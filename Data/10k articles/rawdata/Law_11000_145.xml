The '''''Administrative Law Review''''' was established in 1948 and is the official [[law review|law journal]] of the [[American Bar Association]] Section of Administrative Law &amp; Regulatory Practice.

==Overview==
The journal is a quarterly publication that is managed and edited by approximately 80 students at the [[Washington College of Law]]. The 2018–2019 [[Editor-in-Chief]] is Caroline Raschbaum.  The journal has been cited by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', National Mining Ass'n v. Mine Safety and Health Admin., 512&amp;nbsp;F.3d 696, 700 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Central Texas Telephone Co-op., Inc. v. FCC, 402&amp;nbsp;F.3d 205, 210-11 (D.C. Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; (which is known as the administrative law circuit), and since 2000 has been cited by the Second,&lt;ref&gt;Sweet v. Sheahan, 235&amp;nbsp;F.3d 80, 88 (2d Cir. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Duke Energy Corp., 411&amp;nbsp;F.3d 539, 548 n.6 (4th Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Fifth,&lt;ref&gt;Walton v. Rose Mobile Homes LLC, 298&amp;nbsp;F.3d 470, 490 (5th Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Ninth,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Kriesel, 508&amp;nbsp;F.3d 941, 945 (9th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and Tenth [[United States courts of appeals|Circuit Courts of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalton v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 58 Fed. App'x 442, 445 (10th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also cited by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha]], 462 U.S. 919, 955 n.19 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==
The Administrative Law Review selects staff members based on a competitive exercise that tests candidates on their editing skills, research skills, legal analysis skills, and legal writing ability. There is not a preset number of accepted candidates each year; recent classes of new editors have ranged from about 45 to 50. The candidate "write-on" exercise is distributed to candidates during their second semester at the law school.  An optional "grade-on" process allows students to become staff members based solely on their grades.  Transfer students are also eligible for admission through a fall write-on process.

'''Advocates for Injured Workers''' (AIW) is a student [[legal clinic]] operating in [[Toronto]] and affiliated with the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.utoronto.ca/students_content.asp?itempath=2/2/4/4/0&amp;contentId=371 University of Toronto Faculty of Law Description of AIW Clinic]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224202802/http://www.law.utoronto.ca/students_content.asp?itempath=2%2F2%2F4%2F4%2F0&amp;contentId=371 |date=February 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This clinic is supervised by the Industrial Accident Victims' Group of Ontario (IAVGO)  - itself a community legal clinic funded by [[Legal Aid Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iavgo.org/aiw/ About Advocates for Injured Workers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iavgo.org/ About IAVGO]&lt;/ref&gt;  As per By-law 4 of the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]], student work at AIW is reviewed by a fully licensed lawyer and hence exempt from the normal requirements to practice law in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsuc.on.ca/regulation/a/by-laws/bylaw4/ Law Society of Upper Canada, By-law 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109065605/http://www.lsuc.on.ca/regulation/a/by-laws/bylaw4/ |date=November 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for [http://ifwaa.org Injured Workers] provides free legal representation for low-income clients who have been injured in workplace accidents or have suffered onset occupational injuries.  AIW deals almost exclusively with claims under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, which are made to the [[Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board]] (WSIB) of Ontario and may be appealed to the [[Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal]] (WSIAT).  Very occasionally the clinic may also represent clients in consequential actions that stem from a workplace injury, such as actions before the [[Ontario Labour Relations Board]] (OLRB) and the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]] (OHRC).

The clinic is staffed by approximately twenty-five part-time student volunteers during the academic year, and during the summer by eight full-time student employees.  Every caseworker is responsible for their own individual client files.  Upper-year volunteers have the opportunity to pursue clinical work for [[course credit]].  The clinic carries around one hundred active files at a time.

The '''Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty''' ('''ABM Treaty''' or '''ABMT''') (1972—2002) was an [[arms control]] [[treaty]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] on the limitation of the [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems used in defending areas against [[ballistic missile]]-delivered [[nuclear weapon]]s.  Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/t/isn/trty/16332.htm |title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems |date=26 May 1972 |website=Bureau of Arms Control |publisher=United States Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, four former Soviet republics agreed with the United States to succeed the USSR's role in the treaty.  In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.

==Background==
[[File:Icbm-hist-en.png|thumb|left|165px|upright=1.2|Deployment history of land based ICBM 1959–2014]]
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming [[ICBM]] warheads.  During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange. As part of this defense, [[Canada]] and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called [[NORAD|North American Aerospace Defense Command]]).

By the early 1950s, US research on the [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]] missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system. Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed [[National Missile Defense#Sentinel Program|Sentinel]]. In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]]. Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US. This was achieved with the operational deployment of the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system|A-35 ABM system]] and its successors, which remain operational to this day.

The development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle ([[MIRV]]) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time.  An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=The dramatic proliferation of warheads allowed by MIRV ensured that even an extensive ABM effort could not limit the destructiveness of an American retaliatory strike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically unfeasible: The defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost. To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys; [[R-36 (missile)|R-36M]] heavy missiles carried as many as 40.&lt;ref name="Decoys"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,777379,00.html|title=Moscow extends life of 144 cold war ballistic missiles| accessdate = 2006-10-24|work=The Guardian | location=London | date=20 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decoys would appear as warheads to an ABM, effectively requiring engagement of five times as many targets and rendering defense even less effective.

The United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 [[Glassboro Summit Conference]] during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union [[Alexei Kosygin]].  McNamara argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense. Kosygin rejected this reasoning. They were trying to minimize the number of nuclear missiles in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Although Kosygin rejected this reasoning at Glassboro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the [[SALT I|Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] began in November 1969 (SALT I). By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems. Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.

The treaty was signed during the [[Moscow Summit (1972)|1972 Moscow Summit]] on 26 May by the [[President of the United States]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; and ratified by the US Senate on 3 August 1972.

The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site.&lt;ref name="FAS reference"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/|title=ABM treaty reduces US and USSR to one ABM site each|work=The Nuclear Information Project|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists|FAS]]|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sites were [[Moscow]] for the USSR and the North Dakota [[Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex|Safeguard Complex]] for the US, which was already under construction.

===Missiles limited by the treaty===
The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against "strategic ballistic missiles", without attempting to define "strategic". It was understood that both ICBMs and [[SLBM]]s are obviously "strategic".&lt;ref name=Daalder&gt;{{cite journal|title=A tactical defence initiative for the Western Europe?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=May 1987|volume=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=8 February 2011|author=Ivo H. Daalder|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither country intended to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs. The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.&lt;ref name=Daalder /&gt;

==After the SDI announcement==
[[File:C13571-8a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|President Reagan delivering the 23 March 1983 speech initiating SDI]]
On 23 March 1983, [[Ronald Reagan]] announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be "consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty". The project was a blow to [[Yuri Andropov]]'s so-called "peace offensive". Andropov said that "It is time [Washington] stopped thinking up one option after another in search of the best way of unleashing nuclear war in the hope of winning it. To do this is not just irresponsible. It is madness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Pravda]]|date=27 March 1983|title=Replies by Yu. V. Andropov to Questions from a Correspondent of Pravda}} Cited in {{cite book|last1=Garthoff|first1=Raymond L.|title=The Great Transition: American-Soviet Relations and the End of the Cold War|date=1994|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8157-3060-6|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the opposition, Reagan gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system. The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible. In ''The Nuclear Predicament,'' Beckman claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI. A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a "ragged" Soviet retaliatory response. Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy.  The Soviets could not afford to ignore Reagan's new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Beckman ''et al.'', The Nuclear Predicament: Nuclear Weapons In The Cold War And Beyond, 2nd ed. (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc, 1992), 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Wayne Howell, "[http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/rpa/pdf/2_RP_11-3_Howell_389-415.pdf Reagan and Reykjavík: Arms Control, SDI, and the Argument From Human Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180126/http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/rpa/pdf/2_RP_11-3_Howell_389-415.pdf |date=3 October 2011 }}," ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs, Vol. 11'', No. 3, 2008, pp. 389–415&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1987, however, the USSR withdrew its opposition, concluding the SDI posed no threat and scientifically "would never work."&lt;ref&gt;Norman A. Graebner, Richard Dean Burns, and Joseph M. Siracusa, ''Reagan, Bush, Gorbachev: Revisiting the End of the Cold War,'' p. 95, 2008.  {{ISBN|0313352410}}, {{ISBN|978-0313352416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Julian E. Zelizer|title=Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security—From World War II to the War on Terrorism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_gH5s4B2SEC&amp;pg=PA350|year=2010|publisher=Basic Books|pages=350|isbn=9780465015078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result. SDI research was cut back following the end of Reagan's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that "missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability."  This was reaffirmed in 1997.

Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], the treaty continued in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 13 December 2001, [[George W. Bush]] gave [[Russia]] notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Withdrawal From the ABM Treaty: President Bush's Remarks and U.S. Diplomatic Notes|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2002_01-02/docjanfeb02|publisher=Arms Control Association|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the eventual creation of the American [[Missile Defense Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011213-2.html "Announcement of Withdrawal from the ABM Treaty", White House press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited [[National Missile Defense]] to protect the United States from [[nuclear blackmail]] by a [[rogue state]]. The withdrawal also had many critics. John Rhinelander, a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a "fatal blow" to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and would lead to a "world without effective legal constraints on [[nuclear proliferation]]." The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear [[first strike]].

Putin responded to the withdrawal by ordering a build-up of [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|Russia's nuclear capabilities]], designed to counterbalance U.S. capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Majumdar | first=Dave | date=1 March 2018 | title=Russia's Nuclear Weapons Buildup Is Aimed at Beating U.S. Missile Defenses | url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-nuclear-weapons-buildup-aimed-beating-us-missile-24716 | work=The National Interest | location=USA | access-date=26 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia and the United States signed the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] in Moscow on 24 May 2002. This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.

In [[The Putin Interviews|interviews]] with [[Oliver Stone]] in 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that in trying to persuade Russia to accept US withdrawal from the treaty, both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]] had tried, without evidence, to convince him of an emerging nuclear threat from [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Oliver |title=The Putin Interviews (Party 2 - 2:10) |url=https://www.sho.com/the-putin-interviews |website=www.sho.com |publisher=Showtime |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2018 statement by Putin on new weapons==
On 1 March 2018, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], in an [[Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly (Russia)|address]] to the Federal Assembly, announced the development of a series of technologically new missile systems and stressed that those were designed as a response to U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/56957|website=kremlin.ru|language=en|date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/exclusive-putin-denies-cold-war-1174558275948 Exclusive: Putin blames U.S. for arms race, denies 'new Cold War'] NBC News, 1 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Beyond Russia's Development of New weapons: Insights From Military Innovation and Emulation Theory|url=https://www.academia.edu/37010220|journal=Boletim de Conjuntura Nerint|language=en|date=20 July 2018|last1=Dall|first1=Augusto César}}&lt;/ref&gt; His statements were referred to by the Trump administration officials as largely boastful untruths, as well as confirmation that "Russia ha[d] been developing destabilizing weapons systems for over a decade, in direct violation of its treaty obligations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/01/europe/putin-russia-missile-intl/ Putin claims new 'invincible' missile can pierce US defenses] CNN, 1 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3935">{{Slavery}}
The '''Barbados Slave Code''' of 1661 was a law passed by the colonial English&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grossberg, Christopher Tomlins (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Law in America, Volume 1''. Cambridge University Press, p. 260. {{ISBN|978-0-521-80-305-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
legislature to provide a legal basis for [[slavery]] in the Caribbean island of [[Barbados]]. The code's preamble, which stated that the law's purpose was to "protect them [slaves] as we do men's other goods and Chattels", established that black slaves would be treated as chattel property in the island's court.

The Barbados slave code ostensibly sought to protect slaves from cruel masters and masters from unruly slaves; in practice, it provided far more extensive protections for masters than for slaves.  The law required masters to provide each slave with one set of clothing per year, but it set no standards for slaves' diet, housing, or working conditions.  However, it also denied slaves even [[Rights|basic rights]] guaranteed under [[English common law]], such as the right to life.  It allowed the slaves' owners to do entirely as they wished to their slaves, including mutilating them and burning them alive, without fear of reprisal.

Throughout [[British colonization of the Americas|British North America]], slavery evolved in practice before it was codified into law.  The Barbados slave code of 1661 marked the beginning of the legal codification of slavery.  The Barbados Assembly reenacted the slave code, with minor modifications, in 1676, 1682, and 1688.  The Barbados slave code also served as the basis for the slave codes adopted in several other British colonies, including [[Jamaica]] (1664), [[South Carolina]] (1696), and [[Antigua]] (1702).

The legal basis for slavery was established in [[Mexico]] in 1636. These statutes created the status of [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] slave for those of African descent, i.e. they were slaves for life and the status of slave was inherited. Slave status passed to children through the mother in these statutes. Virginia's 1662 statute reads, "All children borne in this country shall be held bond or free only according to the condition of the mother."&lt;ref&gt;Hening, William Waller. ''The Statutes at Large, Being the  Collection of All the Laws of Virginia from the Third Session of the Legislature in the Year 1619''. 13 vols. Richmond: W. Gray Printers, 1819. 3:252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The Barbados slave code, named An Act for Better Ordering and Governing of Negroes, (1661) declared,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If any Negro or slave whatsoever shall offer any violence to any Christian by striking or the like, such Negro or slave shall for his or her first offence be severely whipped by the Constable.
For his second offence of that nature he shall be severely whipped, his nose slit, and be burned in some part of his face with a hot iron.
And being brutish slaves, [they] deserve not, for the baseness of their condition, to be tried by the legal trial of twelve men of their peers, as the subjects of England are.
And it is further enacted and ordained that if any Negro or other slave under punishment by his master unfortunately shall suffer in life or member, which seldom happens, no person whatsoever shall be liable to any fine therefore."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Berne three-step test''' is a clause that is included in several international [[treaty|treaties]] on [[intellectual property]]. Signatories of those treaties agree to standardize possible [[limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitations and exceptions]] to [[exclusive right]]s under their respective national [[copyright]] laws.

== Berne Convention ==
The three-step test was first established in relation to the [[exclusive right of reproduction]] under Article 9(2) of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1967. Article 9 of the Berne Convention states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Right of Reproduction: 1. Generally; 2. Possible exceptions; 3. Sound and visual recordings'' - (1) Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. '''(2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.''' (3) Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction for the purposes of this Convention. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three-step test in Article 9(2) of the Berne does not apply to copyright exceptions that are implemented under other parts of the Berne convention that have a separate standard, such as those in articles 2(4), 2(7), 2(8), 1&amp;nbsp;bis, 10, 10&amp;nbsp;bis and 13(1), or the Berne Appendix. 

=== Other copyright treaties ===
Since then, the three-step test has been modified and transplanted into the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]], the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] (Article 10), the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], the EU [[Computer Programs Directive]] (Article 6(3)), the [[EU Database Directive]] (Article 6(3)), and the [[EU Copyright Directive]] (Article 5(5)).

The test as included in Article 13 of TRIPs reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Members shall confine limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights holder."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The WTO three-step test does not apply to cases where the Berne or Rome Conventions provide separate standards for exceptions, or for rights not covered in the TRIPS Agreement.

== Interpretation ==
The technical legal reasoning which has been applied to suggest how this wording should be interpreted is arcane (see the references below). To date, only one case (before a [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body|WTO dispute settlement panel]], involving U.S. copyright exemptions allowing restaurants, bars and shops to play radio and TV broadcasts without paying licensing fees, passed in 1998 as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] to the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]) has actually required an interpretation of the test. 

The three-step test may prove to be extremely important if any nations attempt to reduce the scope of copyright law, because unless the WTO decides that their modifications comply with the test, such states are likely to face trade sanctions. Exceptions to copyright protection are required to be clearly defined and narrow in scope and reach.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Ricketson (2003), [http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_id=16805 WIPO Study on Limitations and Exceptions of Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the three-step test was invoked as a justification for refusing certain exceptions to copyright wished for by members of the French parliament during the examination of the controversial [[DADVSI]] copyright bill.

== Patents ==
TRIPs Article 30, covering limitations and exemptions to [[patent]] law, is also derived from a somewhat different three-step test, that includes "taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties."  Exceptions to exclusive patent rights are not subject to this test if they are implemented through Article 31 of the TRIPS, or Articles 6, 40 or 44.2.

{{Judiciary of Fiji}}

The '''Chief Justice''' is [[Fiji]]'s highest [[judiciary|judicial]] officer. The office and its responsibilities are set out in Chapter 5 of the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Republic of Fiji|url=http://www.electionsfiji.gov.fj/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Constitution-of-the-Republic-of-Fiji-.pdf|website=Electionsfiji.gov.fj|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923235116/http://www.electionsfiji.gov.fj/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Constitution-of-the-Republic-of-Fiji-.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Justice is appointed by the [[President of Fiji|President]] on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]], who is required by the Constitution to consult the [[Attorney-General of Fiji|Attorney-General]] (Section 106-1). Under the previous [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]], the Prime Minister was required to consult with the [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Leader of the Opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Fiji 1997|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Fiji_1997|website=Wikisource|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment is permanent, until the Chief Justice reaches the age of 75 years (Section 110-1).

Like other judges, the Chief Justice need not be a [[Citizenship of Fiji|Fijian citizen]].  When [[Timoci Tuivaga|Sir Timoci Tuivaga]] retired in 2002, there were calls from the [[Citizens Constitutional Forum (Fiji)|Citizens Constitutional Forum]] (a pro-democracy, human rights organization) for a foreigner to be appointed, to restore the independence of the judiciary that had been seen to be politically compromised by the 2000 coup.  The government, however, appointed Fijian [[Daniel Fatiaki]]. In 2007, the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]]-backed interim government appointed [[Australia]]n citizen [[Anthony Gates]] as Acting Chief Justice; he became permanent Chief Justice on 5 December 2008.

==Powers of Chief Justice==
According to Chapter 5 of the 2013 Constitution, the Chief Justice sits on the [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] (Section 100) and presides over the [[Supreme Court of Fiji|Supreme Court]] (Section 98), but is barred from membership of the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Court of Appeal]].  This stipulation is designed to give the Appeal Court a measure of independence from the other two courts. The Chief Justice also chairs the [[Judicial Service Commission (Fiji)|Judicial Service Commission]] (Section 104(a)).

According to the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji]], the Chief Justice is the first in the order of succession to discharge the duties of the President as Acting President should the [[President of Fiji]] be unable to discharge her or his office or if the office becomes vacant for any reason. The 2013 Constitution also stipulates that in the absence of the Chief Justice, the next senior most substantive judge performs the  duties of the President as the Acting President.

==History of the office==
Before 1871, when [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] established the first unified [[Fiji during the time of Cakobau|Kingdom of Viti]] under his authority, what is now Fiji was a patchwork of warring fiefdoms. Forming a government dominated by foreigners, Cakobau appointed [[Charles St Julian|Sir Charles St Julian]], an [[Australia]]n newspaper editor, as the first Chief Justice in 1872. St Julian died in office a few weeks after Cakobau ceded Fiji to the United Kingdom on 10 October 1874, under the provisions of the Pacific Islanders Protection Acts of 1872 and 1875,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act | title = Pacific Islanders Protection Acts 1872 and 1875 | number = 35 &amp; 36 Vic. c. 19. | language = English | date = 27 June 1872 | url = http://ozcase.library.qut.edu.au/qhlc/documents/qr_paci_pacific_1872_35-36_Vic_c19.pdf | accessdate = 23 September 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073656/http://ozcase.library.qut.edu.au/qhlc/documents/qr_paci_pacific_1872_35-36_Vic_c19.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The effects of the Pacific Islanders Protection Acts were still being debated in 2012: see {{cite web |first=Michael |last=Anderson |date=5 January 2012 |url=http://treatyrepublic.net/content/aboriginal-australia-and-sovereignty-revolution-0 |title=Aboriginal Australia and the Sovereignty Revolution |publisher=Treaty Republic |accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (amended in 1875),&lt;ref&gt;[http://protimos.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Pacific-Islanders-Protection-Amendment-Act-1875.pdf Pacific Islanders Protection Acts 1875] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925110204/http://protimos.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Pacific-Islanders-Protection-Amendment-Act-1875.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} (38 &amp; 39 Vic. c. 51). Retrieved on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[long title]]: An Act for the Prevention and Punishment of Criminal Outrages upon Natives of the Islands in the Pacific Ocean) which sought to bring the rule of law to British subjects who were using [[blackbirding|unconventional methods]] to supply labour for the European-run cotton plantations in Fiji. St. Julian was followed as Chief Justice in 1875 by Sir [[William Hackett (judge)|William Hackett]].

From 1877 through 1961, the Chief Justice of Fiji was ''ex officio'' Chief Justice of the High Commissioner's Court, more commonly known as the [[Chief Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific]], the chief judicial officer throughout the [[British Western Pacific Territories]], a supra-colonial entity established by the ''Western Pacific Orders-in-Council 1877'' (amended in 1879 and 1880), and by the ''Pacific Order-in-Council 1893''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"B. (1.) The Chief Justice and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, shall be, by virtue of his office, a Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific for the purposes of this Order, and is in this Order referred to as a Judicial Commissioner.

(2.) Where, in the opinion of the High Commissioner, the attendance of a Judicial Commissioner holding office as aforesaid is impracticable, or would be inconvenient, the High Commissioner may from time to time in the name and on behalf of Her Majesty, by writing under his hand and seal, appoint a person of legal knowledge and experience to be a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time. [http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/26439/pages/5119/page.pdf ''The London Gazette'', 8 September 1893 (26439), pp. 5119-5121].&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals lay to the [[Privy Council]] in London. From 1942 to 1945 the High Commission was suspended by military administration during the [[War in the Pacific]]. Headed by a [[High Commissioner for the Western Pacific]], who was also ''[[ex officio]]'' the [[Governor of Fiji]], until the end of 1952, it included numerous islands, mostly small, throughout [[Oceania]]. Composition varied over time, but Fiji (1877-1952) and the [[Solomon Islands]] (1893-1976) were its most durable members.

From the beginning of 1953, Fiji and Tonga were separated from the High Commission as a prelude to full independence, and the High Commission offices were transferred to [[Honiara]] on [[Guadalcanal]] in the Solomon Islands. The office of High Commissioner was separated from that of the Governor of Fiji and was now held by the [[List of Resident Commissioners and Governors of the Solomon Islands|Governor of the Solomon Islands]]). The High Commissioner's Court, however, continued to sit in [[Suva]], and the Chief Justice of Fiji remained the Chief Judicial Commissioner of the Western Pacific until 1962.

From 1962 onwards, functions of the High Commissioner's Court began to be transferred to the increasingly independent island states under the provisions of ''Western Pacific (Courts) Order in Council, 1961''.{{sfn|Care|Paterson|2007|p=15}} The Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific became the '''Chief Justice of the High Court of the Western Pacific''', and removed from Fiji to join the rest of the British High Commission in the Solomon Islands. The position was separated from that of the Chief Justice of Fiji.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;Justice Gordon Ward (2005) [http://www.vanuatu.usp.ac.fj/sol_adobe_documents/usp%20only/pacific%20law/ward2.htm ''Achieving effective legal representation in small Pacific island Commonwealth States''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331054608/http://www.vanuatu.usp.ac.fj/sol_adobe_documents/usp%20only/pacific%20law/ward2.htm |date=31 March 2011 }}. Commonwealth Law Conference, London, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiji gained independence on 10 October 1970. Although no longer connected with the British High Commission, the position of Chief Justice of Fiji continued to be filled by judges from Britain, Australia and New Zealand until the appointment of [[Timoci Tuivaga|Sir Timoci Tuivaga]] in 1980.

The constitutional arrangements relating to the Chief Justice were temporarily overturned in 2000, following a [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|counter-coup]] by [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]] to neutralize a civilian [[coup d'état]] instigated by [[George Speight]].  The then-Chief Justice, Sir [[Timoci Tuivaga]] recognized the Interim Military Government that took office and abrogated the Constitution on 29 May, and drafted the controversial '''Administration of Justice Decree''' that was immediately promulgated by the military administration.  This decree abolished the Supreme Court, made the Chief Justice head of the Appeal Court, and raised the retirement age of the Chief Justice from 70 years to 75.  These changes were reversed following a decision of the High Court to reinstate the Constitution on 15 November 2000, a decision upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001.

==Current Chief Justice==
The present Chief Justice is [[Anthony Gates]], who succeeded [[Daniel Fatiaki]] following the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] that deposed the [[Laisenia Qarase|Qarase]] government on 5 December 2006, when [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama|Josaia Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama]], the Commander of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]] and Acting [[President of Fiji]], sent Fatiaki on leave. [http://www.fijilive.com/news/show/news/2007/01/03/03Fijilive12.html]  The military regime named him as Acting Chief Justice on 3 January 2007, and installed him as the substantive Chief Justice on 5 December 2008.

{{Conflict of laws}}
[[Conflict of laws]] in the [[United States]] is the field of procedural law dealing with [[choice of law]] rules when a legal action implicates the substantive laws of more than one jurisdiction and a court must determine which law is most appropriate to resolve the action. In the United States, the rules governing these matters have diverged from the traditional rules applied internationally. The outcome of this process may require a court in one [[jurisdiction]] to apply the law of a different jurisdiction.

==New approaches in the United States==
Until the 20th century, traditional choice of law rules were based on the principle that legal rights vest automatically at legally significant and ascertainable times and places. For example, a dispute regarding property would be decided by the law of the place the property was located.&lt;ref&gt;7 Restatement (First)of Conflict of Laws, §§208--310.&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes in tort would be decided by the place where the injury occurred.&lt;ref&gt;9 Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws, §377.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first half of the 20th century, the traditional conflict of laws approach came under criticism from some members of the U.S. legal community who saw it as rigid and arbitrary; the traditional method sometimes forced application of the laws of a state with no connection to either party, except that a tort or contract claim arose between the parties in that state.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Alabama G.S.R. Co. v. Carroll'', 97 Ala. 126, 11 So. 803 (Ala. 1892) (holding Alabama employee could not sue Alabama employer for on-the-job injury because accident occurred in Mississippi whose law disallowed the cause of action)&lt;/ref&gt;  This period of intellectual ferment (which coincided with the rise of the [[legal realism]] movement) gave birth to a number of innovative new approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Brainerd Currie, Selected Essays on the Conflict of Laws (1963); Robert A. Leflar, Choice Influencing Consideration in the Conflict of Laws, 41 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 267 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renvoi===
Courts may look for a provision in the law of the choice of law state that permits the court to use the [[lex fori]], i.e. law of the forum state. For example, suppose State X has a rule that says that if property located in State X is conveyed by a contract entered into in any other state, then the law of that other state will govern the validity of the contract. Suppose also that State Y has a rule that says that if a contract entered into in State Y conveys property located in any other state, then the law of that other state will govern the validity of the contract. Now suppose that party A conveys land located in State X to party B through a contract entered into in State Y. If a lawsuit arising from that transaction is brought in State X, the law of State X requires the courts of that state to apply the law of the state where the contract was made, which is state Y. However, the courts of State X might note that a court in State Y would apply the law of State X, because that is where the land is located, and the law of State Y follows the land.

Most U.S. states frown upon renvoi in a choice of law situation. In this example, they would insist that the only law the courts of State X should look at is the ''law of contracts'' of State Y, not the "whole law" of State Y, which includes that state's law governing choice of law. The basic criticism of renvoi is that it can lead to an endless circle. In the above example, it could be argued that if the law of State Y points back to State X, then the law of State X would only once again require application of the law of State Y, and so forth and so on without end.

===Significant contacts test===
The significant contacts test evaluates the contacts between the states and each party to the case, and determines which state has the most significant contacts with the litigation as a whole. This test has been criticized for failing to respect the sovereignty of the state in which the cause of action arose, and because courts can tip the balance in one way or another in deciding which contacts are significant.

===Seat of the relationship test===
The seat of the relationship test specifically examines the relationship between the parties to the lawsuit, and uses the law of the state in which the relationship between the parties was most significant. For example, if two people who live in State X meet and develop a relationship in State Y, and a cause of action arises between them while they are traveling through State Z, a court of any state applying this test would probably apply the law of State Y, because that state is the seat of the relationship between these two parties.

===Balance of interests test===
The balance of interests test examines the interests of the states themselves, and the reasons for which the laws in question were passed.  It is the brainchild of [[University of Chicago]] law professor [[Brainerd Currie]], who outlined the doctrine in a series of articles from the 1950s and 60s. Under this form of analysis, the court must determine whether any conflict between the laws of the states is a true conflict, a false conflict, or an unprovided-for case.
* A true conflict occurs when one state offers a protection to a particular party that another state does not, and the court of the state that offers no such protection is asked to apply the law of the state offering the protection. For example, suppose A, lives in State X, which has no cap on tort damages for injuries received in an auto accident. B lives in State Y, which caps tort damages for injuries received in an auto accident at $100,000. While traveling through State X, B causes an auto accident in which A is seriously injured. A sues B in B's home State of Y, but asks the court there to apply the law of State X. In this situation, it can be argued that State X has chosen to place no limit on recovery in order to protect its citizens and keep its roads safer; while State Y has chosen to place a limit on tort damages to prevent tort abuse and keep insurance costs down. Therefore, State X's law protects its plaintiffs, and State Y's law protects its defendants - the laws serve opposite purposes, but each state has an interest in its own law being applied, to advance its own purposes.
**In such a case, if the interests are balanced, the law of the forum will prevail.
* A false or apparent conflict occurs when the state offering the protection has no actual interest in the endorsement of that protection against the particular parties to the case. For example, some states prohibit spouses from suing one another for negligent torts, in order to prevent them from colluding in order to collect from insurance companies. Other states permit such suits, on the theory that people should be able to recover for their injuries, and possible collusion can be presented as a factor for the jury to deal with. Suppose that a couple, A and B, live in state X, which prohibits these suits, and they travel to state Y, which permits these suits. While in state Y, A negligently injures B, and upon their return to state X, B sues A in the court of state X, asserting that the law of state Y should govern. In this case, since neither party is from state Y, state Y has no interest in the application of the law to these persons.
*An unprovided-for case is one in which each party is seeking to apply the law of the ''other'' state. For example, suppose State X has a law that limits recovery in a tort suit, and state Y has no such limit. A plaintiff from State X suing a defendant from State Y will want the rule of State Y to apply rather than the limit imposed by state X; the defendant will want the State X's limit to apply.
**In such a case, the law of the forum will prevail.
Some courts have sought to distinguish different types of law, giving more weight to laws of foreign states that are intended to regulate conduct (e.g. prohibitions on disfavored activities), and less weight to laws of foreign states that are intended to allocate losses (e.g. [[charitable immunity|tort immunity for charitable organizations]]; joint and several liability).

===Comparative impairment test===
The comparative impairment test asks which state's policies would suffer more if their law was not applied. This is similar to interest analysis, in that the interests of the state are taken into account - however, this test does not look to see which state benefits more from the application of its laws, but rather for situations in which the other state's interests will actually be harmed by the application of the laws of the forum state.

===The "better rule" test===
Use of the "better rule" test, like renvoi, is frowned upon because it appears to be little more than a gimmick to allow a court to apply the law of its own state. The test itself presupposes that, between the laws presented by the two or more states in which the action arose, there is one set of laws which is empirically better. Because courts will almost always presume that their own state has better laws, this is effectively a device to avoid applying choice of law principles altogether.

==United States Constitutional limitations==
The [[United States Supreme Court]] has held that there are certain limitations imposed by the [[U.S. Constitution]] on the ability of states to apply their own law to events occurring in other states.

In one of the earliest cases in this area, ''[[Home Insurance Co. v. Dick]]'', 281 U.S. 397 (1930), the Court held that the state of [[Texas]] could not constitutionally apply its own rule invalidating contract clauses that required any statute of limitations under two years to a contract that had no relation to Texas beyond the fact that the plaintiff was a Texas resident. The plaintiff had sued a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[reinsurer]] of a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[corporation]] that was primarily insured in Mexico, which is where the "injury" had occurred when a [[tugboat]] owned by the company  was lost in a fire. The plaintiff was living in Mexico at the time (although not a resident), but returned to Texas to file suit. These contacts were insufficient to satisfy the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

The doctrine steadily developed in a series of cases over the following decades. In ''[[Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission]]'', 306 U.S. 493 (1939), the court held that there was no violation of the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] where the state of [[California]] applied its own law to a case in which a [[Massachusetts]] employee of a Massachusetts [[corporation]] sued his employer for an injury received in California, seeking relief that would be unavailable under the law of Massachusetts.

This was reaffirmed in ''[[Watson v. Employers Liability Assurance Corp.]]'', 348 U.S. 66 (1954) held that neither the Full Faith and Credit Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment was implicated when a couple who had bought an insurance policy in [[Illinois]] and then moved to [[Louisiana]] sued the issuer of the policy under a provision in the Louisiana law that permitted such suits. A decade later, in ''[[Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, Ltd.]]'', 377 U.S. 179 (1964), the court explicitly stated that [[insurance]] travels with the insured, and that policy holders who move from one state to another can expect to have the laws of their new [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] apply to the interpretation of the insurer's liabilities on the policy.

''[[Allstate Insurance Co. v. Hague]]'', 449 U.S. 302 (1981) determined that the same analysis applies to both the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment; and that both are satisfied so long as there are sufficient aggregate contacts between the forum and the event giving rise to the cause of action. In the case itself, a [[Wisconsin]] resident who was employed over the state line in [[Minnesota]] was killed in a motorcycle accident in Wisconsin. The decedent's wife then moved to Minnesota, where she was appointed administratrix of her husband's estate. She sued the insurance company to recover a higher amount permitted under Minnesota law, and the courts agreed that this was permissible, because of the combination decedent's employment contacts with the state, and the insurance company's commercial contacts with the state.

In ''[[Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts]]'', 472 U.S. 797 (1985), plaintiffs residing in all fifty states brought a [[class-action]] suit in the state courts of [[Kansas]] against an oil company that had failed to pay interest on certain leases. The Kansas court hearing the case simply assumed that the law of Kansas was adequate for all the claims. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the Kansas court was required to determine the law of ''each'' state on the substantive questions of law, and apply the laws of each state to the claims brought by plaintiffs from that state. In the related case of ''[[Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman]]'', 486 U.S. 717 (1988), the Court refused to apply this rule when Kansas had chosen to apply its own statute of limitations to causes raised by a diverse population of class-action plaintiffs. There the Court held that they had long been viewed as procedural matters. The states could choose to use their own with no concern for violating the Constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2161">A '''crime forum''' is a generic term for an [[internet forum]] specialising in [[computer crime]] and [[Internet fraud]] activities such as [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] or [[spamming]].

During the early days of the internet public [[Bulletin board system|dial up BBSes]] would serve to put miscreants in touch with one another to share tips of [[credit card fraud]], [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] and other illicit services.&lt;ref name=eighties&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Cards for fun and profit!|url=http://textfiles.com/anarchy/CARDING/credit|website=[[textfiles.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2000s and the rise of the web, modern [[internet forum]] software was preferred, with private invite-only sites being the most long lived. Sites like [[ShadowCrew]], counterfeitlibrary.com and the Russian language carderplanet.com would specialise in various illegal activities before each eventually succumbing to law enforcement action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise and Challenge of Dark Net Drug Markets|url=http://www.swansea.ac.uk/media/The%20Rise%20and%20Challenge%20of%20Dark%20Net%20Drug%20Markets.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015 notorious forums such as [[Darkode]] would be infiltrated and dismantled prior to returning with increased security.&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite web|work=Wired|last=Clark|first=Lian|title=Hacker forum Darkode is back and more secure than ever|date=28 July 2015|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/28/darkode-back-and-more-secure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2015 there are estimated to be several hundred such forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cobb|first1=Stephen|title=Cybercrime update: take downs, arrests, convictions, and sentences|url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/07/27/cybercrime-take-downs-arrests-convictions-sentences/|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 1989 NATO summit was a summit held for the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]. The summit was held in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. This summit was the tenth [[NATO summit]] to bring world leaders from NATO together. [[Manfred Wörner]] headed the summit, and there were sixteen NATO members when the summit was held.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/49-95/c891215a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and Discussion==
In this period, the organization faced conventional questions about whether a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been. The summit was held during the end of the [[Cold War]], when democratic reforms were being introduced throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/coldwar/page22.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and numerous other events were widely discussed during the summit. The summit affirmed its support of democratic reforms in the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/49-95/c891215a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2102">The '''Denver Newspaper Agency''' was a publishing company in [[Denver, Colorado]], which published the '''''Denver Post''''', a daily newspaper owned by the [[MediaNews Group]].  From its inception in 2001 until Friday, February 27, 2009, the DNA was responsible for the non-editorial operations of both major newspapers in Denver, the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' (owned by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]]) and ''[[The Denver Post]]''.   When the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' ceased publication, the Denver Newspaper Agency became the publisher of the ''Post'' only.

After a continued rivalry that almost put both papers out of business, the ''News'' and the ''Post'' merged operations in 2001 under a [[joint operating agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seattle Post-Intelligencer Staff|title=12 cities still have JOAs|url=https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/12-cities-still-have-JOAs-1113492.php|website=seattlepi.com|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the newly formed Denver Newspaper Agency. DNA was jointly owned by Scripps and MediaNews from 2001 until the discontinuance of the ''Rocky Mountain News''.

While the newspapers shared an advertising and circulation department, they still published separately (except during the weekends, when only the ''News'' was published on Saturday and only the ''Post'' on Sunday; both newspapers' editorial pages appeared in both weekend papers) and maintained their rivalry.

The JOA was dissolved on February 27, 2009, when the ''News'' published its last issue.  The following day, the ''Post'' published its first Saturday issue since 2001.

On December 10, 2009 the Denver Newspaper Agency, was dissolved and folded into ''[[The Denver Post]]'' &amp; [[Media News Group]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5760">'''Donald's Fire Survival Plan''' is an 11-minute [[Donald Duck filmography|Donald Duck]] educational cartoon released on May 5, 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intanibase.com/shorts.aspx?shortid=588|title=Donald's Fire Survival Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The film was directed by [[Les Clark]]. This animated short focuses on fire safety in the home. The original release of this short included a live-action introduction from [[Walt Disney]]. It was re-released in August 1984 without the Walt Disney introduction.

== Plot ==

=== Introduction ===
The feature opens with the image of a burning house which pans out to reveal Walt Disney watching the scene on a television screen. Walt goes on to explain how many homes are lost to house fires every day in the United States and how many lives are lost, emphasizing the point that over a third of that number include small children. 

With the cooperation of local and national fire service authorities, the Disney company produced this short to instruct families on proper home fire safety precautions.

=== The Set Up ===
We transition from Walt Disney to a now animated house on fire, which is "rewound" to show the house undamaged before zooming in through the window to find Donald Duck sitting in an armchair, reading. A few feet from him are his nephews, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Dewey and Louie]] drawing up a fire escape plan in crayon. The boys explain to their Uncle that their school teacher had instructed them to design a plan in the event of a fire. They continue to suggest they find two separate exits from every room as well as choose a rendezvous point outside of the house in order to make sure everyone has escaped the building. Donald reacts nonplussed and attempts to brush his nephews away. The boys continue to explain they need collapsible ladders from the second floor. When they rehearse the use of a whistle as an alarm in the event of a fire at night, Donald loses his patience and angrily sends his nephews away. Immediately afterward Donald falls asleep in his armchair.

=== Common Sense ===
In Donald's dream, we meet his sense of precaution, or his Common Sense, depicted as a smaller Donald Duck wearing a fireman's coat and hat. Common Sense argues with Donald about not paying attention to his nephews, who were only trying to prepare him in the event of an emergency. Donald claims he doesn't need to prepare so Common Sense whisks him off to show him how unsafe his home is. 

Common Sense shows Donald a what-if scenario where a fire starts in his living room and what happens when the entire house is asleep. If Donald left his door open as he slept, the smoke mixed with noxious fumes would potentially kill him before the fire even made it up the stairs. If he had closed his door, the barrier would offer him a short window of fifteen to twenty minutes before the smoke and heat would overtake him. Common Sense tells Donald that in most cases, one would generally use natural exits to leave dangerous situations such as a door but during a fire that could be catastrophic. The best solution to exiting his room would be the window, but as his bedroom is on the second floor he would be stuck without a way down.

Donald abruptly wakes from his sporadic nap and takes immediate action to prevent a fire emergency. He takes Huey, Dewey and Louie's crayon plan and sticks it up on the wall. He puts in a collapsible ladder in his room, makes sure the windows throughout the house open easily from the inside and the screens are easily removed, and adds a ladder to his garage for others to use from the outside. He gathers his nephews to tell them what the plan is in the event of an emergency, stressing that they should remain calm and never hide under the bed or in the closet as that can be a fatal mistake. Donald then initiates a fire drill where we see how the nephews escape their room through their window and down the ladder he placed outside. The instructions end with Donald and the boys going to a public fire department call box.

The video ends with another live-action sequence featuring Walt Disney. He and Common Sense tell the audience that if we can't make a plan, or don't know how, to contact local fire departments and they should be able to devise a plan for us. 

=== August 1984 ===
This educational short was revised in 1984, excluding the original Walt Disney introduction. Instead, the same information is relayed via a voice over. There are new short live-action sequences enacted by human versions of Donald Duck as well as his nephews. The scenes involving Common Sense remain the original 1965 animated versions.

Additions included in the 1984 revision consist of implementing smoke alarms in the home as well as the use of the EDITH system (Exit Drills In The Home).

L|publisher=UOL|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- == Histórico do processo eletrônico no Brasil ==
=== Primeira fase: o início ===
O processo eletrônico no sentido amplo, ou seja, o uso do computador no processo, remonta há décadas,&lt;ref name="RPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.processoeletronico.com.br/page003.aspx|title=Breve Retrospecto do Processo Civil|publisher=Revista de Processo Eletrônico|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sendo possível identificar algumas iniciativas embrionárias em vários Tribunais do País, as quais foram evoluindo, com o uso posterior de outros sistemas e aplicativos, bem como novas linguagens.
Já no sentido estrito não é mais recente a primeira aparição do uso do audio como elemento de autos, inclusive remontando há séculos,&lt;ref name="RJMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aplicacao.mp.mg.gov.br/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/263/novas%20perspectivas%20uso%20taquigrafia_Santos.pdf?sequence=1|title=Diálogo Multidisciplinar|publisher=Revista Jurídica do Ministério Público, Vol. 6|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; caracterizando uma forma eletrônica de armazenamento principal de atos processuais.

=== Segunda fase: a evidência ===
A fase de maior evidência do ''processo eletrônico'' se iniciou em 2006,&lt;ref name="RD2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://direito2.com/tjgo/2008/jun/20/lenar-destaca-projudi-como-renovacao-para-o-judiciario|title=Lenar destaca Projudi como renovação para o Judiciário|author=TJGO|date=20/06/2008|publisher=Revista Direito2|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; com o lançamento do projeto [[PROJUDI]], de iniciativa do órgão oficial [[CNJ]]. A partir de então, crescentemente, os Tribunais passaram a apresentar uma maior movimentação de fluxo de informações ao público externo, bem como trabalhos internos, voltados ao desenvolvimento deste ramo da administração, sobretudo a partir do uso do respectivo sistema, com todas as suas implementações (aplicativos) em todo o país, passando pelas fases de teste, produção e uso estável.

=== A fase atual ===
No momento atual, coexistem diversos sistemas e aplicativos de processos em diversos tribunais. O [[CNJ]]&lt;ref name="CNJPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br|title=Página Principal|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; vem apresentando o novo projeto [[PJe]], aquele que vem obtendo mais evidência no trânsito de informações e mais ocorrências nas pesquisas relacionadas à atividade atual desta área. O material obtido acerca do projeto afirma ser o mesmo uma soma de esforços e utilizações de vários sistemas já testados no âmbito das Justiças Federal e do Trabalho. Ao mesmo momento, percebe-se a a existência do projeto [[Slapsoftware]], uma iniciativa não governamental de processo eletrônico, que, segundo o material obtido, afirma ser o primeiro sistema a seguir o paradigma de [[software livre]], não contradiz o projeto oficial, propondo uma união de esforços, submetendo-se às determinações do [[CNJ]] quanto ao Judiciário, e até mesmo propondo a fusão com o [[PJe]]. Por outro lado, alguns aplicativos também são desenvolvidos por empresas privadas, autoras de alguns dos sistemas e aplicativos já citados. Aqui se deve registrar uma diferença de paradigma, a saber. O projeto do organismo governamental segue a política que vem buscando, desde o início, de condicionar o uso dos aplicativos desenvolvidos aos processos que têm os autos armazenados em meio eletrônico, ou seja, o processo eletrônico em sentido estrito. Já o [[Slapsoftware]] permite o uso dos mesmos aplicativos para ambas as formas de armazenamento, bem como um modelo misto de participação pública e privada, ou seja, atividades como especificação e parametrização de aplicativos, bem como a distribuição e suporte por parte de empresas privadas.

=== Poder judiciário ===
Desde 2009, os sistemas e aplicativos no [[Poder Judiciário]], sobretudo os que gerenciam o [[processo judicial]] devem respeitar determinações e recomendações do [[CNJ]].&lt;ref name="CNJCPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br/sgt/consulta_publica_classes.php|title=Sistema de Gestão de Tabelas Processuais Unificadas|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tais [[norma]]s dizem respeito, entre as principais questões, à [[classificação]] de processos e atos para fins [[Estatística|estatísticos]], ou seja, com objetivo de [[controle]] de produtividade, definição de meios de atuação para correções de distorções e diagnósticos em geral das demandas e suas causas. Entre os mecanismos mediatos de classificação está a '''numeração única'''.&lt;ref name="CNJNU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br/programas-de-a-a-z/eficiencia-modernizacao-e-transparencia/pj-numeracao-unica|title=Numeração Única|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poderes executivo e legislativo===
É menor o número de informações sobre o desenvolvimento de sistemas processuais neste [[Órgão público|órgãos]], bem como para os processos [[Processo administrativo|administrativos]] e [[Processo legislativo|legislativos]], entretanto, se percebe, a partir de uma minuciosa pesquisa, uma demanda reprimida em relação ao uso de tais sistemas para uma abrangência maior de processos. Embora se trate do mesmo tema, vez por outra tais sistemas vêm sendo referidos como elementos autônomos.&lt;ref name="JNPAE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/18959/processo-administrativo-eletrônico|title=Processo Administrativo Eletrônico|author=Correa, D.

== O processo eletrônico e a empresa privada ==
A [[iniciativa privada]] participa, com expressiva presença, no mercado destinado ao desenvolvimento de sistemas para processos, tanto os que possuem os autos eletrônicos como aqueles que, no modelo tradicional, são manuseados em papel e registrados e acompanhados pelo sistema.

== Nomes primitivos do processo eletrônico ==
=== Processo virtual ===
O primeiro nome dado ao ''processo eletrônico'' foi  ''processo virtual''. Processo virtual, conceito de [[direito processual civil]],&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comentários ao Código de Processo Civil, Atualizado por Sérgio Bermudes|last=Pontes de Miranda|first=Francisco Cavalcanti|volume=1|pagess=692,1872|publisher=Forense}}&lt;/ref&gt; relativo ao tema específico da formação do processo, da [[Ação (direito)|ação]] e da [[lide]], é aquele processo '''eventual''', aquele que pode vir a ser processo ou, enfim, o processo que não existe, senão numa construção hipotética. A conveniência do uso deste nome, decorrente da [[metáfora]] da "navegação virtual", como ato de usar a [[rede mundial de computadores]] logo passou a ser revista e tal denominação foi abandonada. Ainda hoje, entretanto, algumas poucas ocorrências desta expressão são encontradas como denotativas do armazenamento de [[autos]] em [[arquivos]].

=== Processo digital ===
[[Digital]], uma contraposição a analógico (relógio digital é aquele possui marcações discretas e informa os dados por [[dígito]]s, que são, em última instância, resultante de operações binárias, ao contrário do analógico que marca continuamente). A difusão do computator e da metáfora da "era digital" como a era dos [[bits]] entratanto, acabou por cunhar esta expressão como uma alternativa para o ''processo eletrônico'', como já explanado anteriormente na enumeração dos ''sistemas'' e ''aplicativos''.

== Law ==
In Brazil, since 2006, there is a law dealing about the electronic process,&lt;ref name="LTR"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ltreditora.com.br/comentarios-a-lei-do-processo-eletronico.html|title=Comentários à Lei do Processo Eletrônico|last=Chaves Júnior|first=José Eduardo de Resende|publisher=LTR|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it's the Law nº 11419 of 2006, without which there would not be the possibility of the phenomenon in its strict sense, that is the substitution of paper as primary source of information. This law is also important to kill the polemic about the validity of non-traditional communications means in legal procedures enrolled by former rules.

{{for|the act establishing Hitler as dictator of Nazi Germany|Enabling Act of 1933}}

An '''enabling act''' ([[German language|German]]: '''Ermächtigungsgesetz''') is a piece of [[legislation]] by which a [[legislative body]] grants an entity which depends on it (for authorization or [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]]) the power to take certain actions. For example, enabling acts often establish [[government agencies]] to carry out specific government policies in a modern nation. The effects of enabling acts from different times and places vary widely.

==Germany==
The German word for an enabling act is ''Ermächtigungsgesetz''. It usually refers to the [[Enabling Act of 1933|enabling act of 23 March 1933]], which became a cornerstone of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s seizure of power.

===Acts of 1914–1927===
The first enabling act is dated from 4 August 1914 just after the outbreak of World War I. With the vote of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] (the parliament) agreed to give the government certain powers to take the necessary economic measures during the war. Such enabling acts were also common in other countries. The Reichstag had to be informed, and had the right to abolish a decree based on the enabling act. This ensured that the government used its rights with care and only in rare cases was a decree abolished. The parliament retained its right to make law.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Rudolf Huber: ''Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789''. Vol. V: Weltkrieg, Revolution und Reichserneuerung. Verlag W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart et al. 1978, p. 37, 62–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933), there were several enabling acts: three in 1919, one in 1920 and one in 1921, three in 1923, one in 1926 and one in 1927. The enabling act on 24 February 1923, originally limited until 1 June but extended until 31 October, empowered the cabinet to resist the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Constitutional Dictatorship: Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies | first= Clinton Lawrence | last= Rossiter | year= 1948 | page= 45 | publisher= Transaction Publishers | isbn= 978-0-7658-0975-9 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rsWXgBcTmbwC&amp;pg=PA45 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an enabling act on 13 October 1923 and an enabling act on 8 December 1923 that would last until the dissolution of the Reichstag on 13 March 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Constitutional Failure: Carl Schmitt in Weimar | first= Ellen | last= Kennedy | year= 2004 | page= 150 | publisher= [[Duke University Press]] | isbn= 978-0-8223-3243-5 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fqYzPDDIrJMC&amp;pg=PA150 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of them had a temporal limit but only vague thematic limits. On the basis of these acts, a vast number of decrees were signed with enormous importance for social and economic life, the judicial system, and taxes. For example, the reform of German currency, the establishment of a single, national railway system and unemployment pay were settled via such decrees (Vollmacht-Verordnungen).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Rudolf Huber: ''Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789''. Vol. VI: Die Weimarer Reichsverfassung. Verlag W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart et al. 1981, pp. 438–449.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emminger Reform]] of 4 January 1924 abolished the [[jury]] as [[trier of fact]] and replaced it with a mixed system of [[judge]]s and [[lay judge]]s in [[judiciary of Germany|Germany's judiciary]] which still exists today.

These enabling acts were unconstitutional, as the Weimar constitution did not provide the possibility that one organ (parliament) would transfer its rights to another one (government). But constitutional experts accepted them because they came into existence with a two-thirds majority, the same majority as for constitutional changes. The government had success in gathering those majorities by threatening to call for presidential emergency dictatorial decrees (usually called ''Notverordnungen''), otherwise. In March 1924, the Reichstag wanted to discuss an abolition of decrees (which was granted by the enabling act of February that year). [[Ebert, Friedrich|President Friedrich Ebert]] dismissed parliament to avoid discussion and abolishments.{{Fact|date=November 2018}}

In later years, since the radicalization of the nationalist party (DNVP) in 1928 and the rise of the Nazi Party from 1930, governments failed to gather two-thirds majorities. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning (1930–1932) worked with presidential decrees which replaced most of ordinary legislature, eventually.

The enabling acts had set a poor and dangerous example. But for the government, they had the advantage that they appeared less unconstitutional and dictatorial compared to presidential decrees. Parliament could prefer those acts because they were valid only for a limited time and included mostly a kind of cooperation (e.g., via a special house committee).

===Enabling Act of 1933===
The German word ''Ermächtigungsgesetz'' usually refers to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], officially ''Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich'' ("Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the State"). It became a cornerstone of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi seizure of power|seizure of power]]. Unlike, for example, the Wilhelm Marx enabling act of December 1923, Hitler's Act:
* was limited to four years, not several months;
* enabled government not only to create decrees, but even laws and treaties with other countries;
* these laws could deviate from the constitution;
* there were no thematic limits;
* neither any house committee nor the [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] (the common organ of the German regional states) had the right to control, or to abolish these laws.
In comparison to the situation of the 1920s, Hitler's [[Nazi Party]] and his coalition partner the [[German National People's Party]] did have a parliamentary majority since the general elections of 3 March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Eilers: ''Ermächtigungsgesetz und militärischer Ausnahmezustand zur Zeit des ersten Kabinetts von Reichskanzler Wilhelm Marx 1923/1924'', PhD thesis Cologne 1987, Cologne 1988, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Those elections and then the voting in the Reichstag were carried out in a climate of intimidation and violence carried out by Nazi paramilitary groups. On 23 March, the Communists were already banned and imprisoned, the Social Democrat delegates were the only ones present in the Reichstag to vote against, while the Centre and moderate-right parties voted yes in order to prevent "worse".

The Enabling Act of 1933 was renewed by a purely Nazi Reichstag in 1937 and 1939. In 1941 and 1943 it was renewed by decree, in 1943 without temporal limit. Although it states that it is valid only for the duration of the current Hitler government of 1933, it remained in force even after major changes of ministers. In any case, Hitler called the cabinet together only very rarely after the first months of 1933. The last cabinet meeting happened in 1937. He preferred to govern via decrees and personal orders.

===Federal Republic===
In the Federal Republic of Germany, with its 1949 constitution, there have been no enabling acts. The constitution states that it can be changed only by an explicit alteration of the phrasing.

==United Kingdom==

===Act of 1919===
The [[Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919]] gave a considerable degree of self-government to the Church of England while retaining overall parliamentary supervision.  Before its passing, almost all adjustments to the legal structure of the Church of England had involved getting a specific bill through Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Livingstone.''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' OUP:1971, art. '''Enabling Act, The'''&lt;/ref&gt; It took nine sessions to approve the salary of the Archdeacon of Cornwall,&lt;ref&gt;Iremonger, F.A. ''William Temple'', OUP:1948, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; and of the 217 bills introduced into the House of Commons between 1880 and 1913, only 33 passed into law for lack of parliamentary time, among the casualties being the bills to establish new dioceses.&lt;ref&gt;Garbett, Cyril. ''The Claims of the Church of England'' Hodder &amp; Stoughton:1947, pp.192f&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act gave the newly established ''[[Church Assembly]]'', predecessor of the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]], power to prepare and present to Parliament measures which could either be approved or rejected, but not modified by either House. Before being voted on, the proposals were examined by an Ecclesiastical Committee of both Houses which reported on their effects and implications. Once approved in Parliament, the measure became law on receiving the royal assent.&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' OUP:1971, art. '''Church Assembly'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act continues to apply today to the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] which, as a result of the Synodical Government Measure of 1969, replaced the Church Assembly with the aim of achieving full integration of the laity and eliminating the complications caused by the dual control of the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocations]] of Canterbury and of York, and the Assembly. All the Assembly's powers passed to the new synod along with many of those of the Convocations.&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' OUP:1971, art. "Synodical Government"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposals===
In the 1930s, both Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] and [[Clement Attlee]] advocated an enabling act to allow a future [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to pass [[socialism|socialist]] legislation which would not be amended by normal parliamentary procedures and the [[House of Lords]]. According to Cripps, his "Planning and Enabling Act" would not be able to be repealed, and the orders made by the government using the act would not be allowed discussion in [[United Kingdom Parliament|Parliament]]. Cripps also suggested measures against the [[British monarchy|monarchy]], but quickly dropped the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/hbtu/chapter_15.html|title=Road to Wigan Pier|accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 [[Oswald Mosley]] advocated a government of national unity drawn from "the professions, from science, from the unions and the managers, from businessmen, the housewives, from the services, from the universities, and even from the best of the politicians". This coalition would be a "hard centre" oriented one which would also get Parliament to pass an Enabling Act in order to stop what Mosley described as "time-wasting obstructionism of present procedure". He also claimed that Parliament would always retain the power to dismiss his government by vote of [[censure]] if its policies failed or if it attempted to "override basic British freedoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oswaldmosley.com/misc_documents/ombfe.htm|title=Oswald Mosley, Briton, Fascist, European|accessdate=29 April 2008|publisher=OswaldMosley.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402004743/http://www.oswaldmosley.com/misc_documents/ombfe.htm|archivedate=2 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006===
{{update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=August 2016}}
In early 2006 the highly controversial yet little-publicised [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill]] was introduced to Parliament. This Bill, if enacted as introduced, would have enabled Government ministers to amend or repeal any legislation (including the L&amp;RR Bill itself), subject to vague and highly subjective restraints, by decree and without recourse to Parliament. The Bill was variously described as the ''Abolition of Parliament Bill''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2049791,00.html Who wants the Abolition of Parliament Bill?] The Times, 21 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and "of first-class constitutional significance ... [and would] markedly alter the respective and long standing roles of minister and Parliament in the legislative process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Finkelstein |title=How I woke up to a nightmare plot to steal centuries of law and liberty |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2040625,00.html|work=[[The Times]] |date=15 February 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2007 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill is, in essence, an Enabling Act in all but name. After some amendment by the government and Lords, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill received [[Royal Assent]] on 8 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/regulation/news/2006/061109.asp Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill receives Royal Assent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211104109/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/regulation/news/2006/061109.asp |date=11 December 2006 }}, Press release CAB066/06 from the [[Cabinet Office]], 8 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments included removing its ability to modify itself or the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]; most of the other modifications were much more subjectively defined.

===Great Repeal Bill===
The [[European Union (Withdrawal) Bill]] of 2017, also known as the Great Repeal Bill, has come under fire from critics because it envisions giving the UK Government unprecedented powers to rewrite any aspect of UK laws imported from [[EU law]] when [[Brexit|Britain leaves the EU]], without consulting Parliament. Such powers, effected by clauses called [[Henry VIII clauses]], have been controversially used in the past, but usually only in respect of very limited areas of law.

==United States==
In the United States, an "enabling act" is a [[statute]] [[wikt:enacted|enacted]] by the [[United States Congress]] authorizing the people of a [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territory]] to frame a proposed [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] as a step towards [[admission to the Union]]. Each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers.

Enabling acts can contain restrictions, such as the prohibition of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] in the [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Oklahoma]] acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Forte |first= David F. |title= Essays on Article IV: New States Clause |url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/4/essays/125/new-states-clause |publisher= The Heritage Foundation |accessdate= December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nevada]] was required to abolish [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]], except [[Penal labor in the United States|as punishment for a crime]]; to guarantee freedom of religious practice to all inhabitants; and to agree that all public lands owned by the federal government at the time of statehood would be retained after admission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Division/Research/Library/Documents/HistDocs/1864Act.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant territory then submits its proposed constitution to Congress, which either accepts it or requires changes. For example, in 1866, Congress refused the proposed [[Nebraska]] constitution because it limited [[suffrage]] to white males. Enabling Acts approved by Congress include:
*[[Enabling Act of 1802]], for the formation of [[Ohio]] from the [[Northwest Territory]]
*[[Enabling Act of 1864]], for the formation of Nevada
*[[Enabling Act of 1889]], for the formation of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Montana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]
*[[s:Utah Enabling Act, 1894|Enabling Act of 1894]], for the formation of Utah
*[[Oklahoma Enabling Act|Enabling Act of 1906]] for the formation of Oklahoma from [[Oklahoma Territory]] and [[Indian Territory]]
*[[Enabling Act of 1910]], for the admission of Arizona&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/const/enabling.pdf|title=Enabling Act|accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Mexico&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/lcsdocs/163941.pdf Piecemal Amendment of the Constitution of New Mexico 1911 to 2006] Seventeenth Revision, January 2007, New Mexico Legislative Council Service&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted, and the act of Congress admitting Kentucky to the Union was passed before the constitution of Kentucky was drafted.

==Venezuela==
In [[Venezuela]], enabling laws allowing the president to [[rule by decree]] in selected matters were granted to [[Rómulo Betancourt]] (1959),&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1998:146–7)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] (1974),&lt;ref name="polar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fpolar.org.ve/Encarte/fasciculo24/fasc2402.html|title=Historia de Venezuela en Imágenes.

In mid-2000 a similar law enabled [[Hugo Chávez]] to legislate on issues related to the economy, reorganization of government ministries, and crime for one year.  Chávez did not take advantage of this act until shortly before its expiration, when he passed 49 decrees in rapid succession, many of them highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/articles.php?artno=1529|title=Land for People not for Profit in Venezuela|accessdate=29 April 2008|publisher=venezuelanalysis.com|date=23 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2004/07/22/en_pol_art_22A477445.shtml|title=Attorney General's Office admits that Venezuelan government exceeded its authority in enacting Enabling Law|accessdate=29 April 2008|publisher=eluniversal.com|date=22 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/wha/8229.htm|title=Venezuela|accessdate=29 April 2008|publisher=[[U.S Department of State]]|date=4 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a new enabling act granted President Chávez powers for 18 months, giving the president the ability to rule by decree over certain economic, social, territorial, defense, and scientific matters as well as control over transportation, regulations for popular participation, and rules for governing state institutions.&lt;ref name="BBC20070119"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6277379.stm|title=Rule by decree passed for Chavez |accessdate=19 January 2007|publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Entick v Carrington''''' [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html EWHC KB J98] is a leading case in [[English law]] and [[UK constitutional law]] establishing the [[civil liberties]] of individuals and limiting the scope of [[executive (government)|executive]] power.&lt;ref name="Entick v Carrington"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Entick v Carrington |year=1765 |court=EWHC |division=KB |num=J98 |parallelcite=(1765) 19 [[Howell's State Trials]] 1029; 95 [[English Reports|ER]] 807}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has also been influential in other [[common law]] jurisdictions and was an important motivation for the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. It is famous for the [[obiter dictum|dictum]] of [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]]: "If it is law, it will be found in our books. If it not to be found there, it is not law."{{refn|Lord Camden's actual words, as recorded in the law report were "If this is law it would be found in our books, but no such law ever existed in this country." &lt;ref name="Entick v Carrington"/&gt;}}

==Facts==
[[Image:John Entick.jpg|left|100px|thumb|John Entick]]
On 11 November 1762, the King's Chief Messenger, Nathan Carrington, and three other King's messengers, James Watson, Thomas Ardran, and Robert Blackmore, broke into the home of the [[Grub Street]] writer, [[John Entick]] (1703?–1773) in the [[parish]] of [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan, Stepney]] "with force and arms". Over the course of four hours, they broke open locks and doors and searched all of the rooms before taking away 100 charts and 100 pamphlets, causing £2,000 of damage. The King's messengers were acting on the orders of [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], newly appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]], "to make strict and diligent search for ... the author, or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers intitled, ''The Monitor, or British Freeholder''".

Entick sued the messengers for [[trespass]]ing on his land.

==Judgment==
[[Image:Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|right|thumb|Lord Camden]]
The trial took place in [[Westminster Hall]] presided over by Lord Camden, the [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]]. Carrington and his colleagues claimed that they acted on Halifax's [[warrant (legal)|warrant]], which gave them legal authority to search Entick's home; they therefore could not be liable for the [[tort]]. However, Camden held that Halifax had no right under [[statute]] or under [[precedent]] to issue such a warrant and therefore found in Entick's favour. In the most famous passage Camden stated:

{{quote|The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property.&lt;ref&gt;This is an obvious reference to [[John Locke]], ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) Ch XI, §§134-5&lt;/ref&gt; That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole. The cases where this right of property is set aside by private law, are various. Distresses, executions, forfeitures, taxes etc are all of this description; wherein every man by common consent gives up that right, for the sake of justice and the general good. By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass. No man can set his foot upon my ground without my licence, but he is liable to an action, though the damage be nothing; which is proved by every declaration in trespass, where the defendant is called upon to answer for bruising the grass and even treading upon the soil. If he admits the fact, he is bound to show by way of justification, that some positive law has empowered or excused him. The justification is submitted to the judges, who are to look into the books; and if such a justification can be maintained by the text of the statute law, or by the principles of common law. If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v. Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=United States | accessdate=2008-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031021121842/http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm |archive-date=21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hence Lord Camden ruled, as later became viewed as a general principle, that the state may do nothing but that which is expressly authorised by law, while the individual may do anything but that which is forbidden by law.

==Significance==
The judgment established the limits of executive power in English law: the state may act lawfully only in a manner prescribed by statute or [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;The judgment was later applied in {{cite AustLII|HCA|67|1984|litigants=A v Hayden ("ASIS case") |parallelcite-(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 532 |courtname=auto}} to extend the principle within the Australian common law jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also part of the background to the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and was described by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] as "a 'great judgment', 'one of the landmarks of English liberty', 'one of the permanent monuments of the British Constitution', and a guide to an understanding of what the Framers meant in writing the Fourth Amendment".&lt;ref name="EngAm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/browse.html |author=Kilman, Johnny and George Costello (Eds) |year=2006 |title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation |publisher=GPO |pages=''pp''1281–1282 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211012558/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/browse.html |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Boyd v.

The U.S. '''Equal Employment Opportunity Commission''' ('''EEOC''') is a federal agency that administers and enforces civil rights laws against [[workplace discrimination]]. The EEOC investigates discrimination complaints based on an individual's race, children, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, and retaliation for reporting, participating in, and/or opposing a discriminatory practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/index.cfm|title=Types of Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On March 6, 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed [[Executive Order 10925]], which required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Executive Order 10925|wikisource – Executive Order No. 10925]]&lt;/ref&gt; It established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity of which then Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] was appointed to head. This was the forerunner of the EEOC.

The EEOC was established on July 2, 1965; its mandate is specified under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]] (ADEA),&lt;ref&gt;29 U.S.C. 621 et seq., as amended&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) of 1990, and the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008]]. The EEOC's first complainants were female flight attendants.&lt;ref name="Collins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Collins|title=When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQ1HhzuaYkEC&amp;pg=PT59|date=14 October 2009|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-07166-6|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the EEOC at first ignored sex discrimination complaints, and the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment went unenforced for the next few years.&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUqK99RZzdEC&amp;pg=PA290 |title=The will of the people: how public&amp;nbsp;... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= September 29, 2009|accessdate=June 29, 2011|isbn=9780374220341}}&lt;/ref&gt; One EEOC director called the prohibition "a fluke... conceived out of wedlock."&lt;ref name="google5"/&gt;

All Commission seats and the post of general counsel to the commission are filled by the US President, subject to confirmation by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/42/21/VI/2000e-4|title=42 U.S.C. § 2000e-4 – Equal Employment Opportunity Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart J. Ishimaru]], a Commissioner who was confirmed in 2003 and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://congress.gov/|title=Nominations PN845-110 and PN1029-108|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Thomas (Library of Congress)|access-date=|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as Acting Chair of the Commission from January 20, 2009 until December 22, 2010, when the Senate confirmed [[Jacqueline Berrien]] to be the chairwoman. She had been nominated as chairwoman by President [[Barack Obama]] in July 2009.&lt;ref name="Berrien"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Pick-to-Head-Equal-Employment-Opportunity-Commission/|title=President Obama Announces Pick to Head Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|author=Press Office|date=July 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206101411/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Pick-to-Head-Equal-Employment-Opportunity-Commission/|archivedate=February 6, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Obama chose [[Chai Feldblum]] to fill another vacant seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-Administration-Posts-9/14/09/|title=President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts|author=Press Office|date=September 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203124321/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-Administration-Posts-9/14/09/|archivedate=February 3, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2010, President Obama made [[recess appointment]]s of three Commission posts: Berrien, Feldblum, and [[Victoria Lipnic]]. With the appointments, the Commission had its full five Commissioners: Ishimaru, Berrien, Feldblum, Lipnic, and [[Constance Barker]], who was confirmed by the Senate in 2008 to be a Commissioner. President Obama also made a [[recess appointment]] of [[P. David Lopez]] to be the EEOC's General Counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-recess-appointments-key-administration-positions |title=President Obama Announces Recess Appointments to Key Administration Positions &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2010-03-27 |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022015004/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-recess-appointments-key-administration-positions |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2010, the Senate gave full confirmation to Berrien, Feldblum, Lipnic, and Lopez. In 2014, President Obama renominated Lopez and he was reconfirmed by the Senate the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/10-11-16.cfm|title=EEOC General Counsel David Lopez to Depart Agency|website=www.eeoc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Commission included "sex-stereotyping" of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, as a form of sex discrimination illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref name="discrimination1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/otherprotections.cfm|title=Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation, Status as a Parent, Marital Status and Political Affiliation|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt|title=EEOC Request No. 0520110649|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Commission expanded protection provided by Title VII to transgender status and gender identity.&lt;ref name="discrimination1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt|title=Macy v. Department of Justice, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the departure of Ishimaru, the commission returned to its full five commissioners on April 25, 2013, with the Senate confirmation of Jenny Yang.

In 2015, it concluded that for Title VII, sex discrimination includes discrimation based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Dale |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/07/16/anti-gay-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination-says-the-eeoc/ |title=Anti-gay discrimination is sex discrimination, says the EEOC |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tatectate |first=Curtis |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article27469123.html |title=EEOC: Federal law bans workplace bias against gays, lesbians, bisexuals &amp;#124; Miami Herald Miami Herald |publisher=Miamiherald.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the rulings, while persuasive, are not binding on courts and would need to be addressed by the Supreme Court for a final decision. The Commission also mediates and settles thousands of discrimination complaints each year prior to their investigation.  The EEOC is also empowered to file civil discrimination suits against employers on behalf of alleged victims and to adjudicate claims of discrimination brought against federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/42/21/VI/2000e-2|title=42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 – Unlawful Employment Practices}} and {{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/42/21/VI/2000e-3|title=42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3 – Other Unlawful Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In addition, the EEOC, the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Civil Service Commission and the Office of [[Revenue Sharing]] have adopted Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures to assist employers in complying with federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.{{cite web|url=http://www.uniformguidelines.com/uniformguidelines.html#129|title=Uniform Guidelines On Employee Selection Procedures|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staffing, workload, and backlog ==
In 1975, when the backlog reached more than 100,000 charges to be investigated, President [[Gerald Ford]]'s full requested budget of $62 million was approved. A "Backlog Unit" was created in [[Philadelphia]] in 1978 to resolve the thousands of federal equal employment complaints inherited from the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]]. In 1980, Eleanor Holmes Norton began re-characterizing the backlog cases as "workload" in her reports to Congress, thus fulfilling her promise to eliminate the backlog.&lt;ref&gt;"Enforcing the Civil Rights Act: Fighting Racism, Sexism and the Ku Klux Klan. The Story of the Miami EEOC's First Class Action Trial."  James Keeney, 2012 Civil Rights Publishing, Sarasota, FL&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, civil rights and labor union advocates publicly complained that the effectiveness of the EEOC was being undermined by budget and staff cuts and the outsourcing of complaint screening to a private contractor whose workers were poorly trained. In 2006, a partial budget freeze prevented the agency from filling vacant jobs, and its staff had shrunk by nearly 20 percent from 2001. A Bush administration official stated that the cuts had been made because it was necessary to direct more money to defense and homeland security.&lt;ref name="wapo06-13-06"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/13/AR2006061301418.html|title=EEOC Is Hobbled, Groups Contend: Case Backlog Grows as Its Staff Is Slashed, Critics Say| last =  Lee|first=Christopher|publisher=Washington Post|date=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the EEOC had lost 25 percent of its staff over the previous eight years, including investigators and lawyers who handle the cases. The number of complaints to investigate grew to 95,400 in fiscal 2008, up 26 percent from 2006.&lt;ref name="WPost20090331"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033002901.html|title=EEOC Willfully Violated Pay Law, Arbitrator Rules|last=Vogel|first=Steve|publisher=Washington Post|date=March 31, 2009|page=A15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although full-time staffing of the EEOC was cut between 2002 and 2006, Congress increased the commission's budget during that period, as it has almost every year since 1980. The budget was $303 million in fiscal year 2001&lt;ref name="eeoc budget and staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/plan/budgetandstaffing.html|title=EEOC Budget and Staffing History|date=May 12, 2009|work=Archives|publisher=EEOC.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209025619/http://archive.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/plan/budgetandstaffing.html|archivedate=December 9, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to $327 million in fiscal year 2006.&lt;ref name="WPost20090331"/&gt;

The outsourcing to Pearson Government Solutions in Kansas cost the agency $4.9 million and was called a "huge waste of money" by the president of the EEOC employees' union in 2006.&lt;ref name="wapo06-13-06"/&gt;

The EEOC uses monetary fines as the primary form of deterrence and, as the fines have not adjusted for inflation, the backlog of EEOC cases illustrates a decline in its effectiveness.

== Race and ethnicity ==

The EEOC requires employers to report various information about their employees, in particular their [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial/ethnic categories]], to prevent discrimination based on race/ethnicity. The definitions used in the report have been different at different times.

In 1997, the [[Office of Management and Budget]] gave a [[Federal Register]] Notice, the "Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity," which defined new racial and ethnic definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html|title="Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 30, 2007, the EEO's EEO-1 report must use the new racial and ethnic definitions in establishing grounds for racial or ethnic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/eeo1/index.html Final Revisions of the Employer Information Report (EEO-1)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813053315/http://www.eeoc.gov/eeo1/index.html |date=August 13, 2009 }} by the EEOC. The page contains links to [[FAQ]]s, forms and instructions&lt;/ref&gt; If an employee identifies their ethnicity as "Hispanic or Latino" as well as a race, the race is not reported in EEO-1, but it is kept as part of the employment record.

A person's skin color or physical appearance can also be grounds for a case of racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=Discrimination&gt;The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. "Race/Color Discrimination." August 15, 2007. "We may use this for the purpose of race and ethnicity."{{cite web |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/types/race.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812231006/http://eeoc.gov/types/race.html |archivedate=2009-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalev|first=Alexandra|last2=Dobbin|first2=Frank|last3=Kelly|first3=Erin|date=2006-08-01|title=Best Practices or Best Guesses?

==Investigative compliance policy==
EEOC applies an investigative compliance policy when respondents are uncooperative in providing information during an investigation of a charge. If a respondent fails to turn over requested information, field offices are to subpoena the information, file a direct suit on the merits of a charge, or use the legal principle of [[adverse inference]], which assumes the withheld information is against the respondent.&lt;ref&gt;AAjing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increase in disability-based charges==
In 2008, disability-based charges handled by the EEOC rose to a record 19,543, up 10.2 percent from the prior year and the highest level since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/eeoc-cases.html|title=''Ability Magazine: BAD BOYS – EEOC Tackles Job Discrimination"'' (2009)|accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That may again be showing that because the EEOC has not adjusted many of their initial 1991 fines for inflation, the backlog of EEOC cases illustrates erosion of deterrence.

==Home Depot disability discrimination suit==
In September 2012, [[Home Depot]] agreed to pay $100,000 and furnish other relief to settle a [[disability]] discrimination lawsuit filed by the EEOC for the alleged failure to provide [[reasonable accommodation]] for a cashier with cancer at its [[Towson, Maryland]], store and for later purportedly firing her because of her condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Depot to Pay $100,000 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Suit| url =  http://www.natlawreview.com/article/home-depot-to-pay-100000-to-settle-eeoc-disability-discrimination-suit |publisher=U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |work=The National Law Review|date=2012-09-10|accessdate=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 profile==
{{Advert|section|date=June 2018}}
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced that it received 99,412 private sector workplace discrimination charges during fiscal year 2012, down slightly from the previous year. The year-end data also show that retaliation (37,836), race (33,512), and sex discrimination (30,356), which includes allegations of sexual harassment and pregnancy were the most frequently filed charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/index.cfm |title=Enforcement and Litigation Statistics |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the EEOC achieved a second consecutive year of a significant reduction in the charge inventory, something not seen since fiscal year 2002.  Due to a concerted effort, the EEOC reduced the pending inventory of private sector charges by 10 percent from fiscal year 2011, bringing the inventory level to 70,312.  This inventory reduction is the second consecutive decrease of almost ten percent in charge inventory.  Also this fiscal year, the agency obtained the largest amount of monetary recovery from private sector and state and local government employers through its administrative process — $365.4 million.
	
In fiscal year 2012, the EEOC filed 122 lawsuits, including 86 individual suits, 26 multiple-victim suits, with fewer than 20 victims, and 10 systemic suits. The EEOC's legal staff resolved 254 lawsuits for a total monetary recovery of $44.2 million.
	
EEOC also continued its emphasis on eliminating alleged systemic patterns of discrimination in the workplace. In fiscal year 2012, EEOC completed 240 systemic investigations which in part resulted in 46 settlements or conciliation agreements. These settlements, achieved without litigation, secured 36.2 million dollars for the victims of unlawful discrimination. In addition, the agency filed 12 systemic lawsuits in fiscal year 2012.

Overall, the agency secured both monetary and non-monetary benefits for more than 23,446 people through administrative enforcement activities – mediation, settlements, conciliations, and withdrawals with benefits. The number of charges resolved through successful conciliation, the last step in the EEOC administrative process prior to litigation, increased by 18 percent over 2011.

==Successes==

On May 1, 2013, a [[Davenport, Iowa]] jury awarded the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissission damages totaling $240 million &amp;mdash; the largest verdict in the federal agency's history &amp;mdash; for disability discrimination and severe abuse.&lt;ref name="EEOC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jury Awards $240 Million for Long-Term Abuse of Workers with Intellectual Disabilities|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/5-1-13b.cfm|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=29 April 2018|language=en|date=1 May 2013}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury agreed with the EEOC that Hill County Farms, doing business as Henry's Turkey Service subjected a group of 32 men with intellectual disabilities to severe abuse and discrimination for a period between 2007 and 2009, after 20 years of similar mistreatment.&lt;ref name="EEOC"/&gt; This victory received international attention and was profiled in the New York Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/09/us/the-boys-in-the-bunkhouse.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/09/us/the-boys-in-the-bunkhouse.html|title=The ‘Boys’ in the Bunkhouse|first=Dan|last=Barry|date=8 March 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held in an 8-1 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia that an employer may not refuse to hire an applicant if the employer was motivated by avoiding the need to accommodate a religious practice. Such behavior violates the prohibition on religious discrimination contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref name="EEOC 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Rules in Favor of EEOC in Abercrombie Religious Discrimination Case|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/6-1-15.cfm|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=29 April 2018|language=en|date=1 June 2015}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EEOC General Counsel David Lopez hailed the decision. "At its root, this case is about defending the quintessentially American principles of religious freedom and tolerance," Lopez said. "This decision is a victory for our increasingly diverse society and we applaud Samantha Elauf's courage and tenacity in pursuing this matter.”&lt;ref name="EEOC 2"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some employment-law professionals criticized the agency after it issued advice that requiring a high school diploma from job applicants could violate the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]. The advice letter stated that the longtime lowest common denominator of employee screening must be "job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity." A [[Ballard Spahr]] lawyer suggested, "There will be less incentive for the general public to obtain a high school diploma if many employers eliminate that requirement for job applicants in their workplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/1/eeoc-high-school-diploma-might-violate-americans-w/|title=EEOC: High school diploma requirement might violate Americans with Disabilities Act|newspaper=Washington Times|author=Dave Boyer|date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EEOC has been criticized for alleged heavy-handed tactics in their 1980 lawsuit against retailer [[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.]] Based on a statistical analysis of personnel and promotions, EEOC argued that Sears both was systematically excluding women from high-earning positions in [[Commission (remuneration)|commission sales]] and was paying female management lower wages than male management. Sears, represented by lawyer [[Charles Morgan, Jr.]], counter-argued that the company had encouraged female applicants for sales and management, but women preferred lower-paying positions with more stable daytime working hours, as compared to commission sales, which demanded evening and weekend shifts and featured drastically-varying paychecks, depending on the numbers of sales in a given pay period. In 1986, the court ruled in favor of Sears on all counts and noted that the EEOC had neither produced a single witness who alleged discrimination nor identified any Sears policy that discriminated against women.&lt;ref&gt;EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 628 F. Supp. 1264 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (Sears II).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Possley, Maurice (1986). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-02-04/business/8601090435_1_eeoc-sears-discrimination Sears Wins 12-year Fight Over Bias] Chicago Tribune 4 February 1986. Retrieved 2012-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 ruling against the EEOC, Judge [[Loretta A. Preska]] declared that It relied too heavily on [[anecdotal]] claims rather than on hard data, in a lawsuit against [[Bloomberg, L.P.]] that alleged discrimination against pregnant employees. In a ruling described in the ''New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/nyregion/discrimination-suit-against-bloomberg-lp-is-dismissed.html|title=Discrimination Suit Against Bloomberg L.P. Is Dismissed|first=David W.|last=Chen|date=17 August 2011|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "strongly worded," Preska wrote, "the law does not mandate 'work-life balance' and added that while Bloomberg had expected high levels of dedication from employees, the company did not treat women who took pregnancy leave differently from those who took leave for other reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1308">In '''''Ex Parte Maurice''''', an important case in [[Law of succession in South Africa|South African succession law]], the facts were these: A few weeks before his death, the deceased forwarded a draft of his [[Will and testament|will]] in his own handwriting to a [[building society]], along with a letter asking them to “knock this document into shape and finalise it in [[Legal English|legal jargon]].” The question before the court was whether it should exercise its discretion to declare the will valid, even though it had not been signed by any witnesses, etc. The court held that there are three requirements which must be fulfilled before condonation is given:

# The document must be drafted or executed by a person
# who has since died;
# and who intended the document to be his will.

The court held that the document was merely a draft; there was still work to be done on it, so it was not the final will and testament of the deceased. Accordingly, the court did not declare the will valid.

The '''Federal Radio Commission''' ('''FRC''') was a government body that regulated [[radio]] use in the [[United States]] from its creation in 1926 until its replacement by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in 1934. The Commission was created to regulate radio use "as the public interest, convenience, or necessity" requires. The [[Radio Act of 1927]] superseded the
[[Radio Act of 1912]], which had given regulatory powers over
radio communication to the [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor|Secretary of Commerce and Labor]]. The Radio Act of 1912 did not mention
broadcasting and limited all private radio
communications to what is now the [[AM band]].

==The Dill White Bill==
The Dill White Bill was proposed and sponsored by [[Clarence Dill]] and [[Wallace H. White Jr.]] on December 21, 1926. Senator Dill and Representative White had made several attempts at creating regulations prior to the Dill White Bill. However the Dill White Bill was the first bill actually considered by the Senate to start regulating the radio waves. The bill originally proposed that a committee of five members (one member representing each time zone) would be given the power to regulate radio waves and licenses. The bill was officially brought to the Senate floor on January 28, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bensman|first=Marvin R.|title=The beginning of broadcast regulation in the twentieth century|year=2000|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a month of debates the bill was finally passed as the '''Radio Act of 1927''' on February 18, 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=A Tower in Babel; A History of Broadcasting in the United States. Vol. 1 - 1933|year=1966|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signed into law by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] on February 23, 1927, as {{USPL|69|632}}, {{USStat|44|1162}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/notes/history_wireless.htm|title= History : Wireless / Radio|author=Howeth, Linwood S.|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Radio Act of 1927==
Prior to 1927, radio was regulated by the [[United States Department of Commerce]].  [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Commerce Secretary]] [[Herbert Hoover]] played a strong role in shaping radio.  His powers were limited by federal court decisions, however; in particular, he was not allowed to deny broadcasting licenses to anyone who wanted one.  The result was that many people perceived the airwaves to suffer from "chaos," with too many stations trying to be heard on too few frequencies. Others believed the government simply wanted to control content. (Initially only two frequencies were available for broadcasting with one of these being reserved for "Crop reports and weather forecasts.")  After several failed attempts to rectify this situation, Congress finally passed the Radio Act of 1927, which transferred most of the responsibility for radio to a newly created Federal Radio Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/69/publaw-632.pdf |title=Radio Act of 1927 ~ P.L. 69-632 |date=February 23, 1927 |series=44 Stat. 1162 ~ House Bill 9971 |publisher= Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Some technical duties remained the responsibility of the Radio Division of the Department of Commerce.)

The five-person FRC was given the power to grant and deny licenses, and to assign frequencies and power levels for each licensee. The Commission was not given any official power of censorship, although programming could not include "obscene, indecent, or profane language." In theory, anything else could be aired. In practice, the Commission could take into consideration programming when renewing licenses, and their ability to take away a broadcaster's license enabled them to control content to some degree.

The Commission also had little power over networks; in fact, the Radio Act of 1927 made almost no mention of the radio networks (notably [[NBC]] and, a bit later [[CBS]]) that were in the process of dominating radio. The only mention of radio networks was vague: The Commission {the Federal Radio Commission} shall ''"Have the authority to make special regulations applicable to stations engaged in chain broadcasting."''

The act did not authorize the Federal Radio Commission to make any rules regulating [[advertising]]. Advertising was mentioned in the act with only slightly more authority than networking; merely requiring advertisers to identify themselves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Sec. 19.'' All matter broadcast by any radio station for which service, money, or any other valuable consideration is directly paid, or promised to, or charged to, or accepted by, the station so broadcasting, from any person, firm, company, or corporation, shall at the time the same is so broadcast, be announced as paid for or furnished as the case may be, by such person, firm, company, or corporation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A forerunner of the "[[equal-time rule]]" was stated in section (18) of the Radio Act of 1927 which ordered stations to give equal opportunities for political candidates. The act did vest in the Federal Radio Commission the power to revoke licenses and give fines for violations of the act.

The Radio Act of 1927 divided the country into five geographical zones. Each zone was represented by one of the five Commissioners. The 1928 reauthorization of the Radio Act included a provision, called the "[[Davis Amendment]]" after its sponsor [[Ewin L. Davis]], that required each zone to have equal allocations of licenses, time of operation, station power, and wavelength. This greatly complicated things for the Commissioners; they were required to deny station applications to otherwise qualified candidates simply because the new station would put a particular state or zone over its quota.  For example, the northeast had a greater population than the
southwest, but was limited to the same number of stations as more sparsely populated areas. Likewise, many small communities in the southwest could have added a local station without increasing interference (because of their remoteness), but were prevented from doing so by the Davis Amendment, which was repealed in 1936.

Although the Commission's primary responsibility was radio, on February 25, 1928, [[Charles Jenkins Laboratories]] of [[Washington, DC]], became the first holder of a [[television]] license from the Federal Radio Commission.

There were even a few [[amateur radio]] stations authorized to broadcast television. Among them was Mel Dunbrack, W1BHD-TV, who began broadcasting [[mechanical television]] in the 1920s, and Truett Kimzey, W5AGO, who began broadcasting television in March 1934.

==Formation of the Federal Radio Commission==
President [[Calvin Coolidge]] nominated five men to
the commission: Admiral [[William H. G. Bullard]] as chairman,
Colonel [[John Francis Dillon (commissioner)|John F. Dillon]], [[Eugene O. Sykes]], [[Henry A. Bellows]], and [[Orestes H. Caldwell]].

The first three were confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] and the first two died soon afterward. Bellows and Caldwell didn't receive salaries, but stayed on anyway. These three did conduct a badly needed reallocation of frequencies. In October, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] removed Bellows from the commission; he returned to [[Minneapolis]] where he became manager of [[CBS]]-affiliate [[WCCO (AM)|WCCO]]. In November 1927 [[Harold Lafount]] and [[Sam Pickard]] joined the commission. In March 1928 Caldwell was barely re-confirmed and [[Ira E. Robinson]] became chairman, the commission was finally complete.

The composition of the FRC from 1927 to 1934 was as follows:

'''Zone 1:'''  Orestes H. Caldwell (New York), Editor of ''Radio Retailing'' magazine); Caldwell resigned February 23, 1929, and was replaced by W. D. L. Starbuck (New York), Patent Attorney, appointed May 1929.

'''Zone 2:''' W. H. G. Bullard (Pennsylvania); Bullard died November 24, 1927, and was replaced by Ira E. Robinson (West Virginia), State Supreme Court judge; Robinson resigned January 1932 and was replaced by Col. [[Thad H. Brown]] (Ohio), lawyer &amp; politico, holding various appointed, and elective offices including [[Ohio Secretary of State]], appointed March 28, 1932.  Brown remained on the FRC until he was appointed to the FCC in 1934.

'''Zone 3:'''  Eugene Octave Sykes (Mississippi) remained until he was appointed to the FCC in 1934.

'''Zone 4:'''  Henry Adams Bellows (Minnesota); Bellows was forced to resign October 31, 1927, and later became chairman of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]];	Bellows was replaced by Sam Pickard (Kansas); Pickard resigned January 31, 1929, and was replaced by Charles McKinley Saltzman (Iowa), appointed May 1929; Saltzman resigned in irritation in June 1932 and was replaced by James H. Hanley

'''Zone 5:'''  [[John Francis Dillon (commissioner)|John F. Dillon]] (California); Dillon died October 8, 1927, and was replaced by Harold A. Lafount (Utah); Lafount stayed on the FRC until its replacement by the FCC, but he was not appointed to the FCC.  In the late 1930s Lafount became president of the National Independent Broadcasters.

==Radio licensing==
In the spring of 1928, the commissioners made drastic reallocations and told 164 stations to justify their existence or be forced to stop broadcasting (these hearings came under the title of General Order 32).  Many low-powered independent stations were eliminated, although eighty-one stations did survive, most with reduced power. Educational stations fared particularly poorly. They were usually required to share frequencies with commercial stations and operate during the daytime, which was considered worthless for adult education.

It was one of the most popular stations in the nation. KFKB was owned by a surgeon, [[John R. Brinkley]], who, among other things, espoused, over the airwaves, implanting slivers of goat testes in men's testicles for "sexual rejuvenation." The [[American Medical Association]] was very upset over a program in which he read listener mail describing symptoms, and then prescribed over the air, describing the medication by number. Listeners had to visit a Brinkley "kick back" pharmacy to fill these prescriptions. In 1930 the Federal Radio Commission denied his request for renewal. Brinkley appealed on the grounds of [[censorship]]. The [[United States Court of Appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]] denied his appeal. The court ruled that the Federal Radio Commission could consider past programming content without it being censorship. This, however, didn't stop the ever-popular Dr. Brinkley, who almost won the [[Governor of Kansas|governorship of Kansas]] in 1930 by write-in votes. He simply beamed his programs to the United States over 100,000 watt [[XER-AM|XER]] from Villa Acuna, Coah, Mexico. This was twice the power of any broadcast radio station save one experimental 500,000 watt station, [[WLW]] Cincinnati. Not to be outdone, Brinkley increased his power to 500,000 watts as well, as [[XERA-AM|XERA]], and used a curtain-array antenna to focus his signal northward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744604,00.html Time-October 17, 1932-POLITICAL NOTES: Capric Candidate]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Brinkley suffered from a series of serious medical problems.  During his attempt to recuperate from them, he was charged with mail fraud, but died before the case could be tried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2006/01/goats-of-kfkb.html Arcane Radio Trivia: The Goats of KFKB-January 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[KGEF]] [[Los Angeles, California]] was the second station to lose its license over what it broadcast.&lt;ref name = "Fairness" /&gt; Owned by "Battling Bob" [[Robert P. Shuler]] (not to be confused with the Robert Schuller of the [[Crystal Cathedral]] a generation later), he built his station at Trinity Methodist Church, South, in downtown Los Angeles from a donation from Methodist philanthropist Lizzie Glide, who also funded San Francisco's famous [[Glide Memorial Church]]. The station quickly ran afoul of the political interests of a corrupt Los Angeles, who didn't appreciate either Shuler's reactionary politics or his often accurate knowledge of who was being paid off by whom. ''KGEF v. FRC'' followed in the footsteps of ''KFKB v. FRC'' as the second of the one-two punch that made past programming relevant in license renewals, though the primary reason for the rejection of the license renewal was that Shuler owned the station (because Glide wrote the check to him) but the church held the license.

[[WNYC]], the municipal station of [[New York City]], was assigned a part-time, low-power channel. It appealed and lost. Even though the station was government owned, the Federal Radio Commission said that city ownership did not give the station any special standing concerning the "public interest, convenience, and necessity."  This was representative of the decline of public broadcasting.

==Different types of radio services==
The Federal Radio Commission issued many licenses for radio services other than radio broadcasting. In 1932, the FRC had licensed about thirty thousand [[amateur radio]] stations, about two thousand ship radios, and about one thousand fixed-point land radio stations. The number of licensed radio broadcasting stations (all of which were [[amplitude modulation|AM]] stations) was 625. Public attention in the mass media, however, mainly concerned radio broadcasting. Radio came to be closely associated in common language with radio broadcasting. Many other radio stations, however, were operating at the same time as early radio broadcasting stations.

The FRC's regulatory enforcement efforts focused on radio broadcasting content. In 1932, out of a total of 424 FRC license investigations, 242 concerned radio broadcasting. Among those 242 radio broadcasting investigations, 156 concerned radio broadcasting content. Analyzing radio broadcasting content is a very different type of technical expertise than evaluating non-content-related radio operations.

Enforcing non-content-related radio regulations occupied relatively more regulatory attention during the time of the FRC than in the early 21st century, in part because radio equipment was more prone to interference (thus requiring more attention to technical issues). The FRC, along with the Radio Division of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], had in 1932 about as many staff members working on enforcement of non-content-related radio rules as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] had in 2002. The total number of radio licenses held, however, was about fifty times greater in 2002 than in 1932. The FRC, along with the Department of Commerce, emphasized education and cooperation in getting radio operators to adhere to radio operating rules. Subsequent proliferation of radio uses other than radio broadcasting did not lead to more regulatory resources devoted to enforcing non-content-related radio regulations.

The FRC carried out provisions of the Radio Act of 1927 to license persons operating amateur and commercial transmitters.  It also complied with new treaty obligations to assign U.S. stations [[ITU prefix]]es.

==Broadcast regulatory actions==
When broadcasting began to be regulated, and stations had to have a broadcast license, some saw this as an infringement of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] stating that the government shall not stop freedom of speech in the media. This was because prior to broadcast licensing, anyone could start transmitting their views cheaply and efficiently.  The FRC cracked down on "vulgar" language — for example the profanity-filled rants of [[William K. Henderson]] (on [[KWKH]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]), non-mainstream political views, and "fringe" religions.

Almost from the start, the FRC was accused of being [[Regulatory capture|captured by the industry it regulated]], radio broadcasters.  Historians and contemporary critics who held this position generally pointed to the results of FRC regulation which, in many cases, advantaged large commercial radio broadcasters at the expense of smaller noncommercial broadcasters.  Early radio regulation has since become a commonly used example of [[rent-seeking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hazlett | first=Thomas W. | title=Physical Scarcity, Rent-Seeking and the First Amendment | journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] | date=May 1997 | volume=97 | issue=4 | page=905 | ssrn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of the Federal Radio Commission==
In 1934 Congress passed the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]], which abolished the Federal Radio Commission and transferred jurisdiction over radio licensing to a new [[Federal Communications Commission]]. Title III of the Communications Act contained provisions very similar to the Radio Act of 1927, and the new FCC largely took over the operations and precedents of the FRC (the FCC also acquired jurisdiction over communications common carriers, such as telephone and telegraph companies, from the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]).

The '''Gadsden Purchase''' (known in Mexico as {{lang-es|Venta de La Mesilla}}, "Sale of La Mesilla"&lt;ref name="azstar"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ignacio |last=Ibarra |title=Land sale still thorn to Mexico: Historians say United States imperialism behind treaty |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/gadsden/9331 |newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |date=February 12, 2004 |access-date=October 4, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503064503/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/gadsden/9331 |archive-date=May 3, 2007 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a {{convert|29670|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} region of present-day southern [[Arizona]] and southwestern [[New Mexico]] that the United States purchased via a treaty that took effect on June 8, 1854. The first draft was signed on December 30, 1853, by [[James Gadsden]], U.S. ambassador to Mexico, and by [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], president of Mexico.&lt;ref name=Kemp2010 /&gt; The U.S. Senate voted in favor of ratifying it with amendments on April 25, 1854, and then transmitted it to President [[Franklin Pierce]]. [[Mexico]]'s government and its [[Mexican Congress|General Congress or Congress of the Union]] took final approval action on June 8, 1854, when the treaty took effect. The purchase was the last substantial territorial acquisition in the [[contiguous United States]]. The U.S. sought the land as a better route for the construction of the southern transcontinental railway line, and the financially-strapped government of Santa Anna agreed to the sale, which netted Mexico $10 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US|10000000|1854|r=-7}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}). After the devastating loss of Mexican territory to the U.S. in the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–48) and the continued [[filibuster (military)|filibustering]] by U.S. citizens, Santa Anna may have calculated it was better to yield territory by treaty and receive payment rather than have the territory simply seized by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan M. |last=Deeds |chapter=Gadsden Purchase |title=Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture |volume=Vol. 3 |pages=1–2 |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purchase included lands south of the [[Gila River]] and west of the [[Rio Grande]] which the U.S. needed to build a [[transcontinental railroad]] along a deep southern route, which the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] later completed in 1881–1883. The purchase also aimed to resolve border issues.

As the railroad age evolved, business-oriented Southerners saw that a railroad linking the South with the Pacific Coast would expand trade opportunities.  They thought the topography of the southern portion of the original boundary line was too mountainous to allow a direct route. Projected southern railroad routes tended to veer to the north as they proceeded eastward, which would favor connections with northern railroads and ultimately favor northern seaports. Southerners saw that to avoid the mountains, a route with a southeastern terminus might need to swing south into what was still Mexican territory.

The administration of President Pierce, strongly influenced by Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]], saw an opportunity to acquire land for the railroad, as well as to acquire significant other territory from northern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nevins|1947|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those years, the debate over slavery in the United States entered into many other debates, as the acquisition of new territory opened the question of whether it would be slave or free territory; in this case, the debate over slavery ended progress on construction of a [[Transcontinental railroad#Subsequent transcontinental routes|southern transcontinental rail line]] until the early 1880s, although the preferred land became part of the nation and was used as intended after the Civil War.&lt;ref name=Robersonp180 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klugerp504 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/amis/learn/historyculture/str.htm |title=The Southern Transcontinental Railroad |location=Amistad, Texas |publisher=National Park Service |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Gadsden.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant James Gadsden, U.S. Army (1788–1858), of [[South Carolina]], later American ambassador/minister to Mexico]] In January 1845 [[Asa Whitney]] of New York state presented  the [[United States Congress]] with the first plan to construct a transcontinental railroad.  Although Congress took no action on his proposal, a commercial convention of 1845 in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] took up the issue.  Prominent attendees included [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Clement Comer Clay|Clement C. Clay, Sr.]], [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], [[William M. Gwin|William Gwin]], and [[Edmund P. Gaines]], but it was [[James Gadsden]] of South Carolina who was influential in the convention's recommending a southern route for the proposed railroad. The route was to begin in [[Texas]] and end in [[San Diego]] or [[Mazatlán]].  Southerners hoped that such a route would ensure southern prosperity while opening the "West to southern influence and settlement".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern interest in railroads in general, and the Pacific railroad in particular, accelerated after the conclusion of the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1848. During that war, [[topography|topographical]] officers [[William H. Emory]] and [[James William Abert|James W. Abert]] had conducted surveys that demonstrated the feasibility of a railroad's originating in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] or western [[Arkansas]] and ending in San Diego.  [[James Dunwoody Brownson DeBow|J. D. B. DeBow]], the editor of ''[[DeBow's Review]]'', and Gadsden both publicized within the [[American South|South]] the benefits of building this railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gadsden had become the president of the [[South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company]] in 1839; about a decade later, the company had laid {{convert|136|mi|km}} of track extending west from [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and was 3 million dollars in debt. Gadsden wanted to connect all Southern railroads into one sectional network.&lt;ref name="Richards1"&gt;{{harvp|Richards|2007|p=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned that the increasing railroad construction in the North was shifting trade in lumber, farm and manufacturing goods from the traditional north–south route based on the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to an east–west axis that would bypass the [[American South|South]]. He also saw Charleston, his home town, losing its prominence as a seaport. In addition, many Southern business interests feared that a northern transcontinental route would exclude the South from trade with the [[Orient]]. Other Southerners argued for diversification from a plantation economy to keep the South independent of northern bankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|p= 485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1849 the southern interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis, in response to a convention in [[St. Louis]] earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there, to connect with an El Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only over the issue of financing. The convention president, [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] of [[Virginia]], preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and others thought that federal land grants to railroad developers would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== James Gadsden and California ===
Gadsden supported [[Nullification crisis|nullification]] in 1831. When [[California]] was admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850, he advocated secession by South Carolina.  Gadsden considered slavery "a social blessing" and abolitionists "the greatest curse of the nation".&lt;ref name="Richards1" /&gt;

When the secession proposal failed, Gadsden worked with his cousin [[Isaac E. Holmes|Isaac Edward Holmes]], a lawyer in San Francisco since 1851, and California state senator [[Thomas Jefferson Green]], in an attempt to divide California into northern and southern portions and proposed that the southern part allow slavery.  Gadsden planned to establish a slave-holding colony there based on rice, cotton, and sugar, and wanted to use slave labor to build a railroad and highway that originated in either [[San Antonio]] or the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] valley. The railway or highway would transport people to the California gold fields.  Toward this end, on December 31, 1851, Gadsden asked Green to secure from the California state legislature a large land grant located between the 34th and 36th parallels, along the proposed dividing line for the two California states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|2007|p= 126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, Gadsden and 1,200 potential settlers from [[South Carolina]] and [[Florida]] submitted a petition to the [[California legislature]] for permanent citizenship and permission to establish a rural district that would be farmed by "not less than Two Thousand of their African Domestics". The petition stimulated some debate, but it finally died in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|2007|p=. 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stephen Douglas and land grants ===
The [[Compromise of 1850]], which created the [[Utah Territory]] and the [[New Mexico Territory]], would facilitate a southern route to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] since all territory for the railroad was now organized and would allow for federal land grants as a financing measure.  Competing northern or central routes championed, respectively, by [[United States Senator|U.S. Senators]] [[Stephen Douglas]] of [[Illinois]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] of [[Missouri]], would still need to go through unorganized territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|p= 487}}; {{harvp|Roberson|1974|p= 169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Millard Fillmore]] established a precedent for using federal land grants when he signed a bill promoted by Douglas that allowed a south to north, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to [[Chicago]] railroad to be financed by "federal land grants for the specific purpose of railroad construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p= 168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To satisfy Southern opposition to the general principle of federally supported [[internal improvements]], the land grants would first be transferred to the appropriate state or territorial government, which would oversee the final transfer to private developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|p= 487}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1850, however, the majority of the South was not interested in exploiting its advantages in developing a transcontinental railroad or railroads in general. Businessmen like Gadsden, who advocated economic diversification, were in the minority. The Southern economy was based on cotton exports, and then-current transportation networks met the plantation system's needs. There was little home market for an intra-South trade. In the short term, the best use for capital was to invest it in more slaves and land rather than in taxing it to support canals, railroads, roads, or in dredging rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|p= 488}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jere W. Roberson wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Southerners might have gained a great deal under the 1850 land grant act had they concentrated their efforts. But continued opposition to Federal aid, filibustering, an unenthusiastic President, the spirit of "Young America", and efforts to build railroads and canals across [[Central America]] and the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in [[Mexico]] divided their forces, leaving a lot of time for the Pacific railroad. Moreover, the Compromise of 1850 encouraged Southerners not to antagonize opponents by resurrecting the railroad controversy.|Jere W. Roberson|''The South and the Pacific Railroad, 1845–1855''}}

== Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ==
{{Main|Mexican Cession}}
[[File:Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna c1853.png|thumb|right|President and General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], photo circa 1853]]
The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848) ended the [[Mexican–American War]], but left issues affecting both sides that still needed to be resolved: possession of the [[Mesilla Valley]], protection for Mexico from Indian raids, and the right of transit in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]].

=== Mesilla Valley ===
The treaty provided for a joint commission, made up of a surveyor and commissioner from each country, to determine the final boundary between the United States and Mexico. The treaty specified that the Rio Grande Boundary would veer west eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) north of El Paso. The treaty was based on the attached 1847 copy of a twenty-five-year-old map.  Surveys revealed that El Paso was {{convert|36|mi|km}} further south and {{convert|100|mi|km}} further west than the map showed. Mexico favored the map, but the United States put faith in the results of the survey. The disputed territory involved a few thousand square miles and about 3,000 residents; more significantly, it included the [[Mesilla Valley]]. Bordering the Rio Grande, the valley consisted of flat desert land measuring about {{convert|50|mi|km}}, north to south, by {{convert|200|mi|km}}, east to west. This valley was essential for the construction of a transcontinental railroad using a southern route.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|p=491}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Russell Bartlett|John Bartlett]] of [[Rhode Island]], the United States negotiator, agreed to allow Mexico to retain the Mesilla Valley (setting the boundary at 32° 22′ N, north of the American claim 31° 52′ and at the easternmost part, also north of the Mexican-claimed boundary at 32° 15′&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_T9BS3hHzkC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57 |title=The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: A Legacy of Conflict |first=Richard |last=Griswold del Castillo |page=57 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |date=1990 |access-date=May 28, 2011 |isbn=978-0-8061-2240-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in exchange for a boundary that did not turn north until 110° W in order to include the [[Santa Rita Mountains]], which were believed to have rich [[copper]] deposits, and some [[silver]] and [[gold]] which had not yet been mined. Southerners opposed this alternative because of its implication for the railroad, but President Fillmore supported it. Southerners in Congress prevented any action on the approval of this separate border treaty and eliminated further funding to survey the disputed borderland. [[Robert B. Campbell]], a pro-railroad politician from [[Alabama]], later replaced Bartlett. Mexico asserted that the commissioners' determinations were valid and prepared to send in troops to enforce the unratified agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|pp=491–492}}; {{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian raids ===
[[File:James Buchanan.jpg|thumb|Then [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[James Buchanan]] (1791–1868), who later became 15th [[President of the United States]] (1857–1861)]]

Article XI of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo contained a guarantee that the United States would protect Mexicans by preventing cross-border raids by local [[Comanche]] and [[Apache]] tribes. At the time the treaty was ratified, Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] had believed that the United States had both the commitment and resources to enforce this promise.&lt;ref name="Kluger1"&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|p= 492}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Richard Kluger]], however, described the difficulties of the task:

{{quote|Comanche, Apache, and other tribal warriors had been punishing Spanish, Mexican, and American intruders into their stark homeland for three centuries and been given no incentive to let up their murderous marauding and pillaging, horse stealing in particular. The [[United States Army|U. S. Army]] had posted nearly 8,000 of its total of 11,000 soldiers along the southwestern boundary, but they could not halt the 75,000 or so native nomads in the region from attacking swiftly and taking refuge among the hills, buttes, and arroyos in a landscape where one's enemies could be spotted twenty or thirty miles away.&lt;ref name="Kluger1" /&gt;}}

In the five years after approval of the Treaty, the United States spent $12 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|12000000|1859|r=-7}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) in this area, and General-in-Chief [[Winfield Scott]] estimated that five times that amount would be necessary to police the border. Mexican officials, frustrated with the failure of the United States to effectively enforce its guarantee, demanded reparations for the losses inflicted on Mexican citizens by the raids. The United States argued that the Treaty did not require any compensation nor did it require any greater effort to protect Mexicans than was expended in protecting its own citizens. During the Fillmore administration, Mexico claimed damages of $40 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|40000000|1854|r=-8}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) but offered to allow the U.S. to buy-out Article XI for $25 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|25000000|1854|r=-7}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) while President Fillmore proposed a settlement that was $10 million less (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|10000000|1854|r=-7}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).&lt;ref name="Kluger1" /&gt;

=== Isthmus of Tehuantepec ===
During negotiations of the treaty, Americans had failed to secure the right of transit across the {{convert|125|mi|km|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico.  The idea of building a railroad here had been considered for a long time, connecting the Gulf of Mexico with the Pacific Ocean. In 1842 Mexican President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] sold the rights to build a railroad or canal across the isthmus. The deal included land grants {{convert|300|mi|km}} wide along the right-of-way for future colonization and development. In 1847 a British bank bought the rights, raising U.S. fears of British colonization in the hemisphere, in violation of the precepts of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. United States interest in the right-of-way increased in 1848 after the gold strikes in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], which led to the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="Roberson p. 182. Kluger p. 493"&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=182}}; {{harvp|Kluger|2007|p=493}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isthmus of Tehuantepec-aeac.jpg|thumb|Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico]]
The Memphis commercial convention of 1849 recommended that the United States pursue the trans-isthmus route, since it appeared unlikely that a transcontinental railroad would be built anytime soon. Interests in Louisiana were especially adamant about this option, as they believed that any transcontinental railroad would divert commercial traffic away from the Mississippi and New Orleans, and they at least wanted to secure a southern route. Also showing interest was Peter A. Hargous of New York who ran an import-export business between New York and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]]. Hargous purchased the rights to the route for $25,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US-GDP|25000|1849|r=-5|fmt=c|cursign=$}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), but realized that the grant had little value unless it was supported by the Mexican and American governments.&lt;ref name="Roberson p. 182. Kluger p. 493" /&gt;

In Mexico, topographical officer [[George Wurtz Hughes|George W. Hughes]] reported to Secretary of State [[John M. Clayton]] that a railroad across the isthmus was a "feasible and practical" idea. Clayton then instructed [[Robert P. Letcher]], the minister to Mexico, to negotiate a treaty to protect Hargous' rights. The United States' proposal gave Mexicans a 20% discount on shipping, guaranteed Mexican rights in the zone, allowed the United States to send in military if necessary, and gave the United States most-favored-nation status for Mexican cargo fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|pp=493–494}}; {{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty, however, was never finalized.

The [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]] between the United States and Great Britain, which guaranteed the neutrality of any such canal, was finalized in April 1850. Mexican negotiators refused the treaty because it would eliminate Mexico's ability to play the US and Britain against each other. They eliminated the right of the United States to unilaterally intervene militarily. The United States Senate approved the treaty in early 1851, but the Mexican Congress refused to accept the treaty.&lt;ref name="Kluger2"&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|p=494}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Hargous proceeded as if the treaty would be approved eventually. [[Judah P. Benjamin]] and a committee of New Orleans businessmen joined with Hargous and secured a charter from the Louisiana legislature to create the Tehuantepec Railroad Company. The new company sold stock and sent survey teams to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hargous started to acquire land even after the Mexican legislature rejected the treaty, a move that led to the Mexicans canceling Hargous' contract to use the right of way. Hargous put his losses at $5 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|5000000|1850|r=-6}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) and asked the United States government to intervene. President Fillmore refused to do so.&lt;ref name="Kluger2" /&gt;

Mexico sold the canal franchise, without the land grants, to A. G. Sloo and Associates in New York for $600,000 (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|600000|1850|r=-6}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}). In March 1853 Sloo contracted with a British company to build a railroad and sought an exclusive contract from the new [[Franklin Pierce]] Administration to deliver mail from New York to San Francisco. However, Sloo soon defaulted on bank loans and the contract was sold back to Hargous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|pp= 494–495}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final negotiations and ratification of the treaty of purchase ==
The Pierce administration, which took office in March 1853, had a strong pro-southern, pro-expansion mindset. It sent Louisiana Senator [[Pierre Soulé]] to Spain to negotiate the acquisition of Cuba. Pierce appointed expansionists John Y. Mason of [[Virginia]] and Solon Borland of [[Arkansas]] as ministers, respectively, to [[France]] and [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nevins|1947|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce's Secretary of War, [[Jefferson Davis]], was already on record as favoring a southern route for a transcontinental railroad, so southern rail enthusiasts had every reason to be encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South as a whole, however, remained divided. In January 1853 Senator [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] of Texas introduced a bill to create two railroads, one with a northern route and one with a southern route starting below Memphis on the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Jeffrey Gordon |last=Mauck |title=The Gadsden Treaty: The Diplomacy of Transcontinental Transportation |type=PhD dissertation |publisher=Indiana University |year=1991}} DAI 1992 52(9): 3405-A. DA9205951.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Rusk legislation, the President would be authorized to select the specific termini and routes as well as the contractors who would build the railroads. Some southerners, however, worried that northern and central interests would leap ahead in construction and opposed any direct aid to private developers on constitutional grounds. Other southerners preferred the isthmian proposals. An amendment was added to the Rusk bill to prohibit direct aid, but southerners still split their vote in Congress and the amendment failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|pp=170–171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This rejection led to legislative demands, sponsored by William Gwin of California and [[Salmon P. Chase]] of [[Ohio]] and supported by the railroad interests, for new surveys for possible routes. Gwin expected that a southern route would be approved—both Davis and [[Robert J. Walker]], former secretary of the treasury, supported it. Both were stockholders in a [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]-based railroad that planned to build a link to Texas to join up with the southern route. Davis argued that the southern route would have an important military application in the likely event of future troubles with Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=172}}; {{harvp|Kluger|2007|p=490}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gadsden and Santa Anna ===
[[File:Gadsden Purchase historical mark.jpg|thumb|The Gadsden Purchase historical marker near [[Interstate 10]]]]

On March 21, 1853, a treaty initiated in the Fillmore administration, that would provide joint Mexican and United States protection for the Sloo grant was signed in Mexico. At the same time that this treaty was received in Washington, Pierce learned that New Mexico Territorial Governor [[William Carr Lane|William C. Lane]] had issued a proclamation claiming the Mesilla Valley as part of New Mexico, leading to protests from Mexico. Pierce was also aware of efforts by France, through its consul in San Francisco, to acquire the Mexican state of [[Sonora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nichols|1969|p=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce recalled Lane in May and replaced him with [[David Meriwether (senator)|David Meriwether]] of Kentucky. Meriwether was given orders to stay out of the Mesilla Valley until negotiations with Mexico could be completed.  With the encouragement of Davis, Pierce also appointed James Gadsden as ambassador to Mexico, with specific instructions to negotiate with Mexico over the acquisition of additional territory. Secretary of State [[William L. Marcy]] gave Gadsden clear instructions: he was to secure the Mesilla Valley for the purposes of building a railroad through it, convince Mexico that the US had done its best regarding the Indian raids, and elicit Mexican cooperation in efforts by US citizens to build a canal or railroad across the [[isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Supporting the Sloo interests was not part of the instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nichols|1969|p=266}}; {{harvp|Kluger|2007|p=496}}; {{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gadsden met with Santa Anna on September 25, 1853 in Mexico City to discuss the terms of the treaty.&lt;ref name=Kemp2010 /&gt;

The Mexican government was going through political and financial turmoil. In the process, [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] had been returned to power about the same time that Pierce was inaugurated. Santa Anna was willing to deal with the United States because he needed money to rebuild the [[Mexican Army]] for defense against the United States. He initially rejected the extension of the border further south to the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre Mountains]]. He initially insisted on reparations for the damages caused by American Indian raids, but agreed to let an international tribunal resolve this. Gadsden realized that Santa Anna needed money and passed this information along to Secretary Marcy.&lt;ref name="Kluger3"&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|pp=497–498}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcy and Pierce responded with new instructions. Gadsden was authorized to purchase any of six parcels of land with a price fixed for each. The price would include the settlement of all Indian damages and relieve the United States from any further obligation to protect Mexicans. $50 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|50000000|1853|r=-8}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) would have bought the [[Baja California Peninsula]] and a large portion of its northwestern Mexican states while $15 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|15000000|1853|r=-7}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) was to buy the {{convert|38000|sqmi|km2}} of desert necessary for the railroad plans.&lt;ref name="Kluger3" /&gt;

"Gadsden's antagonistic manner" alienated Santa Anna. Gadsden had advised Santa Anna that "the spirit of the age" would soon lead the northern states to secede so he might as well sell them now. Mexico balked at any large-scale sale of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/gadsden-purchase |title=Gadsden Purchase, 1853–1854 |publisher=U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian |accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican President felt threatened by [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]'s attempt to capture [[Baja California]] with 50 troops and annex [[Sonora]]. Gadsden disavowed any government backing of Walker, who was expelled by the U.S. and placed on trial as a criminal. Santa Anna worried that the US would allow further aggression against  Mexican territory. Santa Anna needed to get as much money for as little territory as possible.&lt;ref name="azstar" /&gt; When Great Britain rejected Mexican requests to assist in the negotiations, Santa Anna opted for the $15 million package (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|15000000|1854}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).&lt;ref name="Kluger4"&gt;{{harvp|Kluger|2007|pp=498–499}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Anna signed the treaty on December 30, 1853, along with James Gadsden. Then the treaty was presented to the U.S. Senate for confirmation.&lt;ref name=Kemp2010&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Roger L. |editor-last=Kemp |title=Documents of American Democracy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHawgM-WnlUC&amp;pg=PA195 |year=2010 |page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuckered2013&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Tucker |editor-first1=Spencer |editor-last2=Arnold |editor-first2=James R. |editor-last3=Wiener |editor-first3=Roberta |editor-last4=Pierpaoli, Jr |editor-first4=Paul G. |editor-last5=Cutrer |editor-first5=Thomas W. |editor-last6=Santoni |editor-first6=Pedro |display-editors=2 |title=The Encyclopedia of the Mexican-American War: A Political, Social, and Military History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZVQcZpic-8C&amp;pg=PA255|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ratification ===
[[File:UnitedStatesExpansion.png|thumb|300px|Territorial enlargement of the United States, the Gadsden Purchase shown in red-orange]]
Pierce and his cabinet began debating the treaty in January 1854. Although disappointed in the amount of territory secured and some of the terms, they submitted it to the Senate on February 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nichols|1969|p=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gadsden, however, suggested that northern senators would block the treaty in order to deny the South a railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/04/25/76457120.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Pacific Railroad: Southern Plan |date=April 25, 1854 |access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although signed by Pierce and Santa Anna, the treaty needed a 2/3 vote in favor of ratification in the US Senate, where it met strong opposition. Antislavery senators opposed further acquisition of slave territory. Lobbying by speculators gave the treaty a bad reputation. Some senators objected to furnishing Santa Anna financial assistance.

The treaty reached the Senate as that body focused on the debate over the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. On April 17, after much debate, the Senate voted 27 to 18 in favor of the treaty, falling three votes short of the necessary two-thirds required for treaty approval. After this defeat, Secretary Davis and southern senators pressed Pierce to add more provisions to the treaty including:
* protection for the Sloo grant;
* a requirement that Mexico "protect with its whole power the prosecution, preservation, and security of the work [referring to the isthmian canal]";
* permission for the United States to intervene unilaterally "when it may feel sanctioned and warranted by the public or international law"; and
* a reduction of the territory to be acquired by {{convert|9000|sqmi|km2}} to the final size of {{convert|29670|sqmi|km2|adj=on}},  and dropping the price to $10 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|10000000|1854}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) from $15 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|15000000|1854}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).

The land area included in the treaty is shown in the map at the head of the article, and in the national map in this section.{{#tag:ref|The Purchase treaty defines the new border as "up the middle of that river  to the point where the parallel of 31° 47' north latitude crosses the same {{coord|31|47|0|N|106|31|41.5|W}}; thence due west one hundred miles; thence south to the rallel of 31° 20' north latitude; thence along the said parallel of 31° 20' to the 111th meridian of longitude west of Greenwich {{coord|31|20|N|111|0|W}}; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado River twenty English miles below the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers; thence up the middle of the said Colorado river  until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico".

This version of the treaty successfully passed the US Senate April 25, 1854, by a vote of 33 to 12. The reduction in territory was an accommodation of northern senators who opposed the acquisition of additional slave territory. In the final vote, northerners split 12 to 12.

While the land was available for construction of a southern railroad, the issue had become too strongly associated with the sectional debate over slavery to receive federal funding. Roberson wrote:&lt;ref name=Robersonp180&gt;{{harvp|Roberson|1974|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The unfortunate debates in 1854 left an indelible mark on the course of national politics and the Pacific railroad for the remainder of the antebellum period. It was becoming increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible, to consider any proposal that could not somehow be construed as relating to slavery and, therefore, sectional issues. Although few people fully realized it at the close of 1854, [[sectionalism]] had taken such a firm, unrelenting hold on the nation that completion of an antebellum Pacific railroad was prohibited.

=== Post-ratification controversy ===
As originally envisioned, the purchase would have encompassed a much larger region, extending far enough south to include most of the current [[Mexican states]] of [[Baja California]], [[Baja California Sur]], [[Coahuila]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Sonora]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]]. The Mexican people opposed such boundaries, as did anti-[[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] [[US Senate|US Senators]], who saw the purchase as acquisition of more slave territory. Even the sale of a relatively small strip of land angered the Mexican people, who saw Santa Anna's actions as a betrayal of their country. They watched in dismay as he squandered the funds generated by the Purchase. Contemporary Mexican historians continue to view the deal negatively and believe that it has defined the American–Mexican relationship in a deleterious way.&lt;ref name="azstar" /&gt;

The purchased lands were initially appended to the existing [[New Mexico Territory]]. To help control the new land, the [[US Army]] established [[Fort Buchanan, Arizona|Fort Buchanan]] on [[Sonoita Creek]] in present-day southern Arizona on November 17, 1856. The difficulty of governing the new areas from the territorial capital at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] led to efforts as early as 1856 to [[organized territory|organize]] a new territory out of the southern portion. Many of the early settlers in the region were, however, pro-slavery and sympathetic to the [[Southern United States|South]], resulting in an impasse in [[United States Congress|Congress]] as to how best to reorganize the territory.

The shifting of the course of the [[Rio Grande]] would cause a later dispute over the boundary between Purchase lands and those of the state of Texas, known as the [[Country Club Dispute]]. Pursuant to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the Gadsden Treaty and subsequent treaties, the International Boundary and Water Commission which was established in 1889 to maintain the border, and pursuant to still later treaties its duties expanded to allocation of river waters between the two nations, and providing for flood control and water sanitation. Once viewed as a model of international cooperation, in recent decades the IBWC has been heavily criticized as an institutional anachronism, by-passed by modern social, environmental and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=McCarthy |title=Adaptive Treaty Interpretation, and the International Boundary and Water Commission |ssrn=1839903 |work=Water Law Review |date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth of the region after 1854 ==

=== Army control ===
The residents of the area gained full US citizenship and slowly assimilated into American life over the next half-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Marcy Gail |last=Goldstein |title=Americanization and Mexicanization: The Mexican Elite and Anglo-Americans in the Gadsden Purchase Lands, 1853–1880 |type=PhD dissertation |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |year=1977 }} DAI 1977 38(3): 1572-1573-A.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal threat to the peace and security of settlers and travelers in the area were raids by Apache Indians. The US Army took control of the purchase lands in 1854 but not until 1856 were troops stationed in the troubled region. In June 1857 it established Fort Buchanan south of the Gila at the head of the Sonoita Creek Valley. The fort protected the area until it was evacuated and destroyed in July 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Ben |last=Sacks |title=The Origins of Fort Buchanan: Myth and Fact |magazine=Arizona and the West |year=1965 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=207–226 |issn=0004-1408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new stability brought miners and ranchers. By the late 1850s mining camps and military posts had not only transformed the Arizona countryside; they had also generated new trade linkages to the state of [[Sonora]], Mexico. Magdalena, Sonora, became a supply center for Tubac, wheat from nearby Cucurpe fed the troops at Fort Buchanan, and the town of Santa Cruz sustained the Mowry mines, just miles to the north.

=== Civil War ===
In 1861, during the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America]] formed the [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Confederate Territory of Arizona]], including in the new territory mainly areas acquired by the Gadsden Purchase. In 1863, using a north-to-south dividing line, the Union created its own [[Arizona Territory]] out of the western half of the New Mexico Territory. The new American Arizona Territory also included most of the lands acquired in the Gadsden Purchase. This territory would be admitted into the Union as the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]] on February 14, 1912, the last area of the [[Contiguous United States|Lower 48 States]] to receive statehood.

=== Social development ===
After the Gadsden Purchase, southern Arizona's social elite, including the [[Estevan Ochoa]], Mariano Samaniego, and Leopoldo Carillo families, remained primarily Mexican American until the coming of the railroad in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Thomas E. |last=Sheridan |title=Peacock in the Parlor: Frontier Tucson's Mexican Elite |magazine=Journal of Arizona History |year=1984 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=245–264 |issn=0021-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company opened silver mines in southern Arizona, it sought to employ educated, middle-class Americans who shared a work ethic and leadership abilities to operate the mines. A biographical analysis of some 200 of its employees, classed as capitalists, managers, laborers, and general service personnel, reveals that the resulting work force included Europeans, Americans, Mexicans, and Indians. This mixture failed to stabilize the remote area, which lacked formal social, political, and economic organization in the years from the Gadsden Purchase to the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Diane |last=North |title='A Real Class of People' in Arizona: a Biographical Analysis of the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company, 1856–1863 |journal=Arizona and the West |year=1984 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=261–274 |issn=0004-1408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic development ===
From the late 1840s into the 1870s, Texas stockmen drove their beef cattle through southern Arizona on the Texas–California trail. Texans were impressed with the grazing possibilities offered by the Gadsden Purchase country of Arizona. In the last third of the century, they moved their herds into Arizona and established the range cattle industry there. The Texans contributed their proven range methods to the new grass country of Arizona, but also brought their problems as well. Texas rustlers brought lawlessness, poor management resulted in overstocking, and carelessness introduced destructive diseases. But these difficulties did force laws and associations in Arizona to curb and resolve them. The Anglo-American cattleman frontier in Arizona was an extension of the Texas experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=James A. |last=Wilson |title=West Texas Influence on the Early Cattle Industry of Arizona |magazine=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |year=1967 |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=26–36 |issn=0038-478X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arizona Territory]] was formed in 1863 from the southern portion of the [[New Mexico Territory]], [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] and later [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]]—created from the easternmost portion of Pima County in January 1881—were subject to ongoing border-related conflicts. The area was characterized by rapidly growing boom towns, ongoing [[Apache]] raids, smuggling and cattle rustling across the United States-Mexico border, growing ranching operations, and the expansion of new technologies in mining, railroading, and telecommunications.

In the 1860s conflict between the Apaches and the Americans was at its height. Until 1886, almost constant warfare existed in the region adjacent to the Mexican border. The illegal cattle operations kept beef prices in the border region lower and provided cheap stock that helped small ranchers get by. Many early Tombstone residents looked the other way when it was "only Mexicans" being robbed.&lt;ref name="stone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverseaz.com/History/TStone.html |title=History of Old Tombstone |access-date=February 7, 2011 |work=Discover Arizona |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlaws derisively called "[[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|The Cowboys]]" frequently robbed [[stagecoach]]es and brazenly stole cattle in broad daylight, scaring off the legitimate cowboys watching the herds.&lt;ref name="oldwest2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tombstones O.K.

In December 1878, and again the next year, Mexican authorities complained about the "Cowboy" outlaws who stole Mexican beef and resold it in Arizona. The ''[[Arizona Citizen]]'' reported that both U.S. and Mexican bandits were stealing horses from the Santa Cruz Valley and selling them in [[Sonora]]. Arizona Territorial Governor Frémont investigated the Mexican government's allegations and accused them in turn of allowing outlaws to use Sonora as a base of operations for raiding into Arizona.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Pioneer Lawman: Crawley P.

In the 1870s and 1880s there was considerable tension in the region—between the rural residents, who were for the most part [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] from the agricultural South, and town residents and business owners, who were largely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] from the industrial Northeast and Midwest. The tension culminated in what has been called the [[Cochise County in the Old West|Cochise County feud]], and the Earp-Clanton feud, which ended with the historic [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] and [[Wyatt Earp]]'s [[Earp Vendetta Ride|Vendetta Ride]].

=== Railroad development ===
[[File:Gadsden Purchase Southern Pacific.jpg|thumb|300px|Gadsden Purchase]]

In 1846, James Gadsden, then president of the [[South Carolina Railroad]], proposed building a transcontinental railroad linking the Atlantic at Charleston with the Pacific at San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwantes |first1=Carlos |title=The West the Railroads Made |date=2008 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |isbn=978-0-295-98769-9 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal and private surveys by Lt. John G. Parke and Andrew B Gray proved the feasibility of the southern transcontinental route, but sectional strife and the Civil War delayed construction of the proposed railroad.  The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] from [[Los Angeles]] reached [[Yuma, Arizona]], in 1877, [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in March 1880, [[Deming, New Mexico]] in December 1880, and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] in May 1881, the first railroad across the Gadsden Purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = David |last = Devine |title = Slavery, Scandal, and Steel Rails: The 1854 Gadsden Purchase and the Building of the Second Transcontinental Railroad Across Arizona and New Mexico Twenty-Five Years Later |year = 2004 |location = New York |publisher = iUniverse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, 1879-1881, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] was building across New Mexico and met the Southern Pacific at [[Deming, New Mexico]] March 7, 1881, completing the second transcontinental railroad (the first, the central transcontinental, was completed May 10, 1869 at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]]).  Acquiring trackage rights over the SP, from Deming to Benson, the Santa Fe then built a line southwest to Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico, completed October 1882, as its first outlet to the Pacific.  This line was later sold to the Southern Pacific.  The Southern Pacific continued building east from El Paso, completing a junction with the Texas &amp; Pacific in December 1881, and finally in 1883, its own southern transcontinental, the Sunset Route, California to New Orleans, Atlantic waters to the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myrick |first1=David |title=Railroads of Arizona, vol 1, the Southern Roads |date=1975 |publisher=Howell North |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-8310-7111-7 |pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; These railroads caused an early 1880s mining boom in such locales as [[Tombstone, Arizona]], [[Bisbee, Arizona]], and [[Santa Rita, New Mexico]], the latter two world class copper producers.  From Bisbee, a third sub-transcontinental was built across the Gadsden Purchase, the [[El Paso and Southwestern Railroad]], to El Paso by 1905, then to a link with the Rock Island line to form the Golden State Route.  The EP&amp;SW was sold to the Southern Pacific in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ibid.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portion of the Southern Pacific in Arizona was originally largely in the Gadsden Purchase but the western part was later rerouted north of the Gila River to serve the city of Phoenix (as part of the agreement in purchasing the EP&amp;SW). The portion in New Mexico runs largely through the territory that had been disputed between Mexico and the United States after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had gone into effect, and before the time of the Gadsden Purchase. The [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad Company]] also completed a railroad across Northern Arizona, via [[Holbrook, Arizona]], [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]], [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]] in August 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railswest.com/secondtranscontinental.html |title=Second Transcontinental Line brings competition |work=Railswest.com |date = |access-date=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two transcontinental railroads, the Southern Pacific (now part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]) and the Santa Fe (now part of the [[BNSF]]), are among the busiest rail lines in the United States.

During the early twentieth century, a number of short-lines usually associated with mining booms were built in the Gadsden Purchase to Ajo, Silverbell, Twin Buttes, Courtland, Gleeson, Arizona, Shakespeare, New Mexico, and other mine sites.  Most of these railroads have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myrick |first1=David |title=Railroads of Arizona, vol 1, the Southern Roads |date=1975 |publisher=Howell North |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-8310-7111-7 |pages=passim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the Gila Valley pre-Purchase border area was traversed by the [[Arizona Eastern Railway]] by 1899 and the [[Copper Basin Railway]] by 1904. Excluded was a {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} section {{coord|33.1|N|110.6|W}} in the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]], from today's [[San Carlos Lake]] to [[Winkelman]] at the mouth of the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]], including the [[Needle's Eye Wilderness]].

This highway is well north of the Gadsden Purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |first= Marc |last= Pearsall |year=2002 |url=http://www.azrymuseum.org/Information/Arizona_Railroad_Map_2002.pdf |title=Railroads of Arizona |scale=Scale not given |location=Chandler |publisher=Arizona Railway Museum |access-date=August 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |author=DeskMap Systems |year=2005 |url=http://www.arizonaeasternrailway.com/images/AZER%20Map.pdf |title=Arizona Eastern Railway |scale=Scale not given |location=Austin, TX |publisher=DeskMapSystems |access-date=August 1, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603235649/http://www.arizonaeasternrailway.com/images/AZER%20Map.pdf |archive-date=June 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the elevations of those three places, at least a 3% [[Grade (slope)|grade]] would have been required for rails built here, rather than the final alignment; railroads prefer 1% or less grade for better operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trn.trains.com/railroads/abcs-of-railroading/2006/05/grades-and-curves |title=Grades and curves: Railroading's weapons in the battle against gravity and geography |last=McGonical |first=Robert S. |journal=Trains |date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rugged terrain above the Gila River confirms the engineering, technical wisdom of acquiring the Gadsden Purchase for a southern transcontinental railroad.

== Population ==
[[Sunland Park, New Mexico|Sunland Park]] (population 14,267  in 2010), a suburb of [[El Paso, Texas]], in [[Doña Ana County, New Mexico]], is the largest community of [[New Mexico]] in the Gadsden Purchase.

[[Lordsburg, New Mexico]] (population 2,797 in 2010), the county seat of [[Hidalgo County, New Mexico|Hidalgo County]], was in the disputed area before the Gadsden Purchase, and [[Deming, New Mexico]], the county seat of [[Luna County, New Mexico|Luna County]], was north of both the Mexican and American land claims before the Gadsden Purchase, though the proposed Bartlett–Conde compromise of 1851 would have left Deming in [[Mexico]], or stated in positive terms, the negotiations for the Gadsden Purchase resolved the border disputes with Mexico, as well as transferred this land to the U.S.&lt;ref name=James1969&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nmgs.nmt.edu/publications/guidebooks/downloads/20/20_p0040_p0055.pdf |title=History of the United States-Mexican boundary survey--1848-1955 |last=James |first=Harold L. |year=1969 |via=New Mexico Geological Society |accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of most [[List of counties in Arizona|counties in Arizona]] do not follow the northern boundary of the Gadsden Purchase, but six counties in [[Arizona]] do have most of their populations within the land of the Gadsden Purchase. Four of these also contain areas north of the Gadsden Purchase, but these areas do have low population densities, with the exception of northeastern [[Pinal County, Arizona]], including the towns of [[Apache Junction, Arizona|Apache Junction]] and [[Florence, Arizona|Florence]]. [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] also extends south into the area of the Gadsden Purchase, but this area is also thinly populated. [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] is the largest city in the Gadsden Purchase.

The northmost point of the Gadsden Purchase, and also along the American–Mexican border during the period of 1848–53, is at approximately {{coord|33|23|30|N|112|23|0|W}} in the town of [[Goodyear, Arizona]], about {{convert|30|mi|km}} southwest of Phoenix.

== Cost effectiveness ==
Economist [[David R. Barker]] estimated in 2009 that the Gadsden Purchase was likely not profitable for the United States federal government. He admits that "Current historical accounts take it for granted that the purchase has been a boon to the United States" but he feels that the region produces little tax revenue; most mines are on Indian reservations which receive all royalties. The federal government spent much money during the 19th century to defend the territory from Apaches that would not have been necessary without the purchase. The value of the southern transcontinental rail line is not mentioned in this brief analysis.&lt;ref name="uiowa20091106"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Barker |first=David R. |title=Researcher's analysis shows buying Alaska no sweet deal for American taxpayers |pages=38–39 |date=November 6, 2009 |publisher=University of Iowa |url=http://news-releases.uiowa.edu/2009/november/David%20Barker-Alaska.pdf |access-date=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view of the value of the Gadsden Purchase and the resolution of the border between the U.S. and Mexico west from El Paso, Texas was given by geologist Harold L. James in 1969: "Although the boundary controversy did not teach any lessons or impart any wisdom, it did lead to the purchase of an extremely valuable strip of territory that has more than paid for itself in subsequent mineral and agricultural resources. Despite the comedy of errors, chaos, and misunderstanding, the Southwest must therefore be grateful."&lt;ref name=James1969 /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The consequences of the Gadsden Purchase for Mexicans and Native Americans living in the region form the background of the story in the film ''[[Conquest of Cochise]]'' (Columbia, 1953).

The [[United States Post Office Department]] issued a postage stamp commemorating 100 years since the Gadsden Purchase, on December 30, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=U.S. Stamp Gallery |url=http://www.usstampgallery.com/view.php?id=d9935e84bd763cd4b8be14cb7861f1266f659f31 |title=Map &amp; pioneer group: Gadsden Purchase |access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Gadsden Purchase was featured in a segment on ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|title=The Gadsden Purchase (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon)|date=2012-12-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn2FzuPyFlY|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7810">A '''GeoTLD''' ('''geographic TLD''') is a [[top-level domain]] in the [[Domain Name System]] of the [[Internet]] using the name of or invoking an association with a [[Human geography|geographical]], geopolitical, ethnic, linguistic or cultural community.

{{As of|2014}}, several examples of geographic TLDs exist: &lt;code href="Category:All articles containing potentially dated statements"&gt;[[.london]]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dotlondondomains.london/domain-availability/&lt;/ref&gt; enabling London businesses, organizations, and individuals to establish an online naming presence, &lt;code href=".london"&gt;[[.asia]]&lt;/code&gt; (for [[Asia]]), &lt;code href="Asia"&gt;[[.rio]]&lt;/code&gt; (for [[Rio de Janeiro]] city), &lt;code href="Rio de Janeiro"&gt;[[.quebec]]&lt;/code&gt; (for [[Québec]] province), &lt;code href="Québec"&gt;[[.cat]]&lt;/code&gt; which is a [[sponsored top-level domain]] intended to be used to highlight the [[Catalan language]] and culture.
[[.eu]] is a [[country code top-level domain]], since "EU" is a [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#Exceptional reservations|reserved country code]] for the [[European Union]] in [[ISO 3166-1]].

The geographic TLDs have formed in 2017 an interest group that is member of the Registry Stakeholder Group (RySG) at ICANN. The GeoTLD Group AISBL is an international non-for-profit membership association resident in Belgium. It represents and promotes the interests of organizations operating a generic top-level domain which denominates a geographic name, geographic identifier or geographic origin (so-called GeoTLD) with the purpose of serving the respective place, language and culture on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geotld.group/ GeoTLD Group AISBL]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Proposals==
Examples of [[Proposed top-level domain|proposed top-level domains]] in this category are:

== Applications ==
&lt;p&gt;On June 13, 2012 [[ICANN]] has revealed nearly 2,000 applications for new top-level domains, which are expected to go live throughout 2014 after thorough examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/application-results/strings-1200utc-13jun12-en Reveal Day 13 June 2012 – New gTLD Applied-For Strings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615000000/http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/application-results/strings-1200utc-13jun12-en|date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==Internationalized country codes==
An [[internationalized country code]] is similar to a GeoTLD, with two differences: it is a domain used exclusively for a sovereign state. The other difference is that an internationalized country code is considered a [[ccTLD]] and not a GeoTLD. More free geographic ccTLD have been applied for and will be active in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7197">'''Google Free Zone''' was a global initiative undertaken by the Internet company [[Google]] in collaboration with mobile phone-based Internet providers, whereby the providers waive data (bandwidth) charges (also known as ''[[Zero-rating|zero-rate]]'') for accessing select Google products such as [[Google Search]], [[Gmail]], and [[G+|Google+]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/mobile/landing/freezone/ |title=Free Zone powered by Google |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to use this service, users are required to have a Google account and a phone that has access to an internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wap.globe.com.ph/freezone-faqs|title=GOOGLE FREE ZONE FAQs - globe.com.ph|website=wap.globe.com.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==

A number of Internet commentators viewed Google Free Zone as both inspired by and a potential competitor to [[Facebook Zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/10/google-free-zone.html |title=Google Free Zone |date=October 25, 2012 |accessdate=January 15, 2014 |publisher=Google Operating System blog (not affiliated with Google)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://thenextweb.com/mobile/2012/11/08/google-and-globe-telecom-launch-freezone-for-mobile-access-to-web-and-select-google-sites/ |title=The Philippines gets Facebook Zero-style free mobile access to Google services via Globe Telecom |last=Knowles |first=Jamillah |date=November 8, 2012 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Jana Mobile Inc. |url=http://www.jana.com/blog/google-free-zone-googles-challenge-to-facebook-zero/ |title=Google Free Zone: Google’s Challenge to Facebook Zero |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.innovation-series.com/2013/02/19/google-free-zone-and-facebook-zero-products-targeting-developing-populations/ |title=Google ‘Free Zone’ and Facebook ‘Zero’: Products Targeting Developing Populations |date=February 19, 2013 |accessdate=January 15, 2014 |publisher=Innovation Series |last=Deibert |first=April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Subsecretaria de Telecomunicaciones'' of [[Chile]] ruled that ''[[Zero-rating]]'' services like Wikipedia Zero, Facebook Zero, and Google Free Zone, that subsidize mobile data usage, violate [[net neutrality]] laws and had to end the practice by June 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/215064/when-net-neutrality-backfires-chile-just-killed-free-access-to-wikipedia-and-facebook/|title = Less than zero – When net neutrality backfires: Chile just killed free access to Wikipedia and Facebook|last = Mirani|first = Leo |publisher= Quartz |date = May 30, 2014|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/25090/face-chile-net-neutrality-v-human-right-facebook-wikipedia|title = Face Off in Chile: Net Neutrality v.

The '''Convention on the law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary''', or '''Hague Securities Convention''' is an international [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[treaty]] intended to remove, globally, legal uncertainties for cross-border [[security (finance)|securities]] transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=72 |title=36: Convention of 5 July 2006 on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities held with an Intermediary |author= |date= |work=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] |publisher= |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention was drafted under the auspices of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], which as resulted in several Conflict of Laws conventions.

[[Switzerland]], [[Mauritius]]  and the United States have ratified the convention, which entered into force on 1 April 2017. The [[European Commission]] recommended in July 2006 that its member states sign the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0325(02)&amp;from=EN |title=Repeal of COM(2003) 783: Proposal for a Council Decision concerning the signing of the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary |author= [[European Commission]]|date=2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this recommendation was later withdrawn.

== The need for the Convention ==

The Convention is largely a response to the move in recent times in most [[nation]]s from a purely [[direct holding system]] to a mixed direct and [[indirect holding system]].  The reforms, though largely beneficial, have created an alarming level of uncertainty as to the question of "what law applies" in cross-border [[securities]] transactions.  The development of a global agreed-upon method of determining the legal regime governing any such transactions lagged behind market practice, leaving [[financial markets]] with significant [[legal risk]].

The problem stems from the fact that intermediaries exist between an [[investor]] and the company which issues a particular security.

Historically, many jurisdictions attempted to apply the traditional, but now arguably outdated, ''[[lex rei sitae]]'' test to securities held with intermediaries, by "looking through" the tiers of intermediaries to the laws of one or more of:  the jurisdiction of [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of the issuer, the location of the issuer's register, or the location of the actual security certificate (the so-called "[[look-through approach]]").

== Europe ==

The Place of the Relevant Intermediary (or "PRIMA") approach was adopted in Europe under the [[European Union]]'s Settlement Finality Directive of 1998.  That directive has been adopted by a number of states.  In 2002, the [[European Community]] also passed the [[European Union]]'s Collateral Directive.

[[Switzerland]], which is not part of the European Union and therefore does not have to wait for agreement among all member states, signed the Convention.

== Japan ==

Strong support for [[Japan]] joining the Convention has been expressed in Japanese legal circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rikkyo.ne.jp/grp/ribls/symposium/2004hague/Wani.pdf |title=IMPACT OF THE HAGUE SECURITIES CONVENTION ON MARKET  PRACTICE - A JAPANESE PRACTITIONER'S VIEW |author=AKIHIRO WANI |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New test ==

The first Special Commission of the Convention met at [[The Hague]] in January 2001 to consider the appropriate [[conflict of laws]] rule.  At this first meeting, initially the concept embraced by the PRIMA approach was adopted. The next two years of negotiations and meetings were spent determining an appropriate formulation of the language of the convention, and which PRIMA concepts to accept and which to reject.  At the end of the negotiations, the idea that the place of the relevant intermediary was the place to focus on was unanimously rejected in lieu of the approach described below.

The fundamental issue during negotiations was to determine a test that would accurately locate the one [[jurisdiction]] for any set of circumstances that would  be the jurisdiction whose law would apply.  The result of the analysis was that for [[financial institution]]s with many offices, it is often not possible to point to one particular location.  Delegates concluded that a test that tried to actually locate a particular securities account would result in an unacceptable level of impossibility or uncertainty.

Over time a new approach was developed:

*the account holder and relevant intermediary may choose in the account agreement the law to govern the issues under the Convention; 
*this choice will be respected under the Hague Convention provided that the chosen law is of a place where the relevant intermediary has an office that is involved in the maintenance of securities accounts (a "qualifying office").

== Main rule ==

The main rule of the Convention can be summarised as follows:

*Article 4:  The first step is to look to the law expressly agreed between the account holder and its immediate (relevant) intermediary in the account agreement.  If no such express designation is made, but the parties have expressly agreed on the law to govern the account agreement, then the governing law shall govern the issues under the Convention.

The second step is to apply the "qualifying office" test.  Art 4(2) contains a "black list" of activities, each of which by itself is not sufficient to constitute maintenance of securities accounts.

Article 5(1):  Where the previous rule does not provide a result, and a written account agreement exists which "expressly and unambiguously" states that the relevant intermediary entered into the account agreement through a particular office, the applicable law is the law of the location of that office, provided the "qualifying office" test is fulfilled.

Article 5(2) and (3): These provide a fallback where Art 5(1) provides no answer.  Under these provisions, the applicable law is determined with reference to the place of incorporation or organisation of the relevant intermediary, or its principal place of business.

=== Multi-unit states ===

Where the primary rule in Art 4 leads to the law of a territorial unit of a multi-unit state (such as [[Canada]] or [[Australia]]), Art 12 indicates that the applicable law can be the law of a territorial unit specified in the account agreement provided that the relevant intermediary has a qualifying office somewhere in the multi-unit state.

=== Relevant intermediary as collateral taker ===

In Art 4(3), the Convention expressly provides that it applies in the specific case where an account holder:

# Holds interests in securities through an intermediary; and
# [[Pledge (law)|Pledge]]s or transfers title to securities held with an intermediary to that particular inventory.

In this situation, the Convention provides that the relevant intermediary is the account holder's own intermediary, and the account agreement between the account holder and its intermediary is the relevant account agreement to determine the law governing either perfection or completion.

== Other issues ==

Other issues governed by the Convention include:

*Issues of priority between competing dispositions;
*The requirements for the realisation of such an interest; and
*The duties of an intermediary to competing [[claimant]]s to an interest in securities held with the intermediary.

== Other related international conventions ==

In 2003, [[Unidroit]] started a negotiation process with a view to harmonise the material aspects of intermediated securities. The purpose is to achieve a further step towards legal integration of securities markets, that consist not only in identifying the applicable law, but also in harmonising some parts of the legislation of the signatory States. These negotiations eventually reached the adoption, in October 2009, of the [[Unidroit convention on substantive rules for intermediated securities]] also known as the '''Geneva Securities Convention'''.

'''''Harrison v. Vincent''''' [1982] RTR 8 is an English [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] judgment dealing with the liability [[negligence]] of participants in sporting competitions towards other participants. It is notable in that it extended the test of "reckless disregard" for the other's safety which was earlier applied to establish a [[breach of duty in English law|breach of duty]] in cases of injury to spectators&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Wooldridge v. Sumner]]'' [1963] 2 QB 23&lt;/ref&gt; to cases where other participants had been injured.

==Facts==
A sidecar passenger sued the motorcycle rider for injuries sustained during a race when the rider was unable to stop because he missed his gear, and his brakes failed.&lt;ref name=swarb&gt;[http://swarb.co.uk/harrison-v-vincent-1982/ swarb.co.uk:Harrison -v- Vincent; 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The defendant had the duty to check the brakes before the race. Unlike his failure to hit the gear during the "flurry and excitement" of the race, the brakes should have been tested in the relative calm of the workshop before the race. For acts done in the excitement of the competition the participant will only be liable to others if she demonstrates reckless disregard for their safety, or acts maliciously. However, the standard applicable to the preparation of equipment for the sport is the normal standard, with exercise of reasonable care and skill.&lt;ref name=swarb/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}
'''Home state regulation''' is a principle in the [[law of the European Union]] for resolving conflict of laws between Member States when dealing with cross-border selling or marketing of goods and services. The principle states that, where an action or service is performed in one country but received in another, the applicable law is the law of the country where the action or service is performed. It is also called '''home country control''',  '''country of origin rule''', or '''country of origin principle'''. It is one possible rule of EU law, specifically of [[European Single Market]] law, that determines which laws will apply to [[good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|service]]s that cross the border of Member States.

The opposing principle is '''host state regulation''' or the '''country of reception principle'''. In a [[European Union directive|directive]], or [[European Union regulation|regulation]], where this principle applies, if a firm based in country A is selling into customers living in country B, they are regulated according to the laws of country B. Host state regulation is sometimes seen as hindering the single market, as firms need to be aware of 28 sets of national law. However, it is also argued that it gives better protection to consumers, who are unlikely to be aware of their rights under the laws of other EU member states.

==Political objectives==
The "country of origin principle" is a rule that is sometimes advanced with the intention of facilitating the free movement of goods or service providers so as to encourage cross-border competition or, possibly, to encourage individuals or companies to test other markets without having to establish in the target market. It is also sometimes intended to free providers of goods and service from the obligation to accommodate multiple regulatory regimes when trading across borders from a single location. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Home state regulation is often held to help the single market, as firms only need to be aware of their own country's laws, rather than 27 sets of national law.

==Application ==
EU law requires that the goods or services produced legally in one Member States should be allowed unhindered access to markets of other Member States. The latter are not allowed to apply their laws except in specific circumstances. When they are allowed to do so, this will be under a specifically developed test called '''General Good Test'''.{{clarify|date=November 2017}} For example, if a sale of goods is made over the Internet from a website in France to a purchaser in Italy, the country of origin principle would be said to apply if French law applied to the transaction, and the country of reception principle if Italian law prevailed.

The provision underlying the [[European Single Market|four freedoms]] (and therefore also the Home Country Control) is the prohibition of discrimination based on nationality: Article 12 (ex 6) of the [[EC Treaty]]. Over the course of years, this policy evolved to include prohibition on some behaviors that were non-discriminatory, based on the fact that their implementation created obstacles to trade between states. In a [[European Union directive|directive]], or [[European Union regulation|regulation]], where home state regulation applies, if a firm based in country A is selling into customers living in country B, they are regulated according to the laws of country A. In turn, country B has to accept that the laws of country A are sufficient under the principle of mutual recognition. 

In the sphere of goods, what these “non-discriminatory” obstacles were and how they were to be removed was clarified in [[Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein|''Cassis'']] (C-120/78, [1979] ECR 649) and ''[[Keck and Mithouard|Keck]]'' (Joined Cases C-267 and 268/91, 1993 [ECR] I-6097) cases of the Court of Justice. In services, this was done in ''Säger'' (C-76/90, [1991] ECR I-4221), and in establishment in ''[[Gebhard v Consiglio dell'Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano|Gebhard]]'' (C-55/94, [1995] ECR I-4165). The power of these cases lies in making the products and services legally made in one state (Home State) available in other state (Host State), where the latter is only exceptionally able to apply its law to the said good or service. In other words, once a good or a service gains a “passport” in its Home State, it can be freely exported into any other Member State. 

===New Approach as the basis for home country control===
The New Approach{{clarify|date=November 2017}} consists of three important elements: 
* minimum harmonization
* mutual recognition of rules
* home country control

and was based on prohibition of non-discriminatory obstacles to trade. 

The first part, '''minimum harmonization''', aims to unify the absolute minimum of necessary standards. This would, in turn enable '''mutual recognition''' of laws, where the bulk of legal control takes place in the country of origin (Home State) and the country of destination acknowledges the former's regulatory power. This was considered practical, as control would be exercised at first port of call and, since the minimum of mutual standards would exist, there would be no danger of reducing the stringency to the standards of the least developed state. 

For example, a [[bank]]ing service is part of wider efforts to harmonize [[financial services]]. A French bank is able to open a branch in the [[United Kingdom]] and all prudential supervision is conducted in [[France]]. The consolidated Directive on the business of credit institutions from 2000[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0012:EN:NOT] represents the minimum of ''harmonized'' EC law. Britain (Host State) is obliged to recognize the fact that France only, as the country of origin (Home State) is entitled to conduct prudential supervision. Thus, there is only one control, in the Home State, and dual-burden of control in both states, which makes the service less competitive, disappears. The only option for Britain to apply its law to this banking service is to justify it under the General Good test.

===Examples of application===
Directive 2000/31/EC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex - 32000L0031 - EN|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as the [[Electronic Commerce Directive]], establishes that the country of origin principle shall prevail in European law for most, but not all, Information Society Services. Recital 22 of that Directive states:
: ''Information society services should be supervised at the source of the activity, in order to ensure an effective protection of public interest objectives; to that end, it is necessary to ensure that the competent authority provides such protection not only for the citizens of its own country but for all Community citizens; in order to improve mutual trust between Member States, it is essential to state clearly this responsibility on the part of the Member State where the services originate; moreover, in order to effectively guarantee freedom to provide services and [[legal certainty]] for suppliers and recipients of services, such information society services should in principle be subject to the law of the Member State in which the service provider is established.'' 

The extent to which the country of origin principle should be applied to provision of services generally was a main point of political controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4698524.stm|title=Q&amp;A: Services Directive|date=15 November 2006|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in negotiation of the proposed [[Directive on services in the internal market|Services Directive]].

'''''Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha''''', 462 U.S. 919 (1983), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ruling in 1983 that the one-house [[legislative veto]] violated the constitutional [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha|462|919|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Section 244(a)(1) of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]], {{USCSub|8|1254|a|1}}, authorized the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) to suspend deportation of an alien continually residing in the United States for at least seven years where the [[U.S. Attorney General]], in his discretion, found that deportation would result in "extreme hardship." After making such a finding, the Attorney General would transmit a report to Congress pursuant to § 244(c)(1) and either house of Congress had the power to veto the Attorney General's determination pursuant to § 244(c)(2).

===Facts===
Respondent Jagdish Rai Chadha was born in the [[Kenya Colony|British colony of Kenya]] to Indian parents. Chadha was a [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] and entered the United States on a [[British passport]] when studying in Ohio as a [[foreign exchange student]]. After Kenya's declaration of independence from Britain in 1963 he was not recognized as a legitimate citizen or resident of Kenya (as his parents were Indian) or India (as he was born in Kenya). Furthermore, his [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode in the United Kingdom]] was stripped under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] due to his lack of connection with the United Kingdom. After his non-immigrant student visa expired in 1972, none of the three countries would accept him onto their territory, effectively making him ''[[de facto]]'' [[Statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Lena|title=Faces Behind Famous Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/garden/faces-behind-famous-cases.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=26 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=19 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The INS initiated [[deportation]] proceedings against Chadha. Chadha sought to suspend his deportation, and the INS accommodated his request according to § 244(a)(1), and transmitted a report of the suspension to Congress according to § 244(c)(2). The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] vetoed the suspension of Chadha's deportation, and the INS resumed deportation proceedings. Chadha raised constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2), but the immigration judge found he lacked any authority to rule on such claims and ordered Chadha deported. Chadha then appealed to the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]], which also found it lacked any authority to consider constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2). Chadha appealed to the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] for review of the deportation order, and the INS supported his challenge to the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2). The Ninth Circuit found § 244(c)(2) unconstitutional and ordered the [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] to suspend deportation proceedings. The INS appealed the Ninth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in order to obtain a final judgment on the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2).

The House and Senate, as ''[[amici curiae]]'', argued that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid. It asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.

Congress argued that: (1) Chadha lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2) because that section is not severable from § 244(a)(1). Therefore, if Chadha were to succeed in invalidating § 244(c)(2), his means of remedy in § 244(a)(1) would also be destroyed, and there would be no relief possible; (2) the Court did not have jurisdiction over the issue because the Attorney General and INS enforced the challenged statute and thereby effectively waived their right to challenge it; (3) the action was not a genuine [[case or controversy]], as both the original plaintiff and defendant challenged the statute without real opposition; (4) the action was a non-justiciable [[political question]].

==Holding==
The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment. In an opinion by [[Warren Burger|Chief Justice Burger]], the Court held that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. Congress may not promulgate a statute granting to itself a [[legislative veto]] over actions of the executive branch inconsistent with the [[bicameralism]] principle and [[Presentment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

The Court rebutted Congress's assertions as follows: (1) § 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is severable from the rest of the act pursuant to the express severability clause § 406. The legislative history of § 244 supports the proposition that Congress, frustrated with the process of passing [[private bill|private law]]s to provide relief for deportable individuals, would likely not have been willing to retain the private law mechanism rather than ceding all power to the Attorney General. (2) The Attorney General and INS did not waive their right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by enforcing the statute. (3) The action is a genuine case with adequate representation in favor of sustaining the act provided by the houses of Congress as ''amici curiae''. (4) The case is a judicable question, not exempted by the political question doctrine; the constitutionality of a statute is a question for the courts.

The Court then presented its affirmative reasoning: (5) When the Constitution provides express procedures, such procedures must be strictly observed. Two such provisions are bicameralism and presentment in the enactment of law. (6) The presentment process—especially the President's veto power—was intended by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] to provide a mechanism by which the executive branch could defend itself against legislative encroachment and could prevent ill-conceived policies. (7) Similarly, the bicameralism requirement was formulated in order to hinder congressional action and thereby prevent legislative encroachment. (8) The action of the House of Representatives is legislative in nature because (a) it modifies rights and duties of individuals outside the legislative branch; (b) the enactment would otherwise have required a private law, which is a legislative function; and (c) the nature of the action is inherently legislative. (9) When the Framers intended to authorize Congress to exercise power outside of the bicameral and presentment principles, it provided alternate procedures explicitly; other procedures cannot be admitted. (10) Because the action of the House of Representatives was legislative, but did not conform to the mode of action specifically stated by the Constitution for legislative action; it is therefore invalid, unenforceable, and not binding.

===Concurrence===
[[Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.|Justice Powell]], in a concurring opinion, argued that to invalidate all legislative veto provisions is a serious matter, as Congress views the legislative veto as essential to controlling the executive branch, and should therefore be undertaken with caution. However, Congress's action in this case is nonetheless unconstitutional. Contrary to the views of the majority, Congress's action is not legislative in character but adjudicative, and it therefore violates the principle (called the [[anti-aggrandizement principle]]) that Congress may not expand its own power into the areas of competence of the other branches. The Constitution specifically attempted to prevent this form of aggrandizement in the [[Bill of Attainder]] Clause, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Art. I]], § 9, cl. 3, which prohibits Congress from undertaking legislative trials that lack the safeguards and accountability of judicial trials. For a house of Congress to force the deportation of Chadha would amount to such a legislative trial.

===Dissents===
[[Byron White|Justice White]], dissenting, argued that (1) the legislative veto power is absolutely necessary to modern government, as exemplified by the legislative veto powers granted in the [[War Powers Act of 1973]]. (2) The absence of constitutional provisions for alternate methods of action does not imply their prohibition by the Constitution, and the Court has consistently read the Constitution to respond to contemporary needs with flexibility. (3) The legislative veto power does not involve the ability of Congress to enact new legislation without bicameral consensus or presentation to the [[President of the United States|president]], but instead involves the ability of Congress to veto suggestions by the executive, a power that both houses of Congress already possess. (4) The Court has allowed Congress to delegate authority to executive agencies; lawmaking does not always require bicameralism or presentation. (5) The bicameralism and presentation provisions of the Constitution serve to ensure that no departure from the status quo takes place without consensus from both houses of Congress and the President or by a super-majority vote of both houses of Congress. In this case, the deportation of Chadha is the ''[[status quo]]'' situation, and the veto by House of Representatives of an alternative suggestion of the executive branch is reasonable given the purposes of bicameralism and the Presentment Clause.

[[William H. Rehnquist|Justice Rehnquist]], in a dissent joined by White, argued that it is unlikely that Congress would have promulgated § 244(a)(1) without the corresponding provisions of §§ 244(c)(1–2). Therefore, the provisions are not severable from one another, and holding one unconstitutional requires invalidating the other.

==Aftermath==

Chadha became a citizen of the United States and was living in Albany, California, as of October 2015.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Legislative vetoes continued to be enacted after ''Chadha'', although various presidents have issued executive [[signing statement]]s disclaiming the unconstitutional legislative veto provisions. The consultation provisions of the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]], for example, while contested by every president since [[Richard M. Nixon]], are usually grudgingly obeyed. Other processes, such as [[Fast track (trade)|fast-track legislation]], have taken the place of the legislative veto and achieved the same effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking: Cases and Materials |last=Brest |first=Paul |author2=Sanford Levinson |author3=Jack M.

Sections 801-808, allowed Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations. Such a veto had been exercised only once, in March 2001, until 2017, when the [[115th United States Congress|115th Congress]] under President [[Donald Trump]] passed fifteen such vetoes, overturning various rules issued under the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Senate Joint Resolution 6, Pub L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8734">'''Jurisdictional error''' is a concept in [[administrative law]], particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Australia]]. [[Jurisdiction]] is the "authority to decide",&lt;ref&gt;''Abebe v Commonwealth'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|14|1999}}; (1999) 197 CLR 510, 524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bowser v Collins'' 1482, YB22EDIV fol30 pl11.&lt;/ref&gt; and a jurisdictional error occurs when the extent of that authority is misconceived. Decisions affected by jurisdictional error can be quashed by [[judicial review]]. Examples of jurisdictional errors include asking the wrong question, ignoring relevant material, relying on irrelevant material, and breaching [[natural justice]].&lt;ref name="craig"&gt;''Craig v South Australia'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|58|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==

In Australia, the definition of Jurisdictional error can be found in High Court judgements.

[[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne J]] has defined jurisdictional error in the following terms:

The difficulty of drawing a bright line between jurisdictional error and error in the exercise of jurisdiction should not be permitted, however, to obscure the difference that is illustrated by considering clear cases of each species of error. '''There is a jurisdictional error if the decision maker makes a decision outside the limits of the functions and powers conferred on him or her, or does something which he or she lacks power to do.''' By contrast, incorrectly deciding something which the decision maker is authorised to decide is an error within jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Refugee Review Tribunal''; ''Ex parte Aala'' [2000] HCA 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more specific definition of Jurisdictional error is defined as follows:

Jurisdictional error is at its most obvious where the inferior court purports to act wholly or partly outside the general area of its jurisdiction in the sense of entertaining a matter or making a decision or order of a kind which wholly or partly lies outside the theoretical limits of its functions and powers.&lt;ref&gt;Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of superior courts to respond to jurisdictional error by issuing the [[prerogative writ]]s is entrenched in Australia's [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]]:

{{quote|[T]he jurisdiction of this Court to grant relief under s 75(v) of the Constitution cannot be removed by or under a law made by the Parliament. Specifically, '''the jurisdiction to grant s 75(v) relief where there has been jurisdictional error by an officer of the Commonwealth cannot be removed'''.&lt;ref name="s157"&gt;''Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|2|2003}} [98] (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kirk"&gt;''Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|1|2010}} [95] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term has been subject to criticism. In 2008, [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Kirby J]] held:

{{quote|The classification is conclusory. It is very difficult to define and to apply. In recent years it has been substantially discarded by English legal doctrine. Jurisdictional error is nearly impossible to explain to lay people even though the Constitution (including the central provisions in s 75(v)) belongs to them. Most non-lawyers would regard it as a lawyer's fancy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commissioner of Taxation]] v Futuris Corporation Limited'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|32|2008}} [129]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Types===

[[List of University of New South Wales faculty#Legal academics|Mark Aronson]] identifies 8 categories of jurisdictional error:&lt;ref&gt;M Aronson, B Dyer and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action 4th ed, 2009, [1.90].&lt;/ref&gt;
# A mistaken assertion or denial of the very existence of [[jurisdiction]].
# A misapprehension or disregard of the nature or limits of the decision-maker's functions or powers.
# Acting wholly or partly outside the general area of the decision-maker's jurisdiction, by entertaining issues or making the types of decisions or order which are forbidden under any circumstances. An example would be a civil court trying a criminal charge.
# Mistakes as to the existence of a jurisdictional fact or other requirement when the relevant Act treats that fact or requirement as something which must exist objectively as a condition precedent to the validity of the challenged decision.
# Disregarding relevant considerations or paying regard to irrelevant considerations, if the proper construction of the relevant Act is that such errors result in invalidity.
# Errors of law, although where the decision-maker is an inferior court or other legally qualified adjudicative body, the error will probably have to be such that it amounts to a misconception of the nature of the function being performed or of the body's powers.
# Acting in bad faith.
# Breaching the [[hearing rule|hearing]] or [[nemo iudex in causa sua|bias rule]]s of [[natural justice]].
This list is non-exhaustive, as these grounds lead to invalidity and therefore jurisdictional error.

Jurisdictional error is a separate ground of review under the [[Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977|ADJR Act]], sought on the ground "that the person who purported to make the decision did not have jurisdiction to make the decision". The nine statutory grounds of review provided for in s 5 of the ADJR Act overlap substantially with the concept of jurisdictional error at common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|adra1977396|Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for Civil Service"[1985] AC 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisdictional error can "be seen to embrace a number of different kinds of errors" administered in an administrative tribunal. As such, the circumstances of a particular case may permit more than one characterisation." &lt;ref&gt;"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf" {{Cite AustLII|HCA|30|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

[[Canadian administrative law]] has a similar set of concepts called ''[[Canadian administrative law#Substantive review|Substantive review]]'' which incorporates most of the criteria of Jurisdictional error

==Singapore==

In [[Singapore]] they are known as [[Administrative law in Singapore#Error as to a precedent fact|Precedent fact errors]] but works effectively like the [[United Kingdom]] [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration'' [1985–1986] S.L.R.(R.) 180, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==

[[Judicial review in Hong Kong]] is effectively the [[English Law|English system]] and is enshrined in Article 35 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|constitution]].

==United Kingdom==

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the [[House of Lords]] has held they are "... an incorrect interpretation of a statutory phrase by the ... authorities [that] amounted to an error of law that was judicially reviewable".&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v. Bairstow'' [1955] UKHL 3, [1956] A.C. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[Canada]], [[judicial review in Scotland]] does not use the term but holds many of the concepts in their judicial review system.&lt;ref&gt;Rules of Court (Scotland) Chapter 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grounds===
In the [[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|CCSU Case]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]'' [1985] AC 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Diplock]] suggests that the grounds can be reduced to three or four broad concepts – 'illegality', 'irrationality', 'procedural impropriety' and 'proportionality'.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Doeker-Mach, Guenther Doeker-Mach, Klaus A. Ziegert, 'Law and Legal Culture in Comparative Perspective' (Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-wdouHW3jqkC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=Lord+Diplock+%2B+%E2%80%98illegality,%E2%80%99+%E2%80%98irrationality%E2%80%99,+%E2%80%98procedural+impropriety%E2%80%99+and+possible+%E2%80%98proportionality%E2%80%99.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IfNshzUNaS&amp;sig=9lmRN8wCww-UD2ljtyqDZaeFQ7U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hDnfUuqVK4SlkwWM9oGYAw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Lord%20Diplock%20%20%20%E2%80%98illegality%2C%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%98irrationality%E2%80%99%2C%20%E2%80%98procedural%20impropriety%E2%80%99%20and%20possible%20%E2%80%98proportionality%E2%80%99.&amp;f=false page 291].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korean Demilitarized Zone''' ('''DMZ'''; [[Hangul|Chosŏn'gŭl/Hangul]]: 한반도 비무장 지대; [[Hanja]]: 韓半島非武裝地帶) is a strip of land running across the [[Korean Peninsula]]. It is established by the provisions of the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] to serve as a [[buffer zone]] between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]. The [[demilitarized zone]] (DMZ) is a [[border barrier]] that divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half. It was created by agreement between North Korea, [[China]] and the [[United Nations]] in 1953. The DMZ is {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=off}} long, and about {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=off}} wide.

Within the DMZ is a meeting point between the two nations in the small [[Joint Security Area]] (JSA) near the western end of the zone, where negotiations take place. There have been various incidents in and around the DMZ, with military and civilian casualties on both sides.

==Location==
The Korean Demilitarized Zone intersects but does not follow the [[38th parallel north]], which was the border before the [[Korean War]]. It crosses the parallel on an angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of the parallel and the east end lying north of it.

{{main|Division of Korea}}
The [[38th parallel north]]—which divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half—was the original boundary between the United States and Soviet Union's brief administration areas of Korea at the end of [[World War II]]. Upon the creation of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK, informally "North Korea") and the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK, informally "South Korea") in 1948, it became a ''[[de facto]]'' international border and one of the most tense fronts in the [[Cold War]].

Both the North and the South remained dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. That conflict, which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines, commenced on 25 June 1950, with a full-front DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel, and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the [[Front (military)|front]] of the war back to near the 38th parallel.

In the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] of 27 July 1953, the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=in}} from the front line, creating a buffer zone {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. The [[Military Demarcation Line]] (MDL) goes through the center of the DMZ and indicates where the front was when the agreement was signed.

Owing to this theoretical [[stalemate]], and genuine hostility between the North and the South, large numbers of troops are stationed along both sides of the line, each side guarding against potential aggression from the other side, even {{Age|1953|July|27}} years after its establishment. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL.

==Joint Security Area==

[[Image:Joint Security Area from North Korea.jpg|thumb|Conference Row seen from the northern side of the [[Joint Security Area|JSA]]]]
{{main|Joint Security Area}}
Inside the DMZ, near the western coast of the peninsula, [[Panmunjom]] is the home of the Joint Security Area (JSA). Originally, it was the only connection between North and South Korea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imcom.korea.army.mil/imakoroweb/sites/local/news/020808_IMCOMK_DMZ.asp |title=Panmunjon |publisher=army.mil.com |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905081008/http://imcom.korea.army.mil/imakoroweb/sites/local/news/020808_IMCOMK_DMZ.asp |archivedate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that changed on 17 May 2007, when a [[Korail]] train went through the DMZ  to the North on the new [[Donghae Bukbu Line]] built on the east coast of Korea. However, the resurrection of this line was short-lived, as it closed again in July 2008 following an incident in which a South Korean tourist was shot and killed.

There are several buildings on both the north and the south side of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (MDL), and there have been some built on top of it. The JSA is the location where all [[Inter-Korean summits|negotiations]] since 1953 have been held, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of [[Inter-Korean conflict|tensions]]. The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.

Within the JSA are a number of buildings for joint meetings called Conference Rooms. These are used for direct talks between the Korean War participants and parties to the armistice. Facing the Conference Row buildings are the North Korean ''[[Panmungak]]'' ({{lang-en|Panmun Hall}}) and the South Korean [[Freedom House (Joint Security Area)|Freedom House]]. In 1994, North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor. In 1998, South Korea built a new Freedom House for its [[Red Cross]] staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the [[Korean War]]. The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design.

Since 1953 there have been occasional confrontations and skirmishes within the JSA. The [[Korean axe murder incident|axe murder incident]] in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a tree which resulted in two deaths ([[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Arthur Bonifas and [[First Lieutenant]] Mark Barrett). Another incident occurred on 23 November 1984, when a Soviet tourist named Vasily Matuzok (sometimes spelled Matusak), who was part of an official trip to the JSA (hosted by the North), ran across the MDL shouting that he wanted to [[defection|defect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/general-revisits-deadly-1984-thanksgiving-firefight-at-dmz-1.161443 |title=General revisits deadly 1984 Thanksgiving firefight at DMZ |work=Stars and Stripes |accessdate=13 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309182210/http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/general-revisits-deadly-1984-thanksgiving-firefight-at-dmz-1.161443 |archivedate=9 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean troops immediately chased after him, opening fire. Border guards on the South Korean side returned fire, eventually surrounding the North Koreans as they pursued Matusak. One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action, and Matusak was not captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/dmz-list.htm |title=Korea Demilitarized Zone Incidents |date=2009-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331152533/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/dmz-list.htm |archivedate=31 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, South Korean forces in conjunction with the [[United Nations Command]] began renovation of its three guard posts and two checkpoint buildings within the JSA compound. Construction was designed to enlarge and modernize the structures. Work was undertaken a year after North Korea finished replacing four JSA guard posts on its side of the MDL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=65534 |title=South Korea to revamp DMZ towers |publisher=''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2009-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022163155/http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=65534 |archivedate=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 2018, during the high-level talks in Panmunjom, military officials of the rank of [[colonel]] from the two Koreas and Burke Hamilton, Secretary of the [[United Nations Command, Military Armistice Commission, Korea|UNC Military Armistice Commission]], announced measures to reduce conventional military threats, such as creating buffer zones along their land and sea boundaries and a no-fly zone above the border, removing 11 front-line guard posts by December, and [[demining]] sections of the Demilitarized Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kait8.com/2018/10/15/koreas-hold-high-level-peace-talks|title=Koreas agree to break ground on inter-Korean railroad|last=TONG-HYUNG|first=KIM|date=|work=Kait8.com|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villages==
[[Image:Propagandavillage.JPG|thumb|North Korean [[Kijŏng-dong]], seen from South Korea]]
Both North and South Korea maintain ''peace villages'' in sight of each other's side of the DMZ. In the South, [[Daeseong-dong]] is administered under the terms of the DMZ. Villagers are classed as Republic of Korea citizens, but are [[Tax exemption|exempt]] from paying tax and other civic requirements such as [[Conscription in South Korea|military service]]. In the North, [[Kijŏng-dong]] features a number of brightly painted, poured-concrete multi-story buildings and apartments with electric lighting. These features represented an unheard-of level of luxury for rural Koreans, North or South, in the 1950s. The town was oriented so that the bright blue roofs and white sides of the buildings would be the most distinguishing features when viewed from the border. However, based on scrutiny with modern telescopic lenses, it has been claimed the buildings are mere concrete shells lacking window glass or even interior rooms,&lt;ref name="potts"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Rolf|date=1999-02-03|title=Korea's No-man's-land|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/02/03/feature_115/|deadurl=no|journal=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|volume=|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215050040/http://www.salon.com/1999/02/03/feature_115/|archivedate=15 February 2013|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Tom.

{{Main|List of border incidents involving North and South Korea}}
Since demarcation, the DMZ has had numerous cases of incidents and incursions by both sides, although the North Korean government typically never acknowledges direct responsibility for any of these incidents (there are exceptions, such as the axe incident).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/crs/RL30004.pdf |title=North Korea: Chronology of Provocations, 1950 – 2003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905062431/http://www.fas.org/man/crs/RL30004.pdf |archivedate=5 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was particularly intense during the [[Korean DMZ Conflict (1966–1969)]] when a series of skirmishes along the DMZ resulted in the deaths of 43 [[US soldier|American]], 299 [[South Korean soldier|South Korean]] and 397 [[North Korean army|North Korean soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bolger|first=Daniel|title=Scenes from an Unfinished War: Low intensity conflict in Korea 1966–1969|publisher=Diane Publishing Co|isbn=978-0-7881-1208-9|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the [[Blue House raid|Blue House Raid]] in 1968, an attempt to [[Assassination|assassinate]] President [[Park Chung-hee|Park Chung Hee]] at the [[Blue House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/scenes/scen_c3.pdf |title=Scenes from an Unfinished War: Low-Intensity Conflict in Korea, 1966–1968 |publisher=Cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325103728/http://cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/scenes/scen_c3.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incursion tunnels===
{{See also|Tunnel warfare}}
Since 15 November 1974, South Korea has discovered four tunnels crossing the DMZ that had been dug by North Korea. The orientation of the blasting lines within each tunnel indicated they were dug by North Korea. North Korea claimed that the tunnels were for [[coal mining]]; however, no coal was found in the tunnels, which were dug through granite. Some of the tunnel walls were painted black to give the appearance of [[anthracite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jim|last=Sides|title=Almost Home|publisher=Xulon Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60791-740-3|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnels are believed to have been planned as a military invasion route by North Korea. They run in a north-south direction and do not have branches. Following each discovery, engineering within the tunnels has become progressively more advanced. For example, the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward, to prevent [[water stagnation]]. Today, visitors from the south may visit the second, third and fourth tunnels through guided tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demilitarized Zone |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/dmz.htm |accessdate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105034940/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/dmz.htm |archivedate=5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First tunnel====
The first of the tunnels was discovered on 20 November 1974, by a South Korean Army patrol, noticing steam rising from the ground. The initial discovery was met with [[Automatic firearm|automatic fire]] from North Korean soldiers. Five days later, during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel, [[United States Navy|US Navy]] Commander Robert M. Ballinger and [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|ROK Marine Corps]] Major Kim Hah-chul were killed in the tunnel by a North Korean explosive device. The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command.

The tunnel, which was about {{convert|3|by|4|ft|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, extended more than {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} beyond the MDL into South Korea. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete slabs and had electric power and lighting. There were [[Weapon storage area|weapon storage]] and sleeping areas. A [[narrow-gauge railway]] with carts had also been installed. Estimates based on the tunnel's size suggest it would have allowed considerable numbers of soldiers to pass through it.&lt;ref name=bermudez_js&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621051225/http://www.korean-war.com/Archives/2002/02/msg00289.html |archivedate=2013-06-21 |url=http://www.korean-war.com/Archives/2002/02/msg00289.html |title=Tunnels under the DMZ |author=Bermudez, Joseph S. Jr |accessdate=2010-03-26 |website=korean-war.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second tunnel====
[[File:Entrance to the 4th Infiltration Tunnel, Korean DMZ.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the North Korean-dug 4th Infiltration Tunnel, Korean DMZ]]
The second tunnel was discovered on 19 March 1975. It is of similar length to the first tunnel. It is located between {{convert|50|and|160|m|ft|abbr=on}} below ground, but is larger than the first, approximately {{convert|2|by|2|m|ft|0|sp=us|abbr=in}}.

====Third tunnel====
{{main|Third Tunnel of Aggression}}
The third tunnel was discovered on 17 October 1978. Unlike the previous two, the third tunnel was discovered following a tip from a [[North Korean defectors|North Korean defector]]. This tunnel is about {{convert|1600|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|73|m|ft|abbr=on}} below ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Martin|title=Seoul|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-774-5|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft.

====Fourth tunnel====
A fourth tunnel was discovered on 3 March 1990, north of [[Haean]] town in the former [[Punchbowl, Korea|Punchbowl]] battlefield. The tunnel's dimensions are {{convert|2|by|2|m|ft|0|sp=us|abbr=in}}, and it is {{convert|145|m|ft}} deep. The method of construction is almost identical in structure to the second and the third tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panmunjomtour.com/english/dmz/dmz_20.htm |title=The Fourth Infiltration Tunnel |publisher=Panmunjom Travel Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309084651/http://www.panmunjomtour.com/english/dmz/dmz_20.htm |archivedate= 9 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean Wall===
[[File:The Korean Wall in the DMZ.JPG|thumb|The Korean Wall, or anti-tank barrier, in the [[demilitarized zone]] seen through binoculars from the North Korean side.]]
According to North Korea, between 1977 and 1979 the South Korean and United States authorities constructed a concrete wall along the DMZ.&lt;ref name="tetteroo"/&gt; North Korea, however, began to propagate information about the wall after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, when the symbolism of a wall [[Injustice|unjustly]] dividing a people became more apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzinger|first=Caroline|translator-last=Lempinen|translator-first=Ulla|title=Terveisiä pahan akselilta: Arkea ja politiikkaa maailman suljetuimmissa valtioissa|year=2008|publisher=Atena|location=Jyväskylä|language=fi|isbn=978-951-796-521-7|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various organizations, such as the North Korean tour guide company Korea Konsult, claimed a wall was dividing Korea, saying that:

{{quote|In the area south of the Military Demarcation Line, which cuts across Korea at its waist, there is a concrete wall which ... stretches more than {{convert|240|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from east to west, is {{convert|5|-|8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|10|-|19|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} thick at the bottom, and {{convert|3|-|7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide in the upper part. It is set with wire entanglements and dotted with gun embrasures, look-outs and varieties of military establishments.&lt;!-- not in citation: [...] the South Korean rulers built this wall over a period of many years from 1977.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DMZ: Demilitarized Zone|url=http://koreakonsult.net/Attraction_DMZ_eng.html|publisher=''Korea Konsult''|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In December 1999, Chu Chang-jun, [[China–North Korea relations|North Korea's ambassador to China]], repeated claims that a "wall" divided Korea.

The North Korean side of the DMZ primarily serves to defend North Korea from invasion by South Korean forces.

The Civilian Control Line is a line that designates an additional buffer zone to the DMZ within a distance of {{Convert|5|to|20|km|lk=|abbr=on}} from the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ. Its purpose is to limit and control the entrance of civilians into the area in order to protect and maintain the security of military facilities and operations near the DMZ. The commander of the [[Eighth United States Army|8th US Army]] ordered the creation of the CCL and it was activated and first became effective in February 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourdmz.com/english/02dmz/p2-1.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225025507/http://www.tourdmz.com/english/02dmz/p2-1.php |archivedate=25 February 2017 }} Retrieved 10 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The buffer zone that falls south of the Southern Limit Line is called the Civilian Control Zone. Barbed wire fences and manned military [[Guardpost|guard posts]] mark the Civilian Control Line. The Civilian Control Zone is necessary for the military to monitor civilian travel to tourist destinations close to the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ like the discovered infiltration tunnels and tourist observatories. Usually when traveling within the Civilian Control Zone, South Korean soldiers accompany tourist buses and cars as armed guards to monitor the civilians as well as to protect them from North Korean intruders.

Right after the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|ceasefire]], the Civilian Control Zone outside the DMZ encompassed 100 or so empty villages. The government implemented migration measures to attract settlers into the area. As a result, in 1983, when the area delineated by the Civilian Control Line was at its largest, a total of 39,725 residents in 8,799 households were living in the 81 villages located within the Civilian Control Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/user/0003/nd6245.do?View&amp;boardNo=00000415&amp;pubLang=English&amp;pubYear=2016&amp;pubMonth=AUTUMN&amp;zineInfoNo=0003|title=Kor|last=|first=|date=|website=Koreana: Korean culture &amp; arts|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=November 2018}}

Most of the tourist and media photos of the "DMZ fence" are actually photos of the CCL fence. The actual DMZ fence on the Southern Limit Line is completely [[Limited-access road|off-limits]] to everybody except soldiers and it is illegal to take pictures of the DMZ fence. The CCL fence acts more as a deterrent for South Korean civilians from getting too close to the dangerous DMZ and is also the final barrier for North Korean [[Infiltration tactics|infiltrators]] if they get past the Southern Limit Line DMZ fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/277646914_fig1_Figure-1-A-map-of-the-study-site-presenting-the-location-of-Military-Demarcation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312055444/https://www.researchgate.net/figure/277646914_fig1_Figure-1-A-map-of-the-study-site-presenting-the-location-of-Military-Demarcation |archivedate=12 March 2017 }} / up-close map of CCL/CCZ/Southern Limit Line.

==Neutral Zone of the Han River Estuary==
The whole estuary of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] is deemed a "Neutral Zone" and is off-limits to all civilian vessels and is treated like the rest of the DMZ. Only [[Military vessel|military vessels]] are allowed within this neutral zone.

According to the July 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] civil [[Freight transport|shipping]] was supposed to be permissible in the Han River estuary and allow Seoul to be connected to the [[Yellow Sea]] (West Sea) via the Han River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/korea/kwarmagr072753.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305164517/http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/korea/kwarmagr072753.html |archivedate=5 March 2014 }} Article 1, Section 5. Retrieved 11 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; However, both Koreas and the UNC failed to make this happen. The South Korean government ordered the construction of the [[Ara Canal]] to finally connect [[Seoul]] to the Yellow Sea, which was completed in 2012. Seoul was effectively landlocked from the ocean until 2012. The biggest limitation of the Ara Canal is it is too narrow to handle any vessels except small tourist boats and recreational boats, so Seoul still cannot receive large commercial ships or passenger ships in its port.

In recent years [[China|Chinese]] fishing vessels have taken advantage of the tense situation in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] Estuary Neutral Zone and illegally fished in this area due to both the [[Korean People's Navy|North Korean]] and [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korean]] navies never patrolling this area due to the fear of naval battles breaking out.

==Castle of Gung Ye==
Within the DMZ itself, in the town of [[Cheorwon]], is the old capital of the kingdom of [[Taebong]] (901–918), a regional upstart that became [[Goryeo]], the dynasty that ruled a [[History of Korea|united Korea]] from 918 to 1392.

[[Taebong]] was founded by the charismatic leader [[Gung Ye]], a brilliant if tyrannical one-eyed ex-[[Buddhist monk]]. Rebelling against the kingdom of [[Silla]], Korea's then ruling dynasty, he proclaimed the kingdom of [[Taebong]]—also called Later Goguryeo, in reference to the ancient kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (37BCE-668CE)—in 901, with himself as king. The kingdom consisted of much of central Korea, including areas around the DMZ. He placed his capital in [[Cheorwon]], a mountainous region that was easily defensible (in the Korean War, this same region would earn the name "the [[Iron Triangle (Korea)|Iron Triangle]]").

As a former Buddhist monk, [[Gung Ye]] actively promoted the religion of [[Buddhism]] and incorporated Buddhist ceremonies into the new kingdom. Even after Gung Ye was [[Dethroning|dethroned]] by his own generals and replaced by [[Wang Geon]], the man who would rule over a united Korea as the first king of [[Goryeo]], this Buddhist influence would continue, playing a major role in shaping the culture of medieval Korea.

As the ruins of Gung Ye's capital lie in the DMZ itself, visitors cannot see them. Moreover, excavation work and research have been hampered by political realities. In the future, inter-Korean peace may allow for proper archaeological studies to be conducted on the castle site and other historical sites within and underneath the DMZ.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler, Rober.

[[Panmunjeom]] is the site of the negotiations that ended the Korean War and is the main center of human activity in the DMZ.  The village is located on the main highway and near a railroad connecting the two Koreas.

The railway, which connects Seoul and [[Pyongyang]], was called the [[Gyeongui Line]] before division in the 1940s.  Currently the South uses the original name, but the North refers to the route as the P'yŏngbu Line. The railway line has been mainly used to carry materials and South Korean workers to the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]]. Its reconnection has been seen as part of the general improvement in the relations between North and South in the early part of this century. However, in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway amid growing tensions with the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/northkorea/Last-train-to-Kaesong-as.4744792.jp|title=Last train to Kaesong as Korean relations cool|date=2008-11-28|publisher=News.Scotman.Com|location=Edinburgh|first=Jae-Soon|last=Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of former [[President of South Korea|South Korean President]] [[Kim Dae-jung]], conciliatory talks were held between South Korean officials and a North Korean delegation who attended Kim's funeral. In September 2009, the Kaesong rail and road crossing was reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/375550.html |title=Inter-Korean economic cooperation Kaesong office reopens |publisher=Englishhani |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722143648/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/375550.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road at Panmunjeom, which was known historically as ''Highway One'' in the South, was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula. Passage is comparable to the strict movements that occurred at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] in Berlin at the height of the [[Cold War]]. Both North and South Korea's roads end in the JSA; the highways do not quite join as there is a {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} concrete line that divides the entire site. People given the rare permission to cross this border must do so on foot before continuing their journey by road.

In 2007, on the east coast of Korea, the first train crossed the DMZ on the new [[Donghae Bukbu Line|Donghae Bukbu (Tonghae Pukpu) Line]]. The new rail crossing was built adjacent to the road which took South Koreans to [[Mount Kumgang Tourist Region]], a region of significant cultural importance for all Koreans. More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed following the shooting of a 53-year-old South Korean tourist in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2008-07/12/content_6839889.htm |title=ROK woman tourist shot dead at DPRK resort |publisher=''[[China Daily]]'' |date=2008-07-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217140840/http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2008-07/12/content_6839889.htm |archivedate=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[Joint investigation team|joint investigation]] was rebuffed by North Korea, the South Korean government suspended tours to the resort.

On October 14, 2018, North and South Korea, agreed to meet the summit's goal of restoring railway and road transportation which had been cut since the Korean War by either late November or early December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-southkorea/koreas-to-reconnect-roads-rail-u-s-concerned-over-easing-sanctions-idUSKCN1MP0D0&lt;/ref&gt; Road and railway transportation along the DMZ was reconnected in November 2018.&lt;ref name=nov22kr /&gt;&lt;ref name=nov22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nov30 /&gt;

==Nature reserve==
In the past half century, the Korean DMZ has been a deadly place for humans, making habitation impossible. Only around the village of [[Panmunjom]] and more recently the Donghae Bukbu Line on Korea's east coast have there been regular incursions by people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/13/wildlife-thriving-korean-demilitarised-zone |title=How wildlife is thriving in the Korean peninsula's demilitarised zone |first=Lisa |last=Brady |date=13 April 2012 |publisher= |via=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905181630/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/13/wildlife-thriving-korean-demilitarised-zone |archivedate=5 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/ice/DMZ.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520080629/http://www1.american.edu/TED/ice/DMZ.HTM |archivedate=20 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural isolation along the {{convert|250|km|abbr=on}} length of the DMZ has created an [[involuntary park]] which is now recognized as one of the most well-preserved areas of temperate [[habitat]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; In 1966 it was first proposed that the DMZ be turned into a [[national park]].&lt;ref name="Paige 1967"/&gt;

Several [[Endangered species|endangered animal and plant species]] now exist among the heavily fortified fences, [[landmines]] and listening posts. These include the endangered [[red-crowned crane]] (a staple of Asian art), the [[white-naped crane]], and, potentially, the extremely rare [[Siberian tiger]],&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/08/22/korea.bio.dmz/ |title=Korea's DMZ: The thin green line |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2009-07-30 |date=2003-08-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805110227/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/08/22/korea.bio.dmz/ |archivedate=5 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amur leopard]], and [[Asiatic black bear]].

The DMZ owes its varied [[biodiversity]] to its geography, which crosses mountains, prairies, swamps, lakes, and tidal marshes. [[Environmentalist|Environmentalists]] hope that the DMZ will be conserved as a [[nature reserve|wildlife refuge]], with a well-developed set of objective and management plans vetted and in place. In 2005, [[CNN]] founder and [[media mogul]] [[Ted Turner]], on a visit to North Korea, said that he would financially support any plans to turn the DMZ into a peace park and a UN-protected [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-11-18-turnerdmz_x.htm |title=Ted Turner: Turn Korean DMZ into peace park |publisher=USA TODAY |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206190920/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-11-18-turnerdmz_x.htm |archivedate=6 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, South Korea submitted a nomination form to [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]] (MAB) in [[UNESCO]] for designation of {{convert|435|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the southern part of the DMZ below the Military Demarcation Line, as well as {{convert|2979|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} in privately controlled areas, as a Biosphere Reserve according to the Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="Nomination of Korea DMZ Biosphere Reserve"&gt;{{cite web|last=Choi |first=Chungil |title=Nomination of Korea DMZ Biosphere Reserve |url=ftp://ftp.unesco.org/upload/sc/Advisory_Cttee2012/New%20BRs/Korea/DMZ/Letter%20of%20endorsement-DMZ.pdf |accessdate=3 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=Al83tito |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MAB National Committee of the Republic of Korea mentioned only the southern part of DMZ to be nominated since there was no response from [[Pyongyang]] when it requested Pyongyang to push jointly. North Korea is a member nation of the international coordinating council of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme, which designates Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="Seoul to seek UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status for DMZ"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim |first=Jeong-su |title=Seoul to seek UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status for DMZ |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/540913.html |accessdate=3 October 2012 |newspaper=Hankyoreh |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722081415/http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/540913.html |archivedate=22 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea opposed the application as a violation of the armistice agreement during the council's meeting in Paris on July 9 to 13, 2011. The South Korean government's attempt to designate the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was turned down at UNESCO's MAB council meeting in Paris in July 2012. Pyongyang expressed its opposition by sending letters to 32 council member countries, except for South Korea, and the UNESCO headquarters a month prior to the meeting. At the council meeting, Pyongyang said the designation violated the Armistice Agreement.&lt;ref name="Biosphere reserve status for the DMZ is urgent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cho |first=Do-soon |title=Biosphere reserve status for the DMZ is urgent |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2957816 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |newspaper=JoonAng Daily |date=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621051310/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2957816 |archivedate=21 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction of Guard Posts==
On October 26, 2018, South Korean Major Gen. Kim Do-gyun and North Korean general Lt. Gen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1453">"'''Labour is not a commodity'''" is the principle expressed in the preamble to the [[International Labour Organization]]'s founding documents. It expresses the view that people should not be treated like inanimate [[commodities]], [[Human capital|capital]], another mere [[factor of production]], or [[Human resources|resources]]. Instead, people who work for a living should be treated as [[human being]]s and accorded [[dignity]] and respect.

Since taking office as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[President of the United States]] in January 2017, [[Donald Trump]] has granted [[executive clemency]] to a number of individuals.

== Definitions ==

As granted by the [[United States Constitution]], "executive clemency may take several forms, including [[Pardon#Pardons and clemency in the United States|pardon]], [[commutation of sentence]], remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/pardon/index.html|title=USDOJ: Office of the Pardon Attorney|publisher=[[USDOJ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''pardon'' is an executive order granting clemency for a past conviction, the sentence of which has already been completed. Its practical effect is the restoration of civil rights and statutory disabilities (e.g., firearm rights, occupational licensing, etc.) associated with a past criminal conviction.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/pardon/faq.htm#1|title=USDOJ: Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Executive Clemency|publisher=USDOJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''commutation'' is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;

== Constitutional authority ==

{{See also|Powers of the President of the United States}}

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the [[United States Constitution]] gives the president the power of [[clemency]]. The two most commonly used clemency powers are those of [[pardon]] and [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]]. A pardon is an official forgiveness for an acknowledged crime. Once a pardon is issued, all punishment for the crime is waived. The person accepting the pardon must, however, acknowledge that the crime did take place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon_instructions.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The president can only grant pardons for federal offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions-concerning-executive-clemency#0|title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Executive Clemency {{!}} PARDON {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president maintains the [[Office of the Pardon Attorney]] in the U.S. Department of Justice to review all requests for pardons. The president can also commute a sentence which, in effect, changes the punishment to time served. While the guilty party may be released from custody or not have to serve out a prison term, all other punishments still apply.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Most pardons are issued as oversight of the judicial branch, especially in cases where the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines|Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] are considered too severe. This power can check the legislative and judicial branches by altering punishment for crimes. Presidents can issue blanket [[amnesty]] to forgive entire groups of people. For example, President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] [[draft dodgers]] who had [[Canada and the Vietnam War|fled to Canada]]. Presidents can also issue temporary suspensions of prosecution or punishment in the form of [[respite (law)|respites]]. This power is most commonly used to delay federal sentences of execution.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''''Lorain Journal Co. v. United States''''', 342 U.S. 143 (1951),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lorain Journal Co. v. United States|volume=342|page=143|pin=|year=1951}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] often cited as an example of a monopolization violation being based on unilateral denial of access to an [[essential facility]], although it in fact involved concerted action.&lt;ref&gt;See. e.g., [[Robert Pitofsky]], Donna Patterson, and Jonathan Hooks, [http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/346 ''The Essential Facilities Doctrine Under United States Antitrust Law''], 70 {{smallcaps|Antitrust}} L.J. 443, 446–47 (2002) (characterizing it as "a unilateral refusal to deal" case). Actually, ''Lorain Journal'' involved agreements with reluctantly acquiescent customers that they would not deal with a competitive radio station, as explained in the ''Background'' section.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''[[Lorain Journal]]'''s monopoly over advertising in the [[Lorain, Ohio]] area was threatened by the establishment of a competing radio station, the Journal's publisher refused to accept advertising from those who advertised over the radio station and required them to advertise only in the Journal. The purpose of the publisher was to eliminate the competition of the radio station.  The Supreme Court held that the publisher had attempted to monopolize trade and commerce, in violation of §&amp;nbsp;2 of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], and was properly enjoined from continuing the conduct.

==Background==

The defendant The Lorain Journal Company published a newspaper here called the Journal. For some years, the Journal maintained "a commanding and an overpowering" position in the area. It reached 99% of the families in the city. It was the only daily newspaper. It carried a substantial amount of local and national advertising.&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1948, the Journal enjoyed a monopoly "of the mass dissemination of news and advertising, both of a local and national character." In 1948, however, the FCC licensed the Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Company to operate a radio station, WEOL, in the Elyria, Oberlin, and Lorain, Ohio area. Many of the local advertisers in the Journal wanted to use WEOL as well. The Journal developed a plan to eliminate the competition from WEOL. The Journal refused to accept local advertisements in the Journal from any Lorain County advertiser who advertised or who appeared to be about to advertise over WEOL.&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Journal monitored WEOL programs to determine the identity of the station's local Lorain advertisers. Those using the station had their contracts with the Journal terminated, and were able to renew them only after ceasing to advertise through WEOL. As a result, many Lorain County merchants either ceased advertising or abandoned their plans to advertise over WEOL. The district court found that "the very existence of WEOL is imperiled by this attack upon one of its principal sources of business and income."&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court therefore found a violation of §&amp;nbsp;2 of the Sherman Act and enjoined the Journal from continuing its program of refusing to deal with advertisers who advertised in  WEOL and of requiring advertisers to advertise only in the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Lorain Journal Co. |vol=92 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=794 |pinpoint= |court=N.D. Ohio |date=1950 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1803264/united-states-v-lorain-journal-co/ |accessdate=2017-09-28 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher appealed to the Supreme Court.

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

[[File:Harold Burton.jpg|thumb|175px|Justice Harold Burton delivered the opinion of the Court]]

Justice [[Harold H. Burton]] delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court that the Journal's publisher attempted to monopolize in violation of §&amp;nbsp;2 of the Sherman Act and was properly enjoined from continuing to do so.

The Court found the most important among the facts supporting the district court's judgment to be that the Journal enjoyed a nearly complete monopoly in Lorain from 1933 to 1948, together with a 99% coverage of all Lorain families. "Those factors made the Journal an indispensable medium of advertising for many Lorain concerns." Accordingly, the Journal's:

&lt;blockquote&gt; refusals to print Lorain advertising for those using WEOL for like advertising often amounted to an effective prohibition of the use of WEOL for that purpose. Numerous Lorain advertisers wished to supplement their local newspaper advertising with local radio advertising, but could not afford to discontinue their newspaper advertising in order to use the radio.&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court said it was clear that "if all the newspapers in a city, in order to monopolize the dissemination of news and advertising by eliminating a competing radio station, conspired to accept no advertisements from anyone who advertised over that station," their boycott conspiracy would violate §§&amp;nbsp;1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, since that was held in such cases as ''[[Fashion Originators' Guild v. FTC]]''. The Court continued, "It is consistent with that result to hold here that a single newspaper, already enjoying a substantial monopoly in its area, violates the 'attempt to monopolize' clause of §&amp;nbsp;2 when it uses its monopoly to destroy threatened competition."&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal sought to excuse its conduct on the ground that it has a "right as a private business concern to select its customers and to refuse to accept advertisement from whomever it pleases." The Court said that such a right is not unqualified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right claimed by the publisher is neither absolute nor exempt from regulation. Its exercise a purposeful means of monopolizing interstate commerce is prohibited by the Sherman Act. The operator of the radio station, equally with the publisher of the newspaper, is entitled to the protection of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentary==

● A Note in the ''Virginia Law Review'' focused on the fact that the Court found an attempted monopolization of interstate commerce even though the Journal attempted to monopolize the advertising of local merchants only and did not refuse or try to monopolize the business of national advertisers because of their dealings with the radio station:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this sense the monopoly was confined to the limits of a single city. This was nevertheless a forbidden monopoly, as the successful destruction of competition in local business by forcing the station to close would also have destroyed competition in interstate business, i.e., the national advertising carried by both the newspaper and the radio station. Thus the case is useful to point out again that the suppression of local competition is not free from the threat of prosecution under the Sherman Act simply because an intrastate and not an interstate monopoly is contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/valr38&amp;id=406&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=Lorain%20Journal%20Co.%20v.%20United%20States&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor=25 Note]. 38 {{smallcaps|Va.

● Charles Barber points to a contradiction or disconnect in the case law regarding specific intent in cases of this type. In ''Lorain Journal'', especially as interpreted in ''[[Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;345 U.S. 594 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; the specific intent behind the refusal to deal—a purpose to eliminate a competitor—or a purpose to create or maintain a monopoly—was a major theme in finding a §&amp;nbsp;2 Sherman Act violation.&lt;ref&gt;See Charles F. Barber,  [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7730&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Refusals To Deal Under the Federal Antitrust Laws''], 103 U. {{smallcaps|Pa. L. Rev.}} 847, 862, 866 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Lorain Journal'', the district court had found that the purpose and intent of the Journal's refusals to sell "was to destroy the broadcasting company." In ''Times-Picayune'', the Court held that monopolization did not occur because there was no showing of specific intent to destroy competition or build monopoly, and the newspaper's challenged practice was legal; because it was predominantly motivated "by legitimate business aims."&lt;ref&gt;345 U.S. at 622.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court distinguished the ''Lorain Journal'' case on the ground that there the newspaper's refusal to sell space to advertisers who advertised on the local radio station manifested "bold, relentless, and predatory commercial behavior,"&lt;ref&gt;See 342 U.S. at 149.&lt;/ref&gt; which was absent in the ''Times-Picayune'' case. Barber maintains that the Court's "emphasis on specific intent suggests that it regarded this as controlling" on the monopolization issue.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, at 866.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Barber insists, ''United States v. Griffith'',&lt;ref&gt;334 U.S. 100 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; which is  quoted in both ''Lorain Journal'' and ''Times-Picayune'', "held that specific intent is no longer an element of the offense of monopolization under Section 2." &lt;ref&gt;Barber, at 870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber therefore concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cases reviewed above indicate that the courts are groping for an appropriate rationale of the monopoly provisions of the Sherman Act which, while limiting the freedom of a trader unduly to exploit trade advantages stemming from his market position, will assure the preservation of his essential freedom to develop his business, including his supplier and customer relationships, in accordance with his personal business judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, at 872.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

● Donald Turner observed in the ''Harvard Law Review'' that the Supreme Court was "unquestionably correct" in holding the Journal's conduct an unlawful attempt to monopolize under section 2 of the Sherman Ac. Nonetheless, if the Court had been asked to do so, it could properly "also have held that each seller [merchant contracting for advertisements] who complied with Lorain Journal's demands became party to an agreement with Lorain Journal to boycott the radio station." The only problem with holding that would be "the seeming unfairness of subjecting the coerced sellers to criminal penalties." It would be a mistake, however, Turner argued, to hold (as in ''[[Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States]]''&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. 208 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;  or ''[[United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. 29 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;)     
"that the sellers, each being aware that others would also cease patronizing the radio station, have agreed ''with each other'' to carry on a collective boycott [emphasis added]." The reason is that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he decision of each seller was apparently wholly independent of the decisions of the others; each decision simply reflected an economic choice, forced by the newspaper's policy, as to which advertising medium could be dispensed with at least cost, a choice wholly unaffected by what other sellers might choose to do.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. Turner, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/hlr75&amp;div=47&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals ''The Definition of Agreement under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal,'' 75 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev.}}] 655, 700 (Feb. 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Interstate Circuit'', for example, "there was ample evidence .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to support a finding of horizontal agreement of the most obvious sort, including the significant evidence that the consequence of imposing limitations on the movie chains' subsequent-run competitors had been to increase not only the profits of the chains but also the profits of each distributor."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Lorain Journal'' case, each acquiescent merchant "ended up worse off than before." Such an agreement "would be an odd sort of agreement." In such a case it would be more sensible to proceed against the instigating party [who] has coerced those with whom he dealt" under a theory of attempted monopolization, as the Court did in the ''Lorain Journal'' case.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 701.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Turner emphasizes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''Lorain Journal'', for example, the principal culprit was clearly the newspaper which instigated the boycott of the radio station. The advertisers who dealt with the paper, and who acquiesced in its demands, were unwilling participants. Moreover, the situation can be remedied, as indeed it was in ''Lorain Journal'', by [the government's] proceeding against the instigator alone; freed of the unlawful pressures, the other parties would presumably revert to the nonrestrictive decisions they made before. These considerations might well and properly be taken into account by an enforcement agency in deciding whom to charge and whom not to charge with a violation of the act.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 702.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Colonne du Congrès Bxl.01.JPG|thumb|The Congress column in [[Brussels]]]]
The '''National Congress''' ({{lang-fr|Congrès national}}, {{lang-nl|Nationaal Congres}}) was a temporary [[legislative assembly]] in 1830, established shortly after the [[Provisional Government of Belgium|Belgian Provisional Government]] had proclaimed national independence following the [[Belgian Revolution]]. Its primary task was to create a [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]] for the newly formed state.

==History==
The National Congress was [[Belgian general election, 1830|elected by approximately 30,000 voters on 3 November 1830]] and consisted of 200 members. Its president was Baron [[Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier]].

The assembly chose a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[popular monarchy]] as the form of government for Belgium and chose the son of the [[July Monarchy|French]] King [[Louis-Philippe]], [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|Louis, Duke of Nemours]], as the new head of state. Other candidates included [[Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg|Auguste de Beauharnais]] and [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles of Austria]], younger brother of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and the last [[Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governor-General]] of the [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionisme.be/cn18310203.htm#surlet2 |title=Congrès national de Belgique. Séance du 3 février 1831 |publisher=Unionisme.be |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The choice of Louis of Nemours, was unacceptable to the government of the [[United Kingdom]] and another candidate had to be found. Surlet de Chokier was appointed [[Regent]] while awaiting a new decision and was replaced as president of the National Congress by [[Etienne Constantin, Baron de Gerlache]]. [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] was definitively chosen to become the first [[King of the Belgians]]. The National Congress appointed him king on 4 June and six weeks later he was sworn in by swearing allegiance to the Belgian constitution in front of the [[Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg|Saint Jacques Church]] on [[Coudenberg]] in [[Brussels]]. This day (21 July) has since been the [[Belgian National Day|National holiday]] for Belgium.

The [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution of 1831]], which was very progressive for its time, was accepted on 7 February 1831. The Provisional Government was subsequently dismantled. The National Congress itself remained in place until the [[Belgian general election, 1831|official elections of a first Parliament on 29 August 1831]]. A monument in Brussels, the [[Congress Column]], was erected in its honour. On the base of the Congress-column, there are four bronze statues that represent the four basic freedoms enshrined in the Constitution of 1831: freedom of [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of association|association]], [[freedom of education|education]] and [[freedom of the press|the press]].

These four basic freedoms are also reflected in the streets of [[Brussels]]. There are four streets that lead to the ''Place de la Liberté/Vrijheidsplein'' (Freedom Square): the ''Rue des Cultes/Eredienststraat'' (Religion Street), the ''Rue de l'Association/Verenigingsstraat'' (Association Street), the ''Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtstraat'' (Education Street) and the ''Rue de la Presse/Drukpersstraat'' (Press Street).

'''Parole''' in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA) of the [[United States]] generally refers to any [[Alien_(law)#United_States|alien]] who is under the [[wikt:supervision#English|supervision]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). Any alien who is inadmissible to the United States may apply for [[advance parole]] ([[Form I-131]]), which is also known as "humanitarian parole," and when granted allows the alien to stay in the country until the document expires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-or-significant-public-benefit-parole-individuals-outside-united-states |title=Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole for Individuals Outside the United States |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanitarian parole is granted only in [[exceptional circumstances]] and on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the DHS.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/14/nyregion/14orphan.html Nina Bernstein, "A Contest of Suffering, With the U.S. as a Prize," October 14, 2005], accessed August 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Qasim''' ({{lang-ur|پیٹر قاسم}}) was the longest-serving detainee in [[Immigration detention in Australia|Australian immigration detention]], having been detained there for over seven years. He had not been [[deported]] because he was [[stateless person|stateless]]. He was detained at [[Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre]]&lt;ref name="srv"/&gt; before being transferred to an Adelaide psychiatric facility.&lt;ref name="lsd"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/06/20/1119119768388.html |title=Longest serving detainee offered new visa |accessdate=23 September 2012 |date=20 June 2005 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detention in Australia==
In personal accounts Qasim described escaping from his home village of Gopalla in India, into Pakistan, then through Singapore and Papua New Guinea onto Australia. Qasim's provenance, however, proved difficult to verify due to a lack of supporting documentation or witnesses. This lack of evidence, and numerous unsuccessful attempts to validate Qasim's story were primarily responsible for his prolonged period of detention.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.safecom.org.au/peter-qasim3.htm "Life in detention for seven years"] ''The Age''.

He was invited to apply for a new [[Visa (document)|visa]] on 20 June 2005. In 2005, Qasim was 31 years old, and was held at [[Baxter Detention Centre]] until, on 9 June 2005, he was moved to a psychiatric hospital.

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation Measures for the Ruddy-headed Goose''' is a Bilateral Environmental [[Memorandum of Understanding]] between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] and was concluded under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]]. The MoU was concluded as part of the Special Protocol on the Conservation of Wild Fauna and Flora, signed by Argentina and Chile in 2002, and entered into effect on 21 November 2006. It focuses on the protection of the mainland population of the ruddy-headed goose. The MoU is exclusively South American and covers two range States (Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile), both of which have signed.

== Development ==
To implement the decision of the Conference of the Parties of CMS to list the [[ruddy-headed goose]] (''Chloephaga rubidiceps'') on Appendix I and II of the Convention as a consequence of its endangered status and the conviction that conservation efforts of this species are dependent on collaboration between the two range States, an Article IV agreement was concluded and entered into effect on 21 November 2006.

Signatories to the Ruddy-headed Goose MoU:
* Argentine Republic (21 November 2006)
* Republic of Chile (21 November 2006)

== Aim ==
The continental population of the [[ruddy-headed goose]] is migratory and is in imminent danger of extinction because of the small size of its population, its restricted area of distribution, and the numerous threats which it faces in its breeding grounds in the continental area of the [[Magallanes Region]] (Chile), in the north of the Tierra de Fuego (Argentina and Chile) and in the wintering grounds in the South of [[Buenos Aires]] province (Argentina).&lt;ref&gt;IUCN Red List: http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/100600394/0&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the MoU aims to safeguard the mainland population of this species, which is in serious danger of extinction with an estimated size at around 900-1,000 individuals.

== Species covered ==
There are two populations of the ruddy-headed goose. The sedentary population is confined to the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas while the mainland one migrates between its breeding grounds in southern Patagonia of Chile and Argentina and its wintering quarters in southern Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The MoU protects only the mainland South American population of the ruddy-headed goose.

The ruddy-headed goose, which is the smallest [[Southern Hemisphere|austral]] goose inhabiting South America, faces several threats such as predation by the [[South American gray fox]], illegal hunting and habitat degradation. Furthermore, the ruddy-headed goose tends to congregate with other species considered pests by farmers and so it has been persecuted in the past, especially in the wintering grounds in the South of Buenos Aires province.

== Fundamental components ==
Conscious of the need to take immediate and concerted measures to prevent the extinction of the continental population of the species, both range States agree to:&lt;ref&gt;Text of the Ruddy-headed Goose Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/ruddy_goose/MoU_Ruddy_headed_goose_E_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Provide an effective protection of the continental population of the species in both countries in order to restore its populations to appropriate levels for its survival as well as identify and conserve those habitats which are essential for survival throughout its range
# Identify and monitor the factors and processes which have a detrimental effect on the conservation status of the species and recommend appropriate measures to regulate, manage and/or control the said factors and processes
# Elaborate with the support of the Scientific Council of the CMS Convention, an Action Plan
# Apply the provisions of the Action Plan
# Facilitate the exchange of scientific, technical and legal information necessary to coordinate conservation measures as well as cooperate with specialists and international organizations in the implementation of the Action Plan
# Submit, at least annually, a report on the development of the MoU to the CMS Secretaria
# Hold meetings alternately in the territories of the signatories to review the implementation of the Action Plan

The MoU became effective on 21 November 2006 and is valid for a duration of three years, renewable automatically for a similar term unless one of the two signatories gives three months’ prior written notice to the other of its decision to terminate it.

== Workshop and Action Plan ==
In November 2010, a workshop on the conservation of the declining ruddy-headed goose took place in [[Punta Arenas, Chile]]. The workshop reviewed the implementation of the MoU in the two countries and revised the bilateral Action Plan. During the workshop, the Action Plan, drawn up in 2009, was revised. The Action Plan provides a road map to guide the implementation of conservation action for the ruddy-headed goose in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Action Plan: http://www.cms.int/species/ruddy_goose/ruddy_goose_bkrd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secretariat ==
The secretariat functions are provided by the signatories on a rotational base. The CMS Secretariat only acts as depositary to the MoU.

== Activities and successes ==
Several activities have been undertaken in Chile including hunting controls and other protection measures in breeding areas. In Argentina, activities take place in the framework of a national strategy for the conservation and management of the ruddy-headed goose, ashy-headed goose and the upland goose; and these include an education programme and a monitoring programme in the wintering areas. New regulations approved in Argentina in May 2011 prohibit hunting, capture and trade in respect of five goose species including the ruddy-headed goose.

Wetlands Internationals, CMS and the Dirección de Fauna Silvestre produced a leaflet entitled “El Cauquén colorado – una especie en peligro de extinction” (the ruddy-headed goose – a species in danger of extinction).&lt;ref&gt;Leaflet “El Cauquén colorado – una especie en peligro de extinction” (the ruddy-headed goose – a species in danger of extinction): http://www.cms.int/publications/pdf/Cauquen_colorado.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a decreasing trend in the density of individuals, the co-organization and participation in workshops and the development of a National Conservation Plan for the species successfully increased cooperation between the MoU’s signatories. Also, close work with farmers, government officers and other local stakeholders was vital in reducing the persecution and hunting of the species. Furthermore, the reactivation of a ruddy-headed goose forum, the participation in TV and radio interviews, the printing of brochures and books on the species significantly raised the awareness of the locals of the importance of the RHG in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56827">The '''SCO–Linux disputes''' are a series of legal and public disputes between the [[software]] company [[SCO Group]] (SCO) and various [[Linux]] vendors and users.  The SCO Group alleges that its license agreements with IBM means that [[source code]] that IBM wrote and donated to be incorporated into Linux was added in violation of SCO's contractual rights.  Members of the Linux community disagree with SCO's claims; [[IBM]], [[Novell]] and [[Red Hat]] have ongoing claims against SCO.

On August 10, 2007, a federal district court judge in ''SCO v. Novell'' ruled on summary judgment that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system. The court also ruled that "SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent". After the ruling Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated "We don't believe there is Unix in Linux".&lt;ref name="doc377"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf|title=MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER Civil Case No. 2:04CV139DAK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Montalbano |first= Elizabeth | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135959-c,unix/article.html | title= Novell Won't Pursue Unix Copyrights| publisher = PC World | date= 2007-08-15 | accessdate= 2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Says Unix Copyrights Rightfully Belong to Novell |publisher = New York Times|date = 2007-08-11| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/technology/11novell.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15 | first=John | last=Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gl070810&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Rules: Novell owns the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights!

The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement.&lt;ref name="Novell August 2009"/&gt;

{{SCO Controversy}}

==Overview==
[[Unix]] is a major computer [[operating system]], developed in the [[United States of America]].  Prior to the events of this case, the [[intellectual property rights]] (IP) in Unix were held by [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL), part of [[AT&amp;T]], but the area of IP ownership was complex.  By 2003, the rights in Unix had been transferred several times and there was dispute as to the correct owner in law. Also some of the code within Unix had been written prior to the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], or was developed by third parties, or was developed or licensed under different licenses existing at the time. The [[software]] company [[SCO Group]] (SCO), formerly [[Caldera International]], asserted in 2003 that it was the owner of Unix, and that other unix-type operating systems - particularly the [[free software|free operating system]] [[Linux]] and other variants of Unix sold by competitor companies - were violating their intellectual property by using Unix code without a license in their works.

SCO initially claimed, and tried to assert, a legal means to litigate directly against all end-users of these operating systems as well as the companies or groups providing them - potentially a very substantial case and one that would [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|throw fear]] into the market about using them.  However it was unable to formulate such a case, since the Unix copyrights were weakly worded, there was no basis in patent law, and breach of trade secrets would only affect the one or few companies who might have been alleged to have disclosed trade secrets.  Lacking grounds to sue all users generally, SCO dropped this aspect of its cases.

The assertions were heavily contested. Claims of SCO's own copyright violations of these other systems were raised, along with claims related to SCO being bound by, or violating, the [[GPL]] licence, under which SCO conducted business related to these systems. Claims were also made that the case was substantially financed and promoted by [[Microsoft]] and investment businesses with links to Microsoft; around that time (1998 - 2004 onwards) Microsoft was fiercely engaged in various [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|FUD]] tactics such as its ''Get the facts'' campaign, that sought to undermine or discredit Linux as a possible competitor to its own [[Windows]] operating systems and server systems.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak]] for more detail&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Microsoft takes on the free world | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/ | publisher = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] via [[CNNMoney.com]] | first = Roger | last = Parloff | date = 2007-05-14 | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071109190233/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/ | archivedate = 2007-11-09 | df =  }}.

In the end, SCO launched only a few main legal cases - against [[IBM]] for improper disclosure and breach of copyright related to its [[AIX]] operating system, against [[Novell]] for interference (clouding the issue of ownership), against [[DaimlerChrysler]] for non-compliance with a demand to certify certain matters related to Unix usage, and against Linux business and former client [[AutoZone]] for violating SCO's rights by using Linux.  Separately, the Linux company [[Red Hat]] also filed a legal claim against SCO for making false claims that affected its (Red Hat's) business, and to seek a court declaration that SCO had no ownership rights in Linux code.

In 2007, a court ruled in ''SCO v. Novell'' that Novell and not SCO was the owner of the Unix copyrights. {{As of|2016}}, most of these cases have been resolved, or largely resolved, and none of the rulings have been in SCO's favor.

==Timeline and major cases==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
At the beginning of 2003, SCO claimed that there had been "misappropriation of its [[UNIX System V]] [[Source code|code]] into Linux". However, the company refused to identify the specific segments of code, claiming that it was a secret which they would reveal only to the court. They did say that the code could be found in the [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]], [[Read-copy-update|RCU]] and a few other parts of the [[Linux kernel]].

On 6 March 2003 they announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-991464.html|title=SCO sues Big Blue over Unix, Linux|date=11 March 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they were suing IBM for $1&amp;nbsp;billion, claiming that IBM transferred SCO [[trade secret]]s into Linux. That amount later rose to $3&amp;nbsp;billion, and then again to $5 billion.

Some educated parties{{Who|date=March 2011}} note that the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case had shown that the Unix copyrights are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed [[patent infringement]], as according to the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] database, no [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX [[trademark]] was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO was looking for something directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.

SCO now had little legal ground at this point and therefore began numerous legal claims and threats against many of the major names in the computer industry, including IBM, [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Microsoft]], Novell, [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and Red Hat.

By mid-2004, five major lawsuits had been filed:

* ''[[SCO v. IBM]]''
* ''[[Red Hat v. SCO]]''
* ''[[SCO v. Novell]]'' (not directly related to Linux, the suit has more to do with Unix copyrights)
* ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]''
* ''[[SCO-Linux controversies#SCO v. AutoZone|SCO v. AutoZone]]''

In cases SCO publicly implied that a number of other parties have committed copyright infringement, including not only Linux developers but also Linux users.

==UNIX SVRx==
SCO's claims are derived from several contracts that may have transferred UNIX System V Release 4 intellectual property assets.  The UNIX IP rights originated with [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL), a division of AT&amp;T.  In 1993, USL sold all UNIX rights and assets to Novell, including copyrights, trademarks, and active licensing contracts. Some of these rights and assets, plus additional assets derived from Novell's development work, were then sold to the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] in 1995.  The Santa Cruz Operation had developed and was selling a PC-based UNIX until 2000, when it then resold its UNIX assets to [[Caldera Systems]], which later reorganized into [[Caldera International]] and changed its name to [[SCO Group]].

Through this chain of sales, SCO claims to be the "owner of UNIX". The validity of these claims is hotly contested by others. SCO claims copyright to all UNIX code developed by USL, referred to as [[UNIX System V|SVRx]], and licensing contracts originating with AT&amp;T, saying that these are inherited through the same chain of sales. The primary document SCO presents as evidence of these claims is the "Asset Purchase Agreement",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/SCONovellAssetAg.pdf|title=in the original] or [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2003111023050367&amp;query=asset+purchase+agreement transcribed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining the sale between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. SCO says that this includes all copyrights to the UNIX code base and contractual rights to the licensing base. The other parties disagree.

===UNIX copyrights ownership===
The status of copyrights from USL is murky, since UNIX code is a compilation of elements with different copyright histories.  Some code was released without copyright notice before the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made copyright automatic.  This code may be in the [[public domain]] and not subject to copyright claims.  Other code is affected by the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case, and is covered by the [[BSD License]].

[[Groklaw]] uncovered an old settlement made between Unix System Laboratories (USL) and The University of California in the case of [[USL v. BSDi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/USLsettlement.pdf|title=The full settlement available from Groklaw's website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement ended a copyright infringement suit against the University for making [[BSD]] [[source code]] freely available that USL felt infringed their copyrights. The university filed a counter suit, saying that USL had taken BSD source code and put it in UNIX without properly acknowledging the university's copyright. This settlement muddies the question of SCO's ownership of major parts of the UNIX source code. This uncertainty is particularly significant in regard to SCO's claims against Linux, which uses some BSD code.

Novell challenges SCO's interpretation of the purchase agreement.  In response to a letter SCO sent to 1500 companies on May 12, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/pdf/5_12_03_sco-n.pdf May 12, 2003 letter to Novell Chairman and CEO Jack Messman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717052204/http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/pdf/5_12_03_sco-n.pdf |date=July 17, 2004 }} hosted by Novell.&lt;/ref&gt; Novell exchanged a series of letters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/legal.html Novell's Unique Legal Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806125142/http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/legal.html |date=August 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with SCO beginning in May 2003, claiming that the copyrights for the core UNIX System V were not included in the asset purchase agreement and are retained by Novell.  In October 2003, Novell registered those copyrights with the US Copyright Office.

In response to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a "[[slander of title]]" suit against Novell, ''[[SCO v. Novell]]''.  This claimed that Novell was interfering with their business activities by clouding the ownership of UNIX copyrights. SCO's claim for special damages was dismissed on June 9, 2004 for "failure to specifically plead special damages."&lt;ref name="kimbal_order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-29.pdf|title=Judge Kimbal's Order available from Groklaw's website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SCO was given 30 days "to amend its complaint to more specifically plead special damages". In the same ruling,  the judge stated that it was questionable whether or not the Asset Purchase Agreement transferred the relevant copyrights, reasoning that the ASA amendment by which SCO was claiming to have acquired those rights contained no transfer language in the form of "seller hereby conveys to buyer" and that it used ambiguous language when it came to the question of when and how and which rights were to be transferred.&lt;ref name="kimbal_order" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

SCO filed an amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed an answer to SCO's complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for numerous breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]]. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, as well as with numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly.

Novell also retained the right to audit SCO's Unix Licensing Business under the APA. Novell claims that SCO has not turned over vital information about the Microsoft, Sun, and Linux End User License Agreements, despite repeated demands by Novell for them to do so. Novell, in another claim that is part of their counter suit, is asking the court to compel SCO to allow Novell to perform this audit of SCO's Unix Business.

On August 10, 2007 Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf|title=Memorandum order and decision, document 377 in case 2:04CV139DAK], the court order on [[Groklaw]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="novell379"&gt;[https://www.novell.com/communities/coolsolutions/novell-statement-on-todays-sco-ruling/ Novell statement on today’s SCO ruling], Novell Open PR, 2007-08-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===License administration standing===
The Novell to Santa Cruz Operation Asset Purchase Agreement also involved the administration of some 6000 standing licensing agreements between various UNIX users and the previous owners.  These licensees include universities, software corporations and computer hardware companies. SCO's claimed ownership of the licenses has become an issue in three aspects of the SCO–Linux controversies. The first was the cancellation of IBM's license, the second was SCO's complaint against DaimlerChrysler (see ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]''), and the third is the derivative works claim of the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' case.

In May 2003, SCO canceled IBM's SVRx license to its version of UNIX, [[AIX operating system|AIX]].  This was based on SCO's claim of unrestricted ownership of the System V licensing contracts inherited from USL. IBM ignored the license cancellation, claiming that an amendment to the original license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031107212034397|title=Groklaw - Amendment X as Text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it "irrevocable."  In addition, as part of the Purchase Agreement, Novell retained certain rights of control over the administration of the licenses which were sold, including rights to act on SCO's behalf in some cases.  Novell exercised one of these rights by revoking SCO's cancellation of the IBM license.  SCO disputed the validity of both of these actions, and amended its ''SCO v. IBM'' complaint to include copyright infringement, based on IBM's continued sale and use of AIX without a valid SVRx license.

In December 2003, SCO demanded that all UNIX licensees certify some items, some related to the use of Linux, that were not provided for in the license agreement language.  Since DaimlerChrysler failed to respond, SCO filed the ''SCO v. DaimlerChrysler'' suit in March 2004.  All claims related to the certification demands were summarily dismissed by the court.

===Control of derivative works===
The third issue based on the UNIX licensees agreement is related to SCO's claims of control of derivative works.

Many UNIX licensees have added features to the core UNIX SVRx system and those new features contain computer code not in the original SVRx code base. In most cases, software copyright is owned by the person or company that develops the code. SCO, however, claims that the original licensing agreements define this new code as a [[derivative work]]. They also claim that they have the right to control and restrict the use and distribution of that new code.

These claims are the basis of ''SCO v. IBM''. SCO's initial complaint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/complaint3.06.03.html|title=The SCO Group v|website=sco.tuxrocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that IBM violated the original licensing agreement by not maintaining confidentiality with the new code, developed and copyrighted by IBM, and releasing it to the Linux project.

IBM claims that the license agreement (noted in the $Echo newsletter of April 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040211153230800|title=Groklaw - $ echo  April 1985|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent licenses defines derivative works as the developer's property.  This leaves IBM free to do as it wishes with its new code.  In August 2004, IBM filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  The motion stated that IBM has the right to do as it wishes with software not part of the original SVRx code. In February 2005, the motion was dismissed as premature, because discovery was not yet complete. IBM refiled this motion along with other summary judgment motions as noted below in September 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}&lt;!--WP:WEIGHT?--&gt;

===SCO allegations of copyright and trade secret violations===
SCO claims that Linux infringes SCO's [[copyright]], [[trade secrets]], and contractual rights. This claim is fundamental to the [[SCOsource]] program, where SCO has demanded that Linux users obtain licenses from SCOsource to be properly licensed to use the code in question. Exactly which parts of Linux are involved remains unclear as many of their claims are still under seal in the ''SCO v. IBM'' lawsuit.

SCO originally claimed in ''SCO v. IBM'' that IBM had violated trade secrets. But these alleged violations by IBM would not have involved Linux distributors or end users. SCO's trade secret claims were dropped by SCO in their amended complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/Doc-25.html|title=The SCO Group v|website=sco.tuxrocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO also claimed line-for-line literal copying of code from UNIX code files to Linux kernel files and obfuscated copying of code, but originally refused to publicly identify which code was in violation.  SCO submitted to the court evidence of their claims under seal but much of it was excluded from the case after it was challenged by IBM as not meeting the specificity requirements to be included.

These examples have fallen into two groups.  The first are segments of files or whole files alleged to originate in UNIX SVRx code such as the [[errno.h]] header file. The second group are files and materials contributed by IBM that originated with IBM development work associated with AIX and [[Dynix]], IBM's two UNIX products.

Each of these has a different set of issues. In order for copyright to be violated, several conditions must be met. First, the claimant must be able to show that they own the copyrights for the material in question. Second, all or a significant part of the source must be present in the infringing material. There must be enough similarity to show direct copying of material.

====SVRx code allegedly in Linux====
The issue of ownership of the SVRx code base was discussed [[SCO-Linux controversies#UNIX SVRx|above]].  Besides the unresolved issue of what was actually transferred from Novell to Santa Cruz Operation, there are also the portions of the SVRx code base that are covered by BSD copyrights or that are in the public domain.

SCO's first public disclosure of what they claim is infringing code was at [[The SCO Group#History|SCO Forum]] in August 2003.  The first, known as the [[Berkeley Packet Filter]], was distributed under the BSD License and is freely usable by anyone.  The second example was related to memory allocation functions, also released under the BSD License. It is no longer in the Linux code base.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perens, [http://perens.com/Articles/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html Analysis of SCO's Las Vegas Slide Show]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406055034/http://perens.com/Articles/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html |date=April 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has also claimed that code related to [[application programming interface]]s was copied from UNIX.  However, this code and the underlying standards they describe are in the public domain and are also covered by rights USL sold to [[The Open Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perens, [http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39116509,00.htm SCO's failing case against IBM], zdnet.com.au, March 10, 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213234612/http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39116509,00.htm |date=February 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A later claim was made to code segments related to [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] file format standards.  This material was developed by the Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Committee and placed in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040722135616439|title=Groklaw - A Tall Tale About ELF - by Frank Sorenson, Dr Stupid and PJ|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCO claims that the TIS Committee had no authority to place ELF in the public domain, even though SCO's predecessor in interest was a member of the committee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

SCO has claimed that some are violating UNIX SVRx copyrights by putting UNIX code into Linux.  They may or may not have brought this claim directly in any of their cases.  The IBM case is about derivative works, not SVRx code (see below).  The Novell case is about copyright ownership.  DaimlerChrysler was about contractual compliance statements.

The "may or may not" comes from AutoZone's case.{{Original research inline|date=September 2007}}  In AutoZone, SCO's complaint claimed damages for AutoZone's use of Linux.  However, when objecting to AutoZone's request for a stay pending the IBM case, SCO apparently contradicted their written complaint, claiming that the case was entirely about AutoZone copying certain libraries (outside the Linux kernel) from a UNIX system to a Linux-based system to facilitate moving an internal application to the Linux platform faster; SCO's original complaint does not appear to mention these libraries.  AutoZone denies having done this with UNIX libraries.  If SCO's oral description of their case is the correct one, then their AutoZone claim has nothing to do with the Linux kernel or the actions of any distributors.

The copyright issue is addressed directly in two of the cases. The first is by IBM in their counterclaim in ''SCO v. IBM''.  The issue is central to a pending motion by IBM, stating that IBM violated no copyrights in its Linux related activities.  It is also addressed by Red Hat in the Red Hat v. SCO case.  Red Hat claims that SCO's statements about infringement in Linux are unproven and untrue, damaging to them and violates the [[Lanham Act]].  Red Hat asks for an injunction to stop claims of violations without proof.  They also ask for a judgment that they violated no SCO copyrights.  A hearing on the IBM motion was held on September 15, 2004. Judge Kimball took the motion under advisement. The Red Hat case is on hold.

====Allegations of reverse copying====
''EWeek'' has reported allegations that SCO may have copied parts of the Linux kernel into SCO UNIX as part of its Linux Kernel Personality feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1653684,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If true, this would mean that SCO is guilty of a breach of the Linux kernel copyrights. SCO has denied this allegation, but according to Groklaw, one SCO employee confirmed it in a deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050809082902461|title=Groklaw -  Erik Hughes Deposition:  LKP Did Include Linux Kernel Code|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IBM code in Linux====
SCO has claimed a number of instances of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to [[Symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP), [[Journaled File System]] (JFS), [[Read-copy-update]] (RCU) and [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix.

SCO claims that they have "control rights" to this due to their licensing agreements with IBM. SCO disavows claiming that they own the code IBM wrote, rather comparing their "control rights" to an [[easement]], rights which allow them to prohibit IBM from publicizing the code they wrote, even though IBM owns the copyrights. They base this claim on language in the original license agreement that requires non-disclosure of the code and claim that  all code developed by UNIX licensees that is used with the code under license be held in confidence. This claim is discussed above at [[#Control of derivative works|Control of derivative works]].

===SCO and the GPL===
Before changing their name to the SCO Group, the company was known as '''Caldera International'''.

[[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] was one of the major distributors of Linux between 1994 and 1998. In August 1998, the company split into [[Caldera Systems]] and [[Caldera Thin Clients]], with Caldera Systems taking over the Linux systems business and Caldera Thin Clients concentrating on the Thin Clients and embedded business. The parent and shell company Caldera, Inc. ceased to exist in 2000 after a settlement with Microsoft in the [[Caldera v. Microsoft]] lawsuit.

Caldera Systems was reorganized to become Caldera International in 2001, the company, which was renamed to [[The SCO Group]] in 2002.

Some, like [[Eben Moglen]],&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-v-ibm.html|title=FSF Statement on SCO v. IBM|date=2003-06-27|author=Moglen, Eben|publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]], Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that because Caldera{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- TBD: Please be specific about which of the various Caldera companies is meant here --&gt; distributed the allegedly infringing code under the [[GNU General Public License]], or GPL, that this act would license any proprietary code in Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/2207791|title=SCO Faces Hurdles in Linux Claims - InternetNews.|website=www.internetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has stated that they did not know their own code was in Linux, so releasing it under the GPL does not count. However, as late as July and August 2006, long after that claim was made, they were still distributing ELF files (the subject of one of SCO's claims regarding SVRx) under the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060731122623203|title=Groklaw - SCO is Distributing ELF Under the GPL Still. Yes.  Now. Today.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060806074745174|title=Groklaw - SCO  Is Still Distributing ELF Under the GPL, Part 2.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has also claimed, in early stages of the litigation, that the GPL is invalid and non-binding and legally unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1404984,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, supporters of the GPL, such as Eben Moglen, claimed that SCO's right to distribute Linux relied upon the GPL being a valid copyright license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3302801|title=GPL Awaits Test in SCO Group/IBM Dispute - InternetNews.|website=www.internetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court filings by the SCO Group in ''SCO v. IBM'' use SCO's alleged compliance with the license as a defense to IBM's counterclaims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2007020910561488|title=Groklaw - SCO's Memo in Opp. to IBM's Motion for SJ on Claim of Copyright Infringement|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPL has become an issue in ''SCO v. IBM''. Under U.S. copyright law, distribution of creative works whose copyright is owned by another party is illegal without permission from the copyright owner, usually in the form of a license; the GPL is such a license, and thus allows distribution, but only under limited conditions. Since IBM released the relevant code under the terms of the GPL, it claims that the only permission that SCO has to copy and distribute IBM's code in Linux is under the terms and conditions of the GPL, one of which requires the distributor to "accept" the GPL. IBM says that SCO violated the GPL by denouncing the GPL's validity, and by claiming that the GPL violates the U.S. Constitution, together with copyright, antitrust and export control laws.  IBM also claims that SCO's SCOsource program is incompatible with the requirement that redistributions of GPLed works must be free of copyright licensing fees (fees may be charged for the acts of duplication and support). IBM has brought counterclaims alleging that SCO has violated the GPL and breached IBM's copyrights by collecting licensing fees while distributing IBM's copyrighted material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040331043539340|title=Groklaw - IBM's Second Amended Counterclaims Lists 9 Newly Registered Copyrights|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- WP:WEIGHT? SCO dropped their GPL-as-unconstitutional claims anyway.--&gt;

==Status of current lawsuits==

===''SCO v. IBM''===
{{Main article|SCO v. IBM}}
On March 7, 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM. Initially this lawsuit was about breach of contract and trade secrets. Later, SCO dropped the trade secrets claim, so the claim is breach of contract. SCO also added a copyright claim related to IBM's continued use of AIX, but not related to Linux. The judge subsequently stated that the SCO Group had indeed made a claim of copyright infringement against IBM regarding Linux. IBM filed multiple counter claims, including charges of both patent violations, which were later dropped, and violation of copyright law.

On February 8, 2005, Judge Kimball ruled that IBM's motions for summary judgment were premature but added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Viewed against the backdrop of SCO's plethora of public statements concerning IBM's and others' infringement of SCO's purported copyrights to the UNIX software, it is astonishing that SCO has not offered any competent evidence to create a disputed fact regarding whether IBM has infringed SCO's alleged copyrights through IBM's Linux activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050209203941896|title=Groklaw - Kimball Memoradum and Order - as text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 28, 2006 Judge Brooke Wells granted, in part, IBM's motion to limit SCO's claims and excluded 186 of SCO's 294 items of allegedly misused intellectual property (IBM had challenged 201 of them for various reasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628175203644|title=Groklaw - Wells Grants in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims!  In *Large* Part.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells cited a number of factors including SCO's inability to provide sufficient specificity in these claims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In December 2003, near the beginning of this case, the court ordered SCO to, "identify and state with specificity the source code(s) that SCO is claiming forms the basis of their action against IBM." Even if SCO lacked the code behind methods and concepts at this early stage, SCO could have and should have, at least articulated which methods and concepts formed "the basis of their action against IBM." At a minimum, SCO should have identified the code behind their method and concepts in the final submission pursuant to this original order entered in December 2003 and Judge Kimball’s order entered in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628203537917|title=Groklaw - Wells' Order Granting in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims, as text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This left about 100 of SCO's items of allegedly misused intellectual property (the merits of which have not yet been judged), out of 294 items originally disclosed by SCO.

Following the partial summary judgment rulings in the SCO vs Novell Slander of Title case, Judge Kimball asked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-1077.pdf |title=Data |website=www.groklaw.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the parties in SCO v IBM to prepare by August 31, 2007, a statement of the status of this case.

===''Red Hat v. SCO''===
{{Main article|Red Hat v. SCO}}
Red Hat filed suit against SCO on August 4, 2003. Red Hat sued SCO for false advertising, deceptive trade practices and asked for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of any of SCO's copyrights. This case has been stayed pending resolution of the IBM case.

===''SCO v. Novell''===
{{Main article|SCO v. Novell}}
After SCO initiated their Linux campaign, they said that they were the owners of [[Unix|UNIX]]. Novell claimed these statements were false, and that they still owned the rights in question. After Novell registered the copyrights to some key UNIX products, SCO filed suit against Novell on January 20, 2004.&lt;ref name="novell-0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-0.pdf | title=SCO's Complaint In the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County, State of Utah | date=2004-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Novell [[removal jurisdiction|removed]] the suit to federal court on February 6, 2004.&lt;ref name="novell-1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-1.pdf | title=Novell's Removal Notice | date=2004-02-06 | publisher=Groklaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2005, Novell filed its answer with the court, denying SCO's claims. Novell also filed counterclaims asking the court to force SCO to turn over the revenues it had received from UNIX licenses, less a 5% administrative fee. Additionally, Novell asked the court to place the funds in a "constructive trust" in order to ensure that SCO could pay Novell since the company's assets were depleting rapidly.

On August 10, 2007, Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights". Novell was awarded summary judgments on a number of claims, and a number of SCO claims were denied. SCO was instructed to account for and pass to Novell an appropriate portion of income relating to SCOSource licences to Sun Microsystems and Microsoft. A number of matters are not disposed of by Judge Kimball's ruling, and the outcome of these are still pending.&lt;ref name="doc377" /&gt;&lt;ref name="novell379" /&gt;

On July 16, 2008, the trial court issued an order awarding Novell $2,547,817 and ruled that SCO was not authorized to enter into the 2003 agreement with Sun.&lt;ref name="July 2008"&gt;

On August 24, 2009, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] partially reversed the August 10, 2007 district court summary judgment ruling.  The appeals court [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed back to trial on the issues of copyright ownership and Novell's contractual waiver rights.  The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement.&lt;ref name="Novell August 2009"&gt;

===''SCO v. AutoZone''===
[[AutoZone]], a corporate user of Linux and former user of SCO OpenServer, was sued by SCO on March 3, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Primary court documents pertaining to this case can be found at [http://sco.tuxrocks.com/?Case=AutoZone http://sco.tuxrocks.com/?Case=AutoZone].&lt;/ref&gt; SCO claims AutoZone violated SCO's copyrights by using Linux. The suit was stayed pending the resolution of the IBM, Red Hat and Novell cases.

On September 26, 2008, Judge Robert C. Jones lifted the stay, effective December 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080926054747382  | title=Stay Lifted on AutoZone as of December 31st - Updated  | accessdate=2009-10-23  | date=2008-09-26  | publisher=Groklaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He initially scheduled discovery for April 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20090121182736840  | title=Members Only -- Docket Update - BK and AutoZone  | accessdate=2009-10-23  | date=2009-01-21  | publisher=Groklaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCO filed an amended complaint on August 14, 2009.

===''SCO v. DaimlerChrysler''===
{{Main article|SCO v. DaimlerChrysler}}
In December 2003, SCO demanded that some UNIX licensees certify certain issues regarding their use of Linux. [[DaimlerChrysler]], a former UNIX user and current Linux user, did not respond to this demand. On March 3, 2004 SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their UNIX license agreement by failing to respond to the certification request. Almost every claim SCO made has been ruled against in summary judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Not dismissed, see the [http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/DCHearing-2.pdf hearing transcript, page 15]&lt;/ref&gt; The last remaining issue, that of whether DaimlerChrysler made a timely response, was dismissed by agreement of SCO and DaimlerChrysler in December 2004. SCO retains the right to continue this case at a future date, providing it pays legal fees to DaimlerChrysler.

==Other issues and conflicts==

===SCO announces that it will not sue its own customers===
On June 23, 2003, SCO sent out a letter announcing that it would not be suing its own Linux customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caldera.com/scosource/letter_to_partners.html The SCO Group, Inc. | Scosource | Letter_to_partners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009172817/http://www.caldera.com/scosource/letter_to_partners.html |date=October 9, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, it states:

{{quote|SCO will continue to support our SCO Linux and OpenLinux customers and partners who have previously implemented those products and we will hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding Linux.}}

===SCO and SGI===
In August 2003, SCO presented two examples of what they claimed was illegal copying of copyrighted code from UNIX to Linux. One of the examples ([[Berkeley Packet Filter]]) was not related to original UNIX code at all. The other example did, however, seem to originate from the UNIX code and was apparently contributed by a UNIX vendor, [[Silicon Graphics]]. However, an analysis by the Linux community later revealed that:

* The code originated from an even older version of UNIX which at some point was published by Caldera{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- Please be specific about the date and which of the various Caldera companies is meant here. --&gt;, thus making any claim of copyright infringement shaky.
* The code did not do anything. It was in a part of the Linux kernel that was written in anticipation of a Silicon Graphics architecture that was never released.
* It had already been removed from the kernel two months earlier.
* The contested segment was small (80 lines) and trivial.

===SCO and BayStar Capital===
In October 2003, [[BayStar Capital]] and [[Royal Bank of Canada]] invested US$50 million in The SCO Group to support the legal cost of SCO's Linux campaign. Later it was shown that BayStar was referred to SCO by Microsoft, whose proprietary [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system competes with Linux. In 2003, BayStar looked at SCO on the recommendation of Microsoft, according to Lawrence R. Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar Capital: "It was evident that Microsoft had an agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE1DB173AF931A15757C0A9629C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=TECHNOLOGY; Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=April 22, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2004, ''The New York Times'' reported that BayStar Capital, a private [[hedge fund]] which had arranged for $50M in funding for SCO in October 2003, was asking for its $20M back. The remainder of the $50M was from Royal Bank of Canada. SCO stated in their press release that they believed that BayStar did not have grounds for making this demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/22/business/technology-investor-s-pullout-stirs-doubts-about-sco-group.html?scp=5&amp;sq=baystar+capital&amp;st=cse|title=TECHNOLOGY; Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group|first=Steve|last=Lohr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2004, SCO and BayStar resolved their dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/27/sco_completes_baystar_settlement/|title=SCO closes BayStar deal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCO and Canopy Group===
The [[Canopy Group]] is an investment group with shares in a trust of different companies. It is a group owned by the [[Raymond Noorda|Noorda]] family, also founders of Novell.

Until February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the management of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member [[Ralph Yarro III]] on claims of [[misappropriation]]. With internal problems not made public (which included the suicides of Canopy's director of [[information systems]], [[Robert Penrose]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051228235018/http://blog.mecworks.com/articles/2004/12/26/rob-penrose/] Rob Penrose&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Val Kriedel]], the daughter of [[Ray Noorda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/536/000108212/] Noorda bio&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/125977/|title=Daily Herald - Canopy founder's daughter found dead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,600111043,00.html] Canopy at Heart of Feud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000250.htm] Sex, Drugs, and Unix {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314051749/http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000250.htm |date=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canopy Group agreed to buy back all the shares that SCO had in Canopy in exchange for their SCO shares and cash.

SCO and Canopy Group are now mostly independent, though SCO continues to rent their Utah office space from Canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071219004012610|title=SCO Asks Bankruptcy Court to Approve New Leases in NJ and Utah|last=Jones|first=Pamela|publisher=Groklaw|date=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2004, a leaked SCO internal e-mail detailed how Microsoft had raised up to $106 million via the BayStar referral and other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween10.html|title=Halloween Document 10|website=www.catb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake Stowell of SCO confirmed the memo was real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1542915,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BayStar claimed the deal was suggested by Microsoft, but that no money for it came directly from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2004/tc20040311_8915_tc119.htm|title=BW Online - March 11, 2004 - SCO's Suit: A Match Made in Redmond?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the Baystar involvement, Microsoft paid SCO $6M (USD) in May 2003 for a license to "Unix and Unix-related patents", despite the lack of Unix-related patents owned by SCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/08/31OPcringely_1.html SCO strikes gold, Verizon just strikes | InfoWorld | Column | 2003-08-08 | By Robert X.

This deal was widely seen in the press as a boost to SCO's finances which would help SCO with its lawsuit against IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1007528.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711233345/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1007528.html|deadurl=yes|title=Microsoft to license Unix code - CNET News|date=11 July 2012|archivedate=11 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=109360 The SCO Group | Investor Relations | SCO Announces UNIX Licensing Deal With Microsoft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825130902/http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=109360 |date=2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCOsource===
After their initial claim of copyright infringement in the Linux kernel, The SCO Group started their SCOsource initiative, which sells licenses of SCO's claimed copyrighted software, other than OpenServer and Unixware licenses. After a small number of high-profile sales (including one that was denied by the claimed purchaser), SCO claimed to offer corporate users of Linux a license at US$699 per processor running Linux. However, many individuals{{Who|date=December 2015}} have found it impossible to buy such a license from SCO. SCO says that participants of the SCOsource initiative are not liable for any claims that SCO makes against Linux users.

===The Michael Davidson E-Mail===
On July 14, 2005, an email&lt;ref name=md&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-459-22.pdf |title=Data |website=www.groklaw.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; was unsealed that had been sent from Michael Davidson to Reg Broughton (both Caldera International employees) in 2002, before many of the lawsuits. In it, Davidson reported how the company had hired an outside consultant because ''(spelling as in the original)'':
{{cquote|of SCO's executive management refusing to believe that it was possible for Linux and much of the GNU software to have come into existence without *someone* *somewhere* having copied pieces of proprietary UNIX source code to which SCO owned the copyright. The hope was that we would find a "smoking gun" somewhere in code that was being used by Red Hat and/or the other Linux companies that would give us some leverage. (There was, at one stage, the idea that we would sell licences to corporate customers who were using Linux as a kind of "insurance policy" in case it turned out that they were using code which infringed on our copyright).}}

The consultant was to review the Linux code and compare it to Unix source code, to find possible copyright infringement. Davidson himself said that he had not expected to find anything significant based on his own knowledge of the code and had voiced his opinion that it was "a waste of time". After 4 to 6 months of consultant's work, Davidson says: ''"...we had found absolutely *nothing*. ie no evidence of any copyright infringement whatsoever."&lt;ref name=md/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7663">The '''Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project''', one of the [[Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects]], is dedicated to social movements and [[Labor history (discipline)|labor history]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It is directed by Professor James N. Gregory of the [[University of Washington]]. The project represents a unique collaboration between community organizations and University faculty, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become a model of public history across the US and has been credited with changing the discussion of race and civil rights in the Seattle area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffey|first=Trevor|title=Rethinking Race and Place: The Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=OAH Magazine of History|date=January 2012|volume=26|issue=1|pages=47–50|url=http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/47.full?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=IeFmtkRZYTKf7CO|doi=10.1093/oahmag/oar049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The site provides over 70 oral history interviews with short video excerpts and brief biographies, as well as a listing of historic Civil Rights organizations, a page on Seattle's ethnic press, a resource with lesson plans for teachers, films and slidewhows, and a page with in-depth historical essays that explore various issues, incidents and people. Each fully illustrated with photos and newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project: an Online Video Oral History Collection|journal=Northwest Oral History Association Newsletter|date=Spring 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr3/pdf/NOHA%20Spring%2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special sections==
Also in the project is a special sections area featuring nine different sections which showcase comprehensive reports, oral histories, photo collections, and documents about many of the prominent movements and organizations involved in Seattle's rich history of Civil Rights and Labor activism. The sections detail farm workers in Washington State, the Ku Klux Klan in Washington, the Seattle Black Panther Party, Filipino Cannery Unions, the Washington Chicano movement, the 1907 Bellingham anti-Asian riots, the Congress of Racial Equality in Seattle, the Black Student Union at the University of Washington, and the United Construction Workers Association. A section on the history of housing segregation in Seattle attracted media attention and spurred changes in State law that allowed neighborhood associations to remove racially restrictive clauses from their covenants with greater ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Lornet|title=Homeowners find records still hold blot of racism|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002297312_covenants03m.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=June 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=James|title=Stain of racism still haunts Seattle neighborhoods|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002913362_jamesgregory06.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational Outreach==
The Project includes nine full lesson plans for middle school and high school students, ranging from single class periods to longer units, created by Washington educators. The lesson plans are designed to encourage critical thinking and fulfill State requirements. Examples include ‘Martin Luther King’s Controversial Visit to Seattle’ and ‘Document Based Question: School Segregation in Seattle.’

==Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project==
The Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project is a multimedia resource on the history of Chicano activism that includes first-hand oral histories, primary documents and academic research.  It traces the development of the movement in the Yakima Valley and the University of Washington in Seattle. The Project is an initiative of the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project at the University of Washington, alongside the Farm Workers in Washington State History Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosales-Castaneda|first=Oscar|title=Writing Chicana/o History with the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=Writing History in the Digital Age|date=Spring 2012|url=http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/public-history/rosales-castaneda-2012-spring/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
The Project focuses on several organizations including United Mexican American Students (UMAS), [[Brown Berets|the Brown Berets]], [[MEChA|Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztlan]] (MEChA), United Farmworker Cooperative, El Teatro del Piojo, El Centro de la Raza, the Concilio for Spanish Speaking, SEAMAR Community Health Centers, and radio station KDNA. The histories of these organizations are bolstered by video oral histories, photographs from several personal collections and digitized copies of pamphlets and other documents. An in-depth timeline covers the years 1960-1985, and an illustrated essay details the period from the coalescing of the movement in 1967 to the [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|2006 immigration mobilizations]]. In addition, the site contains a database of more than 300 digitized newspaper articles that originally appeared between 1968 and 1979. Like other sections of the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, the site contains model lesson plans for middle school and high school teachers using the available materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project: an Online Video Oral History Collection|journal=Northwest Oral History Association Newsletter|date=Spring 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr3/pdf/NOHA%20Spring%2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3621">The '''Six Clerks’ Office''' was a public legal office that served the [[equity (law)|equitable jurisdiction]] of the [[England and Wales|English]] [[Court of Chancery]] in [[London]], England, until the mid-19th century.

==The Office==
The Office was in [[Chancery Lane]], near the [[Holborn]] end. The business of the office was to enrol [[Letters patent|commissions]], [[pardon]]s, [[patent]]s, [[Warrant (law)|warrants]], ''etc.'', that had passed the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] in addition to other business in Chancery. In the early history of the Court of Chancery, the Six Clerks and their under-clerks appear to have acted as the [[Lawyer|attorneys]] of the [[suitor]]s. As business increased, these under-clerks became a distinct body, and were recognized by the court under the denomination of '''sworn clerks''', or '''clerks in court'''. The advance of commerce, with its consequent accession of wealth, so multiplied the subjects requiring the judgment of a Court of Equity, that the limits of a public office were found wholly inadequate to supply a sufficient number of officers to conduct the business of the suitors. Hence originated the "[[Solicitor]]s of the Court of Chancery.”&lt;ref&gt;Wheatley (1893) [http://www.pepysdiary.com/p/1058.php fn to entry for 12 July 1660]&lt;/ref&gt; The Office also facilitated Chancery claims by litigants ''[[in forma pauperis]]'' (impoverished), including children and those suffering from [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.officialsolicitor.gov.uk/os/legal_basis.htm | title=Official Solicitor: Legal basis and history | publisher=[[Official Solicitor]] | accessdate=2009-05-03 | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “Six Clerks” were abolished by the [[Court of Chancery Act 1842]] following the reforming work of [[Edwin Wilkins Field]]&lt;ref&gt;5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Pemberton]].

'''Smart &amp; Biggar''' is a Canadian [[law firm]] specializing exclusively in [[intellectual property]] and technology law. The firm has offices in [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Calgary]]. It is related to the [[patent]] agency Fetherstonhaugh, and the two firms operate in unison through common partners, offices and personnel.

Smart &amp; Biggar/Fetherstonhaugh has over 110 intellectual property professionals across its five offices. It is the largest firm in Canada that specializes exclusively in intellectual property law.

==History==
The firm was founded in Toronto by [[F. B. Fetherstonhaugh|Frederick Fetherstonhaugh]] in 1890 as a patent firm known as Fetherstonhaugh &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=SBHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smart-biggar.ca/en/firm_history.cfm |title=Firm History |publisher=Smart &amp; Biggar |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetherstonhaugh was a patent attorney from [[Mimico]] who was well known for having one of the first electrified homes in Toronto as well as owning the first electric car in Ontario, which was created by [[William Joseph Still]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=NP_Vance&gt;{{cite news | last=Vance | first=Bill | title=No horse required | newspaper=National Post | location=Toronto | date=April 11, 2009 | url=https://nationalpost.com/story.html?id=2c992179-5778-44b8-bdad-7e05604cc70d&amp;k=27461}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An Ottawa office was established in 1895, and was joined by [[Russel S. Smart]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=Maybee&gt;{{cite book |title= History of the Patent and Trade Mark Profession in Canada |first1=Gareth E. |last1=Maybee |first2= Robert E. |last2= Mitchell |publisher=Patent and Trademark Institute of Canada |location=Ottawa |year=1985 |isbn=0969205600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart joined as a patent agent at the age of 19 with only a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Toronto, and he was later called to the Bar of Quebec in 1911 and to the Bar of Ontario in 1922. He was made a partner of the firm in 1913 with the patent agency then known as Fetherstonhaugh &amp; Co., while the law firm was rebranded as Fetherstonhaugh &amp; Smart.&lt;ref name=Maybee/&gt;

Fetherstonhaugh was joined in 1923 by [[Harold G. Fox]] to create the patent agency Fetherstonhaugh &amp; Fox in Toronto.&lt;ref name=FoxFund&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoxfund.com/harold.htm |title=A Short History of Dr. Harold G. Fox |first=James |last=Tumbridge |date=February 2004 |publisher=The Harold G. Fox Education Fund |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Colonel Oliver Mowat Biggar|Oliver M. Biggar]] joined the partnership at the behest of Smart to form Smart &amp; Biggar.&lt;ref name=Maybee/&gt;

One of the best-known successes in the firm's early years came in the case of ''Lightning Fastener v. Colonial Fastener'',&lt;ref&gt;''Lightning Fastener v. Colonial Fastener'', [1933] S.C.R. 371&lt;/ref&gt; where Fox, along with Smart and Biggar, successfully represented Lightning Fastener Co. and [[Gideon Sundback|Dr. Gideon Sundback]] in a patent infringement action for their patent on an early version of the [[zipper]].&lt;ref name=FoxFund/&gt;

'''Solar gain''' (also known as '''solar heat gain''' or '''passive solar gain''') refers to the increase in thermal energy of a space, object or structure as it absorbs incident [[Solar energy|solar radiation]]. The amount of solar gain a space experiences is a function of the total incident solar [[irradiance]] and of the ability of any intervening material to [[Transmittance|transmit]] or resist the radiation.

Objects struck by sunlight absorb its visible and short-wave infrared components, increase in temperature, and then re-radiate that heat at longer [[infrared]] [[wavelengths]]. Though transparent building materials such as glass allow visible light to pass through almost unimpeded, once that light is converted to long-wave infrared radiation by materials indoors, it is unable to escape back through the window since glass is opaque to those longer wavelengths. The trapped heat thus causes solar gain via a phenomenon known as the [[greenhouse effect]]. In buildings, excessive solar gain can lead to overheating within a space, but it can also be used as a passive heating strategy when heat is desired.

== Window Solar Gain Properties ==
Solar gain is most frequently addressed in the design and selection of windows and doors. Because of this, the most common metrics for quantifying solar gain are used as a standard way of reporting the thermal properties of window assemblies. In the United States, The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers ([[ASHRAE]])&lt;ref name=ASHRAE&gt;{{cite book|last1=ASHRAE|title=ASHRAE Handbook: Fundamentals|date=2013|publisher=ASHRAE|location=Atlanta, GA|url=http://www.ashrae.org|chapter= Chapter 15. Fenestration}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[National Fenestration Rating Council]] (NRFC)&lt;ref name=NFRC200&gt;{{citation|title=ANSI/NFRC 200-2017: Procedure for Determining Fenestration Product Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and Visible Transmittance at Normal Incidence.|publisher = NFRC|date = 2017|url=http://www.nfrc.org|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain standards for the calculation and measurement of these values.

=== Shading Coefficient ===
The '''shading coefficient (SC)''' is a measure of the radiative thermal performance of a [[glass]] unit (panel or window) in a [[building]]. It is defined as the ratio  of solar radiation at a given wavelength and angle of incidence passing through a glass unit to the radiation that would pass through a reference window of frameless {{convert|3|mm|in}} Clear Float Glass.&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt; Since the quantities compared are functions of both wavelength and angle of incidence, the shading coefficient for a window assembly is typically reported for a single wavelength typical of solar radiation entering normal to the plane of glass. This quantity includes both energy that is transmitted directly through the glass as well as energy that is absorbed by the glass and frame and re-radiated into the space, and is given by the following equation:&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar&gt;{{citation|last = McCluney|first = Ross|title = Fenestration Solar Gain Analysis|publisher = Florida Solar Energy Center/University of Central Florida|date = 1996|access-date = 8 November 2017|url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.30.2472&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F(\lambda,\theta)=T(\lambda,\theta)+N*A(\lambda,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, λ is the wavelength of radiation and θ is the angle of incidence. "T" is the transmissivity of the glass, "A" is its absorptivity, and "N" is the fraction of absorbed energy that is re-emitted into the space.  The overall shading coefficient is thus given by the ratio:

&lt;math&gt;S.C. = F(\lambda,\theta)_1 / F(\lambda,\theta)_o&lt;/math&gt;

The shading coefficient  depends on the [[radiation properties]] of the window assembly. These properties are the [[Transmittance|transmissivity]] "T" , [[Absorptance|absorptivity]] "A", [[emissivity]] (which is equal to the absorptivity for any given wavelength), and [[reflectivity]] all of which are dimensionless quantities that together sum to 1.&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar /&gt; Factors such as [[color]], tint, and reflective coatings affect these properties, which is what prompted the development of the shading coefficient as a correction factor to account for this.  ASHRAE’s table of solar heat gain factors&lt;ref name=ASHRAE /&gt; provides the expected solar heat gain for ⅛” clear float glass at different latitudes, orientations, and times, which can be multiplied by the shading coefficient to correct for differences in radiation properties.
The value of the shading coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. The lower the rating, the less solar heat is transmitted through the glass, and the greater its shading ability.

In addition to glass properties, shading devices integrated into the window assembly are also included in the SC calculation. Such devices can reduce the shading coefficient by blocking portions of the glazing with opaque or translucent material, thus reducing the overall transmissivity.&lt;ref name=HCL&gt;{{cite book|last = Lechner|first = Norbert|title = Heating, Cooling, Lighting: Sustainable Design Methods for Architects|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition = 3rd|date = 2009|pages = 250–252|isbn = 9780470048092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Window design methods have moved away from the Shading Coefficient and towards the [[#Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)|Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)]], which is defined as the fraction of incident solar radiation that actually enters a building through the entire window assembly as heat gain (not just the glass portion). The standard method for calculating the SHGC also uses a more realistic wavelength-by-wavelength method, rather than just providing a coefficient for a single wavelength like the shading coefficient does.&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar /&gt; Though the shading coefficient is still mentioned in manufacturer product literature and some industry computer software,&lt;ref name=WINDOW&gt;{{cite web|title=WINDOW Documentation|url=https://windows.lbl.gov/tools/window/documentation|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is no longer mentioned as an option in industry-specific texts&lt;ref name = ASHRAE /&gt; or model building codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ICC|title=2009 International Energy Conservation Code|date=2009|url=https://codes.iccsafe.org/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from its inherent inaccuracies, another shortcoming of the SC is its counter-intuitive name, which suggests that high values equal high shading when in reality the opposite is true. Industry technical experts recognized the limitations of SC and pushed towards SHGC in the United States (and the analogous g-value in Europe) before the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=DeathOfSC&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCluney|first1=Ross|title=The Death of the Shading Coefficient?|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=1991|issue=March|pages=36–45|url=https://www.academia.edu/5340854/The_Death_of_the_Shading_Coefficient_ASHRAE_Journal_March_1991|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conversion from SC to SHGC is not necessarily straightforward, as they each take into account different heat transfer mechanisms and paths (window assembly vs. glass-only). To perform an approximate conversion from SC to SHGC, multiply the SC value by 0.87.&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt;

=== G-Value ===
G-value (sometimes also called a Solar Factor or Total Solar Energy Transmittance) is the coefficient commonly used in Europe to measure the solar energy transmittance of windows. Despite having minor differences in modeling standards compared to the SHGC, the two values are effectively the same. A g-value of 1.0 represents full transmittance of all solar radiation while 0.0 represents a window with no solar energy transmittance. In practice though, most g-values will range between 0.2 and 0.7, with solar control glazing having a g-value of less than 0.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = British Fenestration Rating Council|publisher = BFRC|url = https://www.bfrc.org/|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)===
SHGC is the successor to the shading coefficient used in the United States and it is the ratio of transmitted solar radiation to incident solar radiation of an entire window assembly. It ranges from 0 to 1 and  refers to the solar energy transmittance of a window or door as a whole, factoring in the glass, frame material, sash (if present), divided lite bars (if present) and screens (if present).&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt; The transmittance of each component is calculated in a similar manner to the shading coefficient. However, in contrast to the shading coefficient, the total solar gain is calculated on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis where the directly
transmitted portion of the solar heat gain coefficient is given by:&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T = \int\limits_{350 \ nm}^{3500 \ nm}  T(\lambda) E(\lambda) d\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;T(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral transmittance at a given wavelength in nanometers and &lt;math&gt;E(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the incident solar spectral irradiance. When integrated over the wavelengths of solar short-wave radiation, it yields the total fraction of transmitted solar energy across all solar wavelengths. The product &lt;math&gt;N*A(\lambda,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is thus the portion of absorbed and re-emitted energy across all assembly components beyond just the glass. It is important to note that the standard SHGC is calculated only for an angle of incidence normal to the window. However this tends to provide a good estimate over a wide range of angles, up to 30 degrees from normal in most cases.&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt;

SHGC can either be estimated through simulation models or measured by recording the total heat flow through a window with a calorimeter chamber. In both cases, NFRC standards outline the procedure for the test procedure and calculation of the SHGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = ANSI/NFRC 201-2017: Procedure for Interim Standard Test Method for Measuring the  Solar Heat Gain Coefficient of Fenestration Systems Using Calorimetry Hot Box Methods|publisher = NFRC|page = 19|access-date = 6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For dynamic fenestration or operable shading, each possible state can be described by a different SHGC.

Though the SHGC is more realistic than the SC, both are only rough approximations when they include complex elements such as shading devices, which offer more precise control over when fenestration is shaded from solar gain than glass treatments.&lt;ref name=HCL /&gt;

== Solar Gain in Opaque Building Components ==
Apart from windows, walls and roofs also serve as pathways for solar gain. In these components heat transfer is entirely due to absorptance, conduction, and re-radiation since all transmittance is blocked in opaque materials. The primary metric in opaque components is the Solar Reflectance Index which accounts for both  solar reflectance (albedo) and emittance of a surface.&lt;ref name=ASTM1980&gt;{{cite article|title = Standard Practice for Calculating Solar Reflectance Index of Horizontal and Low-Sloped Opaque Surfaces|publisher = ASTM International|doi = 10.1520/E1980-11|location = West Conshohocken, PA|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials with high SRI will reflect and emit a majority of heat energy, keeping them cooler than other exterior finishes. This is quite significant in the design of roofs since dark roofing materials can often be as much as 50 C° hotter than the surrounding air temperature, leading to large thermal stresses as well as heat transfer to interior space.&lt;ref name=HCL /&gt;

== Solar Gain and Building Design ==
{{Main|Passive solar building design}}
Solar gain can have both positive or negative effects depending on the climate. In the context of passive solar building design, the aim of the designer is normally to maximize solar gain within the building in the winter (to reduce [[space heating]] demand), and to control it in summer (to minimize cooling requirements). [[Thermal mass]] may be used to even out the fluctuations during the day, and to some extent between days.

=== Control of Solar Gain ===
Uncontrolled solar gain is undesirable in hot climates due to its potential for overheating a space. To minimize this and reduce cooling loads, several technologies exist for solar gain reduction. SHGC is influenced by the color or tint of glass and its degree of [[reflectivity]]. Reflectivity can be modified through the application of reflective metal oxides to the surface of the glass. [[Low-emissivity]] coating is another more recently developed option that offers greater specificity in the wavelengths reflected and re-emitted. This allows glass to block mainly short-wave infrared radiation without greatly reducing [[visible transmittance]].&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt;

In climate-responsive design for [[climate zone|cold and mixed climates]], windows are typically sized and positioned in order to provide solar heat gains during the heating season. To that end, glazing with a relatively high solar heat gain coefficient is often used so as not to block solar heat gains, especially in the sunny side of the house. SHGC also decreases with the number of glass panes used in a window. For example, in [[Triple glazing|triple glazed windows]], SHGC tends to be in the range of 0.33 - 0.47. For [[double glazing|double glazed windows]] SHGC is more often in the range of 0.42 - 0.55.

Different types of glass can be used to increase or to decrease solar heat gain through fenestration, but can also be more finely tuned by the proper orientation of windows and by the addition of shading devices such as [[Overhang (architecture)|overhangs]], [[louver]]s, fins, [[porch]]es, and other architectural shading elements.

=== Passive Solar Heating ===
Passive solar heating is a design strategy that attempts to maximize the amount of solar gain in a building when additional heating is desired. It differs from active solar heating which uses exterior water tanks with pumps to absorb solar energy because passive solar systems do not require energy for pumping and store heat directly in structures and finishes of occupied space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0038-092X(77)90071-8 |title=Simulation analysis of passive solar heated buildings—Preliminary results |journal=Solar Energy |volume=19 |issue=3 |year=1977 |last1=Balcomb |first1=J.D |last2=Hedstrom |first2=J.C |last3=McFarland |first3=R.D |bibcode=1977SoEn...19..277B|pages = 2–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct solar gain systems, the composition and coating of the building glazing can also be manipulated to increase the greenhouse effect by optimizing their radiation properties, while their size, position, and shading can be used to optimize solar gain. Solar gain can also be transferred to the building by indirect or isolated solar gain systems.

Passive solar designs typically employ large south facing windows with a high SHGC and overhangs that block sunlight in summer months and permit it to enter the window in the winter. When placed in the path of admitted sunlight, high thermal mass features such as concrete slabs or [[trombe wall]]s store large amounts of solar radiation during the day and release it slowly into the space throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;Balcomb, J.Douglas, editor. Passive Solar Buildings. MIT Press, 1992.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When designed properly, this can modulate temperature fluctuations. Some of the current research into this subject area is addressing the tradeoff between opaque thermal mass for storage and transparent glazing for collection through the use of transparent phase change materials that both admit light and store energy without the need for excessive weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0038-092X(97)00086-8 |title=TIM–PCM external wall system for solar space heating and daylighting |journal=Solar Energy |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=369 |year=1997 |last1=Manz |first1=H |last2=Egolf |first2=P.W |last3=Suter |first3=P |last4=Goetzberger |first4=A |bibcode=1997SoEn...61..369M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''South African constitutional law''' is the area of [[South African law]] relating to the interpretation and application of the [[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]] by the country's courts. All laws of [[South Africa]] must conform with the Constitution; any laws inconsistent with the Constitution have no force or effect.

== Constitutions ==

South Africa is generally considered to have had five constitutional documents since the [[Union of South Africa|Union]] was established in 1910, including the current one. The constitutions in chronological order are -

* [[South Africa Act]]
* [[Constitution of South Africa, 1961]] (also known as the "Republican Constitution")
* [[Constitution of South Africa, 1983]] (also known as the "Tricameral Constitution")
* [[Constitution of South Africa, 1993]] (also known as the "Interim Constitution")
* [[Constitution of South Africa, 1996]] (also known as the "Final Constitution")

The Interim Constitution abolished South Africa's system of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and replaced it with a dispensation wherein the Constitution is the supreme law, as opposed to the will of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]]. The previous three constitutions were all subject to parliamentary amendment with, generally, a [[majority|simple majority]], therefore were not considered extraordinary statutes.

A '''temporary class drug''' is a relatively new status for [[controlled drug]]s, which has been adopted in some jurisdictions, notably [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], to attempt to bring newly synthesised [[designer drug]]s under legal control. The controlled drug legislation in these jurisdictions requires drug scheduling decisions to follow an evidence-based process, where the harms of the drug are assessed and reviewed so that an appropriate legal status can be assigned. Since many designer drugs sold in recent years have had little or no published research that could help inform such a decision, they have been widely sold as "legal highs", often for months, before sufficient evidence accumulates to justify placing them on the controlled drug schedules. 

This situation has been deemed to be undesirable, as every time a designer drug has been banned, novel compounds with similar effects have been quickly developed and brought to market, often with worse health consequences reported than the original compound. The temporary class drug status has been developed to circumvent the evidential requirements and allow drugs to be banned temporarily as soon as they are deemed by authorities to be causing harm to individuals or society. The temporary ban lasts for a period of 1 year, after which the drug would in theory be made legal again, if sufficient evidence to ban it permanently had not been forthcoming. During the period of the temporary ban, the temporary class drugs are treated equivalently to established illegal drugs, though with reduced or absent penalties for personal use amounts, and the main focus of enforcement being on importation and sale of the drugs.

Initially, only the [[dissociative]] [[arylcyclohexylamine]] derivative [[methoxetamine]] was banned as a temporary class drug in the UK, effective from 5 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/mexxy-banned | title = First 'legal high' to be banned under new powers | accessdate = 2012-03-28 | date = 2012-03-28 | work = UK Home Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/28/legal-high-drug-methoxetamine-banned | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Legal high drug 'mexxy' banned under new government powers | date=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/drug-law/temporary-class-drug-orders/methoxetamine/|title=Drug misuse and dependency - GOV.UK|website=www.homeoffice.gov.uk|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2013 methoxetamine was banned as a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/methoxetamine | title = MXE is now a Class B drug | accessdate = 2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a large number of other arylcyclohexylamine derivatives under a 'catch-all' chemical structure clause.

On 10 June 2013, a total of 10 benzofuran and indole analogues and four NBOMe hallucinogens were classified as Temporary Class Drugs in the UK following an ACMD recommendation. Specifically these include [[5-APB]], [[6-APB]], [[5-APDB]], [[6-APDB]] and their N-methyl derivatives [[5-MAPB]], [[6-MAPB]], [[5-MAPDB]] and [[6-MAPDB]], as well as [[5-IT]] and its isomer [[6-IT]], plus [[NBOMe-2C-C]], [[NBOMe-2C-B]], [[NBOMe-2C-I]] and [[NBOMe-2C-D]].&lt;ref name='ACMD report'&gt; {{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title = Temporary class drug order report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds | accessdate = 2013-06-13 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that sale and import of the named substances are criminal offences and are treated as for Class B drugs.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | title = 'NBOMe' and 'Benzofury' banned | date = 4 Jun 2013 | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nbome-and-benzofury-to-be-banned | work = UK Home Office | accessdate = 2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2015, five derivatives of [[methylphenidate]] were recommended to be banned in the UK as Temporary Class Drugs following their sale as uncontrolled [[stimulant]] drugs. The compounds listed for control were [[ethylphenidate]], [[propylphenidate]], [[isopropylphenidate]], [[methylnaphthidate]] and [[3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420983/TCDO_methylphenidate_NPS.pdf|title=Methylphenidate-based NPS: A review of the evidence of use and harm.

On 25 June 2015, two more derivatives of methylphenidate, [[4-Methylmethylphenidate]] and [[ethylnaphthidate]], were recommended to be banned in the UK as Temporary Class Drugs following their sale as uncontrolled [[stimulant]] drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-to-mike-penning-on-methylphenidate-based-novel-psychoactive-substances | title=Letter to Mike Penning on methylphenidate-based novel psychoactive substances | publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs | date=25 June 2015 | accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministerial-response-to-the-advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs-about-2-new-methylphenidate-based-substances | title=Ministerial response to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs about 2 new methylphenidate-based substances | publisher=Home Office | date=25 June 2015 | accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, 35 drugs have been banned as temporary class drugs since August 2011, 24 of which have subsequently had the temporary ban renewed for a further year after reaching the end of the initial one-year ban period. These include; [[JWH-018]], JWH-022, [[JWH-073]], [[JWH-081]], [[JWH-122]], JWH-201, [[JWH-203]], [[JWH-210]], [[JWH-250]], [[JWH-302]], [[AM-694]], [[AM-2201]], [[RCS-4]], RCS-4 butyl homologue, 2-methoxy isomer of RCS-4, and 2-methoxy isomer of RCS-4 butyl homologue, which were banned on 16 August 2011, [[JWH-019]], [[JWH-200]] and [[AM-1220]], which were banned on 14 October 2011, [[AM-2233]], banned on 29 December 2011, [[AM-1248]], [[AM-2232]] and [[UR-144]], banned on 6 April 2012, and the stimulant [[methylhexanamine]], banned on 9 April 2012. Another four cannabinoid compounds, namely [[CB-13]], [[MAM-2201]], [[AKB48 (drug)|AKB48]] and [[XLR-11 (drug)|XLR-11]], were banned on 13 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/mental-health-and-addictions/drug-policy/temporary-class-drug-notices|title=Temporary Class Drug Notices|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further cannabinoid compound [[NNE1]] was banned from 8 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/0ba1cfe0a634fb50cc257aa9005da359|title=New Zealand Gazette|website=www.dia.govt.nz|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more cannabinoids [[APICA (synthetic cannabinoid drug)|APICA]] (also known as 2NE1) and its 5-fluoropentyl derivative [[STS-135 (drug)|STS-135]] were banned from 22 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/72c1fdb1b5057d62cc257ab7005ee3cd New Zealand Government Gazette, Notice Number 7444, 15 November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Another cannabinoid [[EAM-2201]] was banned from 6 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1211/S00429/dunne-bans-substance-found-in-k2-testing.htm|title=Dunne bans substance found in K2 testing - Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another stimulant, the [[phenyltropane]] derivative [[RTI-126]], was banned from 27 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/08962b9beacb16dfcc257ada005dad9a|title=New Zealand Gazette|website=www.dia.govt.nz|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more cannabinoids [[QUCHIC]] (also known as BB-22) and [[5F-AKB48]] were banned from 9 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1304/S00561/dunne-bans-further-two-substances-found-in-k2.htm|title=Dunne bans further two substances found in K2 - Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2013, the [[Psychoactive Substances Act 2013]] came into effect in New Zealand. This superseded the Temporary Class Drug scheme, as all novel psychoactive substances are restricted by default, except where specifically licensed. This Act promises to introduce strict toxicity testing and quality control standards for recreational psychoactive substances, with products that are proved to meet the safety criteria being allowed to be sold legally. Products that were on sale immediately prior to the introduction of the Act were allowed to continue to be on sale while the safety testing regime is implemented, but can be removed from sale if significant adverse events are reported. A number of interim licenses have been refused or revoked under this process, and by January 2014 a total of twelve more synthetic cannabis products had been removed from sale, containing ingredients such as ADB-CHMICA (SGT-7), [[5F-PB-22]], SGT-55 (CUMYL-BICA), SGT-56 ([[CUMYL-PICA]]), 4-F-AM-2201, 4-Cl-AM-2201 and [[PB-22]].&lt;ref name="health.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/psychoactive-substances/interim-product-approvals|title=Home - Psychoactive Substances Regulatory Authority|website=www.health.govt.nz|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/risk-assessment-score-table-27sept-13.pdf|title=The Risk Assessment Score Table.

On 27 April 2014 it was announced that all 41 remaining untested "legal high" products, which had been allowed to continue to be on sale during an interim period, were to be banned on 9 May 2014. These were mainly [[synthetic cannabis]] products containing ingredients such as [[AB-FUBINACA]], PB-22 ([[QUPIC]]), [[5F-PB-22]], SGT-24 ([[CUMYL-PINACA]]), [[CP 55,244]], 4-F-AM-2201, 4-Cl-AM-2201, [[5F-ADBICA]] and [[AB-005]]. There was also one cannabinoid pill containing SGT-42 ([[CUMYL-THPINACA]]), and several "party pill" products containing mixtures of ingredients such as [[caffeine]], [[hordenine]], [[synephrine]] and [[kava]].&lt;ref name="health.govt.nz"/&gt; No "legal high" products will be allowed back on sale in New Zealand under the Psychoactive Substances Act until they have been tested in a manner yet to be determined, and found to present a "low risk of harm". This process is expected to take at least 18 months or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9982968/Legal-highs-to-be-banned|title=Legal highs to be banned|website=Stuff|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9983260/Use-our-legal-high-law-says-Labour|title=Use our legal high law, says Labour|website=Stuff|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11245159|title=Government to ban all legal highs within two weeks|first=Isaac Davison Political reporter, NZ Herald isaac davison@nzherald co nz|last=@isaac_davison|date=27 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rychert M, Wilkins C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16300">'''UHF CB''' is a class-licensed [[citizen's band|citizen's band radio]] service authorised by the governments of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Malaysia]] in the [[UHF]] 477&amp;nbsp;MHz [[band (radio)|band]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Sinclair ''Radio Signal Finding''
McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000 {{ISBN|0-07-137191-5}} page 281&lt;/ref&gt;  UHF CB provides 77 [[channel (communications)|channels]], including 32 channels (16 output, 16 input) allocated to repeater stations. It is similar in concept to [[CB usage in the United States|27 MHz CB Radio]] in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

Class licensing means that users do not have to apply for a licence or pay a licence fee however they must comply with the regulations of the class licence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acma.gov.au/Citizen/TV-Radio/Radio/Marine-and-Amateur-Radio/citizen-band-radio-service-cbrs-fact-sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

User equipment designs are similar to commercial land mobile [[two-way radio]] except the maximum legal output power is 5 [[Watt]]s. External antennas are permitted and commercially manufactured antennas have gains as high as 12&amp;nbsp;dB. Handheld transceivers (walkie talkies) are permitted and have transmit power from 500&amp;nbsp;mW to 5 W (full legal power) and are relatively cheap compared to full-sized transceivers. Operation in the band is restricted to [[Types of radio emissions|modes]] F3E and G3E ([[Frequency modulation|FM]] or [[Phase modulation|PM]] of analogue voice telephony) except for channels 22 and 23, which are data modes only.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/F2015L00876&lt;/ref&gt;

It is illegal to use non-standard radios purchased from overseas because they interfere with licensed land-mobile services. This includes overseas [[personal radio service]] devices because they do not share the same band plan, power output and channels as UHF CB. Care must be taken when importing radios from overseas to ensure they comply with local regulations. Approved radios are identified by an Australian standards C Tick usually found on the tag or sticker of the radio.

==Scan==
Many UHF CB radios allow the user to scan channels to find a conversation. Several different scan modes may be provided:

'''Open Scan''' scans all 80 channels to find an active conversation. Some radios allow skipping selected channels when scanning.

'''Group Scan''' scans a small number of selected channels. For example, a caravanner travelling around the country may choose to group scan Channel 40 (Road Channel), 18 (Caravan Channel) and 5 (Emergency Channel) so they will hear any conversations relating to their travels.

'''Priority Scan''' allows selection of  a "priority" channel whilst scanning a handful of selected channels. This could be useful in a convoy of cars where vehicles can set their own convoy channel as a priority channel whilst scanning the designated road channel for traffic updates, if a member from their convoy speaks, the radio will always switch back to the priority channel even if someone is speaking on another channel.

==Selcall==
Selective calling ([[Selcall]]) allows a radio to call another radio using a sequence of tones, usually presented to the user as a series of 5 numbers. UHF CB radios can be set to be completely silent until they receive a series of tones matching a pre-programmed sequence. Radios which have this feature usually indicate that a call has been received by emitting a number of beeps and by opening the squelch. The popularity of selcall has dropped since the introduction of CTCSS.

==CTCSS==
Continuous tone coded squelch system ([[CTCSS]]) allows a group of radios set with the same tone to converse on a channel without hearing other radios using that channel. CTCSS can be used to silence a radio until another radio with the same tone transmits. This allows monitoring of a channel for transmissions from radios set with the same tone without hearing other conversations that use different or even no tone.

The use of CTCSS is not permitted on UHF CB repeaters or the designated emergency channels.

==Repeaters==
[[Radio repeater|Repeaters]] extend the range of transmission by receiving and automatically rebroadcasting a transmission using an antenna located in a high location, normally the top of a mountain, tall building or radio tower. Sometimes a transmission range of over 100&amp;nbsp;kilometres (60 miles) can be achieved through the use of a repeater. Repeaters are on channels 1–8 and 41–48 and the duplex button should be pressed to access the repeater.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uhfcb.com.au/CB-Radio-History.php CB radio History&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signage==
It is common practice to install signs at the rear of camper vans and caravans, worksites, roadworks, regional highways, national parks and heavy vehicle checking stations to advertise a UHF channel to communicate on. For example, during the widening of the M1 Pacific Motorway between Sydney and Newcastle, contractors installed "UHF 29" signs at the entry point to each worksite.

==Channel use==

===Legally restricted channels===
The following channels are legislated as a part of the ACMA UHF CB Class Licence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/F2015L00876&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Channel 5''' and '''35''' are the designated emergency channels in Australia, Vanuatu and Malaysia, and are not to be used except in an emergency. Making an emergency call involves switching the radio to Channel 5 with duplex on, and trying again with duplex off if there's no response. In New Zealand channels 5 and 35 are not emergency channels, they are available for general use in duplex (repeater) mode. In New Zealand, if you use UHF PRS for emergency, you rely on someone listening on the same channel. Scan all channels for activity before requesting assistance.
* '''Channel 9''' is the designated emergency channels in Malaysia.
* '''Channel 11''' is the 'call channel' and is only to be used for initiating calls with another person, who should quickly organise another vacant channel to continue their discussion on.
* '''Channel 22''' and '''23''' are only to be used for telemetry and telecommand, packet data and voice transmission are not allowed.
* '''Channel 61''', '''62''' and '''63''' are reserved for future allocation and transmission on these channels is not allowed.

===Channels used by consensus===
The following channels are not legislated as a part of the class licence however are used for the following purposes by consensus.

* '''Channel 10''' is typically used by 4WD clubs when in a convoy and in national parks. This channel is used to avoid interfering with road safety communications on channel 29 or 40. If you are not in a convoy it is recommended that only 29 or 40 are used, depending on the road in question.
* '''Channel 18''' is the campers and caravan convoy channel typically used by travellers.
* '''Channel 29''' is the road safety channel on the M1 Pacific Motorway and Highway between Tweed Heads and Newcastle in NSW. It is used due to one transport company who travelled this road who always used this channel. Other drivers switched from 40 to 29 to talk to them and it became a custom. This custom prevails even though the original transport company no longer exists.
* '''Channel 40''' is the primary road safety channel Australia-wide, most commonly used by trucks including pilot/escort vehicles for oversized loads.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Final%20PDF%20version%20-%20OSOM%20Loads%5E2C%20Pilots%20and%20Escort%20vehicles%20brochure.RCN-D13%5E23398873.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.police.qld.gov.au/Resources/Internet/rti/policies/documents/Circular%202-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Users should be aware that UHF CB channels 31 to 38 and 71 to 78 are the 'input' channels for repeaters. Users should avoid using these channels to avoid interfering with repeaters. If a repeater is to be used, switch to 1–8 or 41–48 and press the duplex button.

==UHF CB band plan==

===Expansion to 80 channels===
On 27 May 2011 the channel spacing on UHF CB was changed, allowing the band to expand from 40 channels to 80 channels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_287&lt;/ref&gt; Due to data channels 22 and 23 occupying 25&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth, the expansion effectively allows the use of 77 channels, as channels 61, 62 and 63 are reserved.

===Current UHF CB band plan (80 Channels)===
General chat channels are used in simplex mode, repeater channels must be used in duplex mode. If you are not using a repeater it is recommended to choose a "general chat" channel.

== New Zealand ==
New Zealand offers a similar PRS service. New Zealand's Personal Radio Service (PRS) and 26&amp;nbsp;MHz Citizens Band radio are very similar to Australia's UHF Citizens Band and 27&amp;nbsp;MHz Citizens Band services.
 
The New Zealand Government's Ministry of Commerce introduced the UHF PRS in 1996 to allow for freely available short-range wireless communications outside the 26&amp;nbsp;MHz CB band. The UHF (but not VHF) band was selected due to its ability to withstand atmospheric and groundwave interference unlike the existing 26&amp;nbsp;MHz allocation.

'''United States Navy Regulations''' is the principal regulatory document of the '''[[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]''' (not just the ''[[United States Navy]]''), endowed with the sanction of law, as to duty, responsibility, authority, distinctions and relationships of various officials, organizations and individuals.

Navy Regulations are issued by the [[Secretary of the Navy]], and are permanent regulations of general applicability, as opposed to other regulations that he or she may issue in accordance with law. The Navy Regulations serve in effect much as a vehicle of implementation of [[Title 10 of the United States Code]] as it pertains to the Naval Services. However, Navy Regulations do not take legal precedence over any order or directive issued by either the [[President of the United States|President]] or [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], or of an [[Act of Congress]]. 

The [[Chief of Naval Operations]] is responsible for maintaining the Navy Regulations, and for ensuring that they conform to the current needs of the Department of the Navy. Other directives issued within the Department of the Navy may not conflict with, alter or amend any provision of Navy Regulations. Any additions, changes or deletions to the U.S. Navy Regulations must be approved by the Secretary of the Navy.

==History==
Navy Regulations began with the enactment by the [[Second Continental Congress]] of the "Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies" on November 28, 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules for the Regulation of the Navy|url=https://www.navyhistory.org/rules-for-the-regulation-of-the-navy-of-the-united-colonies-of-north-america/|website=Naval Historical Foundation|publisher=Naval Historical Foundation|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issuance by the United States Government which covered this subject matter was "An Act for the Government of the Navy of the United States," enacted on March 2, 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Public Statutes at Large of the United States of America, Volume 1|year=1850|publisher=Charles C. Little and James Brown|location=Boston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpA_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA709|edition=2|editor=Richard Peters|accessdate=20 March 2011|page=709|chapter=An Act for the Government of the Navy of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed the next year by "An Act for the Better Government of the Navy of the United States." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bill, For the better government of the Navy of the United States, and repealing the act on the same subject, passed the second day of March in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine.|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llhb&amp;fileName=020/llhb020.db&amp;recNum=150|work=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774-1875|accessdate=20 March 2011|date=3 March 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years preceding the [[American Civil War]], twelve successor publications were promulgated under a number of titles by the President, the Navy Department and the Secretary of the Navy. A decision by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] that the last of the pre-Civil War issuances was invalid led to the inclusion in the 1862 naval appropriations bill of a provision that "the orders, regulations, and instructions heretofore issued by the Secretary of the Navy be, and they are hereby, recognized as the regulations of the Navy Department, subject, however, to such alterations as the Secretary of the Navy may adopt, with the approbation of the President of the United States."

Thirteen editions of Navy Regulations were published in accordance with this authority (later codified as Section 1547, Revised Statutes) between 1865 and 1948. The 1973 edition of Navy Regulations was published under authority of {{UnitedStatesCode|10|6011}}, which provided that "United States Navy Regulations shall be issued by the Secretary of the Navy with the approval of the President." In 1981, this provision was amended to eliminate the requirement for presidential approval.

While leaving this provision unaffected, Congress enacted the [[Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986]] (Pub. L. 99–443), which granted each of the service secretaries the explicit authority to prescribe regulations to carry out his or her statutory functions, powers and duties.

'''White flags''' have had different meanings throughout history and depending on the locale.

==Flag of truce or surrender== &lt;!-- [[Flag of surrender]], [[Flag of truce]] and [[Flag of Truce]] redirect to this section. Please update them if changing the heading name --&gt;
[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lt Gen. [[Arthur Percival]], led by a Japanese officer, walks under a flag of truce to negotiate the [[Battle of Singapore|capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore]], on 15 February 1942]]
The white flag is an internationally recognized [[protective sign]] of [[truce]] or [[ceasefire]], and request for negotiation. It is also used to symbolize [[Surrender (military)|surrender]], since it is often the weaker party which requests negotiation. It is also flown on ships serving as [[cartel (ship)|cartel]]s. A white flag signifies to all that an approaching negotiator is unarmed, with an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate. Persons carrying or waving a white flag are not to be fired upon, nor are they allowed to open fire. The use of the flag to request [[parley]] is included in the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]].

The improper use of the flag is forbidden by the [[rules of war]] and constitutes a [[war crime]] of [[perfidy]]. There have been numerous reported cases of such behavior in conflicts, such as [[combatants]] using white flags as a [[Deception|ruse]] to approach and attack enemy combatants, or killings of [[combatants]] attempting to surrender by carrying white flags.

===Origin===
The first mention of the usage of white flags to surrender is made during the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty (AD 25–220). In the [[Roman Empire]], the historian [[Cornelius Tacitus]] mentions a white flag of surrender in AD 109. Before that time, Roman armies would surrender by holding their shields above their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koerner |first=Brendan I. |author-link=Brendan I. Koerner |date=March 21, 2003 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2003/03/why_do_surrendering_soldiers_wave_white_flags.html?via=gdpr-consent |title=Why Do Surrendering Soldiers Wave White Flags? |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=22 August 2018 |agency=[[Graham Holdings Company]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The white flag was widely used in the Middle Ages in Western Europe to indicate an intent to surrender.  The color white was used generally to indicate a person was exempt from combat; heralds bore white wands, prisoners or hostages captured in battle would attach a piece of white paper to their hat or helmet, and garrisons that had surrendered and been promised safe passage would carry white batons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Maurice Hugh |author-link=Maurice Hugh Keen |year=1965 |title=The Laws of War in the Middle Ages |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge &amp; K. Paul]] |oclc=507262 |pages=291 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ANqwAAAAIAAJ |jstor=1339392 |isbn=9781317397588 |doi=10.2307/2851422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its use may have expanded across continents, e.g. Portuguese chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]] (writing in the 1550s), claims that in 1502, an Indian prince, the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], dispatched negotiators bearing a "white cloth tied to a stick", "as a sign of peace", to his enemy [[Vasco da Gama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gaspar |last=Correia |author-link=Gaspar Correia |title=Lendas da Índia |year=1858 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA300 |page=300 |quote=mandou hum seu Bramane em huma almadia com hum pano branco atado e um páu per sinal de paz |publisher=Typ. da Academia Real das Sciencias |first2=Rodrigo José |last2=de Lima Felner |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1625, [[Hugo Grotius]] in ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), one of the foundational texts in international law, recognized the white flag as a "sign, to which use has given a signification"; it was "a tacit sign of demanding a parley, and shall be as obligatory, as if expressed by words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/grotius-the-rights-of-war-and-peace-2005-ed-vol-3-book-iii |first=Hugo |last=Grotius |author-link=Hugo Grotius |title=The Rights of War and Peace |year=2005 |volume=3 |orig-year=1625 |via=[[Liberty Fund, Inc.]] |editor-first=Jean |editor-last=Barbeyrac |editor-link=Jean Barbeyrac |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Tuck |editor2-link=Richard Tuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umayyad dynasty==
The [[Umayyad]] dynasty (661–750) used white as their symbolic color as a reminder of [[Muhammad]]'s first [[Battle of Badr|battle at Badr]], and to distinguish themselves from the [[Abbasid]]s, by using white, rather than black, as their color of mourning.

==Ancien Régime in France==
During the period of the [[Ancien Régime]], starting in the early 17th century, the [[royal standard]] of [[France]] became a plain white flag as a symbol of purity, sometimes covered in [[fleur-de-lis]] when in the presence of the king or bearing the ensigns of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The white color was also used as a symbol of military command, by the commanding officer of a French army. It would be featured on a white scarf attached to the regimental flag as to recognise French units from foreign ones and avoid friendly fire incidents. The French troops fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War]] fought under the white flag.

The French Navy used a plain white [[French ensigns|ensign]] for [[ship of the line|ships of the line]]. Smaller ships might have used other standards, such as a fleur-de-lis on white field. Commerce and private ships were authorised to use their own designs to represent France, but were forbidden to fly the white ensign.

During the [[French Revolution]], in 1794, the blue, white and red [[Flag of France|Tricolore]] was adopted as the official national flag. The white flag quickly became a symbol of French royalists. (The white part of the French Tricolor is itself originally derived from the old Royal flag, the tricolor having been designed when the revolution still aimed at [[constitutional monarchy]] rather than a republic; this aspect of the Tricolor was, however, soon forgotten.){{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], the white flag replaced the Tricolore, by then seen as a symbol of [[regicide]].

It was finally abandoned in 1830, with the [[July Revolution]], with the definitive use of the blue, white and red flag.

In 1873, an attempt to reestablish the monarchy failed when [[Henri, Count of Chambord|Henri of Artois, the Count of Chambord]] refused to accept the Tricolore. He demanded the return of the white flag before he would accept the throne, a condition that proved unacceptable.

==American Civil War==
In 1863, the [[Confederate States of America]] adopted a new flag that played on the popularity of the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Second national flag .28The Stainless Banner.29|Confederate Battle Flag]], using a pure white field with the Battle Flag displayed in a canton in a position equivalent to the stars on the [[Flag of the United States]]. The design lasted until March 1865, when concerns about it being mistaken for a flag of truce when the flag was not completely flying necessitated the addition of a broad red band on the fly edge.

==Christianity==

The [[Christian Flag]], designed in the early 20th century to represent all of [[Christianity]] and [[Christendom]], has a white field, with a red [[Latin cross]] inside a blue canton. In conventional [[vexillology]], a white flag is linked to surrender, a reference to the Biblical description of [[Jesus]]' non-violence and [[Surrender (religion)|surrender]] to [[Will of God|God's will]].&lt;ref name="Prayer Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.prayerfoundation.org/christian_flag.htm|title =The Christian Flag|publisher = Prayer Foundation|quote=The flag's most conspicuous symbol is the Christian cross, the most universal symbol for Christianity.  The red color represents the blood of Christ and brings to mind his crucifixion.  Christians believe that Jesus Christ's death and resurrection is the means God uses to save believers from their sins. The cross and blood have been used since earliest Christianity to symbolize salvation through Jesus; in the words of the Apostle Paul, "And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself;" -Colossians 1:20. The white field draws on symbolism throughout the Bible equating white clothes with purity and forgiveness.  People who have been "washed white as snow" in the Bible have been cleansed from their sins (Isaiah 1:18; Psalm 51:2).  In conventional vexillology (the study of flags, their history and symbolism), a white flag is linked to surrender, a reference to the Biblical description Jesus' non-violence and surrender to God's will. The symbolism behind the blue canton has been interpreted to represent Heaven, truth, or the Christian ritual of Baptism in water.|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing==
{{main|Racing flags#White flag|l1=White flag (racing)}}
In [[FIA]] sanctioned races, a white flag warns of a slow car ahead. In non-FIA races, a white [[racing flag]] is displayed from the starter's tower to indicate that the race leader is running the final lap. The white flag can be pointed at the race leader to avoid confusion of other drivers. Drivers may wave a small white flag after a collision to indicate that they are uninjured.

In [[NASCAR]] and other racing leagues, a white flag symbolizes one lap to go. After this, the checkered flag is waved. NASCAR sometimes has finishes that are coined as "[[green–white–checker finish]]es" because of the order of the flags waved lap after lap before the finish.

==Buddhist and Confucian countries==
In [[Buddhist]] countries, white is the colour of mourning, so a white flag is used where other cultures might fly a [[List of black flags|black flag]].

{{see also|Flag of Afghanistan}}During the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Afghan Civil War]], the [[Taliban]] used a plain white flag. When it took over [[Kabul]] in 1996, and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]], the white flag became the national flag of the country, representing "the purity of their faith and government". After 1997, the Taliban added the [[Shahadah]] to the flag.

==Minamoto clan==
During the [[Genpei War]] (1180–1185), the [[Minamoto clan]] fought under a white flag while the [[Taira clan]] fought under a red flag. As successive [[Shōgun|shogunates]] were from the Minamoto clan, this usage continued to the end of [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1868 when the current international usage was adopted.
