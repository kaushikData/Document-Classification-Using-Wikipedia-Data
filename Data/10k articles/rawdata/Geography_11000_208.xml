'''Alexander Nikolayevich Javakhishvili''' ({{lang-ka|ალექსანდრე ნიკოლოზის ძე ჯავახიშვილი;}}) born 5 August 1875 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style Julian Calendar]]), 17 August 1875 ([[Gregorian Calendar|New Style Gregorian Calendar]]) in [[Gori (Georgia)|Gori]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] – died January 22, 1973, [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) was a Georgian [[geographer]] and [[anthropologist]].&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1= Kavrishvili |first1=K. |last2=Kipiani |first2=S.|last3= |first3= |title=''Alexander Javakhishvili'' (1875—1973), Bibliography, |year= 1984 |publisher= Mecniereba |location=Tbilisi  |isbn= | pages=21–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor]] A. N. Javakhishvili was one of the oldest geographers and anthropologists in the Soviet Union. He was the founder of Soviet Georgian geography which, under him, developed into a school.
His qualifications and awards include [[Doktor nauk|Doctor of Geographical Sciences]] (1937), recognition as an [[Academician]] of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] (1944), a Merited Scientist, an honorary member of the USSR Geographic Society, and winner of a State Prize of the [[Georgian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article025139.html Alexander Nikolayevich Javakhishvili Great Soviet Encyclopedia] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Javakhishvili was born on 5 August (17 August New Style), 1875, in the town of [[Gori (Georgia)|Gori]], into a government official's family.  Javakhishvili began his schooling in [[Tbilisi]] at the Georgian Gymnasium for sons of the gentry.

Leaving the Georgian Gymnasium in 1887, he pursued his studies at the Second Classical Gymnasium for Boys in Tbilisi. In 1895 he completed the course, winning a gold medal and the right to a state grant at [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]] where he became a student of physics and mathematics in its sub-department of Natural Sciences.

In 1900 Javakhishvili graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics with [[Honours degree#Honours Degrees and academic distinctions|honours]] and was invited to remain at the University to prepare for a professorship. As early as in 1899 he began to work as an assistant in [[organic chemistry]] in which he was particularly interested at the time.

==Scientific activities==
His research, to which he devoted many years of his life, solved the cardinal problems of [[anthropology]] of the contemporary population of the [[Caucasus]];&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt; the results of his investigations became widely known in the scientific world. He was a born scientist, and, owing to his exceptional purposefulness, his numerous works covered almost all the geographical problems of Georgia: [[geomorphology]], [[cartography]], the geographical distribution of the population, problems dealing with various peculiarities of the land and its people, and the varied terrain of the country; neither did the history of geography of Georgia escape his attention.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

The theoretical works of Javakhishvili are a significant contribution to Soviet geographical science; among these are publications devoted to the structure of this science, to the interrelations between sciences composing general geography and to their links with adjacent sciences, making part of the geography of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Kipiani S., [[Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia|Georgian State (Soviet) Encyclopedia]], 1987. Book 11. p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of work Javakhishvili did for the benefit of science and knowledge is more than one man could normally be expected to do; therefore he can be regarded, together with [[Vakhushti Bagrationi]], as the founder of [[geography]] in Georgia.&lt;ref name="biblio" /&gt;

==Awards==
In 1955 the Ministry of Education of the Georgian SSR awarded Javakhishvili the badge
"Excellent Educationalist". The Soviet Government highly appreciated Javakhishvili's scientific and public activities and awarded him the [[Order of Lenin]], the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] twice, and the Medal "For Conspicuous Service during the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] of 1941 — 1945".

The '''Arctic Basin''' (also '''North Polar Basin''') is an [[oceanic basin]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]], consisting of two main parts separated by the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], a [[mid-ocean ridge]] running between north [[Greenland]] and the [[New Siberian Islands]]. The basin is bordered by the [[continental shelves]] of [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seebohm|first=Henry|title=The North Polar basin|year=Reviews 1894|publisher=Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.086719742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aves Ridge''' is a ridge in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]]. It runs in a north-south direction, approximately 250 km west of the [[Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc]]. It is mostly under water, but it reaches the surface in the north as [[Aves Island]] and in the south as [[Blanquilla Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Isla Blanquilla, Venezuela: Image of the Day|publisher=NASA|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=8252|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425234227/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=8252|archivedate=25 April 2009|deadurl=no|date=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=James, Keith L.|title=The Caribbean Ocean Plateau – an overview, and a different understanding|pages=2,4|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/CaribbeanPlateau.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003122036/http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/CaribbeanPlateau.pdf|archivedate=3 October 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most geologists believe that the Aves Ridge originated as an [[volcanic arc]] which is now extinct, though its width poses a problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deepseadrilling.org/78a/volume/dsdp78a_02.pdf |title=Geophysics and the Structure of the Lesser Antilles Forearc |last1= Westbrook|first1= G.K|last2=Biju-Duval|first2=B.|last3=Mascle|first3=A.|date=September 20, 1983 |website= Deep Sea Drilling Project |publisher= |access-date=22 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the date of its origin is generally placed in the [[Cretaceous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/CaribbeanPlateau.pdf |title=The Caribbean Ocean Plateau – an overview, and a different understanding |last=James |first=Keith H. |date=2007 |website=&lt;nowiki&gt;MantlePlumes.org&lt;/nowiki&gt; |publisher= |access-date= 22 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bally |editor1-first=Albert W.|editor2-last=Palmer |editor2-first=Allison R. |date= 1989 |title=Geology of North America—An Overview |url= https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=DyF3BQAAQBAJ |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher= [[Geological Society of America]] |page=314 |isbn= 9780813754451 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Environment sidebar}}  

A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term ''[[:wikt:environment|environment]]'' can refer to a singular global environment in relation to [[human]]ity, or a local biophysical environment, e.g. the UK's [[Environment Agency]].

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to conditions of its environment. Temperature, light, humidity, soil nutrients, etc., all influence any species, within any environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long term modifications along the history of our planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]]. Other interactions are more immediate and simple, such as the smoothing effect that forests have on the temperature cycle, compared to neighboring unforested areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. [[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human induced effects on the environment. [[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], [[built environment]]s and [[social environment]]s.

Environmentalism is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimise and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.

One of the studies related include employing Geographic Information Science to study the biophysical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Y. X., and J. P. Wilson. 2006. “The Role of Attribute Selection in GIS Representations of the Biophysical Environment”. ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 96 (1).

'''BirdLife International''' (formerly the '''International Council for Bird Preservation''')  is a global partnership of [[Conservation movement|conservation]] organisations that strives to conserve [[birds]], their [[habitat]]s, and global [[biodiversity]], working with people towards sustainability in the use of natural resources. It is the world's largest partnership of conservation organisations, with over 120 partner organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BirdLife Partners|url=http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a membership of more than 2.5 million people and partner organizations in more than 100 countries. Major partners include [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], the [[Wild Bird Society of Japan]], and the [[National Audubon Society|U.S. National Audubon Society]]. The group’s headquarters are located in [[Cambridge|Cambridge, UK]].

BirdLife International’s priorities include preventing extinction of bird species, identifying and safeguarding important sites for birds, maintaining and restoring key bird habitats, and empowering conservationists worldwide. Guided by a global council, member organizations implement the group’s strategies on local, regional, and national levels.

BirdLife International has identified 7,500 important bird areas and manages more than 2,500,000 million acres (1,000,000 hectares) of wildlife habitat. As the official listing authority for birds for the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]’s [[IUCN Red List|Red List of threatened species]], BirdLife International has identified more than 1,000 bird species threatened with extinction and has developed conservation strategies for each of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/our-work/birds|title=Red List Authority for birds|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
BirdLife International is a worldwide alliance of nongovernmental organizations that promotes the conservation of birds and their habitats. BirdLife International was founded in 1922 as the ''International Council for Bird Preservation'' by American [[ornithologist]]s [[T. Gilbert Pearson]] and [[Jean Theodore Delacour]] under the name International Committee for Bird Protection. The group was renamed International Committee for Bird Preservation in 1928, International Council for Bird Preservation in 1960, and BirdLife International in 1994. It changed its name in 1993 to "BirdLife International".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/our-history|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional work==
BirdLife International has conservation work programmes in the following parts of the world, which it describes as "regions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regions|url=http://www.birdlife.org/regions|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa|url=http://www.birdlife.org/africa|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Americas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americas|url=http://www.birdlife.org/americas|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia|url=http://www.birdlife.org/asia|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe and Central Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe and Central Asia|url=http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East|url=http://www.birdlife.org/middle-east|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific|url=http://www.birdlife.org/pacific|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Member organisations ===
There are about 120 regional partners of BirdLife International, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners BirdLife Partners], BirdLife International (page visited on 16 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bremer Marine Park''' (formerly '''Bremer Commonwealth Marine Reserve''') is a 4472&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[marine protected area]], with a depth range of about 15–5000&amp;nbsp;m, lying in the [[Southern Ocean]] off the southern coast of [[Western Australia]] about 50&amp;nbsp;km south-east of the town of [[Bremer Bay]]. An area of 284&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, comprising the northernmost section adjoining Western Australia’s coastal waters, has been zoned as a marine [[national park]] ([[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN Category II]]), with the remainder as multiple use or special purpose zones (IUCN Category VI).&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;

It was gazetted in 14 December 2013 and was renamed on 11 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Commonwealth Marine Reserves Renaming) Proclamation 2017 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L01337 |website=Federal Register of Legislation |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=5 July 2018 |date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="South-west-MP"/&gt;

==Fauna==
The marine park provides important seasonal calving habitat for [[southern right whale]]s as well as supporting migrating [[humpback whale]]s. It is a foraging area for [[Australian sea lion]]s, [[Indian yellow-nosed albatross]]es, [[flesh-footed shearwater]]s, [[soft-plumaged petrel]]s and [[great white shark]]s. It also encompasses Bremer Canyon, a [[submarine canyon]] known as a [[biodiversity hotspot]] supporting seasonal aggregations of [[sperm whale|sperm]] and [[killer whale]]s.&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-reserves/south-west/bremer |title= Bremer Commonwealth Marine Reserve |accessdate=2014-04-21 |work= South-west Commonwealth marine Reserves Network |first= |last= |publisher=Department of the Environment, Australia |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7243">'''Catalog Service for the Web (CSW)''', sometimes seen as '''Catalog Service - Web''', is a standard for exposing a catalogue of geospatial records in [[XML]] on the Internet (over HTTP). The catalogue is made up of records that describe geospatial data (e.g. [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]]), geospatial services (e.g. [[Web Map Service|WMS]]), and related resources.

CSW is one part (or "profile") of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] '''Catalog Service''', which defines common interfaces to discover, browse, and query metadata about data, services, and other potential resources. Version 2.0 of the specification was released in May 2004. The most recent release is 2.0.2, which was published in 2007.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=20555|title = OpenGIS Catalogue Service Implementation Specification|date = 2007-02-23|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://www.webabc.info/| title= Webkatalog }} Wednesday, 3 May 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the records include [[Dublin Core]], [[Geospatial metadata#ISO 19139 Geographic information Metadata XML schema implementation|ISO 19139]] or [[Federal Geographic Data Committee|FGDC]] metadata, encoded in [[UTF-8]] characters. Each record must contain certain core fields including: Title, Format, Type (e.g. Dataset, DatasetCollection or Service), BoundingBox (a rectangle of interest, expressed in latitude and longitude), Coordinate Reference System, and Association (a link to another metadata record).

Operations defined by the CSW standard include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/csw/features.html|title =GeoServer {{!}} Catalog Services for the Web (CSW) features|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150329160900/http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/csw/features.html|archivedate =2015-03-29|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GetCapabilities&lt;/code&gt;: "allows CSW clients to retrieve service metadata from a server"

 &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
 &lt;xs:documentation&gt;Geographic MetaData (GMD) extensible markup language is a component of the XML Schema Implementation of Geographic Information Metadata documented in ISO/TS 19139:2007. GMD includes all the definitions of http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd&lt;/nowiki&gt; namespace. The root document of this namespace is the file gmd.xsd. This identification.xsd schema implements the UML conceptual schema defined in A.2.2 of ISO 19115:2003. It contains the implementation of the following classes: MD_Identification, MD_BrowseGraphic, MD_DataIdentification, MD_ServiceIdentification, MD_RepresentativeFraction, MD_Usage, MD_Keywords, DS_Association, MD_AggregateInformation, MD_CharacterSetCode, MD_SpatialRepresentationTypeCode, MD_TopicCategoryCode, MD_ProgressCode, MD_KeywordTypeCode, DS_AssociationTypeCode, DS_InitiativeTypeCode, MD_ResolutionType.&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
 &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;

== Versions ==
Versions 2.0.0, 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 are subtly different, and different vendors implement them with variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trac.osgeo.org/geonetwork/wiki/interop_matrix |title=GeoNetwork's cross-platform interoperability}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a CSW server will accept requests in one CSW version only, and it is up to the client to be flexible. e.g. ESRI Geoportal can be configured to harvest documents from CSW servers of a variety of versions and vendor variants &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRI Geoportal|url=http://webhelp.esri.com/geoportal_extension/9.3.1/index.htm#hrvst_use_tool.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "GeoNetwork CSW 2.0.2 APISO".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13843">[[File:Peru map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Peru map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The '''climate of Peru''' is very diverse,  with a large variety of [[climate]]s and [[microclimate]]s, including 28 of the 32 world climates.  Such a diversity is chiefly conditioned by the presence of the [[Andes mountains]] and the cold [[Humboldt Current]]
      
The  climate on the coast is [[arid]] and semi-arid with high temperatures and very little [[rain]]fall. The Andes mountains observe a cool-to-cold climate with rainy [[summer]]s and very dry [[winter]]. The eastern lowlands present an [[Equatorial climate]] with hot weather and rain distributed all year long.

==Pacific coast==
The climate of the coast ranges from warm-[[Semi-arid|semiarid]] (north of 10°S, and thus very close to the equator) to a climate which is a bit like the Mediterranean (Köppen Csb) climate with an important difference &amp;mdash; the winter, although cloudy and cool, does not have sufficient rainfall to be considered a Köppen C climate.

The high coastal climate is mostly determined by the influence of the cold Humboldt Current, which runs parallel to the Peruvian coast, blocking the possibility of precipitation coming from the Ocean. Should this current be warm instead, the presence of the Andes would suffice for high amounts of [[orographic precipitation]], such as registered in the top north and south part of the [[South America]]n coastal Andes.
[[Image:Peru Provinces Costa Sierra Selva.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of the Peruvian provinces climate-wise: coastal (light yellow) – mountain (clay) – jungle (deep green)]]

===Northern coast===
The temperature extremes of the northern coast (3°S–6°S) range from {{convert|30|to|38|°C|°F|1}}. Summers are characterized by hot and sunny conditions, with occasional afternoon and nocturnal light rainshowers. The farther north, the less arid, due to the Humboldt Current getting less cold as it nears the Equator. Thus, the [[Tumbes Region]], bordering [[Ecuador]], is the only coastal one with regular seasonal precipitation.

Summer rainfall totals rarely exceed {{convert|210|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, save for severe [[El Niño]] events, which can provoke major floodings, with precipitations which can be as high as {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, especially in the readings observed over the entire Peruvian coast; the aforementioned Tumbes region and [[Piura Region|Piura]] are the hottest. Winter is characterized by warm yet comfortable conditions and absence of rain.

===Central and southern coast===

In the central and southern coasts (south of 6°S) temperature ranges from {{convert|8|to|30|°C|°F|1}} and rainfall is scarce with annual totals are 150&amp;nbsp;mm. Summer is characterized by warm, moist and sunny conditions with lows between {{convert|20|and|22|°C|°F|1}} and highs are between {{convert|24|and|29|°C|°F|1}}. Temperatures over {{convert|29|°C}} are commonly observed less than 12 days per year except at the Ica deserts where summer highs can sometimes reach {{convert|35|°C}}. Little or no rainfall occurs during the summer. Very rare rainfall events are produced by the leftovers of Andean convection and occur during the night. Summer rainfall totals are generally less than {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

Winter is characterized by overcast, cool and damp conditions, which keep daytime temperatures cool. Strictly by the coast and a few kilometers inland, winter is determined by an almost permanent layer of fog, which creates ''garua'', a particular [[Fog#Sea and coastal fog|mist own to coastal Peru and Chile]]. In those areas located right by the ocean, the so-called 'rainy season' develops by late May and comes to an end by mid October. Precipitation occurs in the form of nocturnal-morning [[drizzle]] and seasonal totals range between {{convert|10|and|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Winter precipitation favors the development of vegetation over particular coastal mountain ranges known as "Lomas". The desert green-up peaks between July and early November.

Temperatures range from {{convert|14|–|18|°C|°F|1}} at night and {{convert|19|–|21|°C|°F|1}} during the day. Winter highs oscillate between {{convert|15|and|21|°C|°F|1}} and the lows between {{convert|8|and|15|°C|°F|1}}. Several weeks of persistent overcast skies and highs below {{convert|19|°C|1}} are not uncommon between July and September.

Some representative [[weather station]] averages:
* [[Piura]] (north); {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|24.4|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|72|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} Climate type BWh (hot [[desert]]).
* [[Lima]], (central); {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|19.2|°C}}; annual {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type BWh ("subtropical" desert, but cold [[Humboldt Current]] generates fog).
* [[Lomas de Lachay]], [[Huaral Province]] in [[Lima]], a unique mist-fed ecosystem.

==Andean highlands==

The Peruvian Andes (''clima de Sierra'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) exhibits the largest diversity among the country. Temperature is proportional to altitude, varying from temperate (annual average of {{convert|18|°C|disp=or}}) in the low-lying valleys to frigid (annual average below {{convert|0|°C|disp=or}}) in the [[alpine climate|highest elevations]]. The maximum temperature is often steady throughout the year, the low varying due to the presence of clouds in the rainy season, which help keeping to some extent the daytime heat during the night. In the absence of clouds, nights are much colder.

Precipitation varies in different scales and has a marked seasonality. The [[Wet season|rainy season]] starts in September but peaks between January and March, whereas the May–August part of the year is characterized by strong [[insolation]], very dry conditions and cold [[night]]s and [[morning]]s, which is almost the exact reverse, in terms of insolation, to the coast climate. There is a marked southwest-northeast rainfall gradient with the driest conditions ({{convert|200|-|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) along the southwestern Andes, and the wettest conditions along the eastern slopes (&gt;{{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year). Upon the interaction between the topography and the mean flow, some regions immediately east of the Andes can receive as much as {{convert|10000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. Rainfall is also larger over mountain ranges than over valley floors, since most of the rainfall occurs in the form of afternoon convective storms. Lakes also modulate the distribution and rainfall amounts. [[Lake Titicaca]], for example, induces nocturnal convective storms that produce twice as much rainfall over the lake than over the surrounding terrain. Occasionally [[thunderstorm]]s can be accompanied by frequent cloud to ground [[lightning]], strong [[wind]]s and damaging [[hail]], especially during the onset of the rainy season and over higher elevations. [[Snow]]fall is frequent above {{convert|5000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} during the rainy season, and occasional above {{convert|3800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} between May and August.

Some representative averages
* [[Chachapoyas, Peru]]; {{convert|2435|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|15.3|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|796|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Oceanic climate|Cwb]]. 
* [[Cusco|Cuzco]], Peru; {{convert|3249|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|12.5|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|736|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Oceanic climate|Cwb]].&lt;ref name="klimadiagramme"&gt;http://www.klimadiagramme.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern lowlands==
The eastern lowlands are characterized by the [[Equatorial climate]] which feeds the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. The climate of this region is hot and rainy most of the year. Temperatures oscillate between {{convert|18|–|36|°C|°F|1}} most of the year and rainfall varies between {{convert|1000|and|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. South of 8°S, a short dry season occurs between June and August. Occasional cold surges that originate over [[Argentina]] may lower the temperature to {{convert|10|–|15|°C|°F}}. These events occur 1–5 times per year between May and September.

Some representative averages:

* [[Iquitos]], Peru; {{convert|126|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, annual mean temperature {{convert|26.2|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|2853|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Equatorial climate|Af]]. 
* [[Yurimaguas]], Peru; {{convert|184|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|26.9|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|2047|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Equatorial climate|Af]].&lt;ref name="klimadiagramme"/&gt;

===2009 winter===
From April to July 2009, unusually cold weather resulted in the deaths of more than 100 children under the age of five.&lt;ref name="Almost 250 children"/&gt;  In June, there were 50,000 suffering from acute respiratory infections, and 4,851 with pneumonia.  Between mid April and mid June, 61 children perished.&lt;ref name="soe"/&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] reported over 13,500 cases of [[pneumonia]], and more than 60,000 cases of [[respiratory infection]]s.  The [[Adventist Development and Relief Agency]] (ADRA) is distributing blankets and warm clothing.  Whereas pneumonia cases resulting in death of infants (who are often underclothed, if not barefoot) are the norm during winter, the 2009 winter season was unusual in that it began 12 weeks earlier than usual.  More than 80 of the deaths occurred in [[Puno]], Peru, one of the larger cities of the [[Altiplano]] lying in the central [[Andes]].  The children suffering from malnourishment are the population at greatest risk in an impoverished southern area of Peru lacking health care facilities.&lt;ref name="Almost 250 children"&gt;{{cite web

Yehude Simon, presidential Cabinet Chief, reported that 27 million [[Peruvian nuevo sol|S/]] or [[United States dollar|US$]]9 million was allotted for [[Puno]] and 23,230 vaccine{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} doses were shipped out.  Oscar Ugarte, the Health Minister reported that only 234 of these vaccines were administered.  Carmen Vildoso, Minister of Women's Affairs is working at developing a program to create solar panel heated walls in residential homes to provide heating.

In June, Percy Zaga Bustinza, Director of Puno's Social Development reported that a new [[Pinaya]] health centre would be opening up and also a small hospital in [[Santa Lucia]].  [[UNICEF]] would like action taken so that the deaths from the predictable cold weather can be prevented. As well preventative measures should be put in place so that the cold weather does not arise in an emergency situation anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  School hours were modified for the children's school days so they are not out in the coldest part of the day.  By the middle of June, livestock and crops had been adversely affected by the cold weather across {{convert|92000|ha|acre|0}} of land. In July 2009, a [[state of emergency]] was declared by [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of Peru]] [[Alan García Pérez]] in 11 regions of Peru: [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac]], [[Arequipa Region|Arequipa]], [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]], [[Cusco Region|Cusco]], [[Huancavelica Region|Huancavelica]], [[Junín Region|Junín]], [[Lima Region|Lima]], [[Moquegua Region|Moquegua]], [[Pasco Region|Pasco]], [[Puno Region|Puno]] and [[Tacna Region|Tacna]].&lt;ref name="soe"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =2009-07-12 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The cold winter weather is expected to end in September.&lt;ref name="soe"/&gt;

=== 2010 state of emergency ===
In July 2010, the Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in 16 of Peru's 24 regions due to cold weather. The majority of the areas affected are in the south, where temperatures have dropped to as low as -24C. Lima recorded its lowest temperatures in 38 years at 9C, and emergency measures have been applied to several of its outlying districts. In the Amazon region temperatures dropped to as low as 9C, the fifth recorded cold spell this year. In the south, hundreds of people - nearly half of them very young children - are reported as having died of cold-related diseases such as pneumonia, and poor rural populations living at more than 3,000m above sea level being the most affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[Germany]] the Official Municipality Key serves [[statistics|statistical]] purposes and is issued by the statistics offices of individual German [[States of Germany|states]].  The municipality key is to be indicated in instances such as changing residence on the notice of departure or registration documents.  This is done at the registration office in every town's [[city hall (administration)|city hall]].

=== Structure ===
The municipality key consists of eight digits, which are generated as follows: The {{color|red|'''first two numbers'''}} designate the individual German state.  The {{color|blue|'''third digit'''}} designates the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead).  The {{color|green|'''fourth and fifth digits'''}} designate the number of the urban area (in a district-free city) or the district (in a city with districts).  The {{color|purple|'''sixth, seventh, and eighth digits'''}} indicate the municipality or the number of the unincorporated area.

==== Examples ====

===Structure===

Usually known as the municipal code or {{va|PSGC code}}, the number comprises nine digits rrppmmbbb, for which rr = region code, pp = province code, {{nowrap|1=mm = city / municipality}} code, bbb = barangay code.

For example, the municipality of [[Ubay, Bohol]] has a code of 071246000 meaning region 07 (Central Visayas), province 12 (Bohol), municipality 46 (Ubay) with barangay code of zero signifying "not at this level." [[Bongbong]], one of its constituent barangays, has a code of 071246007.

The province code is unique and is independent of the region code. All PSGCs, are therefore, unique.

== Sweden ==
A '''kommunkod''' (municipal code) is a numerical code given to all [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] by the Swedish tax authorities.  The code consists of four digits, the first two indicating which [[counties of Sweden|county]] the municipality is situated in, and the last two specific for the municipality.

The code system was introduced with the municipal reform of 1952. There were three different categories of municipalities at the time, which affected the number that they were allocated. Those with [[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]-status (cities) were given codes ending in 80 to 99, smaller towns ([[köping]]) 60 to 79 and [[Rural municipality|rural municipalities]] 01 to 59. The county seats were allocated codes ending in 80.

As part of the reform in the early 1970s, the categorization of municipalities was abolished, but the code was in most cases preserved. When several municipalities were merged, the code for the biggest municipality was kept.

'''Crocker Range National Park''' ({{lang-ms|Taman Negara Banjaran Crocker}}) was established in 1984, although the area had previously been under protection as a forest reserve. It covers the north-south [[Crocker Range]], of 1200-1800 metre mountains in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. In the vicinity of park headquarter, there is a resort that provides accommodation and food services. Other visitors facilities such as an exhibition centre, insectarium, fernarium, observation tower and trekking trail can also be found.

The park covers 1,399&amp;nbsp;km², making it the largest park in Sabah. The park consists of both hill and mountain forest, with many species of flora and fauna [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to Borneo. Maintenance of this forest cover is essential to ensuring a pure water supply for many of the towns and communities in Sabah.

The park contains at least five species of [[primates]], such as the [[orang-utan]], [[gibbon]]s and the furry [[tarsier]] with its enormous round eyes, and extremely sociable long-tailed [[macaques]].  The Padas River bisects the range between [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]] and [[Tenom]].

Crocker Range Park is administered by [[Sabah Parks]].

[[File:Amundsen Expedition at South Pole.jpg|300px|thumb|alt= In an icebound landscape four figures stand, left, facing a small pointed tent from which two triangular flags are flying.|Amundsen's Norwegian party stand at the South Pole, 17 December 1911. They had reached 90°S two days earlier.]]

'''Farthest South''' was the most southerly [[latitude]]s reached by explorers before the conquest of the [[South Pole]] in 1911. Significant steps on the road to the pole were the discovery of lands south of [[Cape Horn]] in 1619, [[Captain James Cook]]'s crossing of the [[Antarctic Circle]] in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the [[Antarctic]] mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in [[Roald Amundsen]]'s success in December 1911.

In the years before reaching the pole was a realistic objective, other motives drew adventurers southward. Initially, the driving force was the discovery of new trade routes between Europe and the Far East. After such routes had been established and the main geographical features of the earth had been broadly mapped, the lure for mercantile adventurers was the great fertile continent of "[[Terra Australis]]" which, according to myth, lay hidden in the south. Belief in the existence of this supposed land of plenty persisted well into the 18th century; explorers were reluctant to accept the truth that slowly emerged, of a cold, harsh environment in the lands of the [[Southern Ocean]].

James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 demonstrated conclusively the likely hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused a shift of emphasis in the first half of the 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental [[Antarctica]] in 1898–99 ([[Adrien de Gerlache]]), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and [[Ernest Shackleton]] during the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.

==Early voyagers==
[[Image:Antarctica Map.png|350px|thumb|right|Antarctica and surrounding islands, showing [[Tierra del Fuego]] and the [[Auckland Islands]]]]

In 1494, the principal maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a [[Treaty of Tordesillas|treaty which drew a line]] down the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Indian Ocean]], which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route.&lt;ref&gt;Knox-Johnston, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Arctic, there is no evidence of human visitation or habitation in Antarctica or the islands around it prior to [[Age of Exploration|European exploration]]. However, the most southerly parts of South America were already inhabited by tribes such as the [[Selknam people|Selk'nam/Ona]], the [[Yaghan people|Yagán/Yámana]], the [[Alacaluf people|Alacaluf]] and the [[Haush]].&lt;ref name="furlong"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlong |first=Charles Wellington |authorlink=Charles W.

Fuegian Indian artifacts and canoe remnants have also been discovered on the [[Falkland Islands]], suggesting the capacity for even longer sea journeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url =  http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5400340 | author = G.

While the natives of Tierra del Fuego were not capable of true oceanic travel, there is some evidence of [[Polynesia]]n visits to some of the [[New Zealand Sub antarctic Islands|sub antarctic islands to the south of New Zealand]], although these are further from Antarctica than South America. There are also remains of a Polynesian settlement dating back to the 13th century on [[Enderby Island]] in the [[Auckland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Tom ''Polynesians in the Southern Ocean: Occupation of the Auckland Islands in Prehistory'' in New Zealand Geographic 69 (September–October 2004): 6–8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Atholl J., &amp; Gerard R.

''Subpolar Settlement in South Polynesia'' Antiquity 79.306 (2005): 791–800&lt;/ref&gt; According to ancient legends, around the year 650  the Polynesian traveler [[Ui-te-Rangiora]] led a fleet of [[Waka (canoe)|Waka Tīwai]] south until they reached "a place of bitter cold where rock-like structures rose from a solid sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bitter Place of Cold |url=http://www.discoveryuk.com/web/discovering-antarctica/timeline/ |publisher=The Discovery Channel |accessdate=14 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629181745/http://www.discoveryuk.com/web/discovering-antarctica/timeline/ |archivedate=29 June 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear from the legends how far south Ui-te-Rangiora penetrated, but it appears that he observed ice in large quantities. A shard of undated, unidentified pottery, reported as found in 1886 in the [[Antipodes Islands]], has been associated with this expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Nga-Iwi-O-Aotea|url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao59TeA/c18.html|journal= Te Ao Hou (The Maori Magazine)|date= June 1967|issue= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferdinand Magellan===
{{Main article|Ferdinand Magellan}}
[[File:Magellan 1810 engraving.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Head and shoulders of a heavily-bearded man wearing a cloak and a soft hat|Ferdinand Magellan]]
Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan transferred his allegiance to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Spain]], on whose behalf he left [[Seville]] on 10 August 1519, with a squadron of five ships, in search of a western route to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref name="ucalgary"&gt;{{cite web|title=The European Voyages of Exploration: Ferdinand Magellan |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/magellan.html |publisher=University of Calgary |year=1997 |accessdate=28 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917033900/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/magellan.html |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the [[South America]]n land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach [[49th parallel south|latitude 49°S]] on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of [[Puerto San Julian]].&lt;ref name="ucalgary" /&gt;

In September 1520, the voyage continued down the uncharted coast, and on 21 October reached [[52nd parallel south|52°S]]. Here Magellan found a deep inlet which proved to be [[Strait of Magellan|the strait he was seeking]], later to be known by his name.&lt;ref name="ucalgary" /&gt; Early in November 1520, as the squadron navigated through the strait, they reached its most southerly point at approximate [[54th parallel south|latitude 54°S]]. This was a record Farthest South for a European navigator, though not the farthest southern penetration by man; the position was north of the [[Tierra del Fuego]] archipelago, where there is evidence of human settlement dating back  thousands of years.&lt;ref name= midden&gt;{{cite web|title=  Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens – Ancient Village or Settlement in Chile|last= Hogan|first= C.

===Francisco de Hoces===
{{Main article|Francisco de Hoces}}
The first sighting of an ocean passage to the Pacific south of Tierra del Fuego is sometimes attributed to Francisco de Hoces of the [[Loaisa Expedition]]. In January 1526 his ship ''San Lesmes'' was blown south from the Atlantic entrance of the [[Magellan Strait]] to a point where the crew thought they saw a headland, and water beyond it, which indicated the southern extremity of the continent. It is speculation as to which headland they saw; conceivably it was [[Cape Horn]]. In parts of the Spanish-speaking world it is believed that de Hoces may have discovered the strait later known as the [[Drake Passage]] more than 50&amp;nbsp;years before Sir Francis Drake, the British [[privateer]].&lt;ref name= espanolas&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyarzun|first= Javier|title=  Expediciones españolas al Estrecho de Magallanes y Tierra de Fuego|year= 1976|location= Madrid|publisher= Ediciones Cultura Hispánica|isbn= 84-7232-130-4}} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sir Francis Drake===
{{Main article|Francis Drake{{!}}Sir Francis Drake}}
[[File:1590 or later Marcus Gheeraerts, Sir Francis Drake Buckland Abbey, Devon.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Man with high forehead and short pointed beard, in dark clothing which incorporates a shining leather or metallic collar. His right hand is resting on a globe of the world.|Sir Francis Drake]]
Sir Francis Drake sailed from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, in command of a fleet of five ships under his flagship ''Pelican'', later renamed the ''Golden Hinde''. His principal objective was plunder, not exploration; his initial targets were the unfortified Spanish towns on the Pacific coasts of Chile and Peru. Following Magellan's route, Drake reached Puerto San Julian on 20 June. After nearly two months in harbour, Drake left the port with a reduced fleet of three ships and a small [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinnace]]. His ships entered the Magellan Strait on 23 August and emerged in the Pacific Ocean on 6 September.&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;Knox-Johnston, pp. 40–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake set a course to the north-west, but on the following day a gale scattered the ships. The ''Marigold'' was sunk by a giant wave; the ''Elizabeth'' managed to return into the Magellan Strait, later sailing eastwards back to England; the pinnace was lost later. The gales persisted for more than seven weeks. The ''Golden Hinde'' was driven far to the west and south, before clawing its way back towards land. On 22 October, the ship anchored off an island which Drake named "[[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]]", where wood for the galley fires was collected and seals and penguins captured for food.&lt;ref name="Knox" /&gt;

According to Drake's Portuguese pilot, Nuno da Silva, their position at the anchorage was [[57th parallel south|57°S]]. However, there is no island at that latitude. The as yet undiscovered [[Diego Ramírez Islands]], at 56°30'S, are treeless and cannot have been the islands where Drake's crew collected wood. This indicates that the navigational calculation was faulty, and that Drake landed at or near the then unnamed [[Cape Horn]], possibly on [[Hornos Island|Horn Island]] itself. His final southern latitude can only be speculated as that of Cape Horn, at 55°59'S. In his report, Drake wrote: "The Uttermost Cape or headland of all these islands stands near 56 degrees, without which there is no main island to be seen to the southwards but that the Atlantic Ocean and the South Sea meet." This open sea south of Cape Horn became known as the Drake Passage even though Drake himself did not traverse it.&lt;ref name=Knox/&gt;

===Willem Schouten===
{{Main article|Willem Schouten}}
On 14 June 1615, Willem Schouten, with two ships ''Eendracht'' and ''Hoorn'',  set sail from [[Texel]] in the [[Netherlands]] in search of a western route to the Pacific. ''Hoorn'' was lost in a fire, but ''Eendracht'' continued southward. On 29 January 1616, Schouten reached what he discerned to be the southernmost cape of the South American continent; he named this point ''Kaap Hoorn'' (Cape Horn) after his hometown and his lost ship. Schouten's navigational readings are inaccurate—he placed Cape Horn at 57°48' south, when its actual position is 55°58'. His claim to have reached 58° south is unverified, although he sailed on westward to become the first European navigator to reach the Pacific via the Drake Passage.&lt;ref name= KJ57&gt;Knox-Johnston, pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garcia de Nodal expedition===
{{Main article|Garcia de Nodal expedition}}
The next recorded navigation of the Drake Passage was achieved in February 1619, by the brothers Bartolome and Gonzalo Garcia de Nodal. The Garcia de Nodal expedition discovered a small group of islands about {{convert|60|nmi|km mi|sigfig=1}} south-west of Cape Horn, at latitude 56°30'S. They named these the Diego Ramirez Islands after the expedition's pilot. The islands remained the most southerly known land on earth until Captain James Cook's discovery of the [[South Sandwich Islands]] in 1775.&lt;ref name=KJ60&gt;Knox-Johnston, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discoveries===
Other voyages brought further discoveries in the southern oceans; in August 1592, the English seaman John Davis had taken shelter "among certain Isles never before discovered"—presumed to be the [[Falkland Islands]].&lt;ref name=Robin&gt;Knox-Johnston, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn| Other claims to the Falklands discovery have been made, particularly that of Netherlander [[Sebald de Weert]] in 1600, hence the early name for the group "Sebaldine Islands".&lt;ref name= KJ57/&gt;|group= n}} In 1675, the English merchant voyager [[Anthony de la Roché]] visited [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] (the first [[Antarctic]] land discovered); in 1739 the Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier|Jean-Baptiste Bouvet de Lozier]] discovered the remote [[Bouvet Island]], and in 1772 his compatriot, [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen de Trémarec]], found the [[Kerguelen Islands]].&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|title= An Antarctic Timeline | url = http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm|publisher= South-pole.com|accessdate= 29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second of James Cook's historic voyages, 1772–1775, was primarily a search for the elusive [[Terra Australis Incognita]] that was still believed to lie somewhere in the unexplored latitudes below [[40th parallel south|40°S]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; Cook left England in September 1772 with two ships, [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']] and [[HMS Adventure (1771)|HMS ''Adventure]]. After pausing at Cape Town, on 22 November the two ships sailed due south, but were driven to the east by heavy gales.&lt;ref name=Coleman56&gt;Coleman, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; They managed to edge further south, encountering their first [[pack ice]] on 10 December. This soon became a solid barrier, which tested Cook's seamanship as he manoeuvered for a passage through.&lt;ref name=Coleman56/&gt; Eventually, he found open water, and was able to continue south; on 17 January 1773, the expedition reached the Antarctic Circle at 66°20'S,&lt;ref name="Coleman_59"&gt;Coleman, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; the first ships to do so. Further progress was barred by ice, and the ships turned north-eastwards and headed for New Zealand, which they reached on 26 March.&lt;ref name="Coleman_59" /&gt;

During the ensuing months, the expedition explored the southern Pacific Ocean before Cook took ''Resolution'' south again—''Adventure'' had retired back to South Africa after a fracas with the New Zealand native population.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This time Cook was able to penetrate deep beyond the Antarctic Circle, and on 30 January 1774 reached 71°10'S, his Farthest South,&lt;ref name= P11&gt;Preston, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but the state of the ice made further southward travel impossible. This southern record would hold for 49&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of his voyages in Antarctic waters, Cook had encircled the world at latitudes generally above [[60th parallel south|60°S]], and saw nothing but bleak inhospitable islands, without a hint of the fertile continent which some still hoped lay in the south. Cook wrote that if any such continent existed it would be "a country doomed by nature", and that "no man will venture further than I have done, and the land to the South will never be explored". He concluded: "Should the impossible be achieved and the land attained, it would be wholly useless and of no benefit to the discoverer or his nation".&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Searching for land===
Despite Cook's prediction, the early 19th century saw numerous attempts to penetrate southward, and to discover new lands. In 1819, [[William Smith (mariner)|William Smith]], in command of the [[brigantine]] ''Williams'', discovered the [[South Shetland Islands]],&lt;ref name=Robin85&gt;Knox-Johnston, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year [[Edward Bransfield]], in the same ship, sighted the [[Trinity Peninsula]] at the northern extremity of [[Graham Land]].&lt;ref name=Robin85/&gt; A few days before Bransfield's discovery, on 27 January 1820, the Russian captain [[Fabian von Bellingshausen]], in another Antarctic sector, had come within sight of the coast of what is now known as [[Queen Maud Land]]. He is thus credited as the first person to see the continent's mainland, although he did not make this claim himself.&lt;!--not even a mention of Palmer and Graham?--&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robin85/&gt; Bellingshausen made two circumnavigations mainly in latitudes between 60 and 67°S, and in January 1821 reached his most southerly point at 70°S, in a longitude close to that in which Cook had made his record 47 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, pp. 396–97&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821 the American sealing captain [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]] led a party which landed on an uncharted stretch of land beyond the South Shetlands. "I think this Southern Land to be a Continent", he wrote in his ship's log. If  his landing was not on an island, his party were the first to set foot on the Antarctic continent.&lt;ref name="Barczewski, p. 19"&gt;Barczewski, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Weddell===
{{main article|James Weddell}}
James Weddell was an [[Anglo-Scottish]] seaman who saw service in both the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Merchant Navy|merchant marine]] before undertaking his first voyages to Antarctic waters. In 1819, in command of the 160-ton [[brigantine]] ''Jane'' which had been adapted for whaling, he set sail for the newly discovered whaling grounds of the South Sandwich Islands. His chief interest on this voyage was in finding the "[[Aurora Islands]]", which had been reported at [[53rd parallel south|53°S]], [[48th meridian west|48°W]] by the Spanish ship ''Aurora'' in 1762.  He failed to discover this non-existent land, but his sealing activities showed a handsome profit.&lt;ref name= Howgego/&gt;
[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Stylized drawing of two sailing ships caught in rough seas, surrounded by towering icebergs.|Weddell's ships, ''Jane'' and ''Beaufort'', under full sail]]
In 1822 Weddell, again in command of ''Jane'' and this time accompanied by the smaller ship ''Beaufort'', set sail for the south with instructions from his employers that, should the sealing prove barren, he was to "investigate beyond the track of former navigators". This suited Weddell's exploring instincts, and he equipped his vessel with chronometers, thermometers, compasses, barometers and charts.&lt;ref name= Howgego/&gt; In January 1823 he probed the waters between the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands, looking for new land. Finding none, he turned southward down the [[40th meridian west|40°W meridian]], deep into the sea that now bears his name.{{refn| Weddell intended to call the sea "Sea of George IV", but this name was not adopted, and it became the [[Weddell Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; |group= n}} The season was unusually calm, and Weddell reported that "not a particle of ice of any description was to be seen".&lt;ref name= Howgego/&gt; On 20 February 1823, he reached a new Farthest South of 74°15'S, three degrees beyond Cook's former record.  Unaware that he was close to land, Weddell decided to return northward from this point, convinced that the sea continued as far as the South Pole.&lt;ref name= Howgego&gt;{{cite book

Another two days' sailing would likely have brought him within sight of [[Coats Land]], which was not discovered until 1904, by [[William Speirs Bruce]] during the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], 1902–04.&lt;ref&gt;Speak, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to England, Weddell's claim to have exceeded Cook's record by such a margin "caused some raised eyebrows", but was soon accepted.&lt;ref name= Howgego/&gt;

===Benjamin Morrell===
{{main article|Benjamin Morrell}}
In November 1823, the American sealing captain Benjamin Morrell reached the South Sandwich Islands in the schooner ''Wasp''.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own later account he then sailed south, unconsciously following the track taken by James Weddell a month previously. Morrell claimed to have reached 70°14'S, at which point he turned north because the ship's stoves were running short of fuel—otherwise, he says, he could have "reached 85° without the least doubt".&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, pp. 65–68&lt;/ref&gt; After turning, he claimed to have encountered land which he described in some detail, and which he named [[New South Greenland]]. This land proved not to exist. Morrell's reputation as a liar and a fraud means that most of his geographical claims have been dismissed by scholars, although attempts have been made to rationalize his assertions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 434–435&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Clark Ross===
{{main article|James Clark Ross}}
James Clark Ross's 1839–43 Antarctic expedition in [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] and [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']] was a full-scale Royal Naval enterprise, the principal function of which was to test current theories on [[magnetism]], and to try to locate the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer [[Sir John Herschel]], and was supported by the [[Royal Society]] and the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name=Coleman326&gt;Coleman, pp. 326–28&lt;/ref&gt; Ross had considerable past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he had been a member of a party that had reached the location of the [[North Magnetic Pole]],&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and he was an obvious choice as commander.&lt;ref name=Coleman326/&gt;
[[File:James Clark Ross.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt= A man in ceremonial naval uniform looks right, gaping a large sword in his right hand. A navigational instrument stands on a table, lower right.|Captain Sir James Clark Ross]]
The expedition left England on 30 September 1839, and after a voyage that was slowed by the many stops required to carry out work on magnetism, it reached [[Tasmania]] in August 1840.&lt;ref name=Coleman326/&gt; Following a three-month break imposed by the southern winter, they sailed south-east on 12 November 1840, and crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on 1 January 1841. On 11 January a long mountainous coastline that stretched to the south was sighted. Ross named the land [[Victoria Land]], and the mountains the [[Admiralty Range]]. He followed the coast southwards and passed Weddell's Farthest South point of 74°15'S on 23 January. A few days later, as they moved further eastward to avoid shore ice, they were met by the sight of twin volcanoes (one of them active), which were named [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]], in honour of the expedition's ships.&lt;ref name=Coleman329&gt;Coleman, pp. 329–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]] (later to be called the "Ross Ice Shelf") stretched away east of these mountains, forming an impassable obstacle to further southward progress. In his search for a strait or inlet, Ross explored {{convert|300|nmi|km mi|sigfig=2}} along the edge of the barrier, and reached an approximate latitude of [[78th parallel south|78°S]] on or about 8 February 1841.&lt;ref name=Coleman329/&gt; He failed to find a suitable anchorage that would have allowed the ships to over-winter, so he returned to Tasmania, arriving there in April 1841.&lt;ref name=Coleman329/&gt;

The following season Ross returned and located an inlet in the Barrier face that enabled him, on 23 January 1842, to extend his Farthest South to 78°09'30"S,&lt;ref name="Coleman, p. 335"&gt;Coleman, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; a record which would remain unchallenged for 58&amp;nbsp;years. Although Ross had not been able to land on the Antarctic continent, nor approach the location of the South Magnetic Pole, on his return to England in 1843 he was [[knighthood|knighted]] for his achievements in geographical and scientific exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

==Explorers of the Heroic Age==
{{main article|Heroic Era of Antarctic exploration}}

The oceanographic research voyage known as the [[Challenger Expedition]], 1872–76, explored Antarctic waters for several weeks, but did not approach the land itself; its research, however, proved the existence of an Antarctic continent beyond reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Evidence for the existence of an Antarctic continent came from the rocks dredged from the sea floor after being carried there in icebergs and deposited as the icebergs melted.&lt;ref&gt;McGonigal. p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;  |group= n}}

The impetus for what would become known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration came in 1893, when in a lecture to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] Professor [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]] called for a resumption of Antarctic exploration: "a steady, continuous, laborious and systematic exploration of the whole southern region".&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this call with an appeal to British patriotism: "Is the last great piece of maritime exploration on the surface of our Earth to be undertaken by Britons, or is it to be left to those who may be destined to succeed or supplant us on the Ocean?"&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; During the following quarter-century, fifteen expeditions from eight different nations rose to this challenge. In the patriotic spirit engendered by Murray's call, and under the influence of RGS president [[Sir Clements Markham]], British endeavours in the following years gave particular weight to the achievement of new Farthest South records,&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop the character of a race for the South Pole.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian-born [[Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink]] had emigrated to Australia in 1888, where he worked on survey teams in Queensland and New South Wales before accepting a schoolteaching post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Borchgrevink, Carsten Egeberg (1864–1934) | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070353b.htm|publisher= Australian Dictionary of Biography—online edition|accessdate= 9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 he joined a sealing and whaling expedition to the Antarctic, led by [[Henryk Bull]]. In January 1895 Borchgrevink was one of a group from that expedition that claimed the first confirmed landing on the Antarctic continent, at [[Cape Adare]].&lt;ref name=Carsten&gt;{{cite web|title= Carsten Borchgrevink 1864–1934 | url = http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm| publisher= South-pole.com|accessdate= 29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Borchgrevink's group may have been preceded on the Antarctic mainland by John Davis  in the Antarctic Peninsula, in 1821, but Davis's landing might  have been on an island.&lt;ref name="Barczewski, p. 19"&gt;Barczewski, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; |group= n}} Borchgrevink determined to return with his own expedition, which would overwinter and explore inland, with the location of the South Magnetic Pole as an objective.&lt;ref name=Carsten/&gt;

Borchgrevink went to England, where he was able to persuade the publishing magnate [[George Newnes|Sir George Newnes]] to finance him to the extent of £40,000,&lt;ref name=Carsten/&gt; equivalent to £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK-GDP|40000|1898}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK-GDP}},{{inflation-fn|UK-GDP}} with the sole stipulation that, despite the shortage of British participants, the venture be styled the "British Antarctic Expedition".&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 4"&gt;Preston, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This was by no means the grand British expedition envisaged by Markham and the geographical establishment, who were hostile and dismissive of Borchgrevink.&lt;ref name=Crane/&gt; On 23 August 1898 the expedition ship ''Southern Cross'' left London for the [[Ross Sea]], reaching Cape Adare on 17 February 1899. Here a shore party was landed and was the first to over-winter on the Antarctic mainland, in a prefabricated hut.&lt;ref name=Carsten/&gt;

In January 1900, ''Southern Cross'' returned, picked up the shore party and, following the route which Ross had taken 60&amp;nbsp;years previously, sailed southward to the Great Ice Barrier, which they discovered had retreated some {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=2}} south since the days of Ross.&lt;ref name=Carsten/&gt; A party consisting of Borchgrevink, William Colbeck and a [[Sami people|Sami]] named [[Per Savio]] landed with sledges and dogs. This party ascended the Barrier and made the first sledge journey on the barrier surface; on 16 February 1900 they extended the Farthest South record to 78°50'S.&lt;ref name= P13&gt;Preston, pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; On its return to England later in 1900, Borchgrevink's expedition was received without enthusiasm, despite its new southern record. Historian David Crane commented that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his contribution to Antarctic knowledge might have been better received, but "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was never going to be taken seriously".&lt;ref name=Crane&gt;Crane, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Falcon Scott===
{{main article|Discovery Expedition}}

The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04 was [[Captain Scott]]'s first Antarctic command. Although according to [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]] the intention was to "reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land",&lt;ref&gt;Wilson diary, 12 June 1902, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; there is nothing in Scott's writings, nor in the official objectives of the expedition, to indicate that the pole was a definite goal. However, a southern journey towards the pole was within Scott's formal remit to "explore the ice barrier of Sir James Ross&amp;nbsp;... and to endeavour to solve the very important physical and geographical questions connected with this remarkable ice formation".&lt;ref&gt;Savours, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern journey was undertaken by Scott, Wilson and [[Ernest Shackleton]]. The party set out on 1 November 1902 with various teams in support, and one of these, led by [[Michael Barne]], passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South mark on 11 November, an event recorded with great high spirits in Wilson's diary.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson diary, 11 November, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The march continued, initially in favourable weather conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson's diary entry for 15 December, p. 225, refers to a "blazing hot day"&lt;/ref&gt; but encountered increasing difficulties caused by the party's lack of ice travelling experience and the loss of all its dogs through a combination of poor diet and overwork.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 205, pp. 223–27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[80th parallel south|80°S]] mark was passed on 2 December,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson diary, 3 December, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; and four weeks later, on 30 December 1902, Wilson and Scott took a short ski trip from their southern camp to set a new Farthest South at (according to their measurements) 82°17'S.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson diary, 30 December, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern maps, correlated with Shackleton's photograph and Wilson's drawing, put their final camp at 82°6'S, and the point reached by Scott and Wilson at 82°11'S, {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|sigfig=2}} beyond  Borchgrevink's mark.&lt;ref name= Crane214&gt;Crane, pp. 214–15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ernest Shackleton===
{{main article|Nimrod Expedition}}
[[File:Nimrod South 9 Jan 09.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Three men in heavy clothing stand in line on an icy surface, next to a flagstaff from which flies the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|From left to right: Jameson Adams, Frank Wild and Eric Marshall (photographed by Shackleton) plant the Union flag at their southernmost position, 88°23', on 9 January 1909.]]
After his share in the Farthest South achievement of the Discovery Expedition, [[Ernest Shackleton]] suffered a physical collapse on the return journey, and was sent home with the expedition's relief vessel on orders from Scott;&lt;ref&gt;Riffenburgh, pp. 87–89&lt;/ref&gt; he bitterly resented it, and the two became rivals.  Four years later, Shackleton organised his own polar venture, the Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. This was the first expedition to set the definite objective of reaching the South Pole, and to have a specific strategy for doing so.&lt;ref name="Riff"&gt;Riffenburgh, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist his endeavour, Shackleton adopted a mixed transport strategy, involving the use of Manchurian ponies as pack animals, as well as the more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken.&lt;ref name="Riff" /&gt; Although the dogs and the car were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.&lt;ref&gt;Riffenburgh, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Shackleton]] and three companions ([[Frank Wild]], [[Eric Marshall]] and [[Jameson Adams]]) began their march on 29 October 1908. On 26 November they surpassed the farthest point reached by Scott's 1902 party. "A day to remember", wrote Shackleton in his journal, noting that they had reached this point in far less time than on the previous march with Captain Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riffenburgh, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton's group continued southward, discovering and ascending the [[Beardmore Glacier]] to the polar plateau,&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh"&gt;Riffenburgh, pp. 227–33&lt;/ref&gt; and then marching on to reach their Farthest South point at 88°23'S, a mere {{convert|97|nmi|km mi}} from the pole, on 9 January 1909. Here they planted the Union Jack presented to them by [[Queen Alexandra]], and took possession of the plateau in the name of [[King Edward VII]],&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; before shortages of food and supplies forced them to turn back north.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh" /&gt; This was, at the time, the closest convergence on either pole.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh" /&gt; The increase of more than six degrees south from Scott's previous record was the greatest extension of Farthest South since Captain Cook's 1773 mark. Shackleton was treated as a hero on his return to England.&lt;ref&gt;Riffenburgh, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; His record was to stand for less than three years, being passed by Amundsen on 7 December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen (Vol II), pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polar conquest==
{{main article|Amundsen's South Pole expedition|Terra Nova Expedition}}

He is dressed formally, with a stiff white wing collar.|Roald Amundsen, leader of the first expedition to reach the South Pole, 15 December 1911]]
In the wake of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott organised the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the [[British Empire]] was an explicitly stated prime objective.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; As he planned his expedition, Scott saw no reason to believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]], who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans [[Frederick Cook]] and [[Robert Peary]]. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, pp. 207–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Amundsen concealed his revised intentions until his ship, ''Fram'', was in the Atlantic and beyond communication.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, pp. 283–88&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was notified by telegram that a rival was in the field, but had little choice other than to continue with his own plans.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ''Fram'' arrived at the Ross Ice Shelf on 11 January 1911, and by 14 January had found the inlet, or "[[Bay of Whales]]", where Borchgrevink had made his landing eleven years earlier. This became the location of Amundsen's base camp, ''[[Framheim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, pp. 297–98&lt;/ref&gt;

After nine months' preparation, Amundsen's polar journey began on 20 October 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding the known route to the polar plateau via the Beardmore Glacier, Amundsen led his party of five due south, reaching the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] on 16 November.&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen, pp. 33–40&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered the [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]], which provided them with a direct route to the polar plateau  and  on to the pole.  Shackleton's Farthest South mark was passed on 7 December, and the South Pole  was reached on 14 December 1911.&lt;ref name= A120&gt;Amundsen, pp 120–30&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian party's greater skills with the techniques of ice travel, using ski and dogs, had proved decisive in their success. Captain Scott's five-man team reached the same point 33&amp;nbsp;days later, and perished during their return journey.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; Since Cook's journeys, every expedition that had held the Farthest South record before Amundsen's conquest had been British; however, the final triumph indisputably belonged to the Norwegians.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

After Scott's retreat from the pole in January 1912, the location remained unvisited for nearly 18 years. On 28 November 1929, US Navy [[Commander]] (later [[Rear-Admiral]]) [[Richard E. Byrd]] and three others completed the first aircraft flight over the South Pole.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Twenty-seven years later, Rear-Admiral [[George J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8247">In [[surveying]], '''free stationing''' (also known as '''resection''') is a method of determining a location of one unknown point in relation to known points.&lt;ref name="Free Stationing" /&gt; There is a zero point of reference called a [[Total station]]. The instrument can be freely positioned so that all survey points are at a suitable sight from the instrument. Setting up the [[Total station]] on a known point, often it is not possible to see all survey points. With the Total Station, [[Bearing (navigation)|bearings]] and distances are measured to at least two known points of a [[control network]]. This with a [[Mobile device|handheld computer ]] recorded data is related to local [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], defined by the [[Theodolite#Concept of operation|Horizontal Circle]] of the total station. By a [[geometric transformation]], these polar coordinates are transformed to the coordinate system of the control network. Errors are distributed by [[least squares adjustment]]. The position and orientation of the Total Station in relation to where the [[Control network]] is established. 

==Comparison of methods==
* [[Angular resection]] and [[triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]]: only bearings are measured to the known points. 
* [[Trilateration]]: only distances are measured to the known points.
* Free stationing and [[wikt:triangulateration|triangulateration]]: both bearings and distances are measured to the known points.

==Naming==
Because bearings and distances in a Resection (Free Stationing) are measured, the result may have a different mathematical solution. This method of a "Total station set up" has different names in other languages, e.g. German: [[:de:Freie Standpunktwahl]] (Free Stationing).&lt;ref name="Free Stationing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose, Advantage, and Objective of Resection Setup|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406432/SC_Purpose,%20advantage%20and%20objective%20of%20resection%20setup.htm|website=Trimble knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Resnik"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Resnik/Bill|title=Vermessungskunde fuer den Planungs-, Bau- und Umweltbereich|publisher=Wichmann|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-87907-488-4|page=115|edition=3.|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Witte/Schmidt|title=Vermessungskunde und Grundlagen der Statistik fuer das Bauwesen|date=2006|publisher=Herbert Wichmann Verlag|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-87907-435-8|pages=180, 515|edition=6.|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moeser"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moeser/Hoffmeister/Mueller/Schlemmer/Staiger/Wanninger|title=Handbuch Ingenieurgeodäsie - Grundlagen|date=2012|publisher=Wichmann|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-87907-504-1|pages=461, 476|edition=4.|url=https://www.vde-verlag.de/buecher/ivz/9783879072934_inhaltsverzeichnis_00.pdf|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naming is also regulated by the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|German Institute for Standardization]] DIN 18 709.

==Different mathematical solution==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The axes and circles of a theodolite]][[Image:Examples of Polar Coordinates.svg|left|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees or (3,60°). In blue, the point (4,210°).]]
By measuring bearings and distances, local [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] are recorded. The orientation of this local polar coordinate system is defined by the 0° [[Theodolite#Concept of operation|Horizontal Circle]] of the [[Total station]] (polar axis L). The pole of this local polar coordinate system is the [[Theodolite#Concept of operation|Vertical Axis]] (pole O) of the Total Stations. The polar coordinates (r,f) with the pole are transformed with a [[Surveying#Software|Surveying Software]] in a [[Data logger|data collector]] to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (x,y) of the known points and the coordinates for the position of the Total station are calculated.&lt;ref name=Kahmen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahmen|first1=Heribert|title=Angewandte Geodaesie – Vermessungskunde –|date=2006|publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|isbn=978-3-11-018464-8|pages=281, 282, 519, 532, 613|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a resection (triangulation) measuring bearings only, there can be a problem with an infinite number of solutions called: "[[Snellius–Pothenot problem#The indeterminate case| danger circle]]" or "[[inscribed angle theorem]]".

==Design of the Backsight Point Configuration==
The back-sight points of the control network should cover and surround the stationing site. The position of the total station is not part of the area. This is the area where you want to measure with this station setup. Topographic points or stakeout points should not be measured outside this area. If measured outside this area, the errors in orientation will be extrapolated instead of being interpolated.&lt;ref name="BS Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Design of the Backsight Point Configuration|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406433/SC_Design%20of%20backsight%20point%20configuration%20in%20resection%20setup.htm|website=Trimble knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is possible to use only two known control points in a resection (free stationing), it is recommended to use three control points. There is no [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] for orientation, using two points only.&lt;ref name=Redundancy&gt;{{cite web|title=Problems in Resection Without Redundancy|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406436/SC_Problems%20in%20resection%20without%20redundancy.htm|website=Trimble knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using five or more points of the control network, there is only a slight improvement in the accuracy.&lt;ref name=Kahmen /&gt;&lt;ref name="BS Design" /&gt;

==Advantages==

* Choose the station point free for best visibility to all survey points
* Where there is no obstruction
* Where there is no traffic
* Where there is the highest safety for the observer and the instrument

Because of the range and accuracy of total stations, the method of a resection (free stationing) permits a great freedom of positioning the total station. For this reason, this method is one of the most used station set ups.&lt;ref name=Resnik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Witte /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moeser /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kahmen /&gt;

==Application==
[[File:PLANTA proceso.JPG|thumb|240px|Example of a Site plan.]]
With the calculated coordinates and orientation of the total station, it can be used to set out points in [[construction surveying]], [[machine guidance]], [[site plan]] or other [[Surveying#Types of surveys|types of surveys]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">'''GeoPlace''' is an organisation (LLP) that oversees the production and maintenance of the national address and street gazetteers, which are created and maintained with input from all [[local government|local authorities]] in England and Wales.  GeoPlace is a public sector limited liability partnership between the Local Government Association (LGA) and Ordnance Survey.

The [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]] (NLPG) and the [[National Street Gazetteer]] (NSG) are overseen by GeoPlace. The [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]] has been synchronised with address data from Ordnance Survey - [[OS MasterMap|Address Layer 2 (AL2)]]. AL2 also incorporates Royal Mail [[Postcode Address File|PAF]] data. The combination of datasets from Local Government and Ordnance Survey is designed to create one definitive national address [[gazetteer]]. Through agreement with Scotland's Improvement Service Company, coverage has been extended to include Scotland.

__TOC__

==History==

On 3 December 2010, the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] announced the formation of GeoPlace to provide a freely-available national address gazetteer. This is a joint venture between the [[Local Government Association]] and [[Ordnance Survey]], which involved the acquisition of Intelligent Addressing. The venture underwent a process of approval by the [[Office of Fair Trading]], which passed a judgement allowing the venture on 15 February 2011. The full text of the [http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/mergers_ea02/2011/OS-LGID.pdf OFT decision] was published on 23 February 2011.

At the equator, a geocell is approximately a 111x{{convert|111|km|mi}} square - but the east-west dimension of geocells gradually decreases and the shape of the geocell becomes increasingly [[trapezoidal]] towards the poles. At the North and South poles, geocells are distorted into long, thin triangles which are still approximately {{convert|111|km|mi}} in the north/south direction but with a base of just {{convert|969|m|feet}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3739">The '''geology of [[Bhutan]]''' is less well studied than many countries in Asia, together with the broader Eastern Himalayas region.  Older [[Paleozoic]] and [[Precambrian]] rocks often appear mixed together with younger sediments due to the [[Himalayan orogeny]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=83-86}}&lt;/ref &gt;

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
Geologic research in Bhutan began in the southwest between 1868 and 1907, followed by regional mapping in 1961 by the Geological Survey of India. A. Gansser led much of the geologic research from the late 1960s through the 1980s. 

Some of the oldest rocks in Bhutan are part of the Indian Shield in the Shillong Basement—part of a [[foreland basin]]. The Bhutanese foothills are separated from Precambrian crystalline rock by the 35 kilometer foreland, where rocks are fold and faulted newer tectonic events and covered in Quaternary sediments. The South Himalayan [[molasse]] is represented by the [[Siwalik Belt]], with four kilometers of siltstone, sandstone and conglomerates in the southeast. 

The Damuda Belt dates to the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] in the [[Paleozoic]] with coal seams, plant remnants and lenses of much younger [[Eocene]] limestone included during the Himalayan orogeny. 

The Lesser Himalayas, to the north of the Damuda Belt contain Precambrian sedimentary rocks such as slate, [[dolomite]] and several kilometers of [[quartzite]]. "Slices" of basement [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] form [[mylonite]] at the edges. These rocks are believed to be part of the Indian Shield and are one billion years old. Geologists also define the High Himalayan Crystalline rocks extending 150 kilometers from the Main Central Thrust to [[Tethys Ocean]] sediments in the north. [[Sillimanite]], [[garnet]] and [[biotite]] are especially common in this area. The Takhtsang monastery, carved into Takhtsang gneiss, is surrounded by rocks with calcsilicate lenses, interpreted as the "hand and foot prints" of Padmasambhva—an important founder of Bhutanese holy sites. This gneiss grades toward [[migmatite]], at higher elevations such as Masang Kang mountain. Geologists have dated the rock to 500 to 400 million years ago. The Paro marbles are widespread in southwest, forming massifs, while leuocogranites are common in dikes, sills and plutons in the northeast. 
Tethys Ocean, Tethyan sediments outcrop along the Tibetan border. The Lingshi Basin is one example, beginning with a foundation of marble and [[phyllite]] lying atop older crystalline rock, overlain by [[tillite]] and limestone. In the basin, migmatite gneiss is transgressed by calc-schist, breccia, quartzite, limestone and recrystallized fossils.  The Tang Chu Basin, on the other hand, holds Devonian rocks and fossils. 

Young faults and fracture zones formed in the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. These recent tectonic features are found in the central and east, often associated with hot springs. Research published in 1983 indicated seven glacial periods during the [[Pleistocene]], based on terminal [[moraine]] distribution.
 
==Natural resource geology==
Bhutan has small gypsum deposits in the Kuru Chu spur and limestones in the foothills of the Himalayas which are extracted locally for the cement industry. Coal seams, with 25 percent ash, are scattered throughout the Damudas region. The Tang-Chu area has high-quality Devonian slate used for roofing. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=86}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2242">The '''geology of [[Liechtenstein]]''' formed at the intersection of the Eastern and Western Alps and the country occupies a wider than average river valley on the [[Rhine River]], running north-south. A spur of the [[Ratikon Mountains]] flanks the river to the east, while Schellenberg hill is a defining topographic high in the north. 

==Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
The Santis-Drusberg Nappe (a [[nappe]] formation) crops out in the Schellenberg [[anticline]] containing [[Early Cretaceous]] marine sediments together with deeper water limestone and [[foraminifera]] fossils. 

From Dogger to Malm, in the Ultrahelvetic realm the Flascherberg is assembled from limestone and black [[shale]]. Geologists divide the Northern Flysch Nappes into the lower Uentschen Nappe and the upper Liechtenstein Flysch. The Southern Flysch Nappe includes the Prattigau Flysch, which "pinches out" near the northern border. The Uentschen Nappe is made up of [[turbidite]] sediments from the [[Maastrichtian]], while the Liechtenstein Flysch is geologically similar but younger—from the [[Paleocene]]. 

These tectonic structures are overlain by the Falknis Nappe, north of the village of Triesen and composed of [[Jurassic]] marine sediments. The Lechtal Nappe is the only prominent nappe in the Eastern Alps. 

During the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, the Rhine Glacier deepened the valley together with the Ill Glacier. Ancient Lake Constance flooded the area, deposited fine lake bed sediments which now cover much of the country's land surface. Major landslides were common into the early [[Holocene]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=506}}&lt;/ref &gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Liechtenstein has few natural resources, aside from alluvial gravel used by the local concrete industry. Gravel extraction from the river interfered with groundwater flows and was banned after 1972. Historically, peat was extracted in the north of the country, but this has also stopped.

      <comment>The size of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region was wrong in the sidebar. The sidebar in this article originally said the ISR was 906,430 km2 with land taking up 521,707 km2 of that. The ISR is actually 435,000 km2 with land taking up 90,650 km2 of that.

The '''Inuvialuit Settlement Region''' (ISR), located in Canada’s western [[Arctic]], was designated in 1984 in the [[Inuvialuit Final Agreement]] by the [[Government of Canada]] for the [[Inuvialuit]] people. It spans {{convert|90650|km2|abbr=on}} of land&lt;ref name="Government"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov.nt.ca/en/priorities/concluding-and-implementing-land-claim-and-self-government-agreements/inuvialuit|title=Concluding and Implementing Land Claim and Self-Government Agreements|publisher=Government of Northwest Territories|accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, mostly above the [[tree line]], and includes several subregions: the [[Beaufort Sea]], the [[Mackenzie River]] delta, the northern portion of [[Yukon]] ("Yukon North Slope"), the northwest portion of [[Northwest Territories]], and the western [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Islands]].&lt;ref name="Berkes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|author2=Rob Huebert |author3=Helen Fast |author4=Alan Diduck |author5=Micheline Manseau |others=Arctic Institute of North America|title=Breaking Ice: Renewable Resource and Ocean Management in the Canadian North|publisher=University of Calgary Press|date=2005|pages=95|isbn=1-55238-159-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKt--FmDOMAC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=%22Inuvialuit+Settlement+Region%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BhpxGQZLZw&amp;sig=cLLoaaYw5ECKa-CqxZQsRi_psjE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hc2-ScbbGZm0sQOp8-G1DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISR includes both [[crown land|Crown Lands]] and Inuvialuit Private Lands.

In the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canada Census]], the ISR population was 5,767 people, of which 3,115 were Inuvialuit and formed a majority in all six communities.&lt;ref name="inuvualuit"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-594/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=BAND&amp;Code1=61640004&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=61&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Inuvialuit&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=PR&amp;GeoCode=61640004 |title = 2006 Aboriginal Population Profile (Inuvialuit) |website = [[Statistics Canada]] |date = January 15, 2008 |accessdate = October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no communities in the Yukon North Slope. Of the six communities in the ISR all are located in the Northwest Territories&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; and, along with [[Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories|Fort McPherson]] and [[Tsiigehtchic]], form the [[Inuvik Region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/_live/documents/content/Administrative_regions.pdf Administrative Regions of the NWT]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inuvik]], located on the East Channel of the Mackenzie Delta, approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the region's administrative centre, home to the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation. The only other inland community, [[Aklavik]], is located on the Peel Channel and is home to [[Aurora College]]. [[Hunting]], [[fishing]] and [[Animal trapping|trapping]] are the major economic activities of [[Paulatuk]], in [[Amundsen Gulf]]'s [[Darnley Bay]], and [[Sachs Harbour]], the only permanent settlement on [[Banks Island]]. [[Tuktoyaktuk]], formerly known as "Port Brabant", is set on Kugmallit Bay, near the Mackenzie River Delta. It has the only deepwater port in the ISR. [[Ulukhaktok]], formerly known as "Holman", is located on the west coast of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]]. Printmaking has taken over as the primary source of income in recent years.

English is spoken in the entire region. Additionally, [[Siglitun]] is spoken in Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour and Tuktoyaktuk. [[Uummarmiutun]] is spoken in Inuvik and Aklavik. [[Inuinnaqtun]] is spoken in Ulukhaktok and nowhere else in the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref name="Balanoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwt.literacy.ca/resources/research/way/way.pdf|title="This is the way we were told": Multiple literacies in Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories|last=Balanoff|first=Helen|author2=Cynthia Chambers |author3=Alice Kaodloak |author4=Emily Kudlak |date=2006|work=Presented at the 15th International Inuit Studies Conference|publisher=nwt.literacy.ca|pages=2|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they are grouped under [[Inuvialuktun]].

'''Islands First''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] working on behalf of the [[Small Island Developing States]] to confront the challenges of [[climate change]], the depletion of ocean resources (including [[ocean acidification]] and [[biodiversity loss]]), and [[sea level rise|ocean level's rise]].

==Background and mission==
Small island countries have been the first to suffer the negative consequences of climate change and [[global warming]], despite bearing little responsibility for creating the problem. Islands First seeks to foster an appreciation for the need to rapidly cut [[carbon dioxide]] emissions with international policy makers.

Islands First's mission is to help the [[small island states]], who represent nearly one-quarter of the votes at the [[United Nations]] (UN), to become effective and vocal advocates for change within the most important forum for environmental progress by building the capacity of their UN missions to influence [[environmental policy]]. At over 40 nations strong, the Small Island States can become a formidable political force within the UN system. Islands First will help them realize that potential.

Islands First proposes to empower the small island states to influence environmental policy through the use of some of the methods wielded so effectively by the wealthy nations. Islands First will assist the small island states by;
# Building the capacity of their UN missions by providing highly trained, professional advisors,
# Creating and sustaining strategic networks of scientific, environmental, and policy experts in order to share information and coordinate activities, and
# Devising comprehensive political strategies for advancing their environmental agenda.

Islands First is unique among environmental [[NGO]]s in that it is being created in cooperation with, and at the request of, the small island states themselves, rather than by UN Agencies or environmental advocates. While this may seem like an academic point, it has profound practical implications. Islands First is not an endeavor seeking to impose environmentalism on a select group of states or a group of Western elites instructing nations on how to behave. Rather, Islands First originates at the request of several small island states with the goal of increasing their ability to advocate on their own behalf and cooperate more effectively with the scientific and environmental communities. Islands First seeks to link the scientific and environmental communities with the levers of power in a way never done before. With better organization and coordination among their strategic partners, the small island states hope to recast the environment and development agenda. At its outset, Islands First is working hand in hand with several UN missions in a way never before attempted in UN history. In the face of the challenges brought on by climate change, the small island states have unimpeachable moral standing as well as political will in abundance. There is simply no group of nations more appropriate to lead the fight for global [[environmental justice]].

==Historical precedents for small island action at the United Nations==
Cooperation among the small island states, the [[scientific community]], and the environmental community on this scale would be historically unprecedented, but it would not be the first time the small island states have mobilized politically and became powerful agents of environmental change. In fact, a concerted effort by a group of small island states put climate change on the UN agenda back in 1988, when [[Malta]] persuaded the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] to recognize the potential for "severe economic and social consequences" from climate change. The Republic of [[Maldives]] followed suit by hosting the 1989 Small States Conference on Sea Level Rise, which resulted in the "Malé Declaration on Global Warming and Sea Level Rise". The Conference also saw the creation of an Action Group on climate change consisting of more than 30 small island states, later to become the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS). This momentum continued through the 1992 "[[Earth Summit]]" in Rio de Janeiro, where AOSIS, aided by the Foundation for Environmental Law and Development (FIELD) and other [[NGO]]s, successfully lobbied for the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). It was thus fitting that the Maldives became the first signatory to the third protocol of the UNFCCC, also known as the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

Similarly, the tiny Republic of [[Palau]], with a mandate from an activist-minded President and a concerned legislature, began in May 2004 what appeared to be a quixotic effort to stop [[bottom trawling]], an odious method of fishing that irreparably damages some of the world's most biologically diverse [[coral reefs]] and is sometimes practiced by multinational fishing corporations. Under the guidance of Palau's Ambassador Stuart Beck, a [[Yale]]-trained lawyer and Chairman of Islands First, the [http://www.palauun.org Palau Mission] and a cohort of [[New York University]] (NYU) law students worked within the UN system to change the [[law of the sea]], not only for Palau, but for the entire world. These law students negotiated on Palau's behalf at the United Nations, interfaced with scientists and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] committed to eradicating the practice, and coordinated Palau's efforts with other likeminded missions. All of this hard work has already begun to pay dividends. The year 2006 saw the passage of the Nadi Declaration, which commits the sixteen members of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] to advocate for prohibitions on bottom trawling and other destructive fishing practices in international waters, prompting the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition to issue a [https://web.archive.org/web/20060515010559/http://www.savethehighseas.org/display.cfm?ID=104 press statement] reading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If all nations that purport to support urgent action to protect the biodiversity of the international waters of the world's oceans from bottom trawl fishing, were as consistent and persistent as the Republic of Palau, the deep sea habitats of the high seas would undoubtedly already be safe from high seas bottom trawling."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Palau Mission continued to push its agenda at the United Nations and played a critical role in rallying support for [http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;DS=A/RES/61/105&amp;Lang=E General Assembly Resolution 61/105], which, among other things, established a new global governance regime for protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems. As reported by the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6627425.stm BBC], "The landmark deal will restrict bottom-trawling, which experts say destroys coral reefs and stirs up clouds of sediment that suffocate marine life." The operators of industrial fishing fleets around the world have taken notice and many have already started retooling their vessels. The result of the alliance between the Palau Mission and NYU has been one of the largest gains in ocean policy since the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]] was concluded in 1982.

These achievements are remarkable, not only because of their global ramifications, but because they were led by countries with very few resources at their disposal. In fact, Palau's UN Mission did not have a single paid employee during its campaign against bottom trawling. Without this newfound capacity in the form of legal advisors, improved cooperation with interested NGOs, and an ongoing dialogue with Palau's committed political leaders, none of what transpired would have been possible. These examples of political upstarts navigating a system of entrenched power vividly demonstrate what is possible at the United Nations when a committed and organized group of countries decides to act. They also illustrate why the need for an organization like Islands First is so urgent.

'''Jingmei''' ({{zh|c=景美|p=Jǐngměi|w=Ching&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-mei&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|l=beautiful scenery}}) is a neighborhood in [[Taipei City]]. Formerly an administrative district, in 1990 it merged with [[Muzha District]] to create [[Wenshan District]].

Jingmei is located south of [[Taipei Main Station]], the city's main transportation hub. Jingmei is known for its locally famous [[night market]]. The [[Jingmei Night Market|market]] includes hundreds, if not thousands, of small street vendors, selling items, including traditional Chinese and Taiwanese snacks, cheap clothes, and various other items. The Jingmei area also includes many stores, upscale restaurants, movie theaters, and [[Karaoke]] establishments, making it a popular destination for nights and weekends for the local population. Jingmei Night Market is accessible by subway via [[Jingmei Station]], which is serviced by the  [[Xindian Line (TRTS)|Xindian Line]] of the [[Taipei Metro]]. Jingmei also serves as a small transportation hub for local buses, since many bus routes run through the area.

Jingmei has a centrally located small park, adjacent to JingSing Junior High-School.

Several scenic walks and panoramic views of Jingmei and of downtown Taipei are available around HsianChien Temple. HsianChien is situated on a small hill and accessible by an easy path from Jingshin Street. The shortest route up and down takes about 20 minutes each way.

==History ==
The former name '''Kingbe''' ({{zh|t=梘尾|poj=Kéng-bé}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{holodict|40178|e=梘尾}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the large spouts of the [[Liugongjun]] irrigation system. The name was later modified ({{zh|c=景尾|poj=Kéng-bé|labels=no}}).

During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], the area was under the jurisdiction of {{nihongo|Shinkō Village|深坑庄}}, Bunsan District, [[Taihoku Prefecture]]. After World War II, the area remained part of [[Shenkeng District|Shenkeng Township]]. In 1950, the more elegant name ''Jingmei'' ({{zh|c=景美|labels=no}}) was adopted and stood on its own as an urban township. However, in [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] the old name ''Kéng-bé'' is still used.

In 1967, the township was merged into Taipei City as Jingmei District. In 1990, it merged with Muzha District to create Wenshan District.

The [[March for Science]] was a series of protests that occurred across the [[United States]] and around the World on April 22, 2017. The protests were organized due to the perceived hostility of the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], as well as proposed budget cuts to federal agencies such as the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[National Institute of Health]]. A major goal of the march was convincing government officials to adopt policies in-line with the scientific understanding of issues such as [[climate change]] and [[vaccine]]s.{{r|nyt_main}} Listed below are several hundreds of the affiliated marches.

==Russia and former Soviet Union==

A mahalla is an Islamic congregation or parish in Russia and a number of countries once part of the [[Soviet Union]].  Typically, a mahalla supports a single mosque. An imam is seen as the spiritual head of a mahalla. A mahalla is directly subordinate to a [[muhtasib]] and a territorial [[muhtasibat]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=udUR_uKyE1kC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=russia+mahalla&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2CcrwfJN54&amp;sig=Kkpt7a297usKIi76Rp7jel127Wo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LnOqUfWOMpPzqwGIwoHgCQ&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=russia%20mahalla&amp;f=false | title = Muslim Religious Institutions in Imperial Russia | isbn = 9789004119758 | author1 = Allen J.

'''Markovi Kuli''' or '''[[Prince Marko|Marko]]'s Towers''' ({{lang-mk|Маркови Кули}}, {{lang-sr|Марковa кулa|Markova kula}}) are situated to the northwest of [[Prilep]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] just above the village of [[Varoš (Prilep)|Varoš]]. The towers named after [[Serbia]]n medieval [[Prince Marko]] Mrnjavčević are located on a 120–180 m high hill, surrounded by steep slopes covered with minute granite stones. The upper part of the former settlement can be reached from its north and south side.

During the four-decade archaeological research, remnants indicating the existence of an early antique settlement&amp;nbsp;— Keramija, were found. In the Roman period, this small village expanded into the southwest, a fact suggested by the several marble ornaments of an early Christian basilica.

[[File:Markovi Kuli zapaden del.JPG|thumb|left|Ruins at Markovi Kuli]]
The rampart on this terrain dates from the 13th and 14th centuries and is in good condition. The walls are about one meter thick and were built of limestone mortar and rest upon the large limestone rocks.

Internal walls separated the acropolis into smaller areas. The palace of Serbian [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević|King Vukašin]] and his son Marko was also situated here. Its north gate has a compound foundation - an evidence for of numerous reconstructions of the space. According to some historical findings, until the second part of the 14th century and even later, this fortress was defended by only 40 soldiers.

The settlement was situated south of the acropolis on a surface of some 3,6 hectares. On its north side, there is a double gate, as well as a large guardhouse between the entrances. On the south wall there are three well-preserved towers.

The lowest zone of the rampart consists of a row of short walls drawn in a broken line. In the west side, there are graves inserted into the rock. In the 14th century, this part served as a temporary refuge of the local population from Turkish raids.

After the death of King Marko in 1395, this settlement was taken by Ottoman forces. At this time the inhabitants of the former settlement migrated to a new settlement at the foot of Marko's towers. It was separated into several quarters and each had its own church. This new settlement from the 14th century was given the name Varoš which is still in use today.

'''Meyerton''' is a former settlement on [[Baker Island]].  The town was named for Captain H. A. Meyer, [[United States Army]], who in 1935 assisted in establishing living quarters and [[rainwater]] cisterns for colonists arriving on the island for the purpose of mining the [[guano]] deposits. It was located on the west side of the island, at an elevation of {{convert|13|ft}} above sea level.

==History==
In 1935 American colonists arrived aboard the USCGC Itasca, the same vessel that brought colonists to neighboring [[Howland Island]], on April 3, 1935. They built a lighthouse, substantial dwellings, and attempted to grow various plants.

'''''Mirny''''' was a 20-gun [[sloop-of-war]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], the second ship of the First Russian Antarctic Expedition in 1819—1821, during which [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] (commander of the lead ship ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'') and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] (commanding ''Mirny'') [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe, discovered the continent of [[Antarctica]] and twice circumnavigated it, and discovered a number of islands and archipelagos in the [[Southern Ocean]] and the [[Pacific]].&lt;ref name=sailhistory&gt;[http://sailhistory.ru/index.php?option=content&amp;id=198&amp;task=view Шлюп "Мирный"] at sailhistory.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Lazarevpetrovich.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Mikhail Lazarev]], captain of ''Mirny''.]]
''Mirny'' was under construction  in 1818 at Olonetskaya Shipyards, [[Lodeynoye Pole]]. It was initially named ''Ladoga'' (after [[Lake Ladoga]]), but when a new ship became needed for an Antarctic expedition, the decision was taken not to build a completely new one, but to refit ''Ladoga''. It was reconstructed under surveillance of its future commander Mikhail Lazarev.&lt;ref name=sailhistory/&gt;

On {{OldStyleDate|14 July|1819|3 July}} ''Vostok'' under the captaincy of [[Commander]] Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, the leader of the expedition, alongside ''Mirny'' under the command of [[Lieutenant Commander]] Mikhail Lazarev left [[Kronshtadt]]  and on {{OldStyleDate|28 January|1820|16 January}} reached the shore of [[Antarctica]], which was sighted for the first time in history. After repair in [[Sydney]] in [[Australia]], the expedition explored the tropical parts of the Pacific, and on {{OldStyleDate|12 November|1820|31 October}} again turned to Antarctica. On {{OldStyleDate|22 January|1821|10 January}} the sloops reached the southernmost point of their voyage at 69° 53' S and 92° 19' W. On {{OldStyleDate|5 August|1821|24 July}} they returned to Kronshtadt.&lt;ref name=sailhistory/&gt;

In 751 days they covered 49&amp;nbsp;723 miles (circa 92&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;km). Apart from the discovery of the world's sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], 29 islands were mapped and complex oceanographic works carried out. A medal was issued by the [[Russian Admiralty]] to commemorate the expedition.&lt;ref name=sailhistory/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12739">'''Natural resources''' are materials that occur in a natural form within environments. These can be classified as either [[Biotic material|biotic]] or [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] on the basis of their origin. The landmass and the territorial waters of Cambodia contain a rather moderate amount, array and variety of resources. Apart from water, [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] resources, such as minerals are generally rare. Still, advanced geo-scientific technologies have produced remarkable results and re-assessments in recent years, such as the localization of offshore oil and gas depots in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Cambodia, on the other hand possesses a relatively wide range of [[Biotic material|biotic]] resources, in particular timber, forest products, rare plants and a fauna of great diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itto.int/sfm_detail/id=12370000    |title=STATUS OF TROPICAL FOREST MANAGEMENT | publisher=  The International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO)|date=  |accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrd.gov.kh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57:land-and-resource-of-cambodia-&amp;catid=36:2009-01-26-09-00-25&amp;Itemid=58&amp;lang=en | title=Land and Resource of Cambodia  | publisher= Ministry of Rural Development |date=January 26, 2009  |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land==
Cambodia comprises an undulating plateau in its eastern part, a continuous flat plain (the Lake Tonle Sap lowland) interrupted only by isolated hills (Phnoms) and the Mekong River in the central part of the country, highlands to the north and northeast and the Cardamom Mountains in the south-west. The agricultural area was estimated at {{convert|5500000|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}} in 2009, with estimated cultivated areas totaling {{convert|4100000|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}}. 96% of this area was used for annual crops and 3.8% for permanent crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/cambodia/documents/publications/country_env_profile_cam_april_2012_en.pdf |title=EUROPEAN UNION DELEGATION TO CAMBODIA - Country Environment Profile |date=April 1, 2012 | publisher= EUROPEAN UNION |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water==

The Cambodian hydro-logical system is dominated by the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Great Lake. From July to the end of October, when the level of the Mekong is high, water flows via the Tonle Sap River, increasing the size of the lake from 2,600 km2  to about {{convert|10500|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} at its maximum extent. The storage capacity of Tonle Sap Great Lake is about {{convert|72|km3|mi3|0|abbr=on}}. When the level of the Mekong decreases, the Tonle Sap River reverses its flow and water flows back from the Tonle Sap Lake into the Mekong River. The Mekong flows from north to south, over a distance of around 480&amp;nbsp;km. About 86% of Cambodia’s territory ({{convert|156000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}) is included in the Mekong’s basin with the remaining 14% draining directly towards the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia represents 20% of the total catchment area of the Mekong basin. Total internal renewable water resources have been estimated at over {{convert|120|km3|mi3|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/cambodia/documents/publications/country_env_profile_cam_april_2012_en.pdf |title=EUROPEAN UNION DELEGATION TO CAMBODIA - Country Environment Profile |date=April 1, 2012 | publisher= EUROPEAN UNION |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mekonginfo.org/assets/midocs/0001968-inland-waters-overview-of-the-hydrology-of-the-mekong-basin.pdf |title=Overview of the Hydrology of the Mekong Basin  | publisher= Mekong Info |date=October 1, 2005  |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydroelectric power===
The country's [[hydroelectric]] generating potential is considerable, especially from the swift current of the middle [[Mekong River]] where it flows through the [[Stoeng Treng]] and [[Kratié Province|Kracheh]] provinces. Other sites of minor importance are on rivers in the highlands of the northeastern and north-central parts of the country. Although the Tonle Sap is Cambodia's dominant hydraulic feature, the rivers flowing into this great lake have little or no exploitable potential. In general, development of the country's water potential appears to be more important for the expansion of [[irrigation]] than for the production of electricity. The largest hydroelctric dam in Cambodia is [[Lower Se San 2 Dam]] which began operation in November 2017 and scheduled for full operation by October 2018. [[Stung Treng Dam]] is a proposed hydroelectric dam with an average production of 4,870 GWh per year, almost 2.5 times the average production of Lower Se San 2.

==Forests==
The forests of Cambodia include evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous, swamp, mangrove and bamboo forest in various conditions from closed to disturbed and mosaic formations. There are also re-growth and plantation forests as well as open forest types including evergreen shrub land and dry deciduous shrub land. About 10% of Cambodia’s flora is endemic. Cover is largely dominated by moist lowland evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest and deciduous forest. A unique seasonally inundated forest is found along the flood plains surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake. Extensive and fairly intact mangroves are found along the southern marine coast. [[forests]], which cover approximately 70 percent of the country and which potentially constitute a second pillar of the economy in addition to the primary one, [[agriculture]]. A survey in the 1960s disclosed that Cambodia had more than 130,000 square kilometres of forests that contained many species of tropical growth and trees but not [[teak]] or other valuable sources of hardwood. Some destruction of the forest environment undoubtedly occurred in the war that followed in the 1970s, but its extent has not been determined. Most of the heavy fighting took place in areas uncovered by dense tropical jungle.

As of late 1987, forest resources had not yet been fully exploited because of poor security in the countryside and a lack of electrical and mechanical equipment, such as power tools and lumber trucks. Nevertheless, the Cambodian government reportedly has discussed with [[Vietnam]] the possibility of coordinated [[reforestation]] programs.

===Timber===

[[Timber]] and [[firewood]] are the main forest products. Timber is considered one of the four economic initiatives of the government's First Plan. Timber production was projected to reach a peak of 200,000 cubic meters in 1990. However, timber production is employing underage children according to the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]]' ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; and the percentage of working children aged 5 to 14 years old has reached 85% in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/cambodia.htm 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor -Cambodia-]&lt;/ref&gt;

Timber production has also had an important role in [[Deforestation in Cambodia|Cambodia's deforestation]].

==Biodiversity and wildlife==
Cambodia is one of the most biodiverse countries in South East Asia. In 2010, the MoE submitted its Fourth National Report to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (MoE/CBD, 2010) which includes information on overall biodiversity status, trends and threats; national strategies and action plans, and; an assessment of cross-sectoral integration of biodiversity considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fauna-flora.org/explore/cambodia/ |title= Cambodia  |website= Fauna &amp;amp; Flora International |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy==

The main energy source in Cambodia is wood, accounting for 80% of national energy consumption (UNEP, 2010). Most households, even in urban areas, rely on traditional energy sources since fossil fuels are either not available or too expensive. 94% of the population living in rural areas relies on wood, charcoal, car batteries and kerosene (UNCDF, 2010). Most primitive fuels are sourced from forests; in rural areas in the form of fuel wood and in towns and cities as charcoal. The UNDP forecasts that wood-derived fuels will remain the main source of cooking energy in rural areas until 2030.

==Mineral resources==
[[image:Ruby - Winza, Tanzania.jpg|right|thumb|200px| '''ruby gemstone''']]
{{main article|Mineral industry of Cambodia}}

Cambodia's mineral resources are moderate and as a result the mining and [[quarry]] industry contributed only 0.39% of Cambodia's [[gross domestic product]] in 2005. The sector employed an estimated 19,000 people and accounted for only 0.2% of the country's total employment in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2006/myb3-2006-cb.pdf |title=The Mineral Industry of Cambodia |date= July 1, 2007 | publisher= U.S. Department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemstones - Gemstone areas - [[Rubies]], [[sapphire]]s, and [[zircon]]s - are located in Samlot district of Battambang, Paillin, Ratanakkiri, and Takeo Province.

Iron ore - Hermatite (Fe203); Magnetite (Fe304); Limonite (2Fe203, 3H2O) - was found In the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, however by Chinese experts in two areas, one located in Phnom Deck and the others located in Koh Keo of [[Preah Vihear Province]], and Thalaborivath of [[Stung Treng Province]]. According to General Department of Mineral, the total iron reserves in Phnom Deck area are estimated at 5-6 million tons and possible reserves of high-grade iron ore, ranging from 2.5 million to 4.8 million tons, exist in the northern part of the country.

Gold - Gold deposits are to be found in the four provinces: Kampong Cham (The Rumchek in Memot area), Kampong Thom (Phnom Chi area), Preah Vihear (Phnom Deck in Roveing district), Ratanakiri (Oyadav district) and Mondulkiri.

Bauxite – was found in Battambang Province and Chhlong district in Mondulkiri Province.

Antimony (Sb) – found in Sre Peang area, Pursat Province

Chromium (Cr) – found in Sre Peang area, Pursat Province

Manganese (Mn) - Chinese explorations revealed [[manganese]] ore reserves, estimated at about 120,000 tons, in Kampong Thom Province.

Phosphates - A few thousand tons of phosphate are extracted annually in [[Kampot Province]] and processed locally or in [[Battambang Province]].

Coal - is found in Phum Talat on the east side of the Tonle San River, Stung Treng Province. There are 27 individual coal seams identified with a reserve of 7 million tons of coal.

==Oil and natural gas==
In late 1969, the Cambodian government granted a permit to a French company to explore for [[petroleum]] in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. By 1972 none had been located, and exploration ceased when the [[Khmer Republic]] (see Appendix B) fell in 1975. Subsequent oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand and in the [[South China Sea]], however, could spark renewed interest in Cambodia's offshore area, especially because the country is on the same [[continental shelf]] as its Southeast Asian oil-producing neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/world/asia/05cambo.html?_r=0 |title= Big Oil in Tiny Cambodia: The Burden of New Wealth  |date=May 5, 2007 | publisher= The New York Times Company |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Niue International Airport''' {{airport codes|IUE|NIUE}}, also known as '''Hanan International Airport''', is an international airport serving the island nation of [[Niue]]. It is located near the town of [[Alofi]] and currently only serves [[Air New Zealand]], flying to and from [[Auckland]] twice a week, departing Auckland on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and departing Niue on Mondays and Fridays.{{efn|group=notes|Because New Zealand and Niue are on opposite sides of the [[International Date Line]], the Tuesday morning flight from Auckland arrives in Niue on Monday, then departs a few hours later, arriving back in Auckland on Tuesday evening.  Similarly, the Saturday morning flight from Auckland arrives in Niue on Friday, then departs a few hours later, arriving back in Auckland on Saturday evening.}}

It was opened in December 1970 at which time it was serviced by [[Fokker F.27 Friendship]] aircraft. For a period in the 1990s, Niue International Airport served as the base of [[Niue Airlines]].

'''Phuntsholing''', also spelled as '''Phuentsholing''' ({{lang-dz|ཕུན་ཚོགས་གླིང་}}) is a [[border town]] in southern [[Bhutan]] and is the [[thromde|administrative seat]] of [[Chukha District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/cabinet-approves-thromdes/ |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |title=Cabinet Approves Thromdes |date=2010-05-07 |accessdate=2011-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120005537/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/cabinet-approves-thromdes/ |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/lg-elections-finalized/ |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |first=Kezang |last=Dorji |title=LG Elections Finalized |date=2010-11-26 |accessdate=2011-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403030914/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/lg-elections-finalized/ |archivedate=2012-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town occupies parts of both [[Phuentsholing Gewog]] and [[Sampheling Gewog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.election-bhutan.org.bt/2011/finaldelimitation/chukha.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chiwogs in Chukha |publisher=Election Commission, [[Government of Bhutan]] |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002183400/http://www.election-bhutan.org.bt/2011/finaldelimitation/chukha.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phuentsholing adjoins the [[India]]n town of [[Jaigaon]], and cross-border trade has resulted in a thriving local economy. The town has the headquarters of the [[Bank of Bhutan]] previously but shifted to [[Thimphu]]. In 2017, Phuentsholing had a population of 27,658.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;srt=npan&amp;col=abcdefghinoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;geo=-41 |title=Bhutan: largest cities and towns and statistics of their population |accessdate=2008-07-11 |work=World Gazetteer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 5 April 1964, reformist [[Prime Minister of Bhutan|Prime Minister]] [[Jigme Dorji]] was assassinated in Phuntsholing by monarchist cadres as the king lay ill in Switzerland. The [[Dorji family]] was subsequently put under close watch.&lt;ref name=Rahul&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oiJuAAAAMAA |title=Royal Bhutan: a political history |author=Ram Rahul |publisher=[[Vikas Publishing|Vikas]] |pages=94–95 |year=1997 |isbn=81-259-0232-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was 1958 when the first one-storeyed cottage was constructed it housed a shop. The late [[Prime Minister of Bhutan|Prime Minister]], [[Jigme Dorji]] informed Phuentsholing residents that concrete houses could be constructed.
Tashi group of companies constructed the first concrete house, followed by Tibetans and Indians.  Some of the structures that exist to this day are the buildings housing Bhutan Enterprise, Jatan Prasad Lal Chand Prasad shop and a beauty parlour near Zantdopelri lhakhang. After the announcement, 18 shops were built around Zangdopelri area. The Zangdopelri area was a bus terminal, and on Saturday a market would be assembled. Apart from the cottages, there were several huts and Phuentsholing was beginning to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/becoming-the-gateway-to-bhutan/#.VUFk7CGqqko |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724161505/http://www.kuenselonline.com/becoming-the-gateway-to-bhutan/#.VUFk7CGqqko |archivedate=2015-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture and culture==
The India-Bhutan border at Phuntsholing clearly separates two very different peoples and cultures. [[Jaigaon]] across the border is larger, bustling and loud, similar to many other [[West Bengal]] centres of commerce, albeit with many Bhutanese shoppers. Phuntsholing is uniquely more urban than other Bhutanese towns as it is the Bhutan financial, industrial and trading capital. It has been affected a little by the neighbouring culture, but is distinctly far more quiet and orderly than its neighbour.

==Economy==
As the majority of goods traded go into Bhutan through Phuntsholing, the town is the gateway to Bhutan for trade with India.

==Indian Border Crossing==
[[File:Bhutan gate in Phuentsoling 0.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The ornate border gate between Bhutan and India, seen from Bhutan]]
[[File:Bhutan gate in Phuentsholing 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Another view seen from [[Jaigaon]], India]]
The border is separated by a long wall with a single Bhutanese gate. Locals can sometimes even cross without being asked for papers. Tourists from India, Bangladesh and Maldives do not need visa to enter Bhutan but have to show proof of identity such as passport or voter ID card and apply for a permit at Phuntsholing to enter Bhutan. Other foreigners need a visa presented by a hired registered tour guide. The entry gate into the town is manned by the [[Indian Army]] and [[Royal Bhutan Army|Bhutanese Army]] guards. The terrain inclines soon after the gate.

==Transportation==
[[File:Bhutan highways labeled location map.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Transport in Bhutan|Highways of Bhutan]]]]

The town does not have an airport or railway. [[Indian Railways]] has railway stations nearby. A {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} railway track has been planned from the nearest railway station Hashimara in North Bengal to Phuntsholing.

Siliguri is the nearest large city in India. [[New Jalpaiguri]] and [[New Alipurduar]] are nearest large railway junctions. Bus are available from the towns in north Bengal. Buses are operated by both travel Indian and Bhutanese government operators. Once at Phuntsholing, the [[Lateral Road]] gives travelers access to the rest of Bhutan.

From almost anywhere in the city, one can see the road to [[Thimphu]] snaking up the hillside, and in the evening it is easy to see the headlights of distant vehicles heading towards the capital. Opposite the big ground PSA is the road that connects rest of cities of Bhutan.The [[Lateral Road]], Bhutan's main highway, begins in Phuntsholing and winds some {{convert|557|km|mi}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/ |publisher=[[Google]] |work=[[Google maps]] |title=Directions from Phuentsholing to Trashigang |accessdate=2011-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724112018/https://maps.google.com/ |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Trashigang]] in the east.

The '''Pico Teneriffe''', is a rocky cape on the northeast coast of the island of [[Barbados]], in the [[Saint Peter, Barbados|Parish of Saint Peter]].&lt;ref name="barbadospocketguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbadospocketguide.com/barbados-attractions/beaches-and-bays/north-coast-beaches/pico-teneriffe.html|publisher=barbadospocketguide.com|title=Pico Teneriffe - Barbados Pocket Guide|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a coral cliff in the shape of a pinnacle that does not reach 100 meters in height, named after the fact that the island of [[Tenerife]] in [[Spain]] is the first land east of Barbados, according to the inhabitants of the place. The presence in the place of people arrived from the [[Canary Islands]] in the time of the colonization of Barbados is not ruled out, but unlikely.&lt;ref name="barbadospocketguide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diariodeavisos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2015/11/tenerife-desde-antipodas-hasta-luna/|publisher=diariodeavisos.com|title=Tenerife: desde las antípodas hasta la Luna &amp;#124; Diario de Avisos|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piet Oudolf''' ({{IPA-nl|ˌpit ˈʌu̯dɔlf}}; born 27 October 1944) is an influential [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[garden designer]], [[plant nursery|plant nursery man]] and author. He is a leading figure of the "New Perennial"  movement — his designs and plant compositions using bold drifts of [[herbaceous]] [[Perennial plant|perennial]]s and [[grass]]es which are chosen at least as much for their structure as for their flower colour.

==Design philosophy==
[[File:Piet Oudolf garden design.jpg|thumb|Segment of planting design for Hauser &amp; Wirth Somerset garden.]]
Working primarily with [[perennial plant]] varieties, Oudolf practices a naturalistic approach to gardening. Taking a cue from architectural design, Oudolf prioritizes the seasonal life cycle of a plant over decorative considerations like flower or colour. He focuses primarily on structural characteristics, such as leaf or seed pod shape, present before and after a plant has flowered.&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patel|first1=Riya|title=Piet Oufolf|url=http://www.iconeye.com/architecture/features/item/11575-piet-oudolf|publisher=Icon|accessdate=22 May 2016|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sorin|first1=Fran|title=Piet Oudolf – Rhythms of Nature: Where Ecology Meets Design|url=http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/20/piet-oudolf-ecology-meets-design/|website=ecology.com|publisher=Ecology Today|accessdate=22 May 2016|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AN2007"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Naturalized perennial and bulb combinations offer elegant alternatives|journal=American Nurseryman|date=July 2007|volume=206|issue=1|page=34|quote=Oudolf likes to use the architecture, i.e, size, shape, color and texture, of plants to build the bones of a garden. He often opts for plants with interesting berries or seedpods, believing that plants should look good in more than one season, which is why a classic Oudolf garden looks as interesting in the winter as it does in the summer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explains: "A garden is exciting for me when it looks good through the year, not just at one particular time. I want to go outside and for it to be interesting in all weather, in early spring and late autumn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Piet Oudolf at home in the garden|url=http://www.theenglishgarden.co.uk/top-picks/interviews/piet_oudolf_at_home_in_the_garden_1_3941963/|accessdate=22 May 2016|publisher=The English Garden|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stability of perennials after planting are key to Oudolf's designs, especially the use of long-lived clump-forming species. The result are gardens that persist in their planned state years after being planted with little deviation from Oudolf's hand drawn maps.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearson|first1=Dan|title=Growing Wild|url=http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-observer-magazine/20130407/281883000802792/TextView|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=The Observer|date=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart-Smith" /&gt;

Oudolf's overall approach to planting has evolved since the 1980s when he and his wife Anja opened their nursery, at Hummelo, in [[Gelderland]]. His early work with perennials consisted of block-type groupings based on structure and texture. More recently Oudolf's gardens has experimented with a variety of approaches, which, broadly speaking, are more naturalistic, often using blends of species. The change in style has been described as a shift from a painter's perspective to one informed by ecology. It was first introduced into Oudolf's public work in 2004 as part of the Lurie Garden in Chicago. The approach can be seen in the New York High Line project. &lt;ref name="Stuart-Smith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stuart-Smith|first1=Tom|title=Dutch master: the garden design genius of Piet Oudolf|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/10036592/Dutch-master-the-garden-design-genius-of-Piet-Oudolf.html|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KinsburyGDM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kingsbury|first1=Noel|title=Piet Oudolf's Next Wave|url=http://www.gardendesign.com/designers/piet-oudolf.html|website=gardendesign.com|publisher=Garden Design Magazine|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His own garden, at [[Hummelo]], near [[Arnhem]] in the [[Netherlands]] was established in 1982. It has gone through many changes which reflect Oudolf's constantly developing planting design. Initially it was designed with a series of yew (''Taxus baccata'') hedges and blocks, reflecting Oudolf's architectural style which owed much to [[Mien Ruys]], the designer who dominated Dutch garden design in the post-war period.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===High Line (2006)===
Oudolf's work on the [[High Line]] relied heavily on plants native to the region. A matrix of grasses with perennials grouped throughout was used to convey how the plants grow and intermingle in the wild.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KingsburyTMag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingsbury|first1=Noel|title=A Wilder Way|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/a-wilder-way/|accessdate=23 May 2016|agency=T Magazine|publisher=New York Times|date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3074">'''Range state''' is a term generally used in [[zoogeography]] and [[conservation biology]] to refer to any [[nation]] that exercises jurisdiction over any part of a [[range (biology)|range]] which a particular [[species]], [[taxon]] or [[biotope]] inhabits, or crosses or overflies at any time on its normal [[Animal migration|migration]] route.  The term is often expanded to ''also'' include, particularly in [[international waters]], any nation with vessels flying their flag that engage in exploitation (e.g. hunting, fishing, capturing) of that species.&lt;ref name="CMG-text"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.cms.int/documents/convtxt/cms_convtxt_english.pdf | title=Convention Text | booktitle=Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals | accessdate=17 February 2012 | location=Bonn, Germany | date=23 June 1979 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406235608/http://www.cms.int/documents/convtxt/cms_convtxt_english.pdf | archivedate=6 April 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deKlemm"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.fni.no/ybiced/94_05_klemm.pdf | title=The Problem of Migratory Species in International Law | author=de Klemm, Cyrille | journal=Green Globe Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development 1994 | year=1994 | pages=66–77 | editors=Helge Ole Bergesen and Georg Parmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries in which a species occurs only as a [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] or ‘accidental’ visitor outside of its normal range or migration route are not usually considered range states.  

Because governmental conservation policy is often formulated on a national scale, and because in most countries, both governmental and private conservation organisations are also organised at the national level, the range state concept is often used by international conservation organizations in formulating their conservation and campaigning policy.  

An example of one such organization is the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ([[Bonn Convention|CMS]], or the  “[[Bonn Convention]]”).  It is a [[multilateral treaty]] focusing on the conservation of critically endangered and threatened migratory species, their habitats and their migration routes.  Because such habitats and/or migration routes may span national boundaries, conservation efforts are less likely to succeed without the cooperation, participation, and coordination of each of the range states.&lt;ref name="deKlemm" /&gt;

'''Sidney Edwards Morse''' (7 February 1794 [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]] – 24 December 1871 [[New York City]]) was an American inventor, geographer and journalist. He was the brother of telegraphy pioneer and painter [[Samuel F. B. Morse]].

==Biography==
He was the son of geographer and clergyman [[Jedidiah Morse]]. He graduated from [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1811, studied theology at [[Andover Seminary]], and law at the [[Litchfield, Connecticut]], school. Meanwhile, he became a contributor to the ''[[Columbian Centinel]]'' of [[Boston]], writing a series of articles that illustrated the danger to the American Union from an undue multiplication of new states in the south, and showing that it would give to a sectional minority the control of the government. These led to his being invited by [[Jeremiah Evarts]] and others to found a weekly religious newspaper, to which he gave the name ''Boston Recorder''. He continued as sole editor and proprietor of this journal for more than a year, and in this time raised its circulation until it was exceeded by that of only two Boston papers. Morse was then associated with his elder brother, [[Samuel Morse]], in patenting the flexible piston pump and extending its sale.

In 1823 he moved to New York, and with his brother, Richard Cary Morse, founded the ''New York Observer'', which eventually became the oldest weekly in New York City, and the oldest religious newspaper in the state. He continued as senior editor and proprietor until 1858, when he retired to private life.

In 1839 was associated with Henry A. Munson in the development of [[cerography]], a method of printing maps in color on the common printing press. He used this process to illustrate the geographical textbooks that he published, and in early life he assisted his father in the preparation of works of that character. The last years of his life were devoted to experimenting with an invention for the rapid exploration of the depths of the sea. This instrument, called a bathyometer, was exhibited at the [[World's fair]] in [[Paris]] in 1869, and during 1870 in New York City.

{{History of Croatia}}
'''Slavonia''' ({{IPAc-en|s|l|ə|ˈ|v|oʊ|n|i|ə}}; {{lang-hr|Slavonija}}) is, with [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia proper]] and [[Istria County|Istria]], one of the four [[historical region|historical]] [[Regions of Croatia|regions]]&lt;ref name="Frucht 2004" /&gt; of [[Croatia]]. Taking up the east of the country, it roughly corresponds with five [[Counties of Croatia|Croatian counties]]: [[Brod-Posavina County|Brod-Posavina]], [[Osijek-Baranja County|Osijek-Baranja]], [[Požega-Slavonia County|Požega-Slavonia]], [[Virovitica-Podravina County|Virovitica-Podravina]] and [[Vukovar-Srijem County|Vukovar-Srijem]], although the territory of the counties includes [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]], and the definition of the western extent of Slavonia as a region varies. The counties cover {{convert|12556|km2|abbr=off}} or 22.2% of Croatia, inhabited by 806,192—18.8% of Croatia's population. The largest city in the region is [[Osijek]], followed by [[Slavonski Brod]] and [[Vinkovci]].

Slavonia is located in the [[Pannonian Basin]], largely bordered by the [[Danube]], [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers. In the west, the region consists of the Sava and Drava valleys and the mountains surrounding the [[Požega Valley]], and [[plain]]s in the east. Slavonia enjoys a moderate [[continental climate]], with relatively low precipitation.

After the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall]] of [[Western Roman Empire|Rome]], which ruled the area of modern-day Slavonia until the 5th century, [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Lombards]] controlled the area before the arrival of [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]], when the Principality of [[Lower Pannonia (9th century)|Lower Pannonia]] was established in the 7th century. It was later incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and, after its decline, the kingdom was ruled through a [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|personal union with Hungary]].

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Slavonia took place in 1536 to 1552. In 1699, after the [[Great Turkish War]], Slavonia was [[Treaty of Karlowitz|transferred]] to the [[Habsburg Empire|Habsburgs]]. Reform of the empire through the [[Compromise of 1867]] assigned it to the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian part of the realm]], and a year later to the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]. In 1918, when [[Austria-Hungary]] dissolved, Slavonia was a part of the short-lived [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] which in turn became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes|kingdom later renamed Yugoslavia]]. During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], Slavonia saw fierce fighting, including the [[Battle of Vukovar]].

The economy of Slavonia is largely based on [[processing industry]], trade, transport and civil engineering. Agriculture is a significant component of its economy: Slavonia contains 45% of Croatia's agricultural land and accounts for a significant proportion of Croatia's livestock farming and production of [[permanent crop]]s. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the five counties of Slavonia is worth 6,454&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]] or 8,005&amp;nbsp;euro per capita, 27.5% below national average. The GDP of the five counties represents 13.6% of Croatia's GDP.

The cultural heritage of Slavonia is a blend of historical influences, especially those since the end of the 17th century, when Slavonia started recovering from the Ottoman wars, and its traditional culture. Slavonia contributed to the culture of Croatia, through art, writers, poets and [[Patronage|art patronage]]. In traditional music, Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia, and the traditional culture is preserved through [[folklore]] festivals, with prominence given to [[tamburica]] music and [[bećarac]], a form of traditional song, recognized as an [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage]] by [[UNESCO]]. The cuisine of Slavonia reflects diverse influences—a blend of traditional and foreign elements. Slavonia is one of Croatia's winemaking areas, with [[Ilok]] and [[Kutjevo]] recognized as centres of wine production.

[[File:ZGvucdove.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Vučedol Dove]]]]
The name ''Slavonia'' originated in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The area was named after the [[Slav]]s who settled there and called themselves *Slověne. The root *Slověn- appeared in various dialects of [[Slavic languages|languages]] spoken by people inhabiting the area west of the [[Sutla]] river, as well as between the [[Sava]] and [[Drava]] rivers—[[South Slavs]] living in the area of the former [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. The area bounded by those rivers was called *Slověnьje in the [[Proto-Slavic]] language. The word subsequently evolved to its various present forms in the [[Slavic languages]], and other languages adopted the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Migracijske i etničke teme|publisher=Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies, Zagreb|issn=1333-2546|volume=19|issue=1|date=March 2003|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=12062|title=Ime Slavonije|language=Croatian|trans-title=Name of Slavonia|author=Alemko Gluhak|pages=111–117|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest was completed in 11 BC, when the [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Roman province of Illyricum]] was established, encompassing modern-day Slavonia as well as a vast territory on the right bank of Danube. The province was renamed Pannonia and divided within two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6L49AAAAIAAJ|title=Pannonia and Upper Moesia|author=András Mócsy|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn= 978-0-7100-7714-1|year=1974|accessdate=11 March 2012|pages=32–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], which included the territory occupied by modern-day Slavonia, the area became a part of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] by the end of the 5th century. However, control of the area proved a significant task, and [[Lombards]] were given increasing control of Pannonia in the 6th century, which ended in their withdrawal in 568 and the arrival of [[Pannonian Avars]] and Slavs, who established control of Pannonia by year 582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UbOtJcF8rQC|title=Becoming Slav, Becoming Croat: Identity Transformations in Post-Roman and Early Medieval Dalmatia|author=Danijel Dzino|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2010|isbn=978-90-04-18646-0|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' written by the 10th century Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]], the Croats had arrived in the early 7th&amp;nbsp;century in the then region of Dalmatia,&lt;ref&gt;''De Administrando Imperio'' 148Be: ''... οἱ Χρωβάτοι, οἱ εἰς τὰ τῆς Δελματίας νῦν κατοικοῦντες μέρη ...''&lt;/ref&gt; although this is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries.&lt;ref name="Mužić-249-293"&gt;Mužić (2007), pp. 249–293&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a [[dukedom (administrative division)|dukedom]] was formed, [[Dalmatian Croatia|Duchy of Dalmatia]], ruled by [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], as attested to by the chronicles of [[Einhard]], starting in the year 818. This record represents the first document of the Croatian state, [[vassal states|vassal]] of [[Francia]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Mužić-157-160"&gt;Mužić (2007), pp. 157–160&lt;/ref&gt; The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]] two decades later.&lt;ref name="Mužić-169-170"&gt;Mužić (2007), pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Battle of Mohács, the Ottomans expanded their possessions in Slavonia seizing [[Đakovo]] in 1536 and Požega in 1537, defeating a Habsburg army led by [[Johann Katzianer]], who was attempting to retake Slavonia, at [[Gorjani]] in September 1537. By 1540, Osijek was also under firm control of the Ottomans, and regular administration in Slavonia was introduced by establishing the [[Sanjak of Pojega]]. The Ottoman control in Slavonia expanded as [[Novska]] surrendered the same year. Turkish conquest continued—[[Našice]] were seized in 1541, [[Orahovica]] and [[Slatina, Croatia|Slatina]] in 1542, and in 1543, [[Voćin]], [[Sirač]] and, after a 40-day siege, [[Valpovo]]. In 1544, Ottoman forces conquered [[Pakrac]]. Lessening hostilities brought about a five-year truce in 1547 and temporary stabilization of the border between Habsburg and Ottoman empires, with [[Virovitica]] becoming the most significant defensive Habsburg fortress and Požega the most significant Ottoman centre in Slavonia, as Ottoman advances to Sisak and [[Čazma]] were made, including a brief occupation of the cities. Further westward efforts of the Turkish forces presented a significant threat to [[Zagreb]] and the rest of Croatia and the Hungarian kingdom, prompting a greater defensive commitment by the Habsburg Empire. One year after the 1547 truce ended, [[Ivan Lenković]] devised a system of fortifications and troops in the border areas, a forerunner of the [[Croatian Military Frontier]]. Nonetheless, in 1552, the Ottoman conquest of Slavonia was completed when Virovitica was captured.&lt;ref name="Mujadžević"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Povijesni prilozi|publisher=Croatian History Institute|issn=0351-9767|title=Osmanska osvajanja u Slavoniji 1552. u svjetlu osmanskih arhivskih izvora|language=Croatian|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=63160|trans-title=The 1552 Ottoman invasions in Slavonia according to the Ottoman archival sources|volume=36|issue=36|date=July 2009|author=Dino Mujadžević|pages=89–107|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman advances in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 [[Battle of Sisak]], the first decisive Ottoman defeat, and a more lasting stabilisation of the frontier.

The areas acquired through the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] were assigned to Croatia, itself in the union with Hungary and the union ruled by the Habsburgs. The border area along the [[Una (Sava)|Una]], Sava and Danube rivers became the [[Slavonian Military Frontier]]. At this time, Osijek took over the role of the administrative and military centre of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] from Požega.&lt;ref name="Blagojević"/&gt; The 1830s and 1840s saw [[romantic nationalism]] inspire the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]], a political and cultural campaign advocating unity of all South Slavs in the empire.

===Physical geography===
{{see also|Geography of Croatia}}

Slavonia is entirely located in the [[Pannonian Basin]], one of three major [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] parts of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Ministry of Construction and Spatial Planning (Croatia)]]|url=http://klima.mzopu.hr/UserDocsImages/Nacionalno_izv_KLIMA_23022007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Drugo, trece i cetvrto nacionalno izvješće Republike Hrvatske prema Okvirnoj konvenciji Ujedinjenih naroda o promjeni klime (UNFCCC)|trans-title=The second, third and fourth national report of the Republic of Croatia pursuant to the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC)|language=Croatian|date=November 2006|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pannonian Basin took shape through [[Miocene|Miocenian]] thinning and [[subsidence]] of crust structures formed during Late [[Paleozoic]] [[Variscan orogeny]]. The Paleozoic and [[Mesozoic]] structures are visible in [[Papuk]] and other Slavonian mountains. The processes also led to the formation of a [[Stratovolcano|stratovolcanic]] chain in the basin 17&amp;nbsp;– 12&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|Mya]] (million years ago) and intensified subsidence observed until 5&amp;nbsp;Mya as well as [[flood basalt]]s about 7.5&amp;nbsp;Mya. Contemporary uplift of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] prevented water flowing to the [[Black Sea]], and the [[Pannonian Sea]] formed in the basin. Sediments were transported to the basin from uplifting Carpathian and [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric mountains]], with particularly deep fluvial sediments being deposited in the [[Pleistocene]] during the uplift of the [[Transdanubian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GClF-4rtvoIC|title=Recent Landform Evolution: The Carpatho-Balkan-Dinaric Region|isbn=978-94-007-2447-1|authors=Milos Stankoviansky, Adam Kotarba|publisher=Springer|year=2012|accessdate=2 March 2012|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, up to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=off}} of the sediment was deposited in the basin, and the Pannonian sea eventually drained through the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJNODA_0IOgC|title=The Nature Guide to the Hortobagy and Tisza River Floodplain, Hungary|author=Dirk Hilbers|publisher=[[Crossbill Guides Foundation]]|year=2008|isbn=978-90-5011-276-5|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern Pannonian Basin, the [[Neogene]] to [[Quaternary]] sediment depth is normally lower, averaging {{convert|500|to|1500|m|abbr=off}}, except in central parts of depressions formed by [[subduction]]—around {{convert|4000|m|abbr=off}} in the Slavonia-Syrmia depression, {{convert|5500|m|abbr=off}} in the Sava depression and nearly {{convert|7000|m|abbr=off}} in the Drava depression, with the deepest sediment found between Virovitica and Slatina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Geologia Croatica|publisher=Croatian Geological Institute|issn=1333-4875|volume=56|issue=1|date=June 2003|title=Tertiary Subsurface Facies, Source Rocks and Hydrocarbon Reservoirs in the SW Part of the Pannonian Basin (Northern Croatia and South-Western Hungary)|pages=101–122|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=6258|authors=Bruno Saftić, Josipa Velić, Orsola Sztanó, Györgyi Juhász, Željko Ivković|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of those processes are large [[plain]]s in eastern Slavonia, Baranya and Syrmia, as well as in river valleys, especially along the Sava, Drava and [[Kupa]].

====Hydrography and climate====
[[File:Biljski most 6 rujna 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The Drava in Osijek]]
The largest rivers in Slavonia are found along or near its borders—the Danube, Sava and Drava. The length of the Danube, flowing along the eastern border of Slavonia and through the cities of Vukovar and Ilok, is {{convert|188|km|abbr=off}}, and its main tributaries are the Drava {{convert|112|km|adj=on}} and the Vuka. The Drava discharges into the Danube near [[Aljmaš]], east of Osijek, while mouth of the Vuka is located in Vukovar. Major tributaries of the Sava, flowing along the southern border of Slavonia and through cities of Slavonski Brod and Županja are {{convert|89|km|adj=on}} the [[Orljava]] flowing through Požega, and the Bosut—whose {{convert|151|km|adj=on}} course in Slavonia takes it through Vinkovci. There are no large lakes in Slavonia. The largest ones are Lake Kopačevo whose surface area varies between {{convert|1.5|and|3.5|km2|abbr=off}}, and Borovik [[Reservoir]] covering {{convert|2.5|km2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/&gt; The Lake Kopačevo is connected to the Danube via Hulovski canal, situated within the [[Kopački Rit]] [[wetland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgipu.hr/doc/PPKopacki-rit-web/00-PPKopacki-rit-tekst.pdf|format=PDF|language=Croatian|title=Prostorni plan parka prirode "Kopački Rit"|trans-title=Kopački Rit Nature Park spatial plan|location=Osijek|date=February 2006|publisher=[[Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection (Croatia)]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Lake Borovik is an artificial lake created in 1978 in the upper course of the Vuka River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Građevinar|url=http://www.casopis-gradjevinar.hr/dokumenti/201006/5.pdf|format=PDF|language=Croatian|title=Zgrada agencije za vodne putove i športske udruge Vukovara|trans-title=Waterways agency building and sport associations of the city of Vukovar|volume=62|issue=6|year=2010|pages=529–538|author=Branko Nadilo|accessdate=14 June 2012|publisher=[[Croatian Association of Civil Engineers]]|issn=0350-2465}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire Slavonia belongs to the [[Danube basin]] and the [[Black Sea]] catchment area, but it is divided in two sub-basins. One of those drains into the Sava—itself a Danube tributary—and the other into the Drava or directly into the Danube. The [[drainage divide]] between the two sub-basins runs along Papuk and Krndija mountains, in effect tracing the southern boundary of the Virovitica-Podravina County and the northern boundary of Požega-Slavonia County, cuts through the Osijek-Podravina County north of Đakovo and finally bisects the Vukovar-Syrmia County running between Vukovar and Vinkovci to reach Fruška Gora southwest of Ilok. The Entire Brod-Posavina County is located in the Sava sub-basin.&lt;ref name="Divides-Ordinance"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_08_97_2726.html|language=Croatian|title=Pravilnik o područjima podslivova, malih slivova i sektora|trans-title=Ordinance on areas of sub-catchments, minor catchments and sectors|date=11 August 2010|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Croatia, including Slavonia, has a moderately warm and rainy [[continental climate]] as defined by the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Mean annual temperature averages {{convert|10|to|12|°C|°F|lk=on}}, with the warmest month, July, averaging just below {{convert|22|°C|°F|lk=on}}.

===Demographics===
{{see also|Demographics of Croatia}}
[[File:Slavonia topo map OSM.png|thumb|right|Geographic map of Slavonia]]
According to the 2011 census, the total population of the five counties of Slavonia was 806,192, accounting for 19% of population of Croatia. The largest portion of the total population lives in Osijek-Baranja county, followed by Vukovar-Syrmia county. Požega-Slavonia county is the least populous county of Slavonia. Overall the population density stands at 64.2&amp;nbsp;persons per square kilometre. The population density ranges from 77.6 to 40.9 persons per square kilometre, with the highest density recorded in Brod-Posavina county and the lowest in Virovitica-Podravina county. Osijek is the largest city in Slavonia, followed by Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci and Vukovar. Other cities in Slavonia have populations below 20,000.&lt;ref name="cbs-2011"/&gt; According to the 2001 census, [[Croats]] account for 85.6 percent of population of Slavonia, and the most significant ethnic minorities are Serbs and [[Hungarians of Croatia|Hungarians]], comprising 8.8 percent and 1.4 percent of the population respectively. The largest portion of the Serb minority was recorded in Vukovar-Syrmia county (15 percent), while the largest Hungarian minority, in both relative and absolute terms, was observed in Osijek-Baranja county. The census recorded 85.4% of the population declaring themselves as [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], with further 4.4% belonging to [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and 0.7% [[Muslim]]s. 3.1% declared themselves as [[Irreligion|non-religious]], [[Agnosticism|agnostics]] or declined to declare their religion. The most widely used language in the region is [[Croatian language|Croatian]], declared as the [[first language]] by 93.6% of the total population, followed by [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (2.6%) and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (1.0%).&lt;ref name="Census 2001"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]]|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/Hdefault.html|title=Popis stanovništva 2001.|trans-title=2001 Census|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent changes to the ethnic composition of Slavonian counties occurred between censuses conducted in 1991 and 2001. The 1991 census recorded a heterogenous population consisting mostly of Croats and Serbs—at 72 percent and 17 percent of the total population respectively. The Croatian War of Independence, and the ethnic fracturing of Yugoslavia that preceded it, caused an exodus of the Croat population followed by an exodus of Serbs. The return of refugees since the end of hostilities is not complete—a majority of Croat refugees returned, while fewer Serbs did. In addition, ethnic Croats moved to Slavonia from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia.&lt;ref name="Babić"/&gt;

The economy of Slavonia is largely based on [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade and [[processing industry]]. [[Food processing]] is one of the most significant types of the processing industries in the region, supporting agricultural production in the area and encompassing [[meat packing]], [[Canning|fruit and vegetable processing]], [[sugar refining]], [[confectionery]] and [[dairy industry]]. In addition, there are [[Winery|wineries]] in the region that are significant to [[economy of Croatia]]. Other types of the processing industry significant to Slavonia are [[wood processing]], including production of [[furniture]], [[cellulose]], paper and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]]; [[metalworking]], [[textile industry]] and [[glass production]]. [[Transport]] and [[civil engineering]] are two further significant economic activities in Slavonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Brod-Posavina County]]|format=PDF|language=Croatian|url=http://www.bpz.hr/_Data/Files/ŽRS%20BPŽ.pdf|title=Županijska razvojna strategija Brodsko-posavske županije|trans-title=County development strategy of the Brod-Posavina County|pages=27–40|location=[[Slavonski Brod]]|date=March 2011|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest industrial centre of Slavonia is Osijek, followed by other county seats—Slavonski Brod, Virovitica, Požega and Vukovar, as well as several other cities, especially Vinkovci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Vukovar-Srijem County]]|url=http://www.vusz.hr/Cms_Data/Contents/VSZ/Folders/dokumenti/upravni2/~contents/TKG2B8LCNJ8388YS/2011-10-5-4712203-informacijaostanjugospodarstvavukovarsko-srijemskezupanije2011..pdf|format=PDF|language=Croatian|title=Informacija o stanju gospodarstva Vukovarsko-srijemske županije|trans-title=Information on state of economy of the Vukovar-Srijem County|date=September 2011|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Osijek-Baranja County]]|url=http://www.obz.hr/en/index.php?tekst=101|title=County economy|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Employment Service|url=http://www.hzz.hr/default.aspx?id=4627|language=Croatian|title=Gospodarstvo Virovitičko-podravske županije|trans-title=Economy of Virovitica-Podravina County|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Brod-Posavina County]]|url=http://www.bpz.hr/opci_podaci/gospodarstvo_i_poljoprivreda/default.aspx|language=Croatian|title=Gospodarstvo Brodsko-posavske županije|trans-title=Economy of Brod-Posavina County|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Požega-Slavonia County]]|url=http://www.pszupanija.hr/profil-zupanije/gospodarski-profil-zupanije.html|title=Gospodarski profil županije|trans-title=Economic profile of the county|language=Croatian|accessdate=29 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203091223/http://www.pszupanija.hr/profil-zupanije/gospodarski-profil-zupanije.html|archivedate=3 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the five counties in Slavonia combined (in year 2008) amounted to 6,454&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]], or 8,005&amp;nbsp;euro per capita—27.5% below Croatia's national average.

Another major sector of the economy of Slavonia is agriculture, which also provides part of the raw materials for the processing industry. Out of {{convert|1077403|ha|abbr=off}} of utilized agricultural land in Croatia, {{convert|493878|ha|abbr=off}}, or more than 45%, are found in Slavonia, with the largest portion of the land situated in the Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Syrmia counties. The largest areas are used for production of [[cereal]]s and [[oilseed]]s, covering {{convert|574916|ha|abbr=off}} and {{convert|89348|ha|abbr=off}} respectively. Slavonia's share in Croatia's agriculturally productive land is greatest in the production of cereals (53.5%), [[legume]]s (46.8%), oilseeds (88.8%), sugar beet (90%), tobacco (97.9%), plants used in pharmaceutical or perfume industry (80.9%), flowers, seedlings and seeds (80.3%) and plants used in the textile industry (69%). Slavonia also contributes 25.7% of cattle, 42.7% of pigs and 20% of the poultry stock of Croatia. There are {{convert|5138|ha|abbr=off}} of vineyards in Slavonia, representing 18.6% of total vineyards area in Croatia. Production of fruit and nuts also takes up a significant agricultural area. Apple orchards cover {{convert|1261|ha|abbr=off}}, representing 42.3% of Croatia's apple plantations, plums are produced in orchards encompassing {{convert|450|ha|abbr=off}} or 59.7% of Croatia's plum plantations and hazelnut orchards cover {{convert|319|ha|abbr=off}}, which account for 72.4% of hazelnut plantations in Croatia.

The [[cultural heritage]] of Slavonia represents a blend of social influences through its history, especially since the end of the 17th century, and the traditional culture. A particular impact was made by [[Baroque]] art and architecture of the 18th century, when the cities of Slavonia started developing after the Ottoman wars ended and stability was restored to the area. The period saw great prominence of the nobility, who were awarded estates in Slavonia by the imperial court in return for their service during the wars. They included [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], the [[House of Esterházy]], the House of [[Odescalchi]], [[Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich]], the House of [[Prandau-Normann Castle|Prandau-Normann]], the [[House of Pejačević]] and the [[List of noble families of Croatia|House of Janković]]. That in turn encouraged an influx of contemporary European culture to the region. Subsequent development of the cities and society saw the influence of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] and especially of [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name="Heritage-modern"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)]]|url=http://www.bastina-slavonija.info/TematskeCjeline.aspx?id=31|title=Novi vijek|trans-title=Modern history|language=Croatian|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of the region includes numerous [[landmark]]s, especially [[manor house]]s built by the nobility in largely in the 18th and the 19th centuries.

'''Juan Víctor Pradera Larumbe''' (1872–1936) was a Spanish political theorist and a [[Carlist]] politician.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - La Concha, San Sebastián, Basque Country, Spain, ca. 1898.jpg|left|thumbnail|San Sebastián, late 19th century]]
Víctor's paternal family originated from France; his grandfather, [[Juan Pradera Martinena]], lived in the [[Basque people|Basque]] town of [[Sare]] ([[Labourd]] province),&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Guinea Suárez, ''Víctor Pradera'', (series ''Temas españoles'', n. 37), Madrid 1953, available  [http://www.filosofia.org/mon/tem/es0037.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; but moved across the [[Pyrenees]] and settled in [[Etxalar|Endara de Etxalar]].&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Orella Martínez, ''Víctor Pradera: Un católico en la vida pública de principios de siglo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8479145579}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Víctor's father, [[Francisco Pradera Leiza]], was an [[:es:indiano|indiano]]. As a youngster he emigrated to [[Americas|America]] and spent 16 years in [[Cuba]];&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; enriched, he returned to Navarre&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953, Orella Martínez 2000, p. 14, also Idioia Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'', available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/118372 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and married a [[Pamplona|pamplonesa]],&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Filomena Larumbe,&lt;ref&gt;some sources prefer the “Larrumbe” spelling, see the official Cortes service [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2891350%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; descendant to a petty [[bourgeoisie]] family. Her father, [[Ángel Larumbe Iturralde]],&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953, Orella Martínez 2000, p. 14, ''LARUMBE ITURRALDE, Ángel'' entry at ''Gran Enciclopedia Navarra'' online available [http://www.enciclopedianavarra.com/navarra/larumbe-iturralde-angel/10772 here]&lt;/ref&gt; sided with the legitimists during the [[First Carlist War]] and narrowly escaped execution, later to settle in [[Vera de Bidasoa]] and to practise as a [[notary]].&lt;ref&gt;he also supported the Carlists during the [[Second Carlist War]], Guinea Suárez 1953, Orella Martínez 2000, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Víctor was born&lt;ref&gt;the first Pradera’s biography claimed he was born 1873, see Maximilian García Venero, ''Víctor Pradera, guerrillero de la unidad'', Madrid 1943, s. 17, and this information has been adopted by almost all other authors; the recent biography claims the correct date is 1872, see Orella Martínez 2000, p. 17, also his ''El origen del primer católicismo Español'', [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; as the first of four sons, Juan Víctor, Luis, Juan&lt;ref&gt;to distinguish between Juan Víctor and Juan José, the older brother was called Victor and this is how he passed into history, Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; and Germán. In 1879 he moved with the family to San Sebastian following the professional lot of his father, who ran a commercial construction business.&lt;ref&gt;some sources claim he constructed houses, see Orella Martínez 2000, p. 15, some sources suggest he was running a commerce business related to construction, Francisco J. Carballo, ''Recordando a Víctor Pradera. Homenaje y crítica'', [in:] ''Aportes'' 81 (2013), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Having obtained [[bachillerato]] in [[Instituto de San Sebastian]]&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; in 1887&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; he spent a year in [[Bordeaux]] and then another one in [[Bilbao]], studying at the [[Jesuit]] [[Deusto|Deusto college]] and preparing for engineer studies.&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953, Orella Martínez 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Having moved to [[Madrid]] Pradera entered [[Escuela de Ingenieros (Madrid)|Escuela de Ingenieros]],&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953, Orella Martínez 2000, p. 17;&lt;/ref&gt; exact year of his graduation is unknown. He returned to [[Gipuzkoa]] in 1897&lt;ref&gt;Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe'', Orella Martínez 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]], engaged in the paper mill business of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly successful as a manager, Pradera later amalgamated the family enterprise into the [[Papelera Española]] trust of [[:ca:Rafael Picavea Leguía|Rafael Picavea]] and became a shareholder of this company,&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; involved in its activities until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;some authors claim he gave up business in 1902, see Orella Martínez 2000, p. 17, though he was reported as engaged as late as 1904, see ''Madrid cientifico'' 1904, p. 19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001763100&amp;page=19 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the century he commenced studying law as an unenrolled student in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953, Carballo 2013, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; which he continued for 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;at that time he was alrady a Cortes deputy; taking the exams unrecognised, Pradera did not reveal his deputy status, see Carballo 2013, p 101&lt;/ref&gt; Having graduated, in San Sebastian he opened the law chancery and practiced as Inspector General in Cuerpo de Ingenieros de Canales y Puertos simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; At unspecified date he obtained PhD in law in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Ibarra, ''Biografias de los ilustres navarros del siglo XIX y parte del XX'', v. 4, Pamplona 1953, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera married a [[San Sebastián|donostiarra]], María Ortega,&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 101; Rafael Castela Santos, ''La ejemplar muerte del diputado carlista Víctor Pradera en 1936'', [in:] ''A casa de Sarto'', 13.10.05, available [http://casadesarto.blogspot.com/2005/10/la-ejemplar-muerte-del-diputado.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had 4 children, Javier to become a prominent Francoist politician.&lt;ref&gt;see his entry at ''Indice Historico de Diputados'', available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2891360%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; Víctor's grandson, [[Javier Pradera]], made his name as a well-known anti-Francoist journalist and publisher, dubbed watchman of the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;see ''El Pais'' 21.11.11, available [http://elpais.com/elpais/2011/11/21/inenglish/1321856446_850210.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young Carlist==

During his academic years Pradera was active in various Catholic organizations and developed interest in politics. Raised in a liberal ambience and – apart from his maternal grandfather – with no family antecedents, in the 1890s he neared Carlism as a result of his lectures; unlike most [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalists]] who inherited their outlook from forefathers, Pradera considered himself a “scientific Carlist”.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 183, Carballo 2013, p.  99&lt;/ref&gt; Already recognized as an orator, in [[Spanish general election, 1899|1899]]&lt;ref&gt;at a minimum legal age, Carballo 2013, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; he was agreed to stand as an unofficial&lt;ref&gt;Jose María Remirez de Ganuza López, ''Las Elecciones Generales de 1898 y 1899 en Navarra'', [in] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; Carlist candidate in Tolosa. Benefitting from just commencing rapprochement between mainstream Carlists and the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrists]], he was elected defeating a governmental candidate;&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012, p. 360; Pradera was sworn two weeks behind schedule, the usual practice employed by the Carlists, who declined to swear obedience to the Alfonsist monarchy, see Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matías Barrio y Mier|Matias Barrio]] appointed him speaker of the small Carlist minority.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Spanish–American War|1898 disaster]] Pradera formed the first wave of [[Regenerationism|regeneracionistas]], demanding profound if not revolutionary change.&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; A young newcomer in the chamber, he regularly clashed with [[Francisco Silvela|Silvela]],&lt;ref&gt;apart from other issues, also protesting the cession of [[Caroline Islands]] to Germany, see Carballo 2013, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating logic combined with oratory skills&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; as well as hot temper.&lt;ref&gt;there were penal proceedings launched against Pradera for assaulting “agentes de la autoridad”, see ''La Epoca'' 22.01.00, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000654070&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Re-elected in [[Spanish general election, 1901|1901]],&lt;ref&gt;this time as an official Carlist candidate, see ''Indice Historico de Diputados'' available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=2-2&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2891350%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; he went on confronting the old liberal enemies and took on the new ones, especially republican radicals and nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, pp. 25-41&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to run for re-election in the subsequent campaign of [[Spanish general election, 1903|1903]], but eventually resigned due to financial issues.&lt;ref&gt;a highly apologetic source claims that Pradera refused to engage in corruption practices, see Guinea Suárez 1953. Contemporary scholars suggest there was no corruption involved and he rather considered it immoral to finance his own campaign, see Carballo 2013, p. 101; ''ABC'' 04.09.86 claims he was defeated, see [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1986/09/04/047.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 Pradera was elected from Tolosa to [[:es:Diputación Foral de Guipúzcoa|Diputación Provincial]].&lt;ref&gt;though it is not clear whether he served only one term or was re-elected, Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe'', see also ''Gestión de Las Diputaciones'' available [http://meta.gipuzkoakultura.net/bitstream/10690/71493/1/AM_316783.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Esteban de Bilbao Eguía]] and [[Julio Urquijo Ibarra|Julio Urquijo]] he formed a new generation of activists, promoted by the claimant [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]] and the party leader [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|marqués de Cerralbo]] in their bid to build a modern Carlist network.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Orella Martínez, ''El origen del primer catolicismo social español'' [PhD thesis at Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Madrid 2012, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

His deputy duties terminated, Pradera dedicated himself to family life, business&lt;ref&gt;he owned shares of a number of San Sebastian companies, see Felix Luengo Teixidor, ''Crecimiento económico y cambio social. Guipuscoa 1917-1923'', Bilbao 1990, {{ISBN|9788460073741}}, p. 353, Angel García-Sanz Marcotegui, ''Elites económicas y políticas en la Restauración, a diversidad de las derechas navarras'' [in:] ''Historia contemporánea'' 23 (2001), p. 602; apart from Papeleria Española the company identified was Cooperativa Eléctrica Donostiarra, see Juan Antonio Saez García, ''Infrastructuras de servicios urbanos'', [in:] ''Geografia e historia de Donostia-San Sebastian'', available [http://www.ingeba.org/liburua/donostia/54ssinfr/543urb/543sssur.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and intellectual work.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2013, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; He remained engaged in party life, though his relations with local leadership deteriorated. In course of the [[Spanish general election, 1910|1910 electoral campaign]] he sought rapprochement with the mauristas and supported a stand-alone candidate;&lt;ref&gt;José Joaquín Castañeda, son of Joaquín Castañeda y Otermín, see Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; both were expelled from the party by its Gipuzkoan jefe, [[Tirso Olazábal Lardizábal|Tirso de Olazabal]].&lt;ref&gt;Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe''. The background of this conflict remains unknown, though there are some suggestions in Luis M.a de Zavala y Fernández de Heredia (ed.), ''La sociedad vasca del siglo XIX en la correspondencia del Archivo de la Casa de Zavala'', Lasarte 2008, {{ISBN|9788496288706}}, p. 67: “Siendo tildado su mandato como personalista, en 1910 expulsó a Víctor Pradera del Partido por indisciplina”; Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, P''recendentes del proyecto ultraderechista mellista en el periodo 1900-1912'', [in:]  ''Boletín de la Real Academia de la Historia'', 202 (2005), p. 125 approaches this conflict as a pre-Mellist controversy; the press communique does not go into details, see ''El Imparcial'' 05.05.10, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000265320&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Re-admitted in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;following personal meeting with Don Jaime in San Jean de Luz in May 1912, see ''La correspondencia militar'' 14.05.12, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001362374&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera continued his career as an orator on public meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Calavia Urdaniz, ''«La Conciliación» de Pamplona y sus relaciones con los sindicatos católico-libres (1915-1923)'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing a wide range of issues, he was increasingly focused on confronting the emerging Basque national aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  As he gained a nationwide expert recognition, in 1917 [[Álvaro de Figueroa, 1st Count of Romanones|de Romanones]] called him into extra-parliamentarian committee to discuss [[Catalonia|Catalan]] autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;with Alcala Zamora, Sanchez Toca and Maura, Orella Martínez 2013, p. 172,&lt;/ref&gt; Elected to the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in [[Spanish general election, 1918|1918]],&lt;ref&gt;as substitute of de Mella, who refused to stand, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 08.04.18, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000353101&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he became the key Carlist speaker.&lt;ref&gt;in 1918 it was Pradera outlining the Carlist policy in the Cortes, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; Forging friendship with [[Antonio Maura]], he nevertheless opposed grand but hazy coalitions aimed at preserving shaky stability of the late [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]]. Aware of the forthcoming revolutionary tide,&lt;ref&gt;Pradera opposed amnesting [[Julián Besteiro|Besteiro]] and [[Francisco Largo Caballero|Largo]], convicted of 1917 revolt, Carballo 2013, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; he advocated a radical Traditionalist change.&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time [[Jaimismo (1909-1931 phase of Carlism)|Jaimismo]] was increasingly paralysed by a multidimensional conflict between its key ideologue, [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]], and the [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|claimant]] himself. Pradera, who befriended de Mella and remained heavily influenced by his vision, sided with the rebels,&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 183, since Pradera was attracted to Carlism by its theory and not dynastical allegiance, the decision to abandon Don Jaime was not hard for him, see Carballo 2013, p. 99; the same author claims (p. 105) that Pradera joined de Mella sharing his anti-Entente views&lt;/ref&gt; in 1919 joining their [[:es:Partido Católico Tradicionalista|Partido Católico Tradicionalista]].&lt;ref&gt;he was appointed the regional jefe in Gipuzkoa, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 268, details in Orella Martinez 2000, pp. 69-89&lt;/ref&gt; Animating the [[Mellismo|Mellist]] ''Diario de Navarra'',&lt;ref&gt;its editor-in-chief was Raimundo García , Eduardo González Calleja, ''La prensa carlista y falangista durante la Segunda República y la Guerra Civil (1931-1937)'', [in:] ''El Argonauta español'' 9 (2012), p. 29, p. 4; Ignacio Olabarri Gortázar, ''Notas sobre la implantación, la estructura organizativa y el ideario de los partidos del turno en Navarra, 1901-1923'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p 323, claims that ''Diario de Navarra'' was indeed identified with Pradera during the last years of Restoration&lt;/ref&gt; he unsuccessfully ran for the  Cortes in [[Spanish general election, 1919|1919]],&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 102 does not specify whether Pradera ran on Jaimist or Mellist ticket; according to ''La Correspondencia de España'' 21.05.19 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000791591&amp;page=3 here] the national Carlist political leader Pascual Comín disauthorised Pradera as a Mellist&lt;/ref&gt; failing also in his 1920 bid for the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;he was reported by the contemporary press as fielding his candidacy, but it is unclear whether he actually ran, see ''El Globo'' 24.12.20 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001479058&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; During final years of Restauración he was in vain lured by both [[:es:Bipartidismo en España|partidos turnistas]], offering him safe place on electoral lists and ministerial jobs;&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953, Carballo 2013, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera remained the PCT party jefe in Gipzukoa.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s Pradera's relations with de Mella deteriorated. According to one theory, Mella favored a loose federation of extreme Right parties, while Pradera opted for a new party of the Right. According to another, Mella perceived Pradera's vision as minimalist, suspecting him of hidden [[laicism]] and embracing parliamentarism.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Most detailed study available pursues the theory of orthodox de Mella disdainful to "possibilist" and "minimalist" Pradera.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 228-237, 253-256; in this vision, praderismo differed from mellismo by recognition of Alfonso XIII, ideological reductionism, adopting authoritatian threads and broadening the alliance base&lt;/ref&gt; One more theory claims that the two clashed later and the point of contention was policy towards the [[Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 358. According to the author, Mella preferred the loosely organised empire of España de los Austrias, while Pradera opted for España de Reyes Catolicos, idealised and unitarian, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera decided to go his own way, taking a number of mellistas with him;&lt;ref&gt;Some claim that PSP enabled survival of Mellismo, embracing most of the orphaned Mellistas, as officially Mellism amalgamated into Jaimismo in 1927, see Carballo 2013, p. 106, also Orella Martínez 2000, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; de Mella himself, plagued by health problems and with both his legs [[amputated]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, Umierac ale powoli, Krakow 2006, {{ISBN|8386225742}}, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; gradually retired into private and intellectual life.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 268. In the aftermath of de Mella’s death in 1928 Pradera was president of Comisión Ejecutiva de la Junta de Homenaje, Carballo 2013, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 Pradera set up [[:es:Partido Social Popular|Partido Social Popular]],&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; intended to be a vehicle of a new, possibilist policy making.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Olábarri Gortázar, ''Víctor Pradera y el Partido Social Popular (1922-1923)'', [in:] ''Estudios de historia moderna y contemporánea: homenaje a Federico Suárez Verdeguer'', Madrid 1991, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Incompatible with the Carlist intransigence,&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, pp. 300-301&lt;/ref&gt; it was envisioned as a broad alliance rather than a party.&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars suggest it was principally inspired by social theories of [[Leo XIII]],&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, Orella Martínez 2012, Carballo 2013; some authors claim that emergence of the party was also spurred by Catalan and Basque electoral successes of 1917-1918, and Pradera was primarily concerned with unity and integrity of Spain, Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; at that time advanced in Spain mostly by the Zaragoza school of [[Salvador Minguijón Adrián|Salvador Minguijon]];&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; it was supposed to confront the rising socialist tide.&lt;ref&gt;Pradera perceived socialism as an ideology depriving a human of its transcendence, literally the devil’s work , Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 215-217&lt;/ref&gt; Though the party is occasionally described as a distant preconfiguration of [[Christian Democracy]],&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso, ''El Carlismo y su signo'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'', 14 (2008), p. 122 criticizes Orella’s work for downplaying Pradera’s hostility to christian democracy and to Angel Herrera; Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 259, 378 suggests that it was rather Ossorio representing christian democracy, while Pradera stood for corporativism&lt;/ref&gt; proto-Fascism or renewed Traditionalism,&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; most summarise its program as [[Catholic social teaching|social-Catholicism]],&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 214, 268,  Orella Martínez 2000, pp. 89-117&lt;/ref&gt; modeled on the [[Centre Party (Germany)|German Catholic Centre Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The party slogan was: Religión, Patria, Estado, Propiedad y Familia.&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; PSP opposed representation based on popular election system and advocated a corporative representation instead;&lt;ref&gt;which later gave rise to claims of the party having been proto-fascist, see Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 306,&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera appreciated good will of Christian-democrats like [[Ángel Herrera Oria|Herrera Oria]], but claimed that their [[Lesser evil|malmenorismo]] opens the door to revolution, he also preferred monarchism to Christian-democratic [[Accidentalism (poliitics)|accidentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The PSP social program included [[progressive taxation]] and social legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 306. However, Pradera was reluctant to accept employee stock ownership, tenants’ right to buy off the land cultivated and the [[female vote]], see Orella Martínez 2012, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Though some of its leaders clearly excluded ruling by force, Pradera remained rather ambiguous on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09414, Primo de Rivera.jpg|165px|thumbnail|[[Primo de Rivera]]]]
Most “pesepistas” welcomed Primo de Rivera dictatorship;&lt;ref&gt;Olabarri Gortazar 1991, pp. 308-309&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera greeted him enthusiastically&lt;ref&gt;Pradera did not know Primo personally and was rather skeptical of him, mostly due to his alleged idea of abandoning Marocco; the Mellistas nurtured a vision of a federation between Spain, Portugal and Morocco, Carballo 2013, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; as a long overdue regeneracionismo.  Asked by Primo for an interview,&lt;ref&gt;José Manuel Cuenca Toribio, ''La Unión Patriótica. Una revisión'', [in:] ''Espacio, Tiempo y Forma'', 9 (1996), p. 127, Rafael Gambra, ''Víctor Pradera en el pórtico doctrinal del Alzamiento'', [in:] ''Revista de Estudios Políticos'' 192 (1973), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera suggested that the new regime should ban all parties,&lt;ref&gt;including his own&lt;/ref&gt; introduce corporative representation, build a presidentialist government and construct a regionalist state,&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; a vision developed further on in 4 memoranda, supplied to the dictator.&lt;ref&gt;on state organization, elections, organization of justice and organization of the government and its relations with the Cortes, see Guinea Suárez 1953; Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 308, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera engaged in advocating dictatorship in the press&lt;ref&gt;in top dailies like ''ABC'' or ''El Debate'', see Carballo 2013, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and remained officially Primo's assessor until 1927,&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; when he entered [[:es:Asamblea Nacional Consultiva|Asamblea Nacional]]. Member of the Proyectos de Leyes Constitucionales section,&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; he strived to institutionalize the system by working on a new constitution, conceived in line with his corporativist vision.&lt;ref&gt;and with the government responsible before the king, not before the parliament, Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Pradera's intellectual contribution to Primo's rule was so eminent that he is sometimes considered a point of reference for primoderiverismo.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus Maria Fuente Langas, ''Los tradicionalistas navarros bajo la dictadura de Primo de Rivera (1923–1930)'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 55 (1994), p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; However, his relations with the dictator deteriorated, the first controversies surfacing in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera was disturbed by the perceived self-adulation of Primo, preserving liberal features of the ancient regime, and generally inertia prevailing over a decisive change.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; He considered [[Spanish Patriotic Union|Union Patriotica]] a mistake,&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1973, pp. 158-9&lt;/ref&gt; opposed centralization and did not agree with [[Calvo Sotelo]] on financial policy, the fiscal system in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the late 1920s Primo was increasingly irritated by Pradera's criticism, the latter remained supportive until the very end.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, pp. 117-135&lt;/ref&gt; It was only long after the regime's fall that Pradera started to view it as a delusive spell of stability between bewilderment of the late Restauración and chaos of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1973, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconciled Carlist==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumb|200px|left|Carlist standard]]
During the first republican [[Spanish general election, 1931|electoral campaign of 1931]] Pradera was supposed to join [[:es:Coalición católico-fuerista|lista católico-fuerista]], but eventually he refused to form ranks with the despised [[Partido Nacionalista Vasco|Basque nationalists]] and withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Maximiliano Garcia Venero, ''Historia de la Unificacion'', Madrid 1970, p. 65, Ana Serrano Moreno, ''Las elecciones a Cortes Constituyentes de 1931 en Navarra'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 50 (1989), p. 699, Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''Los frustrados intentos de colaboración entre el partido nacionalista vasco y la derecha navarra durante la segunda república'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; He drew close to the Jaimistas,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. taking part in joint initiatives like a letter protesting measures applied against [[Pedro Segura y Sáenz|cardinal Segura]], Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''1868 en la memoria carlista de 1931: dos revoluciones anticlericales y un paralelo'', [in:] ''Hispania Sacra'' 119 (2007), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; but remained hesitant about returning to their party.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after the death of Don Jaime that in 1932 Pradera decided to lead his followers and the orphaned mellistas&lt;ref&gt;some claim they were named "praderistas" at the time, see the Partido Carlista version available [http://partidocarlista.com/?p=1024 here]&lt;/ref&gt; to the united Carlist organization, [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]],&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo González Calleja 2012, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; entering its executive.&lt;ref&gt;González Calleja 2012, p. 192, Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 1975, {{ISBN|9780521207294}} , p.133&lt;/ref&gt; He also became head of the newly established Council of Culture,&lt;ref&gt;the Carlist body entrusted with synthesis and diffusion of the ideology, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; rising into a formally acknowledged movement's intellectual leader. His career of a public servant was crowned in 1933, when he was elected&lt;ref&gt;from Navarre and the Basque Country, Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe''&lt;/ref&gt; to [[:es:Tribunal de Garantías Constitucionales de España|Tribunal de Garantías Constitucionales de España]].&lt;ref&gt;elected into the Tribunal, he could no longer serve as a deputy, Carballo 2013, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he unsuccessfully run for its presidency.&lt;ref&gt;but with 27 votes gained he lost to Fernando Gasset Lacasaña, who got 262, Salvador Belles, ''El alcalde que o quiso ser embajador'', available [http://www3.uji.es/~belles/Salvador%20Belles/Seres%20Humanos%20de%20Castell%F3n/Fernando%20Gasset%20Lacasa%F1a.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Pradera was admitted to Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislación.&lt;ref&gt;José Miguel de Mayoralgo y Lodo, ''Movimiento Nobiliario 1936'', available [http://www.ariasdereyna.com/Documentos/Libros-otros/Movimiento%20nobiliario%201936%20%20%28Zayas%20y%20Arias%20de%20Reina%29.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pradera did not display a dynastical zeal; as the [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|new claimant]] was an octogenarian with no issue, he considered recognising [[Don Juan de Borbón|Don Juan]] as Carlist king.&lt;ref&gt;and sounded him on that perspective, Santiago Sanchez Martinez, ''El cardelnal Pedro Segura y Saenz (1880-1957)'' [PhD Univ de Navarra], Pamplona 2002, p. 256, also Carballo 2013, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Within Comunión Pradera formed an influential minority endorsing a broad monarchical alliance with the [[Alfonsist monarchist|Alfonsists]]. He wholeheartedly engaged in [[Acción Española]]&lt;ref&gt;the alliance was dominated by Alfonsinos, with only Pradera and Rodezno representing Carlism, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; and became vice-president of [[Sociedad Cultural Española]], the official owner of ''Acción Española'' periodical.&lt;ref&gt;Pradera was persuaded to withdraw as his presence gave rise to controvereies, Carballo 2013, p. 113-4; some authors claim he was the only Carlist in the board, see Blinkhorn 1975, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He then proved one of key Carlists joining [[Bloque Nacional (Spanish alliance of 1930s)|Bloque Nacional]],&lt;ref&gt;some authors consider him a co-founder of Bloque Nacional, see Eduardo Palomar Baró, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe (1873-1936)'' entry at ''generalisimofranco'' site available [http://www.generalisimofranco.com/caidos/varios/00008.htm here], Garcia Venero 1970, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  entering its executive committee and working out its manifesto, most likely a compromise between himself and Calvo Sotelo.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 189-190&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera continued confronting accidentalist Christian-democracy; his campaign against [[CEDA]] was so virulent that Carlist leaders felt pressed to call for moderation.&lt;ref&gt;Pradera was also outraged that when looking for coalition allies, Gil Robles preferred Lerroux to Carlists, Carballo 2013, p. 116, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Initially Pradera's drive towards a monarchist alliance was shared by the party leaders; it was rather the rank-and-file who saw no purpose mixing with debris of the hated liberal dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2007, p. 358, Carballo 2013, pp. 112-3&lt;/ref&gt; When Alfonso Carlos replaced [[Tomás Domínguez Arévalo]] with the intransigent [[Manuel Fal Condé|Manuel Fal]], Pradera and the entire Junta resigned.&lt;ref&gt;fellow Carlists ironically dubbed them “reconocementeros”, a mockery derivate of “reconocimiento”, see Calleja 2012, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Though Fal permitted Rodezno and Pradera to pursue their tactics on a private business basis, none of them was a match for the personality of Calvo Sotelo. As the growing feeling was that Alfonsinos were gaining the upper hand in Bloque Nacional, Fal decided to withdraw and Pradera hesitantly complied; he focused on fighting secularization, democracy, socialism, nationalism and all perceived evils of the republic as an author, publishing press articles and books.&lt;ref&gt;compare Blinkhorn 1975, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorist==
{{main|The New State}}
[[File:Estado nuevo.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|''[[The New State|El Estado Nuevo]]'']]
Pradera's political vision was taking shape in course of some 40 years, to be finally integrated in ''[[The New State|El Estado Nuevo]]'', the book published in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;and containing articles published in ''Acción Española'' throughout 1934, José Luis Orella Martínez, ''Víctor Pradera; un intelectual entre los ismos de una época'', [in:] ''Navarra: memoria e imagen'' vol. 2, Pamplona 2006, {{ISBN|8477681791}}. Available also [http://www.arbil.org/113orel.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is usually viewed as anchored in works of Vázquez de Mella, considered by Pradera the intellectual master. Other sources of inspiration listed are [[Encyclical|papal encyclicals]], [[Charles Maurras|Maurras]], [[Juan Donoso Cortés|Donoso Cortes]] and, last but not least, [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''La recepción del pensamiento conservador-radical europeo en España (1913-1930)'', [in:] ''Espacio, Tiempo, Forma'', 3 (1990), p. 224, Carballo 2013, p. 114, 122, Gambra 1973, p. 149, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pradera, rights of a man exist only when combined with his duties towards God&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2006, pp. 257-268&lt;/ref&gt; and are unacceptable as deified [[Rousseau, Jean Jacques|Rousseau's]] “human rights”.&lt;ref&gt;Pradera considered Rousseau’s vision another version of Pelagianism, Carballo 2013, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; It is natural that men form different entities (e.g. families, guilds, regions etc.), which interact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Las derechas españolas ante la crisis del 98'', [in:] ''Historia contemporánea'' 15 (1997), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; They are topped by a nation, which is an organically constituted society of societies.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2006, pp. 257-268&lt;/ref&gt; A nation is best expressed as a monarchy, its unity ensured by King and Church.&lt;ref&gt;González Cuevas  1997, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Royal powers are limited by principles of divine order and by sovereignty of the nation's components.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, pp. 119-121, Bartyzel 2006, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; A democratic individualist representation can not express this sovereignty, which is to be voiced by an organic representation.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, pp. 119, 123-125&lt;/ref&gt; Since parties tear every society apart, the Cortes should be composed of representatives of 6 main classes,&lt;ref&gt;David Soto Carrasco, ''Víctor Pradera: políticas viejas para un estado nuevo'', available [https://www.academia.edu/2446125/V%C3%ADctor_Pradera_pol%C3%ADticas_viejas_para_un_estado_nuevo here]&lt;/ref&gt; plus delegates of various state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2006, pp. 257-268&lt;/ref&gt; The law is defined by the king, with auxiliary role of the Cortes and the Council. The state is a fairly withdrawn structure;&lt;ref&gt;some authors claim that state envisaged by Pradera was still far stronger than that envisioned by most Carlists, and “sovereignty” was reserved only for this very state, see Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 359-360&lt;/ref&gt; its principal responsibilities defined as safeguarding the country, ensuring internal order and executing justice.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G Payne, ''Navarrismo y españolismo en la política navarra bajo la Segunda República'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'', 166-167 (1982), p. 901&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic principles provide the logic,&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2006, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; and the corporativist state provides the machinery to solve social problems and implement mechanisms regulating distribution of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;economic issues discussed in detail by Carballo 2013, pp. 132-142&lt;/ref&gt; How this vision was to be achieved remained unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn, a highly critical British historian who in 1975 could not resist the temptation to engage in polemics with Pradera, argued that the weak point of ''Estado Nuevo'' was missing vision of how the Praderian state should be achieved. He suggested that Pradera simply presupposed the existence of a sympathetic consensus, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 151, the same opinion in Bartyzel 2006, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Francisco Franco 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Francisco Franco]]]]
''El Estado Nuevo'' was enthusiastically accepted among Carlists,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 146, José Luis Rodríguez Jiménez, ''La extrema derecha en España: del tardofranquismo a la consolidación de la democracia (1957-1982)'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8484661296}}, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera replacing de Mella as their top theorist.&lt;ref&gt;Pradera’s reception among the Carlists is a history of its own. Initially he was acknowledged with enthusiasm. Once he started to serve as a founding father of Francoism, Carlists began to ignore Pradera, see Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 355, 370. For the Carlist progressists he was worse than ignored – he was banned; “Nosotros nunca citamos a Víctor Pradera” – declared [[Ramón Massó Tarruella|Massó]], see Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 400-02. At that point the Carlist traditionalists like Gambra ceased to “forget” Pradera (Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 403, 408); it was in 1971 that Tejada and Gambra referred to Pradera in ''¿Qué es el carlismo?'' and started quoting him as a Carlist master, see Gambra 1973. He was hailed as intellectual giant by Fuerza Nueva, see Rodríguez Jiménez, 2002, pp.  271-2, 288. Today Traditionalist Carlists refer to Pradera with caution, considering him a sincere Carlist who got eclectic over time, compare Ayuso 2008, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Also other sections of the Spanish Right, deprived of a comparable credo, viewed the work with respect if not envy.&lt;ref&gt;there are also scholars who claim exactly the opposite, namely that Pradera was throwing “jealous insults” towards Jose Antonio and the Spanish fascists, see Ferrán Gallego, ''El evangelio fascista: la formación de la cultura política del franquismo (1930-1950)'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|8498926769}}, 9788498926767, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Republican intellectuals pointed that Pradera questioned all political science and reduced politics to following historical circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;like Ortega y Marañon, see Soto Carrasco, ''Víctor Pradera: políticas viejas para un estado nuevo'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Pradera's impact on [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] remains disputed. In the newspaper version he appears as "one of the icons and pilars of Francoism".&lt;ref&gt;Apart from being “an unknown and forgotten man”, nowadays, see Jorge Trias Sagnier, ''De Pradera a Companys'', [in:] ''ABC'' 25.10.04, available [http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-25-10-2004/abc/Opinion/de-pradera-a-companys_96369808738.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many scholars consider Pradera one of caudillo's masters,&lt;ref&gt;according to some, ''Estado Nuevo'' “ se convirtió en breviario político e institucional de Franco”, see Eduardo Palomar Baró, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe (1873-1936)'', while ''Estado Nuevo'' was “uno de los libros que más influyó en el pensamiento político de Franco”, Payne 1982, p. 901&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to his prologue to the 1945 re-edition&lt;ref&gt;actual text [http://s.libertaddigital.com/doc/el-prologo-de-franco-a-las-obras-de-victor-pradera-41913155.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; and later references;&lt;ref&gt;Xose Manoel Nuñez Seixas, ''Nations in arms against the invader: on nationalist discourses during the Spanish civil war'', [in:] Chris Ealham and Michael Richards (eds.), ''The Splintering of Spain. Cultural History and the Spanish Civil War, 1936 –1939'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; to them, ''Estado Nuevo'' is a forerunner of Francoist state and its clear theoretical lecture.&lt;ref&gt;David Soto Carrasco, ''Víctor Pradera: políticas viejas para un estado nuevo''; also Serrano Suñer appreciated Pradera as a theorist, see Rodríguez Jiménez 2001, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Though some in-depth studies on Francoism even claim that the regime was related to Traditionalism rather than to fascism,&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Redondo Galvez, ''Política, cultura y sociedad en la España de Franco, 1939–1975'', vol. 1, ''La configuración del Estado espanol, nacional y católico (1939–1947)'', Pamplona 1999, {{ISBN|8431317132}}; accordint to the author, "el autoritarismo franquista no fue de signo fascista sino tradicionalista", see Juan María Sanchez-Prieto, ''Lo que fué y lo que no fué Franco'', [in:] ''Nueva Revista de Política, Cultura y Arte'' 69 (2000), pp. 30-38&lt;/ref&gt; other detailed works on the topic barely mention Pradera.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Pulpillo Leiva, ''Orígenes del Franquismo: la construcción de la “Nueva España” (1936–1941)'', [PhD thesis], Madrid 2013, esp. pp. 717-737&lt;/ref&gt; Most detailed biographical studies refrain from making direct links between Pradera and [[Francoism]].&lt;ref&gt;with Francoist omnipotent state, accidentalist regime, centralization, monopolist party, arbitrarily designed representation and Church subservient to state deemed incompatible with Pradera's vision of a withdrawn state, monarchism, regionalisation, abolishment of parties, corporative representation and state subservient to Church, see Orella Martinez's works listed&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Contemporary scholars do not agree how Pradera's theory should be classified.&lt;ref&gt;in a recent work Pradera is presented as a pivotal figure in the process of Carlism gradually melting down within a broad extreme Right between 1876 and 1936, see Javier Esteve Martí, ''El carlismo ante la reorganización de las derechas. De la Segunda Guerra Carlista a la Guerra Civil'' [in:] ''Pasado y Memoria. Revista de Historia Contemporánea'' 13 (2014), pp. 119-140&lt;/ref&gt; Most extensive studies suggest that his vision falls somewhere between [[Catholic social teaching|social-Catholicism]] and [[corporativism]], the closest European incarnations having been [[Dolfuss]]’ [[Austrofascism|Austria]] and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar's]] [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2000, p. 11, Orella Martínez 2006, pp. 257-268. The author notes that in countries like Portugal, Austria, Romania and Hungary the conservatives persecuted fascists, while in Belgium, Norway, Italy and Slovakia the two formations worked hand in hand&lt;/ref&gt; Other options offered are [[Carlism|traditionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;some consider Pradera’s works Traditionalism at its best, see Gonzalo Fernández de la Mora, ''Los teóricos izquierdistas de la democracia orgánica'', Barcelona 1985, p. 188, others see it as evolution of typical Carlism, since  regionalism and dynastical allegiance gave way to corporativism and organicism&lt;/ref&gt; national traditionalism,&lt;ref&gt;most quoted phrase from the book was that “Estado Nuevo is the old traditional state”, Javier Ugarte Tellería, ''El carlismo en la guerra del 36. La formación de un cuasi-estado nacional-corporativo y foral en la zona vasco-navarra'', [in:] ''Historia contemporánea'' 38 (2009), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; corporative neotraditionalist monarchism,&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''Fascism. Comparisons and Definitions'', Madison 1980, {{ISBN|0299080609}}, p. 143; in another of his works, Payne applies a more typical description of "societal corporatism", see his ''The Franco Regime'', Madison 1987, {{ISBN|0299110702}}, pp. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; [[organicism (political theory)|organicism]],&lt;ref&gt;González Cuevas  1997, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; reactionary [[authoritarism]],&lt;ref&gt;or simply “authoritarian”, Iker Cantabrana Morras, ''Lo viejo y lo nuevo: Díputación-FET de las JONS. La convulsa dinámica política de la "leal" Alava (Primera parte: 1936-1938)'', [in:] ''Sancho el Sabio'' 21 (2004), p. 170, also Agustín José Menéndez, ''Shifting legal dogma: From Republicanism to Fascist Ideology under the Early Franquismo'', [in:] ''Arena working papers'' 20 (2000), available [http://www.sv.uio.no/arena/english/research/publications/arena-publications/workingpapers/working-papers2002/wp02_20.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; proto-[[fascism]] (prefascism),&lt;ref&gt;many authors invoke Pradera against the fascist background, indicate similarities, and apply fascistoid qualifications, but stop just short of naming him fascist, see Enrique Moradiellos, ''Evangelios fascistas'', [in:] ''Revista de libros'' 12 (2014), p. 30, Olabarri Gortázar 1988, p. 323, Ernesto Mila, ''Renovación Española y Acción Española, la “derecha fascista española”'', [in:] ''Revista de Historia del Fascismo'', 2 (2011), María Cruz Mina Apat, ''Elecciones y partidos políticos en Navarra (1891-1923)'', [in:] J.

Fernandez Viguera, ''Ideologia de Raimundo Garcia ‘Garcilaso’ en torno al tema foral'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 47 (1986), pp. 511-531. Only in unrestrained cyberspace Pradera is plainly called fascist, compare [http://blognacional.blogspot.com/2007/06/felipe-gonzlez-falangista.html here]. There are also many scholars who highlight what they consider fundamental differences between Pradera and fascism, see Orella Martínez 2006, pp. 257-268, Fernando del Rey Reguillo, Manuel Álvarez Tardío, ''The Spanish Second Republic Revisited: From Democratic Hopes to the Civil War (1931-1936)'', Madrid 2012, {{ISBN|9781845194598}}, pp. 250-251, Carballo 2013, pp. 126-131, Martin Blinkhorn, ''Fascists &amp; Conservatives.

The author claims that de Mella broke with Pradera because of magmatic nature of his work, which contributed not to excellence, but to the intellectual decay of Carlism; similar opinion, though not expressed that boldly, is presented in Andres Martin 2000, pp. 253-257; the author a number of times points to "minimalist" Praderian strategy of seeking understanding with very broad Right-wing political spectrum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regionalist==
[[File:Jose Antonio Agirre Lekube speech in Basque Nationalism Meeting, 1933.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|Basque nationalism: Euzkadi]]
The regionalist question posed an indispensable component of Pradera's theory; it also kept coming back as a major thread of his political activities. Today among many Spanish citizens – especially the Basques&lt;ref&gt;none of the sources consulted clarifies what Pradera’s mothertongue was, though he is reported to have spoken Basque perfectly, Carballo 2013, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; – Pradera is principally recognized only for his stance on this very topic,&lt;ref&gt;compare Pradera’s entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; usually as a sworn enemy of [[National minority|national minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;compare Carballo 2013, pp. 142-146&lt;/ref&gt;

From the onset of his career Pradera declared himself a supporter of traditional regional [[fueros]],&lt;ref&gt;though he remained ambiguos as to their re-introduction; in 1916-1918 he declared that "la situación actual de España no es la oportuna para plantear el pleito de la reintegración foral”, quoted after Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe''&lt;/ref&gt; and identified himself as unswervingly regionalist.&lt;ref&gt;Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe''; "Regionalismo no es separatismo. [...]  El separatismo, o sea la independencia, no lo admitimos nosotros; al contrario, queremos la unidad de la Patria, respetando los derechos que corresponden a todas las provincias”, quoted after Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In his political vision the regions,&lt;ref&gt;according to Pradera municipios are naturally grouped in comarcas, not provincias; actually, he did not recognise official “provincias”, and when advocating  “provincial” rights he meant “regiones”, Carballo 2013, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; with their specific legal, economic and social establishments, were among key entities forming a nation, and his recommendations to Primo endorsed a strongly regionalist state. The fueros, however, did not provide  an autonomous legal framework,&lt;ref&gt;scholars differ on this point. Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 359-360, claims that unlike in case of Mella, for Pradera fueros did not provide a “sovereignty” framework; others claim that Pradera envisioned regions as self-established entities, united in federal or confederal Spain, see González Cuevas 1997, pp. 208-9, Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; but to the contrary, they were viewed as a pact between a region and the Spanish state.&lt;ref&gt;Iñaki Iriarte López, ''Euskaros, nacionalistas y navarristas. Ideologías del pacto y la agonía en Navarra'', [in:] ''Revista Internacional de los Estudios Vascos'' 44 (1999), p. 62. Other sources claim that Pradera, obsessed by Spanish unity, was not a fuerista at all, see Josep Miralles Climent, ''Aspectos de la cultura política del carlismo en el siglo XX'', [in:] ''Espacio, Tiempo y Forma'', 17 (2005), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, he consistently fought all designs perceived as fostering [[separatism]]&lt;ref&gt;Pradera assailed also cultural initiatives suspected of advancing disunion, like the 1920 unveiling of a monument to the 1522 defenders of Navarre against Castillans, dubbed “traidores, villanos y dignos del patíbulo”, quoted after Emilio Majuelo, ''La idea de historia en Arturo Campion'', Donostia 2011, {{ISBN|9788484192206}}. p. 116, details in Jesús Etayo Zalduendo, ''Navarra, una soberanía secuestrada: historia y periodismo (1923-1931)'', Tafalla 2004, {{ISBN|8481363596}}, 9788481363593, pp. 196-7, 407-409&lt;/ref&gt; and embracing [[autonomy]],&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; confronting [[Liga Foral Autonomista de Guipúzcoa|Liga Autonomista]],&lt;ref&gt;Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe''&lt;/ref&gt; lambasting [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] arguments on self-determination, fighting theories advanced by [[Sabino Arana]] and [[:es:Arturo Campión|Arturo Campión]],&lt;ref&gt;see Gambra 1973, p. 150-151, Orella Martínez 2000, pp. 53-69&lt;/ref&gt; thwarting autonomy projects of late Restauración,&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 153, Guinea Suárez 1953, Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe''&lt;/ref&gt; publicly admonishing Primo de Rivera for fostering separatism,&lt;ref&gt;dubbed “paladín del españolismo a secas” , Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe''&lt;/ref&gt; fighting [[:es:Estatuto Vasco-Navarro|Vasco-Navarrese autonomy drafts]] during the Republic&lt;ref&gt;In 1931-1933 Pradera and Juan Olazabal formed the nucleus of the Carlist opponents to the Basque autonomy, Iriarte López 1999, p. 63, González Calleja 2012, p. 72, Ferrer Muñoz 1988, pp. 130-1 (claiming that especially the Gestoras version was lambasted as “laico, antiforal and antieconomico”), Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''La Cuestión estatutaria en Navarra durante la Segunda República'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 52 (1991), p. 205, Santiago de Pablo, ''El carlismo guipuzcoano y el Estatuto Vasco'', [in:] ''Bilduma Rentería'' 2 (1988), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; - with particular hostility to incorporating Navarre into the autonomous project&lt;ref&gt;Pradera is sometimes considered one of the founding fathers of [[:es:Navarrismo|navarrismo]], see Juan María Sánchez-Prieto,  ''Garcia-Sanz, Iriarte, Mikelarena, Historia del navarrismo (1841-1936)'' [review], [in:] ''Revista Internacional de Estudios Vascos'' 48 (2003), p. 732; the author claims that Pradera is fundamental to change in Navarrese perception of their enemies: before it was the Spanish state, after it was the Basque nationalism; Roldán Jimeno Aranguren, ''Los derechos históricos en la renovación del régimen autonómico de Navarra (2004-2006)'', [in:] ''Revista interdisciplinar de estudios histórico-jurídicos'', 15 (2007/8), p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; - and voting against the [[:ca:Llei de Contractes de Conreu|Catalan Leases Act]] in Tribunal de Garantias.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 186; full pronouncement of the Tribunal in ''Memoria elevada al Gobierno de la Republica'', Madrid 1934, available [https://www.fiscal.es/fiscal/PA_WebApp_SGNTJ_NFIS/descarga/1-MEMORIA_1934.pdf?idFile=b3a5d0e4-b626-4362-9536-fc3923da2dd6 here], see also his own explanation as produced during a public meeting [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000527634&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mikel Mikel zaitu Euskalerria.JPG|thumbnail|200px|Traditionalism: Euskalerria]]
Pradera denied the Basques and the Catalans a separate political identity, be it historical&lt;ref&gt;e.g. when discussing political regime of Vasco-Navarrese region during the Reconquista, he pointed out that Navarre formed a militarised monarchy, Álava was almost republican, Gipuzkoa resembled constitutional monarchy and Biscay formed a señorío, see Carballo 2013, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; or contemporary, and was particularly infuriated by [[Racism|racist]] thread of the Basque national discourse.&lt;ref&gt;González Cuevas 1997, p. 208, Orella Martínez 2000, pp. 48-50&lt;/ref&gt; Recognising their separate ethnic status, he considered the minorities "pueblos",&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; forming part of the Spanish political nation.&lt;ref&gt;"irrevocable espańolidad de las Provincias Vascongadas", quoted after Carballo 2013, p. 143, also “Cataluńa no tiene derecho a ser Estado porque no era nación”, Carballo 2013, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; He remained restless denouncing what he considered invented nationalist myths&lt;ref&gt;the level of detail and complexity involved in this highly expert debate can be grasped by looking at Pradera’s discussion with Arturo Campión on dating convention of the papal documents  from 1512,  see Carballo 2013, p. 148;&lt;/ref&gt; and proving that the Basques had neither formed a unitarian cultural entity nor had ever possessed a common political self.&lt;ref&gt;Pradera’s lecture which made particular impact was ''Regionalismo y Nacionalismo'' address of 1917, re-emphasized and re-formatted as a scholarly discourse titled ''El mistero de los Fueros Vascos'' and delivered at Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislación; in ''Por Navarra, para España'' (1921) Pradera claimed that under the old regime Spain was in fact a confederation, Olabarri Gortazar 1991, p. 304, Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; As confronting Basque and Catalan political aspirations became a major thread of Pradera's activity, driven by concern for unity of Spain, he soon grew into the nationalist Basques' primary foe, accused of [[españolismo]], hyperpatriotism and [[jingoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Estornés Zubizarreta, ''Victor Pradera Larumbe'', Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner==
[[File:Elgetako gudariak.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Basque republican militia, [[Gipuzkoa]]]]
Pradera's contribution to [[Spanish coup of July 1936|anti-Republican coup]] consisted chiefly of conducting talks with the would-be Alfonsist allies in Navarre and in the Basque provinces, though exact scale of his engagement remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo G. Calleja, Julio Aróstegui Sánchez, ''La tradición recuperada; el Requeté carlista y la insurrección'', [in:] ''Historia contemporánea'', 11 (1994), p. 36; some claim Pradera did not participate actively and was merely informed on progress, Carballo 2013, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1936 he declined Franco's proposal to join him on Canary Islands;&lt;ref&gt;Pradera forged an amicable if not friendly personal relationship with Franco, allegedly considering him “the man of the future”, Guinea Suárez 1953; when leaving Madrid to assume his post in the [[Canary Islands]], Franco asked Pradera to join him, see Garcia Venero 1970, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; fully aware of the forthcoming coup and anxious not to be called a coward, he cancelled a formal visit to France, scheduled on July 13 as part of Tribunal de Garantias duties, and remained in San Sebastian.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 2013, pp. 103-4&lt;/ref&gt; He is quoted as declaring to Rodezno on July 16, 1936: "Thomas, let God help us. If we fail, we will have our throats cut".&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

During initial days of the insurgency Pradera remained in San Sebastián, where the coup indeed failed; he soon found himself cut off from the nationalist zone. Early August&lt;ref&gt;some sources claim it was on August 2, Pedro Barruso, ''Verano y la revolución. La Guerra Civil en Gipuzkoa'', [in:] ''gipuzkoa1936'' service, available [http://www.gipuzkoa1936.com/verano2-e.php here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was arrested by the Basque militia&lt;ref&gt;at the order of Telesforo Monzon, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 214, or [[Manuel Irujo]], Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; and detained in the [[Ondarreta (prison)|Ondarreta]] prison; his son Javier joined him soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of his last days differ. Most studies claim he was trialed by a makeshift Tribunal Popular and was sentenced to death;&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Barruso Barés, ''La represión en las zonas republicana y franquista del País Vasco durante la Guerra Civil'', [in:] ''Historia contemporánea'' 35 (2007), p. 656, Pedro Barruso Barés, ''Manuel de Irujo y la Guerra Civil en Guipúzcoa en el verano de 1936'', [in:] ''Vasconia: Cuadernos de historia - geografía'', 32 (2002), p. 71; no documentation of such a tribunal has ever been found, Pedro Barruso, ''Verano y la revolución. La Guerra Civil en Gipuzkoa''&lt;/ref&gt; other works suggest that as the city was already [[Campaign of Gipuzkoa|under the nationalist siege]], the Republican militia units stormed the prison fearing the detainees might be soon set free.&lt;ref&gt;Guinea Suárez 1953&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, within a group of other prisoners, Pradera was driven to the nearby [[Polloe cemetery (Donostia)|Polloe cemetery]] and executed,&lt;ref&gt;according to some sources, in the highly Christian spirit Pradera forgave his killers before death, Carballo 2013, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; his son meeting the same fate shortly afterwards. In 1949 Franco posthumously conferred upon Pradera the title of [[:es:Condado de Pradera|conde de Prader]]a, which is functional until today.&lt;ref&gt;''Boletin Oficial del Estado'' 18.07.49, available [http://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE/1949/199/A03196-03196.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;
