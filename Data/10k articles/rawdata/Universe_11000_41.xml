The '''1865 Viroqua tornado''' moved through western Wisconsin on Thursday, June 29, 1865. With at least 22 fatalities, it was one of the first deadly [[tornado]]es recorded in [[Wisconsin]] after it became a state 17&amp;nbsp;years prior.

== Synopsis ==
Approaching [[Viroqua, Wisconsin]], the funnel was accompanied by a "branch whirl holding on like a parasite."  Multiple vortex "branches" and "eddies" were observed as the tornado passed through the town.  "Death rode upon that sulphury siroc" as "the angry elements at the beck of an invisible power lay waste the fairest portion of the village."  Ten people were killed on one street.  A death toll of 17 is usually given for this tornado, but according to the History of Vernon County at least 13&amp;nbsp;people were killed in Viroqua and as many as 12 others may have died later from injuries.  The tornado moved at an estimated 60&amp;nbsp;mph as it approached a schoolhouse 2&amp;nbsp;miles east of [[Viroqua]] containing a teacher and 24 students.  The building was lifted into the air "and dashed to ground", killing the teacher and eight students.  Foot-square timbers were carried "long distances; tree tops were filled with feather beds, chairs, and clothing.  All kinds of livestock were either dead or writhing on the points of broken branches; 20-ton rocks were rolled, lifted, and broken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Boyne  | first = Jeff  | title = Vernon County (WI) Tornadoes  | work = Tornadoes in northeast Iowa, southeast Minnesota, and southwest and central Wisconsin   | publisher = NWS - [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]]  | date = January 22, 2006  | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/arx/tornado/vernon.php  | accessdate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/arx/jun281865|title=Tornadoes of June 28, 1865|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|last=Service|website=www.weather.gov|accessdate = 2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1637">[[Image:6N14P vacuum tube.JPG|thumb|right|150px|6N14P vacuum tube, USSR (Reflektor) 1965]]The '''6N14P''' (Russian: '''6Н14П''') is a miniature [[Russia]]n-made medium gain dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]], intended for service as a low-[[noise]] [[cascode]] [[amplifier]] at [[High frequency|HF]] through [[VHF]] frequencies.  It is a direct equivalent of '''ECC84''' and '''6CW7''' vacuum tubes.

== Basic data ==

Uf = 6.3V, If = 350 mA uM = 25 Ia = 10.5 mA S = 6.8 mA/V Pa = 1.5 W

== History of Use ==

In the [[Soviet Union]] '''6N14P''' found application in special equipment and to a lesser extent in more-expensive [[FM broadcasting|FM]] receivers and [[television]] sets in the 1960s.  However, in the majority of medium and low-grade Soviet-produced FM radios a more general purpose [[6N3P]] (2C51) vacuum tube was utilized, as the lower frequency [[OIRT]] [[FM broadcast band|FM band]] used in the USSR (65.8 to 74 MHz) allowed for less stringent [[noise figure]] requirements towards the receiver design and its components than the higher frequency Western FM broadcast band (87.5-108 MHz) used in most of the rest of the world.

Currently, like many other vacuum tubes, '''6N14P''' has found some use with [[DIY]] audio enthusiasts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8910">{{short description|Mathematical framework}}
'''Aitchison geometry''' is a framework focused on the analysis of data in which each data point is a tuple of nonnegative numbers whose sum is&amp;nbsp;1. These numbers may be proportions, percentages, probabilities, or concentrations.  These tuples are referred to as compositions.  At the heart of the framework is the characterization of the Aitchison simplex, where each element of the space is a [[Compositional_data|composition]].  

Linear operations can be defined on compositions, known as ''perturbation'' and ''powering operations''.  These operations are linear in the Aitchison simplex and can be transformed into traditional addition and multiplication operations in Euclidean space through the use of log-ratio transformations.  Inner products can be defined in the Aitchison simplex, giving rise to the distance metrics such as the Aitchison distance.  It can also be shown that the Aitchison simplex forms a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pawlowsky-Glahn|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Aitchison simplex is formally defined for D species as follows
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}^D=\left\{\mathbf{x}=[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_D]\in\mathbb{R}^D \,\left|\, x_i&gt;0,i=1,2,\dots,D; \sum_{i=1}^D x_i=\lambda \right. \right\} \ &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be any positive real-valued constant.  

[[File:Aitchison-simplex.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the Aitchison simplex.  Here, there are 3 parts, &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2,  x_3&lt;/math&gt; represent values of different proportions.  A, B, C, D and E are 5 different compositions within the simplex.  A, B and C are all equivalent and D and E are equivalent.]]

There are three core axioms that the Aitchison simplex, namely

* Scale invariance : Whether data is represented as proportions, percentages or probabilities, in the context of the Aitchison simplex all of these measurements are equivalent since they only differ by a constant scaling factor. 
* Permutation invariance: The ordering of how the proportions or were measured or counted doesn't matter.  This is analogous to how [[Combination|combinations]] are invariant to the order of selection.
* Subcompositional coherence : Observations on shared species should be consistent. For example, supposed that there are 2 biologists that visited the exact same rainforest to count insects.  One biologist observed 3 species of spiders and 10 species of ants whereas the other biologist only observed 2 species of spiders and 7 species of ants.  If these biologists observed the same 2 spider species and the same 7 species of ants, their conclusions about those species should be the same.  For instance, they should notice that the ratio of those two spider species are consistent between their observations.  While the universal formal definition is still not clearly established, this concept can be formalized to distance metrics as follows

:: &lt;math&gt; d(x_k, y_k) \leq d(x, y) \qquad
\forall x, y \in S^D, \; x_k, y_k \in S^k, \; S^k \subset S^D
&lt;/math&gt;

== Vector space structure ==

=== Properties ===

The Aitchison simplex has the following operators defined using the [[Compositional_data|closure]] operation as follows

; Perturbation

:: &lt;math&gt; x \oplus y = \left[\frac{x_1 y_1}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i y_i},\frac{x_2 y_2}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i y_i}, \dots,\frac{x_D y_D}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i y_i}\right] = C[x_1 y_1, \ldots, x_D y_D]  \qquad \forall x, y \in S^D
&lt;/math&gt;

; Powering

:: &lt;math&gt; \alpha \odot x = \left[\frac{x_1^\alpha}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i^\alpha},\frac{x_2^\alpha}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i^\alpha}, \ldots,\frac{x_D^\alpha}{\sum_{i=1}^D x_i^\alpha} \right] = C[x_1 y_1, \ldots, x_D y_D]  \qquad \forall x \in S^D, \quad \alpha \in \mathbb{R}
&lt;/math&gt;

; Inner product

:: &lt;math&gt; \langle x, y \rangle = \frac{1}{2D} 
\sum\limits_{i=1}^D 
\sum\limits_{j=1}^D
\log \frac{x_i}{x_j} 
\log \frac{y_i}{y_j} 
\qquad \forall x, y \in S^D&lt;/math&gt;

Under these these operations alone, it is sufficient to show that the Aitchison simplex forms a Euclidean vector space.

=== Orthonormal bases ===
Since the Aitchison simplex forms a finite Hilbert space, it is possible to construct orthonormal bases in the simplex. Every composition can be decomposed as follows

:: &lt;math&gt; x = \bigoplus_{i=1}^D x_i \odot e_i &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;e_1, \ldots, e_{D-1} &lt;/math&gt; forms an orthonormal basis in the simplex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Egozcue|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linear transformations ===
There are 3 well-characterized [[isomorphism]]s that transform from the Aitchison simplex to real space.  All of these transforms satisfy linearity and as given below

==== Additive logratio transform ====
The additive log ratio (alr) transform is an where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{alr}: S^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{D-1} &lt;/math&gt;.  This is given by

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{alr}(x) = \left[ \log \frac{x_1}{x_D} \cdots \log \frac{x_{D-1}}{x_D} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

The choice of denominator component is arbituary, and could be any specified component.
This transform is commonly used in chemistry with measurements such as pH.  In addition, this is the transform most commonly used for [[Multinomial logistic regression]].  The alr transform is not an isometry, meaning that distances on transformed values will not be equivalent to distances on the original compositions in the simplex.

==== Center logratio transform ====
The center log ratio (clr) tranform is both an isomorphism and an isometry where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{clr}: S^D \rightarrow \mathbb{U}, \quad \mathbb{U} \subset \mathbb{R}^D &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{clr}(x) = \left[ \log \frac{x_1}{g(x)} \cdots \log \frac{x_{D-1}}{g(x)} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of this function is also known as the [[Softmax function]] commonly used in neural networks.

==== Isometric logratio transform ====
The isometric log ratio (ilr) tranform is both an isomorphism and an isometry where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ilr}: S^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{D-1} &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ilr}(x) = \big[ \langle x, e_1 \rangle, \ldots, \langle x, e_{D-1} \rangle\big]
&lt;/math&gt;

There are multiple ways to construct orthonormal bases, including using the [[Gram–Schmidt_process | Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization]] or [[Singular-value decomposition]] of clr transformed data.  
Another alternative is to construct log contrasts from a bifurcating tree.  If are given a bifurcating tree, we can construct a basis from the internal nodes in the tree.

[[File:Orthogonal-tree-basis.jpg|thumb|A representation of a tree in terms of its orthogonal components. l represents an internal node, an element of the orthonormal basis. This is a precursor to using the tree as a scaffold for the ilr transform]]

Each vector in the basis would be determined as follows

:: &lt;math&gt; e_l = C[\exp( \,\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_k, \underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_r,\underbrace{b,\ldots,b}_s,\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_t \, )]
&lt;/math&gt;

The elements within each vector are given as follows

:: &lt;math&gt; a = \frac{\sqrt{s}}{\sqrt{r(r+s)}} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{-\sqrt{r}}{\sqrt{s(r+s)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k, r, s, t&lt;/math&gt; are the respective number of tips in the corresponding subtrees shown in the figure.  It can be shown that the resulting basis is orthonormal&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Egozcue|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the basis &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is built, the ilr transform can be calculated as follows

:: &lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{ilr}(x) = \operatorname{clr}(x) \Psi^T
&lt;/math&gt;

where each element in the ilr transformed data is of the following form

:: &lt;math&gt; b_i = \sqrt{\frac{rs}{r+s}} \log \frac{g(x_R)}{g(x_S)}  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_S&lt;/math&gt; are the set of values corresponding to the tips in the subtrees &lt;math&gt; R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10858">'''BatteryMAX''' is an idle detection system used for computer power management under operating system control developed at [[Digital Research, Inc.]]'s European Development Centre (EDC) in Hungerford,&amp;nbsp;UK. It was created to address the new genre of portable personal computers ([[laptop]]s) which ran from battery power. As such, it was also an integral part of Novell's [[PalmDOS 1.0]] operating system tailored for early [[palmtop]]s in 1992.

== Description ==
Power saving in laptop computers traditionally relied on hardware inactivity timers to determine whether a computer was idle. It would typically take several minutes before the computer could identify idle behavior and switch to a lower power consumption state. By monitoring software applications from within the [[operating system]], BatteryMAX is able to reduce the time taken to detect idle behavior from minutes to microseconds. Moreover, it can switch power states around 18 times a second between a user's keystrokes. The technique was named ''Dynamic Idle Detection'' and includes [[HLT (x86 instruction)|halting]], or stopping the [[CPU]] for periods of just a few microseconds until a hardware event occurs to restart it.

[[DR DOS 5.0]] was the first [[Personal Computer]] [[operating system]] to incorporate an Idle Detection System for power management. It was invented by British engineers Roger Gross and John Constant in August 1989.&lt;ref name="Glass_1991_DRDOS"/&gt; A US patent describing the idle detection system was filed on 9 March 1990 and granted on 11 October 1994.&lt;ref name="Patent_5355501"/&gt;

Despite taking an early lead and having the protection of a patent, BatteryMAX did not enjoy significant commercial success having been sidelined after the disarray that followed the integration of Digital Research into [[Novell, Inc.]] in 1991. It was not until 1992, some three years after the invention, that software power management under operating system control became ubiquitous following the launch of [[Advanced Power Management]] (APM) by [[Microsoft]] and [[Intel]].

== Functional overview ==
BatteryMAX uses the technique of Dynamic Idle Detection to provide power savings by detecting what the application is doing (whether it is idle), and switching power states (entering low power mode) therefore extending the battery life of the product.

BatteryMAX employs a layered model of detection software encapsulated into an [[DOS]] character device driver called &lt;tt&gt;$IDLE$&lt;/tt&gt; that contains all the [[hardware-dependent code]] to support Dynamic Idle Detection. It can either be linked into the DR-DOS operating system [[DOS BIOS|BIOS]] or loaded dynamically using the [[CONFIG.SYS]] [[DEVICE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|DEVICE]] directive, overloading the built-in default driver. All versions of DR-DOS since version 5.0 have contained Dynamic Idle Detection support inside the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]. When the operating system believes an application is idle, it calls the &lt;tt&gt;$IDLE$&lt;/tt&gt; BIOS/driver layer, which executes custom code written by the computer manufacturer or third parties to verify the request and switch power states. Using the device driver concept, BatteryMAX can be integrated with hardware-related power management facilities, which might be provided by the underlying hardware, including interfacing with [[Advanced Power Management|APM]] or [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] [[system BIOS]]es.

Power states are computer dependent and will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Power savings can be made in a number of ways including slowing/stopping the processor clock speed or shutting off power to complete sub-systems.

Before switching power states, the &lt;tt&gt;$IDLE$&lt;/tt&gt; driver uses any available hardware assistance to detect if the application has been accessing other components in the system. For example, the application may be polling a serial port, or updating a graphics screen. If this is the case, the device driver determines that the application is not in fact idle and overrides the kernel's call to switch power states by passing information back up the layers and allowing application execution to resume.

== Detecting when an application is idle ==
An application is idle if it is waiting for some external event to occur, for example for a keystroke or a mouse movement, or for a fixed amount of time to pass. The DR-DOS kernel monitors all DOS [[Application program interface|API]] calls building up a profile of the applications behavior. Certain combinations of API calls suggest that the application is idle.

The &lt;tt&gt;$IDLE$&lt;/tt&gt; driver is able to make the subtle distinction between a program that is genuinely idle, for instance one that is polling the keyboard in a tight loop, and one that is active but also polling the keyboard, to test for an abort key to be pressed. The driver makes this distinction by monitoring the time taken to go idle. If the time is within a specified period, the driver assumes that the program is idle, e.g. polling in a tight loop for a key to be pressed. If the time is outside the specified limit, the driver assumes that some processing has occurred in between polling the keyboard, and allows application execution to resume without switching power states. A local variable, IDLE_CNTDN, specifies the time against which the actual time taken to go idle is compared. The value for this variable is dynamically calculated at initialization and recalculated periodically.

== Origins of BatteryMAX ==
The Idle Detection technique was first used to improve [[multi-tasking]] of single-tasking DOS applications in Digital Research's multi-tasking/multi-user [[Concurrent DOS 386|Concurrent DOS/386]] (CDOS386) operating system.

Programs written for single-tasking operating systems such as MS-DOS/PC DOS can go into endless loops until interrupted; for example when waiting for a user to press a key. Whilst this is not a problem where there is no other process waiting to run, it wastes valuable processor time that could be used by other programs in a multi-tasking/multi-user environment like CDOS386. Applications designed for a multi-tasking environment use API calls to "sleep" when they are idle for a period of time but normal DOS applications do not do this so Idle Detection must be used.

The Concurrent DOS/386 release included an Idle Detection function in the operating system kernel which monitored [[DOS API]] calls to determine whether the application was doing useful work or in fact idle. If it was idle, the process was suspended allowing the dispatcher to schedule another process for execution.

== Patent litigation ==
{{Primary sources|section|date=February 2018}}
BatteryMAX and the "idle detection" patent played an important role in an alleged [[patent infringement]] relating to software power management under operating system control.
 
On May 15, 2009, St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants, Inc. filed [[Lawsuit|civil action]] No. 09-354 in the United States District Court D. Delaware, against defendants [[Acer, Inc.]], [[Dell Inc.]], [[Gateway, Inc.]] and [[Lenovo Group, Inc.]] and on September 18, 2009 filed civil action No. 09-704 against [[Apple Inc.]], and [[Toshiba Corporation, Inc.]] The actions alleged infringement of several U.S. patents that they owned relating to software power management under operating system control. 

St. Clair asserted that Henry Fung had invented software power management under operating system control and alleged that these companies had infringed St. Clair's patents and therefore owed St. Clair [[royalty payments]]. Microsoft intervened on behalf of the defendants and filed a [[declaratory judgment]] against St. Clair on April 7, 2010, seeking judgments of non-infringement and invalidity of the Fung patents. (D.I. 1, C.A. No. 10-282). Intel Corporation filed an intervention on behalf of the defendants and this was granted on June 4, 2010 (D.I. 178, C.A. No. 09-354).

Seattle law firm Perkins Coie, LLP acting for the defendants discovered BatteryMax and Gross’s Idle Detection Patent during a [[prior art]] search. Gross’s patent had an earlier [[priority date]] than Fung’s patents which if proven would undermine St. Clair's case. On February 28, 2011, Gross was hired by Intel as a Subject Matter Expert to provide [[Expert_witness|expert witness testimony]] for the defendants in the case. Gross provided evidence in his [[expert report]] that he, not Fung, had invented software power management under operating system control and sited the Idle Detection patent and the existence of BatteryMax as proof of this.

St Clair filed a Motion to Exclude Opinions Concerning BatteryMax, in an attempt to have Gross’s expert report dismissed but on March 29, 2013 the district court denied St. Clair’s motion declaring Gross’s testimony for the defendants as admissible,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/lps/2013/march/09-354_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=February 2018}} stating that "The Court agrees with Defendants that there is sufficient corroborating evidence that BatteryMax was available to the public prior to the Fung patents' priority date. Further, the Court concludes that even if BatteryMax did not predate the Fung patents, Mr. Gross's testimony … would be relevant and helpful to the fact finder in an [[Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness|obviousness inquiry]]”.

{{Mechanical failure modes}}
In science, '''buckling''' is a mathematical instability that leads to a [[structural failure|failure mode]].

When a structure is subjected to [[Compression (physics)|compressive]] [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], buckling may occur. Buckling is characterized by a sudden sideways deflection of a structural member. This may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed. As an applied load is increased on a member, such as a column, it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have buckled. Further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member's load-carrying capacity. If the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle. If the buckled member is part of a larger assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the structure.

In a mathematical sense, buckling is a [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] in the solution to the equations of [[Mechanical equilibrium|static equilibrium]]. At a certain point, under an increasing load, any further load is able to be sustained in one of two states of equilibrium: a purely compressed state (with no lateral deviation) or a laterally-deformed state.

==Columns==
[[File:Buckled column.svg|thumb|right|A column under a concentric axial load exhibiting the characteristic deformation of buckling]] [[File:Buckling beam element.svg|thumb|right|The eccentricity of the axial force results in a bending moment acting on the beam element.]] The ratio of the effective length of a [[column]] to the least [[radius of gyration]] of its cross section is called the [[slenderness ratio]] (sometimes expressed with the Greek letter lambda, λ). This ratio affords a means of classifying columns and their failure mode. The slenderness ratio is important for design considerations. All the following are approximate values used for convenience.

If the load on a column is applied through the [[center of gravity]] (centroid) of its cross section, it is called an [[axis of rotation|axial]] [[Structural load|load]]. A load at any other point in the cross section is known as an [[eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] load. A short column under the action of an axial load will fail  by direct compression before it buckles, but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by springing suddenly outward laterally (buckling) in a bending mode. The buckling mode of deflection is considered a failure mode, and it generally occurs before the axial compression stresses (direct compression) can cause failure of the material by yielding or fracture of that compression member. However, intermediate-length columns will fail by a combination of direct compressive stress and bending.

In particular:
* A short [[steel]] column is one whose slenderness ratio does not exceed 50; an intermediate length steel column has a slenderness ratio ranging from about 50 to 200, and its behavior is dominated by the strength limit of the material, while a long steel column may be assumed to have a slenderness ratio greater than 200 and its behavior is dominated by the modulus of elasticity of the material.
* A short [[concrete]] column is one having a ratio of unsupported length to least dimension of the cross section equal to or less than 10. If the ratio is greater than 10, it is considered a long column (sometimes referred to as a slender column).
* [[Wood|Timber]] columns may be classified as short columns if the ratio of the length to least dimension of the cross section is equal to or less than 10. The dividing line between intermediate and long timber columns cannot be readily evaluated. One way of defining the lower limit of long timber columns would be to set it as the smallest value of the ratio of length to least cross sectional area that would just exceed a certain constant K of the material. Since K depends on the [[modulus of elasticity]] and the allowable compressive [[stress (physics)|stress]] parallel to the grain, it can be seen that this arbitrary limit would vary with the [[species]] of the timber. The value of K is given in most structural handbooks.

The theory of the behavior of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]]. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly "jumping" to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

To get the mathematical demonstration read: [[Euler's critical load]]

where
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = maximum or critical [[force]] (vertical load on column),
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = [[modulus of elasticity]],
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; =  smallest [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross section of the column,
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = unsupported length of column,
:&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = [[:File:ColumnEffectiveLength.png|column effective length factor]], whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows.
::For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 1.0.
::For both ends fixed, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 0.50.
::For one end fixed and the other end pinned, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = {{radic|2}}/2 ≈ 0.7071.
::For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 2.0.
:&lt;math&gt;K L&lt;/math&gt; is the effective length of the column.

Examination of this formula reveals the following facts with regard to the load-bearing ability of slender columns.
*The [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the material of the column and not the compressive [[strength of materials|strength of the material]] of the column determines the column's buckling load.
* The buckling load is directly [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[second moment of area]] of the cross section.
* The boundary conditions have a considerable effect on the critical load of slender columns. The boundary conditions determine the mode of bending of the column and the distance between inflection points on the displacement curve of the deflected column. The inflection points in the deflection shape of the column are the points at which the curvature of the column changes sign and are also the points at which the column's internal bending moments of the column are zero. The closer the inflection points are, the greater the resulting axial load capacity (bucking load) of the column.

[[Image:Buckledmodel.JPG|thumb|right|A demonstration model illustrating the different "Euler" buckling modes. The model shows how the boundary conditions affect the critical load of a slender column. Notice that the columns are identical, apart from the boundary conditions.]]

A conclusion from the above is that the buckling load of a column may be increased by changing its material to one with a higher modulus of elasticity (E), or changing the design of the column's cross section so as to increase its moment of inertia. The latter can be done without increasing the weight of the column by distributing the material as far from the principal axis of the column's cross section as possible. For most purposes, the most effective use of the material of a column is that of a tubular section.

Another insight that may be gleaned from this equation is the effect of length on critical load. Doubling the unsupported length of the column quarters the allowable load. The restraint offered by the end connections of a column also affects its critical load. If the connections are perfectly rigid (does not allowing rotation of its ends), the critical load will be four times that for a similar column where the ends are pinned (allowing rotation of its ends).

Since the radius of gyration is defined as the square root of the ratio of the column's moment of inertia about an axis to its cross sectional area, the above Euler formula may be reformatted by substituting the radius of gyration A·r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for I:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{\pi^2 E}{\left(\frac{\ell}{r}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F/A= \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the stress that causes buckling the column, and &lt;math&gt;l/r&lt;/math&gt; is the slenderness ratio.

Since structural columns are commonly of intermediate length, the Euler formula has little practical application for ordinary design. Issues that cause deviation from the pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear stress strain behaviour of the column's material. Consequently, a number of empirical column formulae have been developed that agree with test data, all of which embody the slenderness ratio. Due to the uncertainty in the behavior of columns, for design, appropriate [[factor of safety|safety factors]] are introduced into these formulae. One such formula is the [[Perry Robertson formula]] which estimates the critical buckling load based on an assumed small initial curvature, hence an eccentricity of the axial load. The Rankine Gordon formula (Named for [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and Perry Hugesworth Gordon (1899 &amp;ndash; 1966)) is also based on experimental results and suggests that a column will buckle at a load F&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; given by:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{F_\text{max}} = \frac{1}{F_e} + \frac{1}{F_c}&lt;/math&gt;
where F&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the Euler maximum load and F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum compressive load. This formula typically produces a conservative estimate of F&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Self-buckling===

==Buckling under tensile dead loading==

[[File:Continuous model tensile buckling.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 2: Elastic beam system showing buckling under tensile dead loading.]]
Usually buckling and instability are associated with compression, but buckling and instability can also occur in elastic structures subject to dead [[tensile load]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/paper/zaccaria_bigoni_buckling_tension.pdf |first1=D. |last1=Zaccaria |first2=D. |last2=Bigoni |first3=G. |last3=Noselli |first4=D. |last4=Misseroni |title=Structures buckling under tensile dead load |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |date=21 April 2011 |volume=467 |number=2130 |pages=1686–1700 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0505|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1686Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a single-degree-of-freedom structure is shown in Fig. 2, where the critical load is also indicated.
Another example involving flexure of a structure made up of beam elements governed by the equation of the Euler's elastica is shown in Fig.3.
In both cases, there are no elements subject to compression. The instability and buckling in tension are related to the presence of the slider, the junction between the two rods, allowing only relative sliding between the connected pieces. Watch a [http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/tensile_buckling.html movie] for more details.

==Constraints, curvature and multiple buckling==
[[Image:Sketch curvature 1.jpg|thumb|Fig. 3: A one-degree-of-freedom structure exhibiting a tensile (compressive) buckling load as related to the fact that the right end has to move along the circular profile labeled 'Ct' (labelled 'Cc').]]
Buckling of an elastic structure strongly depends on the curvature of the constraints against which the ends of the structure are prescribed to move (see Bigoni, Misseroni, Noselli and Zaccaria, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/multiple_bifurcations.html |first1=D. |last1=Bigoni |first2=D. |last2=Misseroni |first3=G. |last3=Noselli |first4=D. |last4=Zaccaria |title=Effects of the constraint's curvature on structural instability: tensile buckling and multiple bifurcations |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |date=2012 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2011.0732|arxiv = 1201.4701 |bibcode = 2012RSPSA.468.2191B |volume=468 |pages=2191–2209}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In fact, even a single-degree-of-freedom system (see Fig.3) may exhibit a tensile (or a compressive) buckling load as related to the fact that one end has to move along the circular profile labeled 'Ct' (labelled 'Cc').

[[Image:buckling curvature 2.gif|thumb|Fig. 4: A one-degree-of-freedom structure with a 'S'-shaped bicircular profile exhibiting multiple bifurcations (both tensile and compressive).]]
The two circular profiles can be arranged in a 'S'-shaped profile, as shown in Fig.4; in that case a discontinuity of the constraint's curvature is introduced, leading to multiple bifurcations. Note that the single-degree-of-freedom structure shown in Fig.4 has two buckling loads (one tensile and one compressive). Watch a [http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/multiple_bifurcations.html movie] for more details.

==Flutter instability==
Structures subject to a follower (nonconservative) load{{clarify|date=February 2015}} may suffer instabilities which are not of the buckling type and therefore are not detectable with a static approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bigoni |first1=D. |title=Nonlinear Solid Mechanics: Bifurcation Theory and Material Instability |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2012 |isbn=9781107025417}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the so-called 'Ziegler column' is shown in Fig.5.
[[Image:Ziegler column.jpg|thumb|Fig. 5: A sketch of the 'Ziegler column', a two-degree-of-freedom system subject to a follower load (the force P remains always parallel to the rod BC), exhibiting flutter and divergence instability. The two rods, of linear mass density ρ, are rigid and connected through two rotational springs of stiffness k1 and k2.]]
This two-degree-of-freedom system does not display a quasi-static buckling, but becomes dynamically unstable.
To see this, we note that the equations of motion are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{3} \rho l_1^{2} \left(l_1 + 3 l_2\right)\ddot{\alpha}_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho l_1 l_2^2 \cos(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2)\ddot{\alpha}_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho l_1 l_2^2 \sin(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2)\dot{\alpha}_2^2 +{} &amp;\\
  (k_1 + k_2)\alpha_1 - k_2\alpha_2 + (\beta_1 + \beta_2)\dot{\alpha}_1 - \beta_2 \dot{\alpha}_2 - l_1 P \sin(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2) &amp;= 0, \\[6pt]
  \frac{1}{2} \rho l_1 l_2^{2} \cos(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2)\ddot{\alpha}_1 + \frac{1}{3} \rho l_2^{3}\ddot{\alpha}_2 - \frac{1}{2} \rho l_1 l_2^{2} \sin(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2)\dot{\alpha}_1^{2} -{} &amp;\\
  k_2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2) - \beta_2(\dot{\alpha}_1 - \dot{\alpha}_2) &amp;= 0 ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and their linearized version is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{3} \rho l_1^{2} \left(l_1 + 3 l_2\right)\ddot{\alpha}_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho l_1 l_2^{2} \ddot{\alpha}_2 + (k_1 + k_2)\alpha_1 - k_2\alpha_2 - l_1 P (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2) &amp;= 0, \\
    \frac{1}{2} \rho l_1 l_2^{2} \ddot{\alpha}_1 + \frac{1}{3} \rho l_2^{3}\ddot{\alpha}_2 - k_2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2) &amp;= 0 .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a time-harmonic solution in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_j = A_j \, e^{-i \Omega \,t},  ~~~j = 1,2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

we find the critical loads for flutter (&lt;math&gt;\ P_f &lt;/math&gt;) and divergence (&lt;math&gt;\ P_d &lt;/math&gt;),

:&lt;math&gt;P_{f,d} = \frac{k_2}{l_1} \cdot \frac{k + (1 + \lambda)^3 \mp \lambda\,\sqrt{k (3 + 4\lambda)}}{1 + \frac{3}{2}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda = l_1/l_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k = k_1/k_2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:deformed shapes.jpg|thumb|Fig. 6: A sequence of deformed shapes at consecutive times intervals of the structure sketched in Fig.5 and exhibiting flutter (upper part) and divergence (lower part) instability.]]
Flutter instability corresponds to a vibrational motion of increasing amplitude and is shown in Fig.6 (upper part) together with the divergence instability (lower part) consisting in an exponential growth.

Recently, Bigoni and Noselli (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni |first1=D. |last1=Bigoni |first2=G. |last2=Noselli |title=Experimental evidence of flutter and divergence instabilities induced by dry friction |journal=Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids |date=2011 |volume=59 |pages=2208–2226|bibcode = 2011JMPSo..59.2208B |doi = 10.1016/j.jmps.2011.05.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have experimentally shown that flutter and divergence instabilities can be directly related to dry friction, watch the [http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/flutter.html movie] for more details.

== Various forms of buckling ==
Buckling is a state which defines a point where an equilibrium configuration becomes unstable under a parametric change of load and can manifest itself in several different phenomena.  All can be classified as forms of [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation]].

There are four basic forms of bifurcation associated with loss of structural stability or buckling in the case of structures with a single degree of freedom.  These comprise two types of [[pitchfork bifurcation]], one [[saddle-node bifurcation]] (often referred to as a [[limit point]]) and one [[transcritical bifurcation]]. The pitchfork bifurcations are the most commonly studied forms and include the buckling of columns, sometimes known as Euler buckling; the buckling of plates, sometimes known as local buckling, which is well known to be relatively safe (both are supercritical phenomena) and the buckling of shells, which is well-known to be a highly dangerous (subcritical phenomenon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A general theory of elastic stability |first1=J. M. T. |last1=Thompson |first2=G. W. |last2=Hunt |publisher=Wiley |date=1973 |isbn=978-0471859918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the concept of potential energy, equilibrium is defined as a stationary point with respect to the degree(s) of freedom of the structure. We can then determine whether the equilibrium is stable, as in the case where the stationary point is a local minimum; or unstable, as in the case where the stationary point is a maximum point of inflection or saddle point (for multiple-degree-of-freedom structures only) – see animations below.

In Euler buckling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buckling of Bars, Plates, and Shells |first=Robert M. |last=Jones |date=1 December 2007 |publisher=CRC |isbn=978-1560328278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Observations on eigenvalue buckling analysis within a finite element context |first=Christopher J. |last=Earls |date=2007 |journal=Proceedings of the Structural Stability Research Council, Annual Stability Conference |location=New Orleans, LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the applied load is increased by a small amount beyond the critical load, the structure deforms into a buckled configuration which is adjacent to the original configuration. For example, the Euler column pictured will start to bow when loaded slightly above its critical load, but will not suddenly collapse.

[[File:bifurcation buckling.png]]

In structures experiencing limit point instability, if the load is increased infinitesimally beyond the critical load, the structure undergoes a large deformation into a different stable configuration which is not adjacent to the original configuration. An example of this type of buckling is a toggle frame (pictured) which 'snaps' into its buckled configuration.

==Plate Buckling==
A [[plate (metal)|plate]] is a 3-dimensional structure defined as having a width of comparable size to its length, with a thickness is very small in comparison to its other two dimensions. Similar to columns, thin plates experience out-of-plane buckling deformations when subjected to critical loads; however, contrasted to column buckling, plates under buckling loads can continue to carry loads, called local buckling. This phenomenon is incredibly useful in numerous systems, as it allows systems to be engineered to provide greater loading capacities.

For a rectangular plate, supported along every edge, loaded with a uniform compressive force per unit length, the derived governing equation can be stated by:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bulson |first=P. S. |title=Theory of Flat Plates |publisher=Chatto and Windus, London |date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta^{4}w}{\delta x^{4}}+\frac{\delta^{4}w}{\delta x^{2} \delta y^{2}}+\frac{\delta^{4}w}{\delta y^{4}}=\frac{12(1-\nu^{2})}{E t^{3}}(-N_{x}\frac{\delta^{2}w}{\delta x^{2}})&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; = out-of-plane deflection
:&lt;math&gt;N_{x}&lt;/math&gt; = uniformly distributed compressive load
:&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = [[Poisson's Ratio]]
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = [[modulus of elasticity]]
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = thickness

The solution to the deflection can be expanded into two harmonic functions shown:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w=\sum_{m=1, 2, 3,...} \sum_{n=1, 2, 3,...}w_{mn}\sin(\frac{m\pi x}{a})\sin(\frac{n\pi y}{b})&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = number of half sine curvatures that occur lengthwise
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = number of half sine curvatures that occur widthwise
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; = length of specimen
:&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; = width of specimen

The previous equation can be substituted into the earlier differential equation where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equals 1. &lt;math&gt;N_{x}&lt;/math&gt; can be separated providing the equation for the critical compressive loading of a plate:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N_{x, cr}=k_{cr} \frac{\pi^{2}E t^{3}}{12(1-\nu^{2})b}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;k_{cr}&lt;/math&gt; = buckling coefficient, given by:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{cr}=(\frac{mb}{a}+\frac{a}{mb})^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The buckling coefficient is influenced by the aspect of the specimen, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; / &lt;math&gt;{b}&lt;/math&gt;, and the number of lengthwise curvatures. For an increasing number of such curvatures, the aspect ratio produces a varying buckling coefficient; but each relation provides a minimum value for each &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. This minimum value can then be used as a constant, independent from both the aspect ratio and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Given stress is found by the load per unit area, the following expression is found for the critical stress:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{cr}=k_{cr}\frac{\pi^{2}E}{12(1-\nu^{2})(\frac{b}{t})^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

From the derived equations, it can be seen the close similarities between the critical stress for a column and for a plate. As the width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; shrinks, the plate acts more like a column as it increases the resistance to buckling along the plate’s width. The increase of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; allows for an increase of the number of sine waves produced by buckling along the length, but also increases the resistance from the buckling along the width.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This creates the preference of the plate to buckle in such a way to equal the number of curvatures both along the width and length. Due to boundary conditions, when a plate is loaded with a critical stress and buckles, the edges perpendicular to the load cannot deform out-of-plane and will therefore continue to carry the stresses. This creates a non-uniform compressive loading along the ends, where the stresses are imposed on half of the effective width on either side of the specimen, given by the following:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b_{eff}}{b}=\sqrt{(\frac{\sigma_{cr}}{\sigma_{y}})(1-1.022\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{cr}}{\sigma_{y}}})}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;b_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; = effective width
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{y}&lt;/math&gt; = yielding stress

As the loaded stress increase, the effective width continues to shrink; if the stresses on the ends ever reaches the yield stress, the plate will fail. This is what allows the buckled structure to continue supporting loadings. When the axial load over the critical load is plotted against the displacement, the fundamental path is shown. It demonstrates the plate's similarity to a column under buckling; however, past the buckling load, the fundamental path bifurcates into a secondary path that curves upward, providing the ability to be subjected to higher loads past the critical load.

==Bicycle wheels==
A conventional [[bicycle wheel]] consists of a thin rim kept under high compressive stress by the (roughly normal) inward pull of a large number of spokes. It can be considered as a loaded column that has been bent into a circle. If spoke tension is increased beyond a safe level, the wheel spontaneously fails into a characteristic saddle shape (sometimes called a "taco" or a "[[Pringles|pringle]]") like a three-dimensional Euler column. This is normally a purely elastic deformation and the rim will resume its proper plane shape if spoke tension is reduced slightly.

==Surface materials==
[[Image:Spoorspatting Landgraaf.jpg|thumb|Railway tracks in the [[Netherlands]] affected by Sun kink.]]
Buckling is also a failure mode in [[pavement (material)|pavement]] materials, primarily with concrete, since [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]] is more flexible. [[Radiant heat]] from the [[sun]] is absorbed in the road surface, causing it to [[thermal expansion|expand]], forcing adjacent pieces to push against each other. If the stress is great enough, the pavement can lift up and crack without warning. Going over a buckled section can be very jarring to [[automobile]] drivers, described as running over a [[speed hump]] at highway speeds.

Similarly, [[rail tracks]] also expand when heated, and can fail by buckling, a phenomenon called '''sun kink'''. It is more common for rails to move laterally, often pulling the underlain [[railroad tie]]s (sleepers) along.

===Cause===
The buckling [[force]] in the track due to warming up is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the rise in temperature only and is independent of the track length:

:&lt;math&gt;F = E A \alpha_L \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;.

Derivation of buckling force function:

The linear [[thermal expansion]] due to heating of the track is found using
:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta L} = \alpha_L \Delta T \ L&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ΔL = thermal expansion of the rail
* L = length of the rail/track
* α = [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]
* ΔT = increase in temperature

According to [[Hooke's law]] the extension due to a force (in the rail) is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta L = \frac{F}{E A} L&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ΔL = extension of the rail/track
* F = the force extending a rod, here the induced force in the rail
* E = [[modulus of elasticity]] of rail material (steel)
* A = cross section of rail
* L = length of rail

Putting these together gives
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  {\frac{F}{E A} L } &amp;= \alpha_L \Delta T \ L \Longleftrightarrow \\
                   F &amp;= E A \alpha_L \Delta T
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Accidents===
These accidents were deemed to be sun kink related (''more information available at [[List of rail accidents (2000–2009)]]''):
* April 18, 2002 [[Amtrak]] ''[[Auto-Train]]'' derailment, off [[CSX]] tracks, near [[Crescent City, Florida]].
* July 29, 2002 [[Amtrak]] ''[[Capitol Limited (Amtrak train)|Capitol Limited]]'' derails, off [[CSX]] tracks, near [[Kensington, Maryland]].
* July 8, 2010 CSX train derails off tracks in [[Waxhaw, North Carolina]].
* July 6, 2012 WMATA [[Washington Metro|Metrorail]] train derails off tracks near Hyattsville, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;http://dcist.com/2012/07/excessive_heat_probable_cause_in_gr.php{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy method==
Often it is very difficult to determine the exact buckling load in complex structures using the Euler formula, due to the difficulty in determining the constant K. Therefore, maximum buckling load is often approximated using energy conservation and referred to as an energy method in structural analysis.

The first step in this method is to assume a displacement mode and a function that represents that displacement. This function must satisfy the most important boundary conditions, such as displacement and rotation. The more accurate the displacement function, the more accurate the result.

The method assumes that the system (the column) is a conservative system in which energy is not dissipated as heat, hence the energy added to the column by the applied external forces is stored in the column in the form of strain energy.

:&lt;math&gt;U_\text{applied} = U_\text{strain} \, &lt;/math&gt;

In this method, there are two equations used (for small deformations) to approximate the "strain" energy (the potential energy stored as elastic deformation of the structure) and "applied" energy (the work done on the system by external forces).

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   U_\text{strain} &amp;= \frac{E}{2} \int I(x)(w_{xx}(x))^2 \, dx \\
  U_\text{applied} &amp;= \frac{P_\text{crit}}{2} \int (w_{x}(x))^2 \, dx
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement function and the subscripts &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;xx&lt;/math&gt; refer to the first and second derivatives of the displacement. Energy conservation yields:

==Flexural-torsional buckling==
Flexural-torsional buckling can be described as a combination of bending and twisting response of a member in compression. Such a deflection mode must be considered for design purposes. This mostly occurs in columns with "open" cross-sections and hence have a low torsional stiffness, such as channels, structural tees, double-angle shapes, and equal-leg single angles. Circular cross sections do not experience such a mode of bucking.

==Lateral-torsional buckling==
[[File:Biegedrillknicken-svg.svg |thumb|upright=1.5|Lateral-torsional buckling of an I-beam with vertical force in center: a) longitudinal view, b) cross section near support, c) cross section in center with lateral-torsional buckling]]
When a simply supported beam is loaded in [[flexure]], the top side is in [[compression (physical)|compression]], and the bottom side is in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]]. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange as it buckles locally. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as ''lateral-torsional buckling''. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.

The use of closed sections such as square [[Hollow structural section|hollow section]] will mitigate the effects of lateral-torsional buckling virtue of their high [[torsional rigidity]]. 

===The modification factor (''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;)===
''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; is a modification factor used in the equation for nominal [[flexural strength]] when determining lateral-torsional buckling.  The reason for this factor is to allow for non-uniform moment diagrams when the ends of a beam segment are braced.  The conservative value for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; can be taken as 1, regardless of beam configuration or loading, but in some cases it may be excessively conservative. ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; is always equal to or greater than 1, never less. For [[cantilever]]s or overhangs where the free end is unbraced, C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to 1. Tables of values of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; for simply supported beams exist.

If an appropriate value of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; is not given in tables, it can be obtained via the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\ C_b = \frac{12.5M_\max}{2.5M_\max + 3M_A + 4M_B + 3M_C} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;M_\max&lt;/math&gt; = absolute value of maximum moment in the unbraced segment,
:&lt;math&gt;M_A&lt;/math&gt; = absolute value of maximum moment at quarter point of the unbraced segment,
:&lt;math&gt;M_B&lt;/math&gt; = absolute value of maximum moment at centerline of the unbraced segment, 
:&lt;math&gt;M_C&lt;/math&gt; = absolute value of maximum moment at three-quarter point of the unbraced segment,

The result is the same for all unit systems.

==Plastic buckling==
The buckling strength of a member is less than the elastic buckling strength of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.

A more accurate approximation of the buckling load can be had by the use of the tangent modulus of elasticity, E&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, which is less than the elastic modulus, in place of the elastic modulus of elasticity. The tangent is equal to the elastic modulus and then decreases beyond the proportional limit. The tangent modulus is a line drawn tangent to the stress-strain curve at a particular value of strain (in the elastic section of the stress-strain curve, the tangent modulus is equal to the elastic modulus). Plots of the tangent modulus of elasticity for a variety of materials are available in standard references.

==Dynamic buckling==
If a column is loaded suddenly and then the load released, the column can sustain a much higher load than its static (slowly applied) buckling load. This can happen in a long, unsupported column used as a drop hammer. The duration of compression at the impact end is the time required for a stress wave to travel along the column to the other (free) end and back down as a relief wave. Maximum buckling occurs near the impact end at a wavelength much shorter than the length of the rod, and at a stress many times the buckling stress of a statically-loaded column. The critical condition for buckling amplitude to remain less than about 25 times the effective rod straightness imperfection at the buckle wavelength is

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma L = \rho c^2 h \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the impact stress, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the rod, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic wave speed, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the smaller lateral dimension of a rectangular rod. Because the buckle wavelength depends only on &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, this same formula holds for thin cylindrical shells of thickness &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lindberg |first1=H. E. |last2=Florence |first2=A. L. |title=Dynamic Pulse Buckling |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] |date=1987 |pages=11–56, 297–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buckling of thin cylindrical shells subject to axial loads==
Solutions of Donnell's eight order differential equation gives the various buckling modes of a thin cylinder under compression. But this analysis, which is in accordance with the small deflection theory gives much higher values than shown from experiments. So it is customary to find the critical buckling load for various structures which are cylindrical in shape from empirically based design curves wherein the critical buckling load F&lt;sub&gt;cr&lt;/sub&gt; is plotted against the ratio R/t, where R is the radius and t is the thickness of the cylinder for various values of L/R, L the length of the cylinder. If cut-outs are present in the cylinder, critical buckling loads as well as pre-buckling modes will be affected. Presence or absence of reinforcements of cut-outs will also affect the buckling load.

==Buckling of pipes and pressure vessels subject to external overpressure==
Pipes and pressure vessels subject to external overpressure, caused for example by steam cooling within the pipe and condensing into water with subsequent massive pressure drop, risk buckling due to compressive [[hoop stress]]es. Design rules for calculation of the required wall thickness or reinforcement rings are given in various piping and pressure vessel codes.

'''''Consolidated Safety-Valve Co. v. Crosby Steam Gauge &amp; Valve Co.''''', 113 U.S. 157 (1885),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Consolidated Safety-Valve Co. v. Crosby Steam Gauge &amp; Valve Co.|113|157|1885}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[patent]] case to determine validity of patent No. 58,294,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|58294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; granted to George W. Richardson September 25, 1866, for an improvement in steam [[safety valve]]s.

==Technical background==
Richardson was the first person who made a safety valve which, while it automatically relieved the pressure of steam in the [[boiler]], did not, in effecting that result, reduce the pressure to such an extent as to make the use of the relieving apparatus practically impossible because of the expenditure of time and fuel necessary to bring up the steam again to the proper working standard.

His valve was the first which had the strictured orifice to retard the escape of the steam and enable the valve to open with increasing power against the spring and close suddenly, with small loss of pressure in the boiler.

==Ruling==
The direction given in the patent that the [[flange]] or lip is to be separated from the [[valve seat]] by about one sixty-fourth of an inch for an ordinary spring, with less space for a strong spring and more space for a weak spring, to regulate the escape of steam as required, is a sufficient description as matter of law, and it is not shown to be insufficient as a matter of fact.

Letters patent No. 85,963, granted to said Richardson January 19, 1869, for an improvement in safety valves for steam boilers or generators, are valid.

The patents of Richardson were [[Patent infringement|infringed]] by a valve which produces the same effects in operation by the means described in Richardson's claims, although the valve proper is an annulus and the extended surface is a disc inside of the annulus, the Richardson valve proper being a disc and the extended surface an annulus surrounding the disc, and although the valve proper has two ground joints, and only the steam which passes through one of them goes through the stricture, while, in the Richardson valve, all the steam which passes into the air goes through the stricture, and although the huddling chamber is at the center instead of the circumference, and is in the seat of the valve, under the head, instead of in the head, and the stricture is at the circumference of the seat of the valve instead of being at the circumference of the head.

The fact that the prior patented valves were not used and the speedy and extensive adoption of Richardson's valve support the conclusion as to the novelty of the latter.

Suits in equity having been begun in 1879 for the infringement of the two patents, and the circuit court having dismissed the bills, this Court in reversing the decrees after the first patent had expired but not the second, awarded accounts of profits and damages as to both patents, and a perpetual [[injunction]] as to the second patent.

[[Renewable energy]] sources such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], [[tidal power|tidal]], [[hydroelectric power|hydro]], [[biomass energy|biomass]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] have become significant sectors of the energy market.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency, IEA sees renewable energy growth accelerating over next 5 years, http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2012/july/name,28200,en.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global trends in renewable energy investment 2012, by REN21 (Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century); www.ren21.net/gsr&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid growth of these sources in the 21st century has been prompted by increasing costs of [[fossil fuel]]s as well as their [[environmental impact]] issues that [[Fossil fuel phase-out|significantly lowered]] their use.

Physical Metallurgy of Electrical Conductors, in Nonferrous Wire Handbook, Volume 3: Principles and Practice, The Wire Association International&lt;/ref&gt; power systems that utilize copper generate and transmit energy with high efficiency and with minimum environmental impacts. 

When choosing electrical conductors, facility planners and engineers factor capital investment costs of the materials against operational savings due to their electrical energy efficiencies over their useful lives, plus maintenance costs. Copper often fairs well in these calculations. One pertinent factor, called "copper usage intensity,” is a measure of the number of pounds of copper necessary to install one megawatt of new power-generating capacity. 

When planning for a new renewable power facility, engineers and product specifiers seek to avoid supply shortages of selected conductor materials. According to the United States Geological Survey, in-ground copper reserves have increased more than 700% since 1950, from almost 100 million tonnes to 720 million tonnes today, despite the fact that world refined usage has more than tripled in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;The World Copper Factbook, 2017; http://www.icsg.org/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/170/2462&lt;/ref&gt; Copper resources are estimated to exceed 5,000 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;Copper Mineral Commodity Summary (USGS, 2017) https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/ mcs-2017-coppe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Mineral Resource Assessment (USGS, 2014) http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2014/3004/pdf/fs2014-3004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bolstering the annual supply is the fact that more than 30 percent of copper installed during the last decade came from recycled sources.&lt;ref&gt;Long-Term Availability of Copper; International Copper Association; http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ICA-long-term-availability-201802-A4-HR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the sustainability of renewable energy systems, it is worthy to note that in addition to copper's high electrical and thermal conductivity, its recycling rate is higher than any other metal.&lt;ref&gt;Will the Transition to Renewable Energy Be Paved in Copper?, Renewable Energy World; Jan 15, 2016; by Zolaikha Strong; https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/01/will-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-be-paved-in-copper.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This article discusses the role of copper in various renewable energy generation systems.

==Overview of copper usage in renewable energy generation==
Copper plays a larger role in renewable energy generation than in conventional [[thermal power plants]] in terms of tonnage of copper per unit of installed power.&lt;ref&gt;  Integrated life-cycle assessment of electricity-supply scenarios confirms global environmental benefit of low-carbon technologies; Edgar G. Hertwich, Thomas Gibon, Evert A. Bouman, Anders Arvesen, Sangwon Suh, Garvin A. Heath, Joseph D. Bergesen, Andrea Ramirez, Mabel I. Vega, and Lei Shi; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA; May 19, 2015. 112 (20) 6277-6282;  https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1312753111&lt;/ref&gt; The copper usage intensity of renewable energy systems is four to six times higher than in fossil fuel or nuclear plants. So for example, while conventional power requires approximately 1 [[tonne]] of copper per installed [[megawatt]] (MW), renewable technologies such as wind and solar require four to six times more copper per installed MW. This is because copper is spread over much larger land areas, particularly in solar and wind energy power plants,&lt;ref&gt;Winds of Trade Toward Copper; Energy &amp; Infrastructure,  http://www.energyandinfrastructure.com/sections/columns1/469-winds-of-trade-toward-copper&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a need for long runs of power and grounding cables to connect components that are widely dispersed, including to energy storage systems and to the main electrical grid.&lt;ref&gt;Current and Projected Wind and Solar Renewable Electric Generating Capacity and Resulting Copper Demand; BBF Associates and Konrad J.A. Kundig, July 20, 2011; http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Projected-wind-solar-copper-demand-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The Rise Of Solar: A Unique Opportunity For Copper; Solar Industry Magazine; April 2017; Zolaika Strong; https://issues.solarindustrymag.com/article/rise-solar-unique-opportunity-copper&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind and solar [[photovoltaic]] energy systems have the highest copper content of all renewable energy technologies. A single wind farm can contain between 4 million and 15 million pounds of copper.  A photovoltaic solar power plant contains approximately 5.5 tons of copper per megawatt of power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Will the Transition to Renewable Energy Be Paved in Copper?; Renewable Energy World; Jan 15, 2016; https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/01/will-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-be-paved-in-copper.html&lt;/ref&gt; A single 660-kW turbine is estimated to contain some 800 pounds of copper.&lt;ref&gt;Growing Renewable Energy Needs More Copper, Windpower Engineering, November 21, 2012; https://www.windpowerengineering.com/business-news-projects/uncategorized/growing-renewable-energy-needs-more-copper/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The total amount of copper used in renewable-based and distributed electricity generation in 2011 was estimated to be 272 kilotonnes (kt). Cumulative copper use through 2011 was estimated to be 1,071 kt.

Copper conductors are used in major electrical renewable energy components, such as [[turbines]], [[electric generator|generators]], [[electric transformer|transformers]], [[inverter]]s, [[electrical cable]]s, [[power electronics]], and information cable. Copper usage is approximately the same in turbines/generators, transformers/inverters, and cables. Much less copper is used in power electronics.

[[Solar thermal heating|Solar thermal heating and cooling energy systems]] rely on copper for their thermal energy efficiency benefits. Copper is also used as a special [[corrosion resistance|corrosion-resistant]] material in renewable energy systems in wet, [[humidity|humid]], and [[saline water|saline corrosive]] environments.

Copper is a sustainable material that is 100% recyclable. The recycling rate of copper is higher than any other metal.&lt;ref&gt;Will the Transition to Renewable Energy Be Paved in Copper?; Renewable Energy World; Jan 15, 2016; https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/01/will-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-be-paved-in-copper.html&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the useful life of the renewable energy power plant or its electrical or thermal components, the copper can be recycled with no loss of its beneficial properties.

==Solar photovoltaic power generation==
Of the 20,000 TWh of power consumed globally in a single year,&lt;ref&gt;World Energy Outlook 2012, International Energy Agency; {{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Qcwo3frA?url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/ |archivedate=July 26, 2007 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; approximately 90 TWh are generated from solar PV systems. While this is only a very small percentage of global energy consumption (0.6% of total installed electricity generating capacity worldwide),&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"&gt;The Emerging Electrical Markets for Copper, Bloomsbury Minerals Economics Ltd., July 6, 2010; Independent research study available at Leonardo Energy - Ask an Expert; {{cite web |url=http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126131037/http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |archivedate=2012-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is nevertheless sufficient to power the needs of more than 10 million people living at the standard of living in a developed country.

Various overlapping statistics regarding the growth of solar PVs have been cited. Solar PVs have been cited to have a 40% annual growth rate, which may grow even faster as the cost of the technology continues to decline.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt; Another source cites operating capacity to have increased by an average of 58% annually from year end-2006 through 2011.&lt;ref name="ren1"&gt;Renewables 2012: Global status report; REN 21 (Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century; {{cite web |url=http://new.ren21.net/REN21Activities/GlobalStatusReport.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128084825/http://new.ren21.net/REN21Activities/GlobalStatusReport.aspx |archivedate=2013-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Installed capacity estimates to 2020 suggest a rapid rise in solar PV generation, growing by a factor of five between 2010 and 2020.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;

Household PV systems are able to generate their own electricity and use the [[electrical grid]] for support and reliability.

For these reasons, policy initiatives are taking place to enhance the deployment of solar photovoltaic energy installations. This would boost the steady expansion of PV markets by reducing the competitiveness gap of PVs compared to fossil fuel technologies.&lt;ref&gt;PV Parity; http://www.pvparity.eu&lt;/ref&gt; The goal at this point is to reach grid parity,&lt;ref&gt;Photovoltaic Grid Parity Monitor, Leonardo Energy; http://www.leonardo-energy.org/photovoltaic-grid-parity-monitor&lt;/ref&gt; where the cost of producing energy from rooftop panels over the course of their 25-year lifetime equates to the cost of retail electricity generated by conventional sources. This achievement has already been accomplished in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, Giles; 2011. Solar PV at grid parity! Now what? Climate Spectator, http://www.climatespectator.com.au/commentary/solar-pv-grid-parity-now-what?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trabish, Herman K; 2011. Solar grid parity is here today; GreentechSolar; http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/New-Study-Solar-Grid-Parity-Is-Here-Today&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper in photovoltaic power systems===
There is eleven to forty times more copper per unit of generation in photovoltaic systems than in conventional fossil fuel plants.&lt;ref&gt;Renewables Are as Green as You'd Expect; ''Scientific American''; October 8, 2014; https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewables-are-as-green-as-you-d-expect/; citing, Integrated life-cycle assessment of electricity-supply scenarios confirms global environmental benefit of low-carbon technologies; by Edgar G. Hertwich et. al; ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA''; May 19, 2015. 112 (20) 6277-6282; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1312753111&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of copper in photovoltaic systems averages around 4-5 tonnes per MW&lt;ref&gt;Will the Transition to Renewable Energy Be Paved in Copper?, Renewable Energy World; Jan 15, 2016; https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/01/will-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-be-paved-in-copper.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rise Of Solar: A Unique Opportunity For Copper; Solar Industry Magazine; April 2017; Zolaika Strong; https://issues.solarindustrymag.com/article/rise-solar-unique-opportunity-copper&lt;/ref&gt; or higher if conductive ribbon strips that connect individual PV cells are considered.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy2"/&gt;

Copper is used in: 1) small wires that interconnect [[photovoltaic modules]]; 2) earthing grids in [[electrode]] earth pegs, horizontal plates, naked cables, and wires; 3) [[Direct current|DC]] cables that connect photovoltaic modules to [[inverters]]; 4) low-voltage [[Alternating current|AC]] cables that connect inverters to metering systems and protection cabinets; 5) high-voltage AC cables; 6) communication cables; 7) inverters/power electronics; 8) ribbons; and 9) transformer windings.

Copper used in photovoltaic systems in 2011 was estimated to be 150 kt. Cumulative copper usage in photovoltaic systems through 2011 was estimated to be 350 kt.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy2"/&gt;

==== Photovoltaic system configurations ====

[[PV system|Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems]] are highly scalable, ranging from small [[rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop systems]] to large [[photovoltaic power station]] with capacities of hundreds of [[megawatt]]s. In residential systems, copper intensity appears to be linearly scalable with the capacity of the electrical generation system.&lt;ref&gt;Current and projected wind and solar renewable electric generating capacity and resulting copper demand; Copper Development Association Sustainable Electrical Energy Program; July 20, 2011, by BFF Associates and Konrad J.A. Kundig; http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Projected-wind-solar-copper-demand-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Residential and community-based systems generally range in capacity from 10&amp;nbsp;kW to 1&amp;nbsp;MW.

PV cells are grouped together in [[solar modules]]. These modules are connected to panels and then into PV arrays. In [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system]], arrays can form sub-fields from which electricity is collected and transported towards the grid connection.

Copper [[solar cable]]s connect modules (module cable), arrays (array cable), and sub-fields (field cable). Whether a system is connected to the grid or not, electricity collected from the PV cells needs to be converted from [[Direct current|DC]] to [[Alternating current|AC]] and stepped up in voltage. This is done by [[solar inverter]]s which contain copper windings, as well as with copper-containing power electronics.

==== Solar cells ====

The [[photovoltaic]] industry uses several different [[semiconducting material]]s for the production of [[solar cells]] and often groups them into first and second generation technologies, while the third generation includes a number of emerging technologies that are still in the research and development phase. Solar cells typically convert 20% of incident sunlight into electricity, allowing the generation of 100 - 150 kWh per square meter of panel per year.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;

Conventional first-generation [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si) technology includes [[monocrystalline silicon]] and [[polycrystalline silicon]]. In order to reduce costs of this wafer-based technology, copper-contacted silicon solar cells are emerging as an important alternative to [[silver]] as the preferred conductor material. Challenges with solar cell metallization lie in the creation of a homogenous and qualitatively high-value layer between silicon and copper to serves as a barrier against copper diffusion into the [[semiconductor]]. Copper-based front-side metallization in silicon solar cells is a significant step towards lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;PV Technology: Swapping Silver for Copper, 2012. Renewable Energy World International; July 2, 2012; http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/07/pv-technology-swapping-silver-for-copper&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-generation technology includes [[thin film solar cell]]s. Despite having a slightly lower [[Solar cell efficiency|conversion efficiency]] than conventional PV technology, the overall [[cost-per-watt]] is still lower. Commercially significant thin film technologies include [[copper indium gallium selenide solar cell]]s (CIGS) and [[cadmium telluride photovoltaics]] (CdTe), while [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si) and [[micromorphous silicon]] (m-Si) tandem cells are slowly being outcompeted in recent years.

CIGS, which is actually copper (indium-gallium) diselenide, or Cu(InGa)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, differs from silicon in that it is a [[heterojunction]] [[semiconductor]]. It has the highest solar energy conversion efficiency (~20%) among thin film materials.&lt;ref&gt;Characterization of 19.9%-Efficient CIGS Absorbers; National Renewable Energy Laboratory, May 2008; http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42539.pdf. Retrieved 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Because CIGS strongly absorbs sunlight, a much thinner film is required than with other semiconductor materials.

A photovoltaic cell manufacturing process has been developed that makes it possible to print CIGS semi-conductors. This technology has the potential to reduce the price per solar watt delivered.

While copper is one of the components in CIGS solar cells, the copper content of the cell is actually small: about 50&amp;nbsp;kg of copper per MW of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Global Solar; http://www.globalsolar.com, as cited in The Emerging Electrical Markets for Copper, Bloomsbury Minerals Economics Ltd., July 6, 2010; page 59. Independent research study available at Leonardo Energy - Ask an Expert; {{cite web |url=http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126131037/http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |archivedate=2012-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mono-dispersed [[copper sulfide]] [[nanocrystals]] are being researched as alternatives to conventional single crystals and thin films for photovoltaic devices. This technology, which is still in its infancy, has potential for [[dye-sensitized solar cells]], all-inorganic solar cells, and hybrid [[nanocrystal solar cell|nano-crystal]]-polymer composite solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;Wadia, C. et. al, 2008. Synthesis of copper (I) sulfide nanocrystals for photovoltaic application; Nanotech 2008 Conference Program Abstract; http://www.nsti.org/Nanotech2008/showabstract.html?absno=70355&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cables====
Solar generation systems cover large areas. There are many connections among modules and arrays, and connections among arrays in sub-fields and linkages to the network. Solar cables are used for wiring solar power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Solar First Source; {{cite web |url=http://solarfirstsource.com/solar-cable.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325102653/http://www.solarfirstsource.com/solar-cable.html |archivedate=2011-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of cabling involved can be substantial. Typical diameters of copper cables used are 4–6&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for module cable, 6–10&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for array cable, and 30–50&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for field cable.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;

====Energy efficiency and system design considerations====
Energy efficiency and renewable energy are twin pillars of a sustainable energy future. However, there is little linking of these pillars despite their potential synergies. The more efficiently energy services are delivered, the faster renewable energy can become an effective and significant contributor of primary energy. The more energy is obtained from renewable sources, the less fossil fuel energy is required to provide that same energy demand.&lt;ref name="ren1"/&gt; This linkage of renewable energy with energy efficiency relies in part on the electrical energy efficiency benefits of copper.

Increasing the [[diameter]] of a copper cable increases its electrical [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] ''(see: [[Copper wire and cable]])''. Thicker cables reduce [[Copper loss|resistive (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R) loss]], which affects lifetime profitability of PV system investments. Complex cost evaluations, factoring extra costs for materials, the amount of solar radiation directed towards solar modules per year (accounting for diurnal and seasonal variations, subsidies, tariffs, payback periods, etc.) are necessary to determine whether higher initial investments for thicker cables are justified.

Depending upon circumstances, some conductors in PV systems can be specified with either copper or [[aluminum]]. As with other electrical conducting systems, there are advantages to each ''(see: [[Copper wire and cable]])''. Copper is the preferred material when high electrical conductivity characteristics and flexibility of the cable are of paramount importance. Also, copper is more suitable for small roof facilities, in smaller cable trays, and when ducting in [[steel]] or [[plastic]] pipes.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy2"/&gt;

Cable ducting is not needed in smaller power facilities where copper cables are less than 25mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Without duct work, installation costs are lower with copper than with aluminum.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy2"/&gt;

[[Data communications]] networks rely on copper, [[optical fiber]], and/or [[radio frequency|radio]] links. Each material has its advantages and disadvantages. Copper is more reliable than radio links. Signal attenuation with copper wires and cables can be resolved with [[signal amplifiers]].&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy2"/&gt;

==Concentrating solar thermal power==
The Sun’s solar energy can also be harnessed for its heat. When the Sun’s energy heats a [[Coolant|fluid]] in a closed system, its pressure and temperature rise. When introduced to a [[turbine]], the fluid expands, turning the turbine and producing [[electrical power]].&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;

[[Concentrating solar power]] (CSP), also known as [[solar thermal electricity]] (STE), uses arrays of [[mirror]]s that concentrate the sun’s rays to temperatures between 400&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C -1000&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt; Electrical power is produced when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a [[steam turbine]]) connected to an electrical power generator.

CSP facilities can produce large-scale power and hold much promise in areas with plenty of sunshine and clear skies. Poised to make Sun-powered grids a reality,&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Alex, 2008. Solar thermal power may make sun-powered grid a reality; Popular Mechanics; November 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; CSP is currently capable of providing power and dispatchability on a scale similar to that of fossil fuel or nuclear electrical power plants.

The electrical output of CSP facilities match shifting daily demand for electricity in places where air conditioning systems are spreading. When backed by thermal storage facilities and combustible fuel, CSP offers utilities electricity that can be dispatched when required, enabling it to be used for base, shoulder and peak loads.&lt;ref&gt;Technology Roadmap: Concentrating Solar Power; IEA, http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/csp_roadmap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry groups have estimated that the technology could generate a quarter of the world’s electricity needs by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Jha, Alok, 2009. Concentrated solar power could generate 'quarter of world's energy,' The Guardian; May 26, 2009; https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/26/solarpower-renewableenergy&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, plans for future CSP facilities are ambitious. A timeline of CSP deployment around the world is available.&lt;ref&gt;4 CSP facts and figures; Timeline of CSP deployment around the world; CSP World; {{cite web |url=http://www.csp-world.com/resources/4-csp-facts-figures |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429051148/http://www.csp-world.com/resources/4-csp-facts-figures |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total installed power is forecasted to increase exponentially through 2025,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Global Concentrated Solar Power Markets and Strategies: 2010-2025, IHS Emerging Energy Research, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;2011 global status report by Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)&lt;/ref&gt; creating as much as 130,000 jobs.&lt;ref name="researchandmarkets1"&gt;Solar thermal power market guide; Energy Business Reports; October 2011; 153 pps. {{cite web |url=http://www.energybusinessreports.com/Solar-Thermal-Power.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103150555/http://www.energybusinessreports.com/Solar-Thermal-Power.html |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Spain]], the world leader of CSP technology, was constructing or planning to build some 50 large CSP plants. That nation has a total installed base of 1581 MW of power plus an additional 774 MW nearing completion for installation.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt; Other countries in southern [[Europe]] also have CSP facilities, as do countries in emerging markets, such as [[Chile]], [[India]], [[Morocco]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="researchandmarkets1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CSP Markets Report 2012-2013; CSP Today; http://www.csptoday.com/csp-markets-report/conference-event-brochure.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike wind energy, photovoltaics, and most distributed power, the main advantage of CSP is its [[thermal storage]] capability&lt;ref&gt;Dessau, Kathy Li 2010. Concentrating solar thermal: Sun power even in the dark; Solar Novus Today; July 26; http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1073:concentrating-solar-thermal-sun-power-even-in-the-dark&amp;catid=38:application-tech-features&amp;Itemid=246&lt;/ref&gt; and hybridization possibilities.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt; Storage systems range from 4 hours in the most typical plants to more than 20 hours when base load is required. This can complement variable generation of other renewable power sources.

CSP systems are sometimes combined with fossil fueled steam turbine generation, but interest is growing in pure CSP technology.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt; Further information on concentrating solar power is available from the Global Solar Thermal Energy Council.&lt;ref&gt;Global Solar Thermal Energy Council, http://www.solarthermalworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper in concentrating solar thermal power facilities===
A CSP system consists of: 1) a concentrator or collector containing [[mirror]]s that reflect [[solar radiation]] and deliver it to the receiver; 2) a receiver that absorbs concentrated sunlight and transfers heat energy to a working fluid (usually a [[mineral oil]], or more rarely, molten [[salts]], [[metals]], [[steam]] or [[air]]); 3) a transport and storage system that passes the fluid from the receiver to the power conversion system; and 4) a [[steam turbine]] that converts thermal power to electricity on demand.

Copper is used in field power [[Copper wire and cable|cables]], grounding networks, and [[Electric motor|motors]] for tracking and pumping fluids, as well as in the main generator and [[high voltage]] [[transformer]]s. Typically, there is about 200 tonnes copper for a 50 MW power plant.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt;

It has been estimated that copper usage in concentrated solar thermal power plants was 2 kt in 2011. Cumulative copper usage in these plants through 2011 was estimated to be 7 kt.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt;

There are four main types of CSP technologies, each containing a different amount of copper: parabolic trough plants, tower plants, distributed linear absorber systems including linear Fresnel plants, and dish Stirling plants.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt; The use of copper in these plants is described here.

====Parabolic trough plants====
[[Parabolic trough]] plants are the most common CSP technology, representing about 94% of power installed in Spain. These plants collect solar energy in parabolic trough concentrators with linear collector tubes. The heat transfer fluids are typically synthetic oil that circulates through tubes at inlet outlet/temperatures of 300&amp;nbsp;°C to 400&amp;nbsp;°C. The typical storage capacity of a 50 MW facility is 7 hours at nominal power. A plant of this size and storage capacity can generate 160 GWh/year in a region like Spain.

In parabolic trough plants, copper is specified in the solar collector field (power cables, signals, earthing, electrical motors); steam cycle (water pumps, condenser fans, cabling to consumption points, control signal and sensors, motors), electricity generators (alternator, transformer), and storage systems (circulating pumps, cabling to consumption points). A 50 MW plant with 7.5 hours of storage contains approximately 196 tonnes of copper, of which 131,500&amp;nbsp;kg are in cables and 64,700&amp;nbsp;kg are in various equipment (generators, transformers, mirrors, and motors). This translates to about 3.9 tonnes/MW, or, in other terms, 1.2 tonnes/GWh/year. A plant of the same size without storage can have 20% less copper in the solar field and 10% less in the electronic equipment. A 100 MW plant will have 30% less relative copper content per MW in the solar field and 10% less in electronic equipment.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt;

Copper quantities also vary according to design. The solar field of a typical 50 MW power plant with 7 hours of storage capacity consists of 150 loops and 600 motors, while a similar plant without storage uses 100 loops and 400 motors. Motorized valves for mass flow control in the loops rely on more copper. Mirrors use a small amount of copper to provide [[galvanic corrosion]] protection to the reflective silver layer. Changes in the size of the plants, size of collectors, efficiencies of heat transfer fluids will also affect material volumes.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt;

====Tower plants====
[[Solar power tower|Tower plants]], also called central tower power plants, may become the preferred CSP technology in the future. They collect solar energy concentrated by the [[heliostat]] field in a central receiver mounted at the top of the tower. Each heliostat tracks the Sun along two axes (azimuth and elevation). Therefore, two motors per unit are required.

Copper is required in the heliostat field (power cables, signal, earthing, motors), receiver (trace heating, signal cables), storage system (circulating pumps, cabling to consumption points), electricity generation (alternator, transformer), steam cycle (water pumps, condenser fans), cabling to consumption points, control signal and sensors, and motors.

A 50 MW solar tower facility with 7.5 hours of storage uses about 219 tonnes of copper. This translates to 4.4 tonnes of copper/MW, or, in other terms, 1.4 tonnes/GWh/year. Of this amount, cables account for approximately 154,720&amp;nbsp;kg. Electronic equipment, such as generators, transformers, and motors, account for approximately 64,620&amp;nbsp;kg of copper. A 100 MW plant has slightly more copper per MW in the solar field because the efficiency of the heliostat field diminishes with the size. A 100 MW plant will have somewhat less copper per MW in process equipment.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt;

====Linear Fresnel plants====
[[Compact linear Fresnel reflector|Linear Fresnel]] plants use linear reflectors to concentrate the Sun’s rays in an absorber tube similar to parabolic trough plants. Since the concentration factor is less than in parabolic trough plants, the temperature of the [[Coolant|heat transfer fluid]] is lower. This is why most plants use [[saturated steam]] as the working fluid in both the solar field and the turbine.

A 50 MW linear Fresnel power plant requires about 1,960 tracking motors. The power required for each motor is much lower than the parabolic trough plant. A 50 MW lineal Fresnel plant without storage will contain about 127 tonnes of copper. This translates to 2.6 tonnes of copper/MW, or in other terms, 1.3 tonnes of copper/GWh/year. Of this amount, 69,960&amp;nbsp;kg of copper are in cables from process area, solar field, earthing and lightning protection and controls. Another 57,300&amp;nbsp;kg of copper is in equipment (transformers, generators, motors, mirrors, pumps, fans).&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt;

====Dish Stirling plants====
These plants are an emerging technology that has potential as a solution for decentralized applications. The technology does not require water for cooling in the conversion cycle. These plants are non-dispatchable. Energy production ceases when clouds pass overhead. Research is being conducted on advanced storage and hybridization systems.

The largest dish Sterling installation has a total power of 1.5 MW. Relatively more copper is needed in the solar field than other CSP technologies because electricity is actually generated there. Based on existing 1.5 MW plants, the copper content is 4 tonnes/MW, or, in other terms, 2.2 tonnes of copper/GWh/year. A 1.5 MW power plant has some 6,060&amp;nbsp;kg of copper in cables, induction generators, drives, field and grid transformers, earthing and lightning protection.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy4"/&gt;

==Solar water heaters (solar domestic hot water systems)==
[[Solar water heating|Solar water heaters]] can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for homes. They can be used in any climate. The fuel they use, sunshine, is free.&lt;ref name="energysavers1"&gt;Solar water heaters; Energy Savers; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; U.S. Department of Energy; http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850/&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar hot water collectors are used by more than 200 million households as well as many public and commercial buildings worldwide.&lt;ref name="ren1"/&gt; The total installed capacity of solar thermal heating and cooling units in 2010 was 185 GW-thermal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Solar heating capacity increased by an estimated 27% in 2011 to reach approximately 232 GWth, excluding unglazed swimming pool heating. Most solar thermal is used for water heating, but solar space heating and cooling are gaining ground, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name="ren1"/&gt;

There are two types of solar water heating systems: active, which have circulating pumps and controls, and passive, which don't. Passive solar techniques do not require working electrical or mechanical elements. They include the selection of materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;

Copper is an important component of solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of its high [[List of thermal conductivities|heat conductivity]], resistance to atmospheric and water corrosion, sealing and joining by soldering, and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; For the [[Solar thermal collector|absorber plate]], aluminum is sometimes used as it is cheaper, yet when combined with copper piping, there may be problems in regards to allow the absorber plate to transfer its heat to the piping suitably. An alternative material that is currently used is [[Cross-linked polyethylene#PEX-AL-PEX|PEX-AL-PEX]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.builditsolar.com/Experimental/PEXCollector/SmallPanelTests.htm PEX-AL-PEX used frequently for solar thermal collector construction]&lt;/ref&gt; but there may be similar problems with the heat transfer between the absorber plate and the pipes as well. One way around this is to simply use the same material for both the piping and the absorber plate. This material can be copper off course but also aluminum or PEX-AL-PEX.

Three types of [[solar thermal collector]]s are used for residential applications: [[Solar thermal collector#Flat plate collectors|flat plate collectors]], integral collector-storage, and [[Solar thermal collector#Evacuated tube collectors|solar thermal collector: Evacuated tube collectors]];  They can be direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps heat a transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems.&lt;ref name="energysavers1"/&gt;

In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Copper heat pipes transfer thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. A thermal transfer fluid (water or [[glycol]] mixture) is pumped through the copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises. The evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. The outer layer is fully transparent to allow solar energy to pass through unimpeded. The inner layer is treated with a selective [[optical coating]] that absorbs energy without reflection. The inner and outer layers are fused at the end, leaving an empty space between the inner and outer layers. All air is pumped out of the space between the two layers (evacuation process), thereby creating the thermos effect which stops conductive and convective transfer of heat that might otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Heat loss is further reduced by the low-emissivity of the glass that is used. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains a small amount of proprietary liquid, which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. Other components include a solar heat exchanger tank and a solar pumping station, with pumps and controllers.&lt;ref&gt;Solar hot water; B&amp;R Service Inc.; http://www.bandrservice.com/solar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How solar hot water system works; SolarPlusGreen.com; http://www.solarplusgreen.com/solar-know-how.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirasol Solar Energy Systems; http://www.mirasolenergysystems.com/pdf/et-technology.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How solar heaters work; Mayca Solar Energy; {{cite web |url=http://www.maycasolar.com/techinfo.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028203532/http://www.maycasolar.com/techinfo.asp |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayat Energy: solar water heaters; http://www.bayatenergy.co.uk/Solar%20Water%20Heaters%20Catalogue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wind==
[[Wind power]] is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using [[wind turbines]] to make electricity, [[windmills]] for mechanical power, [[windpump]]s for water pumping or drainage, or [[sail]]s to propel ships. In a [[wind turbine]], the wind's [[kinetic energy]] is converted into [[mechanical energy]] to drive a [[Electric generator|generator]], which in turn generates [[electricity]].

Wind energy is one of the fastest growing energy technologies. Wind power capacity increased from a very small base of around 0.6 GW in 1996 to around 160 GW in 2009.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt; It has also been reported that wind power capacity increased by 20% in 2011 to approximately 238 GW by 2012. This was the largest addition in capacity of any of the renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref name="ren1"/&gt; It is anticipated that the growth of wind energy will continue to rise dramatically. Moderate estimates for global capacity by 2020 are 711 GW.&lt;ref&gt;Wind Energy – The Facts, European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), as cited in The Emerging Electrical Markets for Copper, Bloomsbury Minerals Economics Ltd., July 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 50 countries operated wind power facilities in 2010.&lt;ref name="ren1"/&gt;

Traditionally, wind power has been generated on land. But higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to land.&lt;ref&gt;Offshore Wind Power 2010 BTM Consult, Madsen &amp; Krogsgaard; 22 November 2010. {{cite web |url=http://btm.dk/news/offshore+wind+power+2010/?s%3D9%26p%3D%26n%3D39 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630030725/http://btm.dk/news/offshore%2Bwind%2Bpower%2B2010/?s=9&amp;p=&amp;n=39 |archivedate=2011-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are being improved to exploit the potential of wind power in offshore environments. The offshore wind power market is expanding with the use of larger turbines and installations farther from shore.&lt;ref name="ren1"/&gt;

Offshore installation, as yet, is a comparatively small market, probably accounting for little more than 10% of installation globally. The location of new [[wind farms]] increasingly will be offshore, especially in Europe. Offshore wind farms are normally much larger, often with over 100 turbines with ratings up to 3 MW and above per turbine. The harsh environment means that the individual components need to be more rugged and corrosion protected than their onshore components. Increasingly long connections to shore with subsea MV and HV cables are required at this time. The need for [[corrosion resistance|corrosion protection]] favors [[copper nickel]] cladding as the preferred alloy for the towers.

Wind power installations vary in scale and type. Large wind farm installations linked to the [[electrical grid]] are at one end of the spectrum. These may be located either onshore or offshore. At the other end of the spectrum are small individual [[turbines]] that provide electricity to individual premises or electricity-using installations. These are often in rural and grid-isolated sites.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;

The basic components of a wind power system consist of a tower with rotating blades containing an electricity generator and a transformer to step up voltage for electricity transmission to a substation on the grid. Cabling and electronics are also important components.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Distributed generation and renewables – wind power; Power Quality and Utilisation Guide; Leonardo Energy; {{cite web |url=http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/power-quality/downloads/pqug/832-wind-power.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101181406/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/power-quality/downloads/pqug/832-wind-power.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kundig; published at: http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Projected-wind-solar-copper-demand-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In both onshore and offshore environments, additional copper cabling is used to connect wind farms to main electrical grids.&lt;ref&gt;The Rise Of Solar: A Unique Opportunity For Copper; Solar Industry Magazine; April 2017; by Zolaika Strong; https://issues.solarindustrymag.com/article/rise-solar-unique-opportunity-copper&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of copper used for wind energy systems in 2011 was estimated to be 120 kt. The cumulative amount of copper installed through 2011 was estimated to be 714 kt.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy3"/&gt;

For wind farms with three-stage gearbox doubly fed 3 MW induction generators, approximately 2.7 t per MW is needed with standard windmills. For windmills with LV/MV transformers in the nacelle, 1.85 t per MW is needed.&lt;ref&gt;García-Olivares, Antonio, Joaquim Ballabrera-Poy, Emili García-Ladona, and Antonio Turiel. A global renewable mix with proven technologies and common materials, Energy Policy 41 (2012): 561-57, http://imedea.uib-csic.es/master/cambioglobal/Modulo_I_cod101601/Ballabrera_Diciembre_2011/Articulos/Garcia-Olivares.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Copper is primarily used in coil windings in the [[stator]] and [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] portions of [[Electric generator|generators]] (which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy), in [[high voltage]] and [[low voltage]] cable conductors including the vertical electrical cable that connects the [[nacelle]] to the base of the [[wind turbine]], in the coils of transformers (which steps up low voltage AC to high voltage AC compatible with the grid), in [[gearboxes]] (which convert the slow revolutions per minute of the rotor blades to faster rpms) and in wind farm electrical grounding systems.&lt;ref&gt;Growing renewable energy needs more copper; by Nic Sharpley; November 21, 2012; ''Windpower Engineering''; https://www.windpowerengineering.com/business-news-projects/uncategorized/growing-renewable-energy-needs-more-copper/&lt;/ref&gt; Copper may also be used in the nacelle (the housing of the wind turbine that rests on the tower containing all the main components), auxiliary motors (motors used to rotate the nacelle as well as control the angle of the rotor blades), cooling circuits (cooling configuration for the entire [[drive train]]), and [[power electronics]] (which enable the wind turbine systems to perform like a power plant).&lt;ref&gt;Copper content assessment of wind turbines, Final Report V01, by Frost &amp; Sullivan. Presented to ECI on July 12, 2010. Available at Leonardo Energy - Ask an Expert; {{cite web |url=http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126131037/http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |archivedate=2012-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coils of wind generators, electric current suffers from losses that are proportional to the resistance of the wire that carries the current. This resistance, called [[copper loss]]es, causes energy to be lost by heating up the wire. In wind power systems, this resistance can be reduced with thicker copper wire and with a cooling system for the generator, if required.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, C. Bracken, 2009. Energy loss of a wind turbine; Centurion Energy; July 31, 2009; http://centurionenergy.net/energy-loss-of-a-wind-turbine&lt;/ref&gt;

====Copper in generators====
Either copper or aluminum conductors can be specified for generator cables.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Component — Cables: Choosing the right cable for specific turbine applications is essential for wind farm success; Wind Systems; Uwe Schenk; http://www.windsystemsmag.com/article/detail/538/critical-componentcables&lt;/ref&gt; Copper has the higher electrical conductivity and therefore the higher electrical energy efficiency. It is also selected for its safety and reliability. The main consideration for specifying aluminum is its lower capital cost. Over time, this benefit is offset by higher energy losses over years of power transmission. Deciding which conductor to use is determined during a project's planning phase when utility teams discuss these matters with turbine and cable manufacturers. 

Regarding copper, its weight in a generator will vary according to the type of generator, [[power rating]], and configuration. Its weight has an almost linear relationship to the power rating.

Generators in [[Wind turbine design|direct-drive wind turbines]] contain more copper, as the generator itself is bigger due to the absence of a gearbox.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy5"&gt;Copper content assessment of wind turbines, Final Report V01, by Frost &amp; Sullivan. Presented to ECI; July 12, 2010. Available at Leonardo Energy - Ask an Expert; {{cite web |url=http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126131037/http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |archivedate=2012-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A generator in a direct drive configuration could be 3.5&amp;nbsp;times to 6&amp;nbsp;times heavier than in a geared configuration, depending on the type of generator.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy5"/&gt;

Five different types of generator technologies are used in wind generation:
# double-fed asynchronous generators (DFAG)
# [[Induction generator|conventional asynchronous generators]] (CAG)
# [[Alternator|conventional synchronous generators]] (CSG)
# [[permanent magnet synchronous generator]]s (PMSG)
# [[Superconducting electric machine|high-temperature superconductor generators]] (HTSG)
The amount of copper in each of these generator types is summarized here.

|-
|Double-fed asynchronous generator (DFAG) ||650 ||Geared; most common wind generator in Europe (70% in 2009; strong demand until 2015, then neutral as high cost of maintenance and servicing and need for power correction equipment for grid compliance will make these less popular in next ten years.

|}

Direct-drive configurations of the synchronous type machines contain the most copper. Conventional synchronous generators (CSG) direct-drive machines have the highest per-unit copper content. The share of CSGs will increase from 2009 to 2020, especially for direct drive machines. DFAGs accounted for the most unit sales in 2009.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy5"/&gt;

The variation in the copper content of CSG generators depends upon whether they are coupled with single-stage (heavier) or three-stage (lighter) gearboxes. Similarly, the difference in copper content in PMSG generators depends on whether the turbines are medium speed, which are heavier, or high-speed turbines, which are lighter.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy5"/&gt;

There is increasing demand for synchronous machines and direct-drive configurations. CSG direct and geared DFAGs will lead the demand for copper. The highest growth in demand is expected to be the direct PMSGs, which is forecast to account for 7.7% of the total demand for copper in wind power systems in 2015. However, since permanent magnets that contain the rare earth element neodymium may not be able to escalate globally, direct drive synchronous magnet (DDSM) designs may be more promising.&lt;ref&gt;García-Olivares, Antonio, Joaquim Ballabrera-Poy, Emili García-Ladona, and Antonio Turiel. A global renewable mix with proven technologies and common materials, Energy Policy 41 (2012): 561-57, http://imedea.uib-csic.es/master/cambioglobal/Modulo_I_cod101601/Ballabrera_Diciembre_2011/Articulos/Garcia-Olivares.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of copper required for a 3 MW DDSM generator is 12.6 t.&lt;ref&gt;Bang, D., Polinder, H. Shrestha, G. and Ferreira, J.A., 2009. Possible solutions to overcome drawbacks of direct-drive generator for large wind turbines; In: Ewc 2009 Proceedings, CT3 session, available at www.ewec2009proceedings.info.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locations with high-speed turbulent winds are better suited for variable-speed wind turbine generators with full-scale power converters due to the greater reliability and availability they offer in such conditions. Of the variable-speed wind turbine options, PMSGs could be preferred over DFAGs in such locations. In conditions with low wind speed and turbulence, DFAGs could be preferred to PMSGs.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy3"/&gt;

Generally, PMSGs deal better with grid-related faults and they could eventually offer higher efficiency, reliability, and availability than geared counterparts. This could be achieved by reducing the number of mechanical components in their design. Currently, however, geared wind turbine generators have been more thoroughly field-tested and are less expensive due to the greater volumes produced.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy3"/&gt;

The current trend is for PMSG hybrid installations with a single-stage or two-stage gearbox. The most recent wind turbine generator by [[Vestas]] is geared drive. The most recent wind turbine generator by [[Siemens]] is a hybrid. Over the medium term, if the cost of power electronics continues to decrease, direct-drive PMSG are expected to become more attractive.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy3"/&gt;
High-temperature superconductors (HTSG) technology is currently under development. It is expected that these machines will be able to attain more power than other wind turbine generators. If the offshore market follows the trend of larger unit machines, offshore could be the most suitable niche for HTSGs.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy3"/&gt;

====Copper in other components====
For a 2 MW turbine system, the following amounts of copper were estimated for components other than the generator:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
! Component || Average Cu content (kg)
|-
| Auxiliary motors (pitch and yaw drives) ||75
|-
| Other parts of the nacelle || &lt;50
|-
| Vertical cables || 1500
|-
| Power electronics (converter) || 150
|-
| Cooling circuits || &lt;10
|-
| Earthing and lightning protection|| 750
|}

Cabling is the second largest copper-containing component after the generator. A wind tower system with the transformer next to the generator will have medium-voltage (MV) power cables running from the top to the bottom of the tower, then to a collection point for a number of wind towers and on to the grid substation, or direct to the substation. The tower assembly will incorporate wire harnesses and control/signal cables, while low-voltage (LV) power cables are required to power the working parts throughout the system.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy1"/&gt;

For a 2 MW wind turbine, the vertical cable could range from 1,000-1,500&amp;nbsp;kg of copper, depending upon its type. Copper is the dominant material in underground cables.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy5"/&gt;

====Copper in grounding systems====
Copper is vital to the [[electrical grounding]] system for wind turbine farms. Grounding systems can either be all-copper (solid or stranded copper wires and copper bus bars) often with an American gauge rating of 4/0 but perhaps as large as 250 thousands of circular mils&lt;ref&gt;Winds of Trade Toward Copper; Energy &amp; Infrastructure; http://www.energyandinfrastructure.com/sections/columns1/469-winds-of-trade-toward-copper&lt;/ref&gt; or copper-clad steel, a lower cost alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to wind turbine cables: Cables 101: by Kathie Zipp, January 17, 2012; https://www.windpowerengineering.com/mechanical/cables-connectors/cables-101/&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbine masts attract [[lightning]] strikes, so they require [[lightning protection]] systems. When lightning strikes a turbine blade, current passes along the blade, through the blade hub in the [[nacelle]] ([[gearbox]]/ generator enclosure) and down the mast to a grounding system. The blade incorporates a large cross-section copper conductor that runs along its length and allows current to pass along the blade without deleterious heating effects. The nacelle is protected by a lightning conductor, often copper. The grounding system, at the base of the mast, consists of a thick copper ring conductor bonded to the base or located within a meter of the base. The ring is attached to two diametrically opposed points on the mast base. Copper leads extend outward from the ring and connect to copper grounding electrodes. The grounding rings at turbines on wind farms are inter-connected, providing a networked system with an extremely small aggregate resistance.&lt;ref name="copper2"/&gt;

Solid [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]] has been traditionally deployed for grounding and lightning equipment due to its excellent [[electrical conductivity]]. However, manufacturers are moving towards less expensive bi-metal copper clad or aluminum grounding wires and cables.&lt;ref&gt;Mattera, Michael; 2010. An alternative to copper-based grounding; Windpoweer Engineering &amp; Development; August 4, 2010; http://www.windpowerengineering.com/tag/copper-clad-steel/&lt;/ref&gt; Copper-plating wire is being explored. Current disadvantages of copper plated wire include lower conductivity, size, weight, flexibility and current carrying capability.

====Copper in other equipment====
After generators and cable, minor amounts of copper are used in the remaining equipment. In yaw and pitch auxiliary motors, the [[Yaw system|yaw drive]] uses a combination of [[induction motors]] and multi-stage [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary gearboxes]] with minor amounts of copper. [[Power electronics]] have minimal amounts of copper compared to other equipment. As turbine capacities increase, converter ratings also increase from low voltage (&lt;1 kV) to medium voltage (1–5 kV). Most wind turbines have full [[Electric power conversion|power converters]], which have the same [[power rating]] as the [[Electric generator|generator]], except the DFAG that has a power converter that is 30% of the rating of the generator. Finally, minor amounts of copper are used in air/oil and water cooled circuits on gearboxes or generators.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy5"/&gt;

Class 5 copper power cabling is exclusively used from the generator through the loop and tower interior wall. This is due to its ability to withstand the stress from 15,000 torsion cycles for 20 years of service life.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Component—Cables: Choosing the right cable for specific turbine applications is essential for wind farm success;  Wind Systems; Uwe Schenk; http://www.windsystemsmag.com/article/detail/538/critical-componentcables&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Superconductivity|Superconducting]] materials are being tested within and outside of wind turbines. They offer higher electrical efficiencies, the ability to carry higher currents, and lighter weights. These materials are, however, much more expensive than copper at this time.&lt;ref name="leonardo-energy5"/&gt;

====Copper in offshore wind farms====
The amount of copper in offshore wind farms increases with the distance to the coast. Copper usage in offshore windmills is on the order of 10.5 t per MW.&lt;ref&gt;Growing renewable energy needs more copper; by Nic Sharpley; November 21, 2012; ''Windpower Engineering''; https://www.windpowerengineering.com/business-news-projects/uncategorized/growing-renewable-energy-needs-more-copper/; citing the study: Current and projected wind and solar renewable electric generating capacity and resulting copper demand; by BFF Associates and Konrad J.A. Kundig; published at: http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Projected-wind-solar-copper-demand-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Borkum 2 offshore wind farm in Denmark uses 5,800 t for a 400 MW, 200 kilometer connection to the external grid, or approximately 14.5 t of copper per MW. The Horns wind farm uses 8.75 tons of copper per MW to transmit 160 MW 21 kilometers to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;García-Olivares, Antonio, Joaquim Ballabrera-Poy, Emili García-Ladona, and Antonio Turiel.

'''Copper–tungsten''' ('''tungsten–copper''', '''CuW''', or '''WCu''')  is a mixture of [[copper]] and [[tungsten]]. As copper and tungsten are not mutually soluble, the material is composed of distinct particles of one metal dispersed in a matrix of the other one. The [[microstructure]] is therefore rather a [[metal matrix composite]] instead of a true alloy.

The material combines the properties of both metals, resulting in a material that is heat-resistant, [[ablation]]-resistant, highly [[thermal conductivity|thermally]] and [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]], and easy to [[machining|machine]].

Parts are made from the CuW composite by pressing the tungsten particles into the desired shape, [[sintering]] the compacted part, then infiltrating with molten copper. Sheets, rods, and bars of the composite mixture are available as well.

Commonly used copper tungsten mixtures contains 10–50 wt.% of copper, the remaining portion being mostly tungsten. The typical properties is dependent on its composition. The mixture with less wt.% of copper has higher density, higher hardness, and higher resistivity. The typical density of CuW90, with 10% of copper, is 16.75 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 11.85 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for CuW50 . CuW90 has higher hardness and resistivity of 260 HB kgf/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 6.5 µΩ.cm than CuW50.

==Applications==
CuW composites are used where the combination of high heat resistance, high electrical and thermal conductivity, and low thermal expansion are needed. Some of the applications are in [[electric resistance welding]], as [[electrical contact]]s, and as [[heat sink]]s. As contact material, the composite is resistant to erosion by electric arc. WCu alloys are also used in electrodes for [[electrical discharge machining]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.credoreference.com/entry/mhmeh/the_principle_of_edm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electrochemical machining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tungstenchina.com/product/Tungsten-Copper.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328121724/http://www.tungstenchina.com/product/Tungsten-Copper.html |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CuW75 composite, with 75% tungsten, is widely used in [[chip carrier]]s, substrates, flanges, and frames for [[power semiconductor device]]s. The high thermal conductivity of copper together with the low thermal expansion of tungsten allows thermal expansion matching to [[silicon]], [[gallium arsenide]], and some [[ceramic]]s. Other materials for this applications are [[CuMo]] alloy, [[AlSiC]], and [[Dymalloy]].

Composites with 70–90% of tungsten are used in liners of some specialty [[shaped charge]]s. The penetration is enhanced by factor 1.3 against copper for homogeneous steel target, as both the density and the break-up time are increased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/109668096/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten powder based shaped charge liners are especially suitable for [[oil well completion]]. Other ductile metals can be used as a binder in place of copper as well. [[Graphite]] can be added as lubricant to the powder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5656791.html&lt;/ref&gt;

CuW can also be used as a contact material in a vacuum. When the contact is very fine grained (VFG) the electrical conductivity is much higher than a normal piece of Copper Tungsten.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plansee.com/en/Products-Electrical-contacts-Tungsten-copper-WCu-58.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Copper tungsten is a good choice for a vacuum contact due to its low cost, resistance to arc erosion, good conductivity, and resistance to mechanical wear and contact welding. CuW is usually a contact for vacuum, oil, and gas systems. It is not a good contact for air since the surface will oxidize when exposed. CuW is less likely to erode in air when the concentration of copper is higher in the material. The uses of CuW in the air are as an arc tip, arc plate, and an arc runner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmwinc.com/copper-tungsten-contacts.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212110537/http://www.cmwinc.com/copper-tungsten-contacts.php |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper tungsten materials are often used for arcing contacts in SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; circuit breakers that require medium and high voltages.  The copper tungsten used in these circuit breakers is subject to temperatures above 20,000K, which is reached during arcing.  Copper tungsten arc contacts resist arc erosion.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plansee.com/en/Products-Electrical-contacts-Tungsten-copper-WCu-58.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


The Spark Erosion (EDM) process calls for copper tungsten. Usually, this process is used with graphite, but as tungsten has a high melting point (3420 &lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C) this allows the CuW electrodes to have a longer service life than the graphite electrodes. This is crucial when the electrodes have been processed with complex machining. Since the electrodes are susceptible to wear the electrodes provide more geometrical accuracy than the other electrodes. These properties also let the rods and tubes manufactured for spark erosion be made smaller in diameter and have a longer length since the material is less likely to chip and warp. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.plansee.com/en/Products-Forming-and-machining-tools-Erosion-electrodes-76.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrical and thermal properties of the composites vary with different proportions. An increase in copper increases the thermal conductivity, which plays a huge part when being used in circuit breakers.  Electrical resistivity increases with an increase in the percentage of tungsten present in the composite, ranging from 3.16 at 55% tungsten  to  6.1 when the composite contains 90% tungsten.  An increase in tungsten leads to an increase in ultimate tensile strength up until the alloy reaches 80% tungsten and 20% copper with an ultimate tensile strength of 663 MPa.  After this mixture of copper and tungsten, the ultimate tensile strength then begins to decrease fairly rapidly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="715">A '''cullingey''' is an obsolete unit of mass that was used in the southern region in state of [[Karnataka]] in [[India]]. One cullingey was approximately equal to 81.25&amp;nbsp;[[troy grain]]s (5.265&amp;nbsp;g). After [[Metrication in India|metrification]] in the mid-20th century, the unit became obsolete.

The '''Egyptian Petroleum Research Institution''' ('''EPRI''') is a governmental organization in [[Egypt]] founded by the [[decree | presidential decree]] 541 in 1974. It is under the umbrella of the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology, to help advance the development of studies and applications within the oil sector, and to find solutions to both long and short term technical problems.

To effectively carry out this role the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Egypt)|Ministry of petroleum]] is authorized for up to 50% of the EPRI's board of director shares; the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and Development is the head of the EPRI board, other members who are appointed by him to support and back the EPRI mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epri.sci.eg/Default2.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EVD-tenis-045.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Friction tape on a tennis racket handle]]
'''Friction tape''' is a type of [[adhesive tape]] made from [[Textile|cloth]] impregnated with a rubber-based [[adhesive]], mainly used to insulate splices in electric wires and cables. Because the adhesive is impregnated in the cloth, friction tape is sticky on both sides. The rubber-based adhesive makes it an electrical [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]] and provides a degree of protection from liquids and [[corrosion]]. In the past, friction tape was widely used by electricians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Basic Electricity: Rate Training Manual | author=United States Bureau of Naval Personnel, Bureau of Naval Personnel | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=1970 | ISBN=0-486-20973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[electrical tape]] has replaced it in most applications today. The frictional properties of the tape come from the cloth material, which is usually made from [[cotton]], while the fabric base protects electrical splices against punctures and abrasion.

== Other uses ==
Aside from its original purpose as an electrical insulating tape, a common use for friction tape is to wrap it around the blade of a [[hockey stick]] to improve [[hockey puck|puck]] control.  Another use is to wrap it around the handle of a softball or baseball bat to provide a better grip. It is also useful as a base when wrapping a [[bicycle handlebar]] with handlebar tape.

'''Planta Solar Fuente Álamo''' is a [[photovoltaic power station]] in [[Fuente Álamo de Murcia|Fuente-Álamo]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] in [[Spain]].  It covers an area of {{convert|62|ha}}. The power station has a capacity of 26&amp;nbsp;megawatts and its annual output is 44&amp;nbsp;GWh, equivalent to supply electricity to 13,000&amp;nbsp;households.

The project was developed and constructed by Gestamp Solar. It was later acquired by FRV. The power station cost nearly €200&amp;nbsp;million and it was commissioned in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exenewable.com/projectProfile.asp?id=12611 eXenewable Project Profile Page - Fuente Alamo, PV, Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate and energy policy ==
Wagner was an economist at the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] from 2008 to 2014 and lead senior economist from 2014 to 2016.&lt;ref name="yaleclimateconnection" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=The American South Will Bear the Worst of Climate Change’s Costs|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/global-warming-american-south/532200/|work=The Atlantic|date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there he was a member of the faculty of the [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University]], and he wrote ''Climate Shock'' (2015), a book emphasizing the importance of risk and uncertainty for prompting action on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heal|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Economics of the Climate|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=2017|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1046–1063|doi=10.1257/jel.20151335|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20151335|issn=0022-0515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/what-if-climate-scientists-are-guessing-wrong.html|title=What If Climate Scientists Are Guessing Wrong?|last=Chait|first=Jonathan|work=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Pilita|title=‘Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet’, by Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bc2016e2-d320-11e4-9b0a-00144feab7de|work=Financial Times|date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner was a member of the six-person lead author team, including [[Suzi Kerr]], that wrote the [[World Bank]]'s [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23874 Emissions Trading in Practice : A Handbook on Design and Implementation].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Partnership for Market Readiness |last2=International Carbon Action Partnership |title=Emissions Trading in Practice |date=2016 |publisher=World Bank |location=Washington, DC |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Risk" and "uncertainty" in climate change are often mentioned as reasons to delay action. Wagner's ''Climate Shock'', joint with [[Martin Weitzman]], emphasizes that the "known unknowns" and potential "unknown unknowns" instead increase the need for action.&lt;ref name="yaleclimateconnection" /&gt; This contrasts with work done, for example, by economists [[William Nordhaus|Bill Nordhaus]], [[Richard Tol]], and others. Nordhaus, in turn, favorably reviewed Wagner and Weitzman's book in the [[New York Review of Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nordhaus|first1=William D.|title=A New Solution: The Climate Club|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/06/04/new-solution-climate-club/|work=The New York Review of Books|date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's latest academic work on this topic, joint with Kent Daniel of [[Columbia University]] and [[Robert Litterman|Bob Litterman]] of Kepos Capital further emphasizes the importance of pricing climate risk and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The High Cost of Climate Uncertainty|url=http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/node/1718|accessdate=20 December 2017|work=Ideas &amp; Insights|publisher=Columbia Business School|date=3 February 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geoengineering ==
Wagner is the co-director, joint with [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]], of Harvard's Solar Geoengineering Research Program founded in 2017.&lt;ref name="yaleclimateconnection" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=What Happens If We Start Solar Geo-Engineering—and Then Suddenly Stop?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/what-happens-if-we-start-geo-engineeringand-then-suddenly-stop/551354/|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scharping|first1=Daniel|title=A Geoengineered Future Is Downright Scary|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2017/12/13/geoengineering-climate-dont-do-it|accessdate=2017-12-19|publisher=Discover Magazine|date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramachandran|first1=Akshitha|title=Harvard Researchers Launch Solar Geoengineering Moonshot|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/4/17/solar-geoengineering-program-launch/|accessdate=19 December 2017|work=www.thecrimson.com|publisher=The Harvard Crimson|date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His geoengineering research focuses on economics, governance, policy, and public perception, including the [[chemtrails conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beaumont|first1=Hilary|title=Chemtrails conspiracy theorists are sending death threats to climate scientists|url=https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/mb99mp/chemtrails-arent-real-say-harvard-scientists-trying-to-fight-climate-change|work=VICE News|date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Dustin Tingley, Wagner finds that in a U.S. public opinion survey conducted in October 2016, 30 to 40% of the U.S. public believed in a version of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tingley|first1=Dustin|last2=Wagner|first2=Gernot|title=Solar geoengineering and the chemtrails conspiracy on social media|journal=Palgrave Communications|date=31 October 2017|volume=3|doi=10.1057/s41599-017-0014-3|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0014-3|issn=2055-1045}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also describes what the authors call a "community of conspiracy" in online discourse, in particular on Twitter and other anonymous social media.

On November 23rd, 2018, Wagner published an open-access article on "Stratospheric aerosol injection tactics and costs in the first 15 years of deployment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Wake |last2=Wagner |first2=Gernot |title=Stratospheric aerosol injection tactics and costs in the first 15 years of deployment |journal=Environmental Research Letters |date=2018 |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=124001 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aae98d |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aae98d/meta |language=en |issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carrington |first1=Damian |title=Solar geoengineering could be ‘remarkably inexpensive’ – report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/23/solar-geoengineering-could-be-remarkably-inexpensive-report?CMP=share_btn_tw |work=the Guardian |date=23 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was picked up in a questionable report by [[CNN]], claiming that: "Scientists are proposing an ingenious but as-yet-unproven way to tackle climate change: spraying sun-dimming chemicals into the Earth's atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Matthew |title=Dimming the sun: The answer to global warming? |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/23/health/sun-dimming-aerosols-global-warming-intl-scli/index.html |work=CNN |date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gommateshwara Statue''' ಗೊಮ್ಮಟೇಶ್ವರ is a {{convert|57|ft|m|adj=on}} high [[monolithic architecture|monolithic]] statue located on [[Vindhyagiri_Hill|Vindyagiri]] at [[Shravanbelagola]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Karnataka]]. Vindyagiri Hill is one of the two hills in Shravanabelagola; the other is [[Chandragiri_hill|Chandragiri]], which is also a seat of several ancient Jain centers, much older than Gommateshwara statue.

The Gommateshwara statue is dedicated to the [[Jain god]] [[Bahubali]]. It was built around 983 A.D. and is one of the largest free standing statues in the world.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=212}} The construction of the statue was commissioned by the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] minister and commander, [[Chavundaraya]]. Neighboring areas have [[Jain temple]]s known as ''basadis'' and several images of the [[Tirthankara]]s. Chandragiri is dedicated to the Jain God Bharat, the brother of Bahubali and the son of the first tirthankara Adinatha.

One can have a beautiful view of the surrounding areas from the top of the hill. An event known as [[Mahamastakabhisheka]] attracts devotees from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hassan.nic.in/htmls/sbelagola2.htm Official website Hassan District]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahamastakabhisheka festival is held once in 12 years, when the Gommateshwara statue is anointed with milk, saffron, ghee, sugarcane juice (ishukrasa) etc. from the top of the statue  [[Heinrich Zimmer]] attributed this anointment as the reason for the statue's freshness.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=212}} The next abhisheka will be in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Mahamastakabhisheka-to-be-held-in-February-2018/article16444944.ece|title=Mahamastakabhisheka to be held in February 2018|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the statue was voted as the first of Seven Wonders of India in a ''[[Times of India]]'' poll; 49% of the total votes went in favor of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2256323.cms |title=And India's 7 wonders are... |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date= August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
[[File:Shravanbelgola_Gomateshvara_head_and_torso.jpg|thumb|[[Mahamastakabhisheka]] at Shravanabelagola ]]
The statue depicts the prolonged meditation of ''Bahubali''. The motionless contemplation in [[kayotsarga]] (standing still) posture led to the growth of climbing vines around his legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Risabha Deva - The Founder of Jainism|first=Champat Rai|last=Jain|publisher=K. Mitra, Indian Press|location=[[Allahabad]]|year=1929|url=https://archive.org/details/RisabhaDeva-TheFounderOfJainism|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Gommateshwara has curly hair ringlets and large ears. The eyes are open as if he is viewing the world with detachment. His facial features are perfectly chiseled with a faint touch of a smile at the corner of the lips that embodies a calm inner peace and vitality. His shoulders are broad, the arms stretch straight down and the figure has no support from the thigh upwards.

There is an anthill in the background which signifies his incessant penance. From this anthill, emerge a snake and a creeper which twine around both the legs and arms culminating as a cluster of flowers and berries at the upper portion of the arms. The entire figure stands on an open lotus signifying the totality attained in installing this unique statue. On either side of Gommateshwara stand two tall and majestic chauri bearers in the service of the Lord. One of them is a yaksh and the other one is a yakshini. These richly ornamented and beautifully carved figures complement the main figure. Carved on the rear side of the anthill is also a trough for collecting water and other ritual ingredients used for the sacred bath of the statue.

In the introduction to his English translation of the ''[[Gommatsāra]]'', J. L. Jaini writes:{{cquote|The grandeur of the Image, as also its serene-looking and peace-inspiring presence, are well-known to all Jainas and non-Jainas who have the good fortune of visiting it. When I visited the sacred place in 1910, I met some English men and women missionaries, who out of respect for the Holy Image took off their shoes and visited it on their bare feet. They also held the opinion which I have given above. The Image is about 57 feet high; even so, every limb and minor limb thereof is in exquisite proportion. It is impossible to convey its glory and artistic excellence by words. Anyone who has a chance to see it personally will easily agree with the hitherto general opinion. This gives an answer to some critics also who call the Jainas idolatrous. The Jainas do not worship the stone, silver, gold or diamond of which the Images are made. They worship the qualities of total renunciation of the world, the acquisition of undisturbable Harmony with the Infinite, and the identity of the liberated soul with peace everlasting, which these images represent.{{sfn|Jaini|1927|p=7-8}}

[[File:Cs heater.gif|thumb|Some other symbols used for heater-coils or heating elements]]

A '''heating element''' converts electrical energy into heat through the process of resistive or [[Joule heating]]. [[Electric current]] passing through the element encounters [[electrical resistance|resistance]], resulting in heating of the element. Unlike the [[Peltier effect]], this process is independent of the direction of current flow.

== Metal heating elements ==
[[File:Tubular heating element 3.png|left|thumb|Tubular heating element]]
[[File:Heizstab-heatingelement-espressomachine.jpg|thumb|A folded tubular heating element from an [[espresso]] machine]]
* [[Nichrome]]: Most heating elements use nichrome 80/20 (80% [[nickel]], 20% [[chromium]]) wire, ribbon, or strip. Nichrome 80/20 is an ideal material, because it has relatively high resistance and forms an adherent layer of [[chromium oxide]] when it is heated for the first time.  Material beneath this layer will not oxidize, preventing the wire from breaking or burning out.
[[File:Toaster-quartz element.JPG|thumb|A coiled heating element from an electric [[toaster]]]]
* Resistance wire: Metallic resistance heating elements may be wire or ribbon, straight or coiled. They are used in common heating devices like [[toaster]]s and [[blowdryer|hair dryers]], furnaces for industrial heating, floor heating, roof heating, pathway heating to melt snow, dryers, etc. The most common classes of materials used include:
** [[Kanthal (alloy)|Kanthal]] (FeCrAl) wires
** [[Cupronickel]] (CuNi) alloys for low temperature heating
* Etched foil: Etched foil elements are generally made from the same alloys as resistance wire elements, but are produced with a subtractive [[photo-etching]] process that starts with a continuous sheet of metal foil and ends with a complex resistance pattern.  These elements are commonly found in precision heating applications like medical diagnostics and aerospace.


* [[Molybdenum disilicide]] (MoSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) an intermetallic compound, a silicide of molybdenum, is a refractory ceramic primarily used in heating elements. It has moderate density, melting point 2030&amp;nbsp;°C, (3,686 degrees F)and is electrically conductive. At high temperatures it forms a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer of silicon dioxide, protecting it from further oxidation. The  application area includes [[glass industry]], [[ceramic sintering]], [[heat treatment furnaces]] and [[semiconductor]] diffusion [[furnace]]s.
* PTC ceramic elements: [[Positive temperature coefficient|PTC]] [[ceramic]] material is named for its positive thermal coefficient of resistance (i.e., resistance increases upon heating). While most ceramics have a ''negative'' coefficient, these materials (often [[barium titanate]] and [[lead titanate]] [[Composite material|composites]]) have a highly nonlinear thermal response, so that above a composition-dependent threshold temperature their resistance increases rapidly. This behaviour causes the material to act as its own [[thermostat]], since current passes when it is cool, and does not when it is hot. [[Thin film]]s of this material are used in automotive rear-window defrost heaters, and honeycomb-shaped elements are used in more expensive [[hair dryer]]s and [[space heating|space heaters]].

== Polymer PTC heating elements ==
[[File:Standard zpi medium.jpg|thumb|A flexible PTC heater made of conductive rubber]]
Resistive heaters can be made of conducting [[PTC rubber]] materials where the [[resistivity]] increases exponentially with increasing temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|country=US|number=6,734,250|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a heater will produce high power when it is cold, and rapidly heat up itself to a constant temperature. Due to the exponentially increasing resistivity, the heater can never heat itself to warmer than this temperature. Above this temperature, the rubber acts as an electrical insulator. The temperature can be chosen during the production of the rubber. Typical temperatures are between {{convert|0|and|80|C|F}}.

It is a point-wise [[self-regulating heater]] and [[self-limiting heater]]. Self-regulating means that every point of the heater independently keeps a constant temperature without the need of regulating electronics. Self-limiting means that the heater can never exceed a certain temperature in any point and requires no overheat protection.

== Composite heating elements ==
[[File:Sheathed element cross section.JPG|thumbnail|right|sheathed element cut off cross section]]
* Tubular (sheathed) elements normally comprise a fine coil of nichrome (NiCr) resistance heating alloy wire, that is located in a metallic tube (of stainless steel alloys, such as [[Incoloy]], or copper) and insulated by [[magnesium oxide]] powder.  To keep moisture out of the [[hygroscopic]] insulator, the ends are equipped with beads of insulating material such as ceramic or silicone rubber, or a combination of both.  The tube is [[Wire drawing|drawn through a die]] to compress the powder and maximize heat transmission.  These can be a straight rod (as in [[toaster oven]]s) or bent to a shape to span an area to be heated (such as in [[electric stove]]s, [[oven]]s, and [[coffee maker]]s).
* [[Screen printing|Screen-printed]] metal–ceramic tracks deposited on ceramic insulated metal (generally steel) plates have found widespread application as elements in kettles and other domestic appliances since the mid-1990s.
* Radiative heating elements (heat lamps): A high-powered [[incandescent lamp]] usually run at less than maximum power to radiate mostly [[infrared]] instead of [[Visible spectrum|visible light]]. These are usually found in [[radiant heating|radiant space heaters]] and food warmers, taking either a long, tubular form or an ''R40''&lt;!-- What do Europeans call this shape? --&gt; reflector-lamp form. The reflector lamp style is often tinted red to minimize the visible light produced; the tubular form comes in different formats:
** Gold coated - Made famous by the patented Phillips Helen lamp.  A gold [[dichroic]] film is deposited on the inside that reduces the visible light and allows most of the short and medium wave infrared through.  Mainly for heating people. A number of manufacturers now manufacture these lamps and they improve constantly.
** Ruby coated - Same function as the gold-coated lamps, but at a fraction of the cost. The visible glare is much higher than the gold variant.
** Clear - No coating and mainly used in production processes.
* Removable ceramic core elements use a coiled resistance heating alloy wire threaded through one or more cylindrical ceramic segments to make a required length (related to output), with or without a centre rod. Inserted into a metal sheath or tube sealed at one end, this type of element allows replacement or repair without breaking into the process involved, usually fluid heating under pressure.

== Combination heating element systems ==
* [[Thick film technology]]: Heating elements for high-temperature [[furnace]]s are often made of exotic materials, including [[platinum]],  [[molybdenum disilicide|tungsten molybdenum disilicide]], [[molybdenum]] ([[vacuum furnace]]s) and [[silicon carbide]]. Silicon carbide [[igniter]]s are common in gas ovens. [[Laser]] heaters are also being used for achieving high temperatures in thick film technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rashidian Vaziri et al.|first1=M R|title=New raster-scanned CO2 laser heater for pulsed laser deposition applications: design and modeling for homogenous substrate heating|journal=Optical Engineering|volume=51|issue=4|page=044301|doi=10.1117/1.OE.51.4.044301|url=http://opticalengineering.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1183406|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215507/http://opticalengineering.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1183406|archivedate=2016-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viruses are a major cause of human waterborne and water-related diseases.''' Waterborne diseases are caused by water that is contaminated by human and animal urine and feces that contain [[pathogenic bacteria|pathogenic]] [[microorganism]]s. A subject can get infected through contact with or consumption of the contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Waterborne diseases]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virus]]es affect all living organisms from single cellular plants, bacteria and animal to the highest forms of plants and animals including human beings. Viruses can interact with their host through several methods and mechanisms; some viruses can be host specific ([[HIV]]) and some can be less host specific ([[influenza]]) viruses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virus]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Different viruses can have different routes of transmission; for example, HIV is directly transferred by contaminated body fluids from an infected host into the tissue or bloodstream of a new host while influenza is airborne and transmitted through inhalation of contaminated air containing viral particles by a new host. Enteric viruses primarily infect the intestinal tract through ingestion of food and water contaminated with viruses of fecal origin. Some viruses can be transmitted through all three routes of transmission.

Water virology started about half a century ago when scientists attempted to detect the [[polio]] virus in water samples.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;  Since then, other pathogenic viruses that are responsible for gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and many other virus strains have replaced enteroviruses as the main aim for detection in the water environment.&lt;ref name="Book Ref"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosch|first=edited by Albert|title=Human viruses in water|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080553276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Major outbreaks===
Water virology was born after a large hepatitis outbreak transmitted through water was confirmed in New Delhi between December 1955 and January 1956.&lt;ref name=mini38 /&gt;

Viruses can cause massive human mortality. [[Smallpox|The smallpox virus]] killed an estimated 10 to 15 million human beings per year until 1967.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;  Smallpox was finally eliminated in 1977 by extinction of the virus through vaccination, and the impact of viruses such as influenza, poliomyelitis and measles are mainly controlled by vaccination.&lt;ref name=mini38&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosch|first=Albert|title=Human enteric viruses in the water environment: a minireview|url=http://revistes.iec.cat/index.php/IM/article/viewFile/4c3da6fc9be69.002/38|newspaper=INTERNATL MICROBIOL|date=27 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite advances in vaccination and prevention of viral diseases, it is estimated that in the 1980s a child died approximately every six seconds from diarrhea confirmed by WHO.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|last=WHO|first=world health organisation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/en/|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases of hepatitis A and/or E, both of which are enteric viruses, are typically transmitted by food and water. Extreme examples include the outbreak of 300,000 cases of hepatitis A and 25,000 cases of gastroenteritis in 1988 in Shanghai caused by shellfish harvested from a sewage polluted estuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Israel Potasman,  Alona Paz and Majed Odeh|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2002|volume=35|issue=8|pages=921–928|doi=10.1086/342330|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/8/921.full|pmid=12355378|title=Infectious Outbreaks Associated with Bivalve Shellfish Consumption: A Worldwide Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, an outbreak of 79,000 cases of hepatitis E in Kanpur was ascribed to drinking polluted water.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;

A more recent outbreak of Hepatitis E in South Sudan killed 88 people. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it had treated almost 4,000 patients since the outbreak was identified in South Sudan in July 2012. In this outbreak, [[Hepatitis E]], which causes liver infections, and was thought to be spread by drinking water contaminated with feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Hereward|title=Hepatitis outbreak kills 88 in South Sudan: aid agency|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/02/us-southsudan-hepatitis-idUSBRE91108520130202|date=Feb 2, 2013|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viruses present in water==
Sewage contaminated water contains many viruses, over one hundred species are reported and can lead to diseases that affect human beings. For example, [[hepatitis]], [[gastroenteritis]], [[meningitis]], [[fever]], [[rash]], and [[conjunctivitis]] can all be spread through contaminated water. More viruses are being discovered in water because of new detection and characterization methods, although only some of these viruses are human pathogens.&lt;ref name=mini38 /&gt;

==Virus survival in water==
Viruses need a suitable environment to survive in. There are many characteristics that control the survival of viruses in water such as temperature, light, pH, salinity, organic matter, suspended solids or sediments, and air–water interfaces.

===Temperature===

Temperature has the highest effect on virus’s survival in water since lower temperatures are the key to longer virus survival. The rate of protein, nucleic acid denaturation and chemical reactions that destroy the viral capsid are increased at higher temperatures, thus viruses will survive best at low temperatures. Hepatitis A, adenoviruses and parvoviruses have the highest survival rate in low temperatures amongst enteric viruses.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;

===Light===

Ultraviolet light (UV) is the light in sunlight and can inactivate viruses by causing cross-linking of the nucleotides in the viral genome. Many viruses in water are exterminated in the presence of sunlight. The combination of higher temperatures and more UV in the summer time corresponds to shorter viral survival in summer compared to winter. Double stranded DNA viruses like adenoviruses are more resistant to UV light inactivation than enteroviruses because they can use their host cell to repair the damage caused by the UV light.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;

Visible light can also affect virus survival by a process called photodynamic inactivation but the length and intensity of the light exposure can change the inactivation rate.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;

===pH===

The pH of most natural water is between 5-9. Enteric viruses are stable in these conditions. On the other hand, many enteric viruses are more stable at pH 3-5 than at pH 9 and 12. Enteroviruses can survive at pH 11-11.5 and 1-2, but for only short periods. Adenoviruses and rotaviruses are delicate to a pH of 10 or greater and leads to inactivation.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;

==Virus removal from water==

Water that is intended for drinking should go through some treatment to reduce pathogenic viral and bacterial concentrations. As the density of the human population has increased the incidence of sewage contamination of water has increased as well, thus the risk to humans from pathogenic viruses will increase if precautions are not taken.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;

Scientific studies suggest that the most common viruses found are caliciviruses, astroviruses and enteric viruses. Laboratories are still looking for improved methods to detect these pathogenic viruses. Reducing the amount of viruses in drinking water is accomplished by various treatments that are typically part of drinking water treatment systems in developed countries.&lt;ref name="Book Ref" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC treat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Treatment|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/water_treatment.html|publisher=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water purification]] of surface water (water from lakes, rivers, or reservoirs) typically utilizes four treatment stages: coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The first three stages remove mainly dirt and larger particles, although filtration does reduce the number of viruses and bacteria in the water the number of pathogens present after filtration is still considered too high for drinking water. Purification of water from underground aquifers, called ground water, may skip some of these steps as ground water tends to have fewer contaminants than surface water. The last step, disinfection, is primarily responsible for the reduction of pathogenic viruses to safe levels in all drinking water sources. The most common disinfectants used are chlorine and chloramine. Ozone and UV light can also be used to treat large volumes of water to remove pathogens.&lt;ref name="CDC treat" /&gt;

==Prevention of water viruses==
The quality of drinking water is ensured through a framework of water safety plans that ensures the safe disposal of human waste so that drinking water supplies are not contaminated. Improving the water supply, sanitation, hygiene and management of our water resources could prevent ten percent of total global disease.&lt;ref name=waterorg /&gt;

Half of the hospital beds occupied in the world are related to the lack of safe drinking water. Unsafe water leads to the 88% of the global cases of diarrhea and  90% of the deaths of diarreaheal diseases in children under five years old. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries due to poverty and the high cost of safe water.&lt;ref name=waterorg&gt;{{cite web|last=org|first=water|title=water facts disease|url=http://water.org/water-crisis/water-facts/disease/|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion people do not have access to improved water and 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion people do not have access to sanitation facilities. This situation leads to 2&amp;nbsp;million preventable deaths each year.&lt;ref name=who2&gt;{{cite web|last=WHO|first=worldhealt|title=water and sanitation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmpfinal.pdf|accessdate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hydraulic engine house''' &lt;!--({{gbmapping|ST588730}})--&gt; is part of the "[[Underfall Yard]]" in [[Bristol Harbour]] in [[Bristol]], [[England]].

The [[octagon]]al [[brick]] and [[terracotta]] [[chimney]] of the engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chimney of hydraulic engine house |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380745 |accessdate=2006-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015190206/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380745 |archivedate=2007-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the hydraulic engine house itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraulic engine house|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1202648|website=National Heritage List for England|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the original pumping house which is now [[Pump House, Bristol|The Pump House]] [[public house]]. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and originally contained two [[steam engine]]s made by the [[Worthington Corporation]]. These were compound surface condensing cylinders of {{convert|17.5|in}} diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Bertram M.H.|title=Handbook to Bristol and the Neighbourhood with Map (in Excursion Pamphlets):|date=2014|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9781483223094|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3DK0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=Hydraulic+engine+house+Bristol&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jvz2NANYue&amp;sig=pN-3j3N4EvARim-GL6CtdSenONw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoqs7W9rHOAhWHI8AKHcaXBm04ChDoAQgzMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=Hydraulic%20engine%20house%20Bristol&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were replaced in 1907 by the current machines from [[Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay]] of Paisley. It powered the docks' [[hydraulic]] system of cranes, bridges and locks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraulic engine house |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380746 |accessdate=2006-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422220311/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380746 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2010.

Water is pumped from the harbour to a header tank and then fed by gravity to the high pressure pumps, where it is pressurised thence raising the external [[hydraulic accumulator]]. This stores the hydraulic energy ensuring a smooth delivery of pressure and meaning that the pumps do not need to be running the whole time nor be capable of supplying the instantaneous peak demands. The working pressure is 750 lbs/square inch. The external accumulator was added about 1954 when the original inside the building's tower became difficult to service (but it remains in place). The building originally contained a pair of steam powered pumps &lt;ref&gt;Wallis,G,UNDERFALL YARD SURVEY of HISTORIC MACHINERY,http://www.gwconservation.com/page5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; however these were replaced with three electrically driven ones in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNeill|first1=Jeremy|title=Bristol's Harbourside: A Guide to the City Docks|date=1997|publisher=Hotwell|isbn=978-0953027002|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine house provided the power for equipment such as the lock gates and cranes until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol City Docks (post 1830s)|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=447|publisher=Engineerung Timelines|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Société d'énergie de la Baie James''' is the company in charge of building the hydroelectric development known as the [[James Bay Project]] in northern Quebec. It was established in December 1971 by the ''Société de développement de la Baie James'' (SDBJ), a Crown corporation of the province of Quebec and became a wholly owned subsididiary of [[Hydro-Québec]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SEBJ|1987|p=2|id=SEBJ1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In the summer of 1971, the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] passed [[Bill (law)|Bill]] 50, an Act establishing the Société de développement de la Baie James (SDBJ), a [[Government-owned corporation#Commonwealth|Crown corporation]] tasked with the development of natural resources as well as the general administration of the James Bay territory. The development of the hydroelectric potential was the focus of a newly created subsidiary (the SEBJ) with Hydro-Québec as a majority shareholder along with the SDBJ.&lt;ref name="SEBJ1987p1_2"&gt;{{harvnb|SEBJ|1987|pp=1–2 |id=SEBJ1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both corporations would be chaired by Pierre A. Nadeau, an insurance executive recruited by [[Robert Bourassa]]'s money man, Paul Desrochers.&lt;ref name="Bolduc2000p124"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolduc|2000|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of Bill 50 was controversial with Hydro-Québec's top executives, who felt the government tried to bypass the powerful [[public utility|utility]].&lt;ref name="Bolduc2000p128"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolduc|2000|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the party picking up the bill, Hydro wanted control over the development of the hydroelectric project. Commissioner [[Robert A. Boyd]], who was slated as the top Hydro-Québec executive and Nadeau's right-hand man at the SEBJ, first declined the appointment, explaining that with no background in public works, Nadeau would have little credibility with the [[engineer]]s running the operations.&lt;ref name="Bolduc2000p125"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolduc|2000|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict soon erupted between Hydro-Québec and Nadeau, who left less than a year after his appointment. He was replaced by Boyd, who kept informed of the latest development on the project by consulting with colleagues on the board on a daily basis.

&lt;!--
was founded as a consortium of three companies, [[Hydro-Québec]],[[SNC-Lavalin]], and [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel]], to build a series of [[hydroelectric dam]]s in northern [[Quebec]] during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Upon completion, the dams all came under the control of Hydro-Québec.

Professor '''James Blyth''' [[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Legum Doctor#United Kingdom|LLD]], [[FRSE]] [[FRSSA]] (4 April 1839&amp;nbsp;– 15 May 1906) was a Scottish [[electrical engineer]] and academic at Anderson's College, now the [[University of Strathclyde]], in [[Glasgow]]. He was a pioneer in the field of [[electricity generation]] through [[wind power]] and his [[wind turbine]], which was used to light his holiday home in [[Marykirk]], was the world's first-known structure by which electricity was generated from wind power. Blyth patented his design and later developed an improved model which served as an emergency power source at [[Sunnyside Royal Hospital|Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary &amp; Dispensary]] for the next 30 years. Although Blyth received recognition for his contributions to science, electricity generation by wind power was considered uneconomical and no more wind turbines were built in the United Kingdom until 1951, some 64 years after Blyth built his first prototype.

==Early life==
[[File:James Blyth's 1891 windmill.jpg|thumb|right|Blyth's "windmill" at his cottage in Marykirk in 1891]]
'''James Blyth''' was born in [[Marykirk]], Kincardineshire, on 4 April 1839 to John Blyth, an innkeeper and small farmer, and his wife Catherine.&lt;ref name="Strathclyde archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strath.ac.uk/archives/iotm/march2012/|title=Papers of James Blyth|last=Croll|first=Kirsteen|date=March 2012|work=University of Strathclyde archives|publisher=University of Strathclyde|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the Marykirk parish school and later, the [[Montrose Academy]]&lt;ref name="Courier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/Community/Heritage-and-History/article/2332/renewable-energy-and-role-of-marykirk-s-james-blyth.html |title=Renewable energy and role of Marykirk's James Blyth |last=Hardy |first=Chris |date=6 July 2010 |work=[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]] |publisher=D.

Blyth completed his Master of Arts in 1871&lt;ref name="Strathclyde people"/&gt; and in the same year married Jesse Wilhelmena Taylor at the United Presbyterian Church in Athol Place, Edinburgh. They had two sons and five daughters, two of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1880 Blyth was appointed Freeland Professor of Natural Philosophy at Anderson's College, Glasgow, which became the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College in 1886.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.strath.ac.uk/information/history/index.php|title=James Blyth 1880–1906|last=Anon|work=Former Professors of Natural Philosophy in the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College (founded in 1886)|publisher=University of Strathclyde|accessdate=12 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717201457/http://phys.strath.ac.uk/information/history/index.php|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst teaching at the technical college he pursued an active research programme with a particular interest in the generation and storage of electricity from wind power.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Blyth was liked by his students and colleagues who admired his hard working nature, down-to-earth attitude and willingness to roll up his sleeves. He was also well known in the local community through a series of popular lectures and demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Strathclyde people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strath.ac.uk/media/ps/comms/itallstartedhere/Blyth.pdf|title=It started here: No.9 Wind Power|last=Anon|work=Strathclyde people|publisher=University of Strathclyde|accessdate=16 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129111424/http://www.strath.ac.uk/media/ps/comms/itallstartedhere/Blyth.pdf|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1887 Blyth built a cloth-sailed wind turbine (or "windmill") in the garden of his holiday cottage in Marykirk and used the electricity it produced to charge [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]]; the stored electricity was used to power the lights in his cottage, which thus became the first house in the world to be powered by wind-generated electricity.&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt;
In a paper delivered to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow on 2 May 1888, Blyth described the wind turbine as being "of a tripod design, with a 33-foot windshaft, four arms of 13&amp;nbsp;feet with canvas sails, and a Burgin dynamo driven from the flywheel using a rope".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; The turbine produced enough power to light ten 25-volt bulbs in a "moderate breeze" and could even be used to power a small lathe.&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt;
[[File:James blythe turbine.jpg|thumb|right|The 1895 turbine built for the Montrose Lunatic Asylum]]
Over the next few years Blyth experimented with a number of different designs.&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; The final design operated for the next 25 years and produced surplus electricity which Blyth offered to the people of Marykirk to light the main street of the town. But his offer was rejected, as the people thought electricity was "the work of The Devil".&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt; Blyth was awarded a UK patent for his "wind engine" in November 1891.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In 1895 he licensed the Glasgow engineering company, Mavor and Coulson,&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; to build a second, improved turbine, which was used to supply emergency power to the Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]];&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt; the system operated successfully for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Making Scotland's landscape: The Climate  Presented by Professor Iain Stewart, Producer Michael Burke, Director Colin Murray, BBC Scotland Television screened 11 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Blyth's original wind generator was the first known structure by which electricity was generated from wind power, but its lack of a braking mechanism meant it was prone to damage in strong winds.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In the winter of 1887, some months after Blyth's first wind generator was built, American, [[Charles F. Brush]] built the first automatically operated wind turbine. The design of Brush's machine allowed it to be shut down manually to protect it from wind damage.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; The improved design of the turbine built for the Montrose Lunatic Asylum (which was based on [[John Thomas Romney Robinson|Thomas Robinson's]] [[anemometer]] design) went some way towards solving this problem but it could not be guaranteed to stall in very strong winds.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1891 Blyth presented a paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh espousing his belief in the benefits of renewable energy sources, particularly wind but also wave energy.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Later that year he was awarded the Brisbane Gold Medal by the [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts]] for his work in producing electrical energy from wind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/scotlandoffice/12883.html|title=Secretary of State for Scotland: Scotland Office / Royal Society of Edinburgh Climate Change Seminar|last=Secretetary of State for Scotland|publisher=Crown copyright|accessdate=12 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308090635/http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/scotlandoffice/12883.html|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his wind turbine was not considered to be economically viable.&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt;

Blyth's other research interests included the relative efficiency of different forms of lighting, telephone communication, and microphones; he also contributed entries on a number of topics for the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Later life and death==
Blyth's son, Vincent James (1874–1916), and his son-in-law, George Edwin Allan (1870–1955), both became demonstrators, assistants and lecturers in the Department of Natural Philosophy.&lt;ref name="Strathclyde archives"/&gt; Blyth himself was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He died from [[apoplexy]] at his home in Glasgow on 15 May 1906.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; His friend Dr. James Colville remembered him as "a true man of science...one who by insight, patient toil, and mechanical ingenuity did much in his day to explain and illustrate many of the facts of physical science."&lt;ref name="Strathclyde people"/&gt;

==Legacy==
''The Professor James Blyth Memorial Committee'', composed of Blyth's former students and associates, was established in March 1907 to raise funds for a memorial to him. The memorial eventually took the form of endowing the Blyth Memorial Prizes, and erecting a wall plaque in the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ica-atom.org/strathclyde/glasgow-and-west-of-scotland-technical-college-professor-james-blyth-memorial-committee;isaar|title=Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College – Professor James Blyth Memorial Committee |last=Short|first=Lindsey|author2=Peters, Victoria|work=University of Strathclyde archives|publisher=Universityof Strathclyde|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbine at Montrose Asylum was dismantled in 1914. Britain's first public utility wind turbine did not come into operation until 1951, when a prototype turbine built by [[John Brown Engineering]] of Glasgow was installed at [[Costa Head]], Orkney.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18575">'''Jellium''', also known as the '''uniform electron gas''' ('''UEG''') or '''homogeneous electron gas''' ('''HEG'''), is a [[quantum mechanical]] model of interacting [[electron]]s in a solid where the [[positive charge]]s (i.e. atomic nuclei) are assumed to be uniformly distributed in space whence the electron density
is a uniform quantity as well in space.  This model allows one to focus on the effects in solids that
occur due to the quantum nature of electrons and their mutual repulsive interactions (due to like charge)
without explicit introduction of the atomic lattice and structure making up a real material. Jellium is often used in [[solid-state physics]] as a simple model of delocalized electrons in a metal, where it can qualitatively reproduce features of real metals such as [[Electric field screening|screening]], [[plasmon]]s, [[Wigner crystal]]lization and [[Friedel oscillation]]s.

At [[zero temperature]], the properties of jellium depend solely upon the constant [[electronic density]]. This lends it to a treatment within [[density functional theory]]; the formalism itself provides the basis for the [[local-density approximation]] to the exchange-correlation energy density functional.

The term ''jellium'' was coined by [[Conyers Herring]], alluding to the "positive jelly" background, and the typical metallic behavior it displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/posc.2006.14.4.457|last=Hughes|first=R.

==Hamiltonian==

The jellium model treats the electron-electron coupling rigorously. The artificial and structureless background charge interacts electrostatically with itself and the electrons. The jellium [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for ''N''-electrons confined within a volume of space Ω, and with [[electronic density]] ''ρ''('''r''') and (constant) background charge density ''n''('''R''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''/Ω is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=E.

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\mathrm{el}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{back}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{el-back}},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

*''H''&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; is the electronic Hamiltonian consisting of the kinetic and electron-electron repulsion terms:
::&lt;math&gt; \hat{H}_{\mathrm{el}}=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{p_{i}^2}{2m}+\sum_{i&lt;j}^N\frac{e^2}{|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|}&lt;/math&gt;
*''H''&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt; is the Hamiltonian of the positive background charge interacting [[electrostatic]]ally with itself:
::&lt;math&gt; \hat{H}_{\mathrm{back}}=\frac{e^2}{2}\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}'\ \frac{n(\mathbf{R})n(\mathbf{R}')}{|\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{R}'|} = \frac{e^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{N}{\Omega}\right)^{2}\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}'\ \frac{1}{|\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{R}'|}&lt;/math&gt;
*''H''&lt;sub&gt;el-back&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron-background interaction Hamiltonian, again an electrostatic interaction:
::&lt;math&gt; \hat{H}_{\mathrm{el-back}}=\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}\ \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r})n(\mathbf{R})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}|} = -e^{2}\frac{N}{\Omega}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}\ \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{R}|}&lt;/math&gt;

''H''&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant and, in the limit of an infinite volume, divergent along with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;el-back&lt;/sub&gt;. The divergence is canceled by a term from the electron-electron coupling: the background interactions cancel and the system is dominated by the kinetic energy and coupling of the electrons. Such analysis is done in Fourier space; the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian which remain correspond to the Fourier expansion of the electron coupling for which '''q'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''0'''.

==Contributions to the total energy==

The traditional way to study the electron gas is to start with non-interacting electrons which are governed only by the kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian, also called a [[Fermi gas]].  The kinetic energy per electron is given by
: &lt;math&gt; KE = \frac{3}{5} E_F = \frac{3}{5}\frac{\hbar ^2k_F^2}{2m_e} = \frac{3}{5}\biggl(\frac{9\pi}{4}\biggr)^{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{1}{(r_s / a_0)^2} \textrm{Ry} \approx \frac{2.21}{(r_s / a_0)^2} \textrm{Ry} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; E_F&lt;/math&gt; is the Fermi energy, &lt;math&gt; k_F &lt;/math&gt; is the Fermi wave vector, and the last expression shows the dependence on the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]] &lt;math&gt; r_s &lt;/math&gt; where energy is measured in [[Rydberg constant|Rydbergs]].

Without doing much work, one can guess that the electron-electron interactions will scale like the inverse of the average electron-electron separation and hence as &lt;math&gt; 1/r_{12} &lt;/math&gt; (since the Coulomb interaction goes like one over distance between charges) so that if we view the interactions as a small correction to the kinetic energy, we are describing the limit of small &lt;math&gt; r_s &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;1/r_s^2&lt;/math&gt; being larger than &lt;math&gt;1/r_s&lt;/math&gt;) and hence high electron density.  Unfortunately, real metals typically have &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; between 2-5 which means this picture needs serious revision.

The first correction to the [[free electron model]] for jelium is from the [[Hartree–Fock method|Fock exchange]] contribution to electron-electron interactions.  Adding this in, one has a total energy of
: &lt;math&gt; E = \frac{2.21}{r_s^2} - \frac{0.916}{r_s}&lt;/math&gt;
where the negative term is due to exchange:  exchange interactions lower the total energy.  Higher order
corrections to the total energy are due to [[Electronic correlation|electron correlation]] and if one
decides to work in a series for small &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;, one finds
: &lt;math&gt; E = \frac{2.21}{r_s^2} - \frac{0.916}{r_s}  + 0.0622 \ln (r_s) - 0.096 + O(r_s)&lt;/math&gt;
The series is quite accurate for small &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; but of dubious value for &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; values found in actual metals.

For the full range of &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;, Chachiyo's correlation energy density can be used as the higher order correction. In this case,
: &lt;math&gt; E = \frac{2.21}{r_s^2} - \frac{0.916}{r_s}  +  a \ln \left( 1  + \frac{b}{r_s} + \frac{b}{r_s^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Simple and accurate uniform electron gas correlation energy for the full range of densities | author = Teepanis Chachiyo | journal = J. Chem. Phys. | volume = 145 | pages = 021101 | year = 2016 | doi = 10.1063/1.4958669 | pmid = 27421388 | issue = 2| bibcode = 2016JChPh.145b1101C }}&lt;/ref&gt; which agrees quite well (on the order of milli-Hartree) with the Quantum Monte Carlo simulation.

== Zero-temperature phase diagram of jellium in three and two dimensions ==

The physics of the zero-temperature phase behavior of jellium is driven by competition between the kinetic energy of the electrons and the electron-electron interaction energy.  The kinetic-energy operator in the Hamiltonian scales as &lt;math&gt;1/r_s^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]], whereas the interaction energy operator scales as &lt;math&gt;1/r_s&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence the kinetic energy dominates at high density (small &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;), while the interaction energy dominates at low density (large &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;).

The limit of high density is where jellium most resembles a [[Fermi gas|noninteracting free electron gas]].  To minimize the kinetic energy, the single-electron states are delocalized plane waves, with the lowest-momentum plane-wave states being doubly occupied by spin-up and spin-down electrons, giving a [[paramagnetic]] Fermi fluid.

At lower densities, where the interaction energy is more important, it is energetically advantageous for the electron gas to spin-polarize (i.e., to have an imbalance in the number of spin-up and spin-down electrons), resulting in a [[ferromagnetic]] Fermi fluid. This phenomenon is known as ''itinerant ferromagnetism''.  At sufficiently low density, the kinetic-energy penalty resulting from the need to occupy higher-momentum plane-wave states is more than offset by the reduction in the interaction energy due to the fact that exchange effects keep indistinguishable electrons away from one another.

A further reduction in the interaction energy (at the expense of kinetic energy) can be achieved by localizing the electron orbitals.  As a result, jellium at zero temperature at a sufficiently low density will form a so-called [[Wigner crystal]], in which the single-particle orbitals are of approximately Gaussian form centered on crystal lattice sites.  Once a Wigner crystal has formed, there may in principle be further phase transitions between different crystal structures and between different magnetic states for the Wigner crystals (e.g., antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic spin configurations) as the density is lowered.  When Wigner crystallization occurs, jellium acquires a [[band gap]].

Within [[Hartree-Fock]] theory, the ferromagnetic fluid abruptly becomes more stable than the paramagnetic fluid at a density parameter of &lt;math&gt;r_s=5.45&lt;/math&gt; in three dimensions (3D) and &lt;math&gt;2.01&lt;/math&gt; in two dimensions (2D).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giuliani|first=Gabriele|author2=Vignale |author3=Giovanni |title=Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-82112-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Hartree-Fock theory, Wigner crystallization occurs at &lt;math&gt;r_s=4.5&lt;/math&gt; in 3D and &lt;math&gt;1.44&lt;/math&gt; in 2D, so that jellium would crystallise before itinerant ferromagnetism occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J.

[[Quantum Monte Carlo]] (QMC) methods, which provide an explicit treatment of electron correlation effects, are generally agreed to provide the most accurate quantitative approach for determining the zero-temperature phase diagram of jellium.  The first application of the [[diffusion Monte Carlo]] method was Ceperley and Alder's famous 1980 calculation of the zero-temperature phase diagram of 3D jellium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D.

==Applications==

Jellium is the simplest model of interacting electrons. It is employed in the calculation of properties of metals, where the [[core electron]]s and the nuclei are modeled as the uniform positive background and the [[valence electron]]s are treated with full rigor. Semi-infinite jellium slabs are used to investigate surface properties such as [[work function]] and surface effects such as [[adsorption]]; near surfaces the electronic density varies in an oscillatory manner, decaying to a constant value in the bulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=N.

Within [[density functional theory]], jellium is used in the construction of the [[local-density approximation]], which in turn is a component of more sophisticated exchange-correlation energy functionals. From [[quantum Monte Carlo]] calculations of jellium, accurate values of the correlation energy density have been obtained for several values of the electronic density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ground State of the Electron Gas by a Stochastic Method |author1=D.

The jellium model has been applied to [[superatoms]], and used in [[nuclear physics]].

'''Joseph Neng Shun Kwong''' (October 28, 1916 – January 4, 1998) was a [[chemical engineer]], most famous for his role in the development of the [[Redlich–Kwong equation of state]].

==Biography==
Joseph Kwong was born in Chung Won, China in 1916, and emigrated to the United States as a child with his family.  Kwong earned a bachelor's degree in 1937 from [[Stanford University]] in chemistry and basic medical sciences.  He then earned a Master of Science degree in Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering at the [[University of Michigan]], and was awarded a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota in 1942.&lt;ref name = "one"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reif-Acherman |first1=Simón |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Joseph Neng Shun Kwong: A Famous and Obscure Scientist |journal=Quim. Nova. |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=1909–1911 |doi=10.1590/S0100-40422008000700054  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwong worked as a chemical engineer at Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. (later [[3M]]) from 1942 to 1944, helping to develop adhesive products.  In 1944, Kwong began working at the [[Shell Development Emeryville|Shell Development Company]] in California.  During his time at Shell, Kwong met [[Otto Redlich]], a physical chemist who had fled his native Austria to the United States in 1938 as the [[Nazi]]s took power.  The two presented a paper in 1948 describing what is now known as the [[Redlich–Kwong equation of state]], which related the pressure, volume, and temperature of different compounds.&lt;ref name = "two"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Redlich |first1=Otto |last2=Kwong |first2=J.

Rev. |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=233–244 |doi= 10.1021/cr60137a013|pmid=18125401}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kwong returned to 3M in 1951 as a senior chemical engineer in the Chemical Division, working there until retirement in 1980, at the age of 64.  The development of the Redlich-Kwong equation was the last significant theoretical treatment of thermodynamics.  He died of pneumonia in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on January 4, 1998, at the age of 81.

'''Kryptonite''' is a material that appears primarily in [[Superman]] stories. In its most well-known form, it is a green, crystalline material that emits a peculiar radiation that weakens and sickens Superman, but is generally harmless to humans when exposed to it in short term. However, when it gets into their bloodstream it can poison them. There are other varieties of kryptonite such as red and gold kryptonite which have different but still generally negative effects on Superman. Due to Superman's popularity ''kryptonite'' has become a byword for an extraordinary weakness, synonymous with "[[Achilles' heel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horton|first1=Andrew|last2=McDougal|first2=Stuart Y.|last3=Braudy|first3=Leo|title=Play it Again, Sam: Retakes on Remakes|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0520205936|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Kryptonite poisoning.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The character [[Superman]] suffering from kryptonite poisoning, courtesy of villains [[Metallo]] and [[Titano]].&lt;br/&gt;''[[Action Comics]] Annual'' #10 (March 2007). Art by [[Art Adams]] and [[Alex Sinclair]].]]
An unpublished 1940 story titled "[[The K-Metal from Krypton]]", written by Superman creator [[Jerry Siegel]], featured a prototype of kryptonite. It was a mineral from the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] that drained Superman of his strength while giving superhuman powers to mortals. This story was rejected because in it Superman reveals his identity to Lois.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Gerard|title=Men Of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book|date=2004|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0465036562|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mineral known as kryptonite was introduced in the radio serial [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|''The Adventures of Superman'']], in the story "The Meteor from Krypton", broadcast in June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayde |first=Michael J. |year=2009 |title=Flights of Fantasy: The Unauthorized but True Story of Radio &amp; TV's Adventures of Superman |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=9781593933449 |ref=harv}}&lt;br/&gt;"Only one arc in 1943 managed to transcend its era: "The Meteor from Krypton." Debuting on June 3, it marked the debut of kryptonite..."&lt;/ref&gt; An apocryphal story claims that kryptonite was introduced to give Superman's voice actor, [[Bud Collyer]], the possibility to take a vacation at a time when the radio serial was performed live. In an episode where Collyer would not be present to perform, Superman would be incapacitated by kryptonite, and a substitute voice actor would make groaning sounds. This tale was recounted by [[Julius Schwartz]] in his memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Schwartz |first=Julius |title=Man of Two Worlds: My Life in Science Fiction and Comics |year=2000 |publisher=HarperEntertainment |isbn=0-380-81051-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;br/&gt;pg 132-133&lt;/ref&gt; However, the historian Michael J. Hayde disputes this: in "The Meteor From Krypton", Superman is never exposed to kryptonite. If kryptonite allowed Collyer to take vacations, that was a fringe benefit discovered later. More likely, kryptonite was introduced as a plot device for Superman to discover his origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayde |first=Michael J. |year=2009 |title=Flights of Fantasy: The Unauthorized but True Story of Radio &amp; TV's Adventures of Superman |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=9781593933449 |ref=harv}}&lt;br/&gt;"Since Superman’s life isn’t threatened — the meteorite never leaves the doctor’s custody — it’s likely that Lowther’s primary intent was to create a means for Superman to discover his own origin."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the radio serial, Krypton was located in the same solar system as Earth, in the same orbit, but on the opposite side of the Sun.  This provided an easy explanation for how kryptonite found its way to Earth.

Kryptonite was incorporated into the comic mythos with ''Superman'' #61 (November 1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Al Pastino|inker=|colorist=|letterer=|editor=|story=Superman's Return to Krypton!|title=Superman|volume=1|issue=#61|date=November 1949|publisher=DC Comics|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editor [[Dorothy Woolfolk]] stated in an interview with ''[[Florida]]'' ''Today'' in August 1993, that she "felt Superman's invulnerability was boring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tippens|first1=Norman|title=Dorothy Woolfolk, Superman Editor|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2000-12-06/news/0012060120_1_superman-comics-comic-books-superman-editor|website=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]|publisher=WebCite|accessdate=2 October 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wWBeqRl1?url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2000-12-06/news/0012060120_1_superman-comics-comic-books-superman-editor|archivedate=15 February 2011|language=en|date=6 December 2000|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''Green kryptonite'''||Originally red in color, the material debuted in ''[[Superman (comics)|Superman]]'' #61 (Nov. 1949) and did not adopt its characteristic green hue until ''[[Action Comics]]'' #161 (Aug. 1951). Green kryptonite weakens Superman and other Kryptonians. It can and will kill them with long-term exposure. Kryptonians under kryptonite exposure experience severe muscular weakness, usually to the point of collapse, and excruciating pain, with both conditions progressively intensifying. Kryptonians under kryptonite exposure usually develop a fever and eventually will lose consciousness before death. Under kryptonite exposure, the blood of Kryptonians begins turning green, and their skin gradually assumes a green color.
Although canonical depictions vary widely, the majority of accounts maintain that although kryptonite exposure victims experience severe weakness and pain, exposure in itself does not eradicate the victim's superpowers, except those related to physical strength. Therefore victims retain most of their visual and sensory powers, although kryptonite itself appears impervious to damage by heat vision. Kryptonite exposure does not compromise the subject's invulnerability to other forms of injury; therefore it is not a practical strategy for a villain to first expose the victim to kryptonite, then kill them with a gun or other conventional weapon. Some accounts maintain paralysis is an effect of kryptonite exposure, although most depictions show victims still capable of limited movement.

|'''Red kryptonite'''|| Debuted in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #252 (Sept. 1958). Originally red kryptonite simply weakened Superman, but to a greater degree than green kryptonite. Red kryptonite was later described as causing odd behavior or bizarre transformations, albeit temporary and non-fatal. The effects of red kryptonite are sometimes described as lasting exactly 24 hours, but in other accounts the effects may persist up to three days.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Harmless to Kryptonians, the mineral gives normal life-forms superhuman abilities, as in the case of Supergirl's pet cat [[Streaky the Supercat|Streaky]]. Revised in ''Superman Family'' #203 (Oct. 1980) to have the same effect as the green variety on Kryptonians.

|- valign="top"
|'''Blue kryptonite''' || Debuted in ''Superman'' #140 (Oct. 1960). An imperfect form of kryptonite which affects the imperfect Superman duplicate [[Bizarro]] and members of the [[Bizarro League]] in the same way that green kryptonite affects Kryptonians. Kryptonians, however, are unaffected by it. Blue kryptonite is also the antidote to the random and bizarre effects of red kryptonite.

|'''Silver kryptonite''' || Debuted in ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'' #70 (July 1963). Revealed by Jimmy Olsen to be a hoax. In Post-''Crisis'' stories, silver kryptonite first appeared in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #46 (April 2008), modeled after the version that appeared in the ''[[Smallville]]'' TV series, {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} season 5 episode 7 "Splinter", where Clark suffers paranoid delusions. Silver kryptonite causes Kryptonians to suffer from altered perceptions, loss of inhibitions, and extreme hunger cravings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} On the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' TV series, this kryptonite causes Superman to hallucinate his "greatest fear" of an attacking [[General Zod]] during the final episode of season 2 ''[[Nevertheless, She Persisted (Supergirl)|Nevertheless, She Persisted]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

|- valign="top"
|'''Kryptonite-X''' || Debuted in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #511 (April 1994). A one-time fluke, kryptonite-X was created when the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] filtered a harmful barrage of kryptonite discharged by the villain the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] at Superman.

|'''Pink kryptonite''' || Debuted in ''Supergirl'' vol. 4 #79 (April 2003). Pink kryptonite seemingly turns Kryptonians gay.

In the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' short "True Colours" it switches a Kryptonian's gender.

|- valign="top"
|'''Black kryptonite''' || Debuted in ''[[Supergirl (comics)|Supergirl]]'' #2 (vol. 5, Oct. 2005). In Pre-''Flashpoint'' continuity, it could split a Kryptonian into two separate entities: one good and the other evil (the kryptonite manufactured by the villains of ''[[Superman III]]'' had just such an effect on the Man of Steel). 
In [[Dark Nights: Metal|''Dark Nights: Metal - The Batman Who Laughs'' #1]], set on the Dark Multiverse's Earth -22, a Batman corrupted by the Joker creates a modified strand of black kryptonite. He tests this first on Supergirl, causing her to murder her family before dying.

===Television===
====Live-action====
* The ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' (1952-1958) featured kryptonite in the episodes "[[Panic in the Sky (Adventures of Superman)|Panic in the Sky]]", "The Defeat of Superman", "Superman Week", "The Deadly Rock", "The Magic Secret", "The Gentle Monster" and "All That Glitters".
*''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (1988-1992) featured green kryptonite in the episodes: "Kryptonite Kills" and "Metallo", "Bride of Bizarro", "Kryptonite Kid", and "Obituary for a Super-Hero". The red variety was featured in the episode "Super Menace". A Bizarro White variant was featured in the episode "The Battle With Bizarro", which heals the title character.
*''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' (1993-1997) featured green kryptonite in the episodes "The Green, Green Glow of Home", "Barbarians at the Planet", "The House of Luthor", "Metallo", "Top Copy" and "Battleground Earth". The red variety was featured in the episodes "Individual Responsibility", "Ultrawoman" and "Lethal Weapon".
* ''[[Smallville]]'' (2001-2011) featured kryptonite on a regular basis. A large quantity of the green variety descends to Earth in a meteor shower, arriving in the town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville, Kansas]] with the spaceship containing the infant Kal-El. The material is colloquially referred to by Smallville residents as "meteor rock", but is eventually called "kryptonite" by [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] once he discovers his origins in season two episode "Rosetta" (in real life, the area near [[Brenham, Kansas]] is known as the site of a major meteorite strike between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;Scharping, Nathaniel (April 4, 2018). [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/04/04/meteorites-ancient-cultures "Space Metal Has Captivated Humanity for Ages"]. ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from being harmful to Clark Kent, the mineral produces bizarre changes in flora and fauna. It also occasionally bestows [[metahuman]] abilities on humans depending on the circumstances of their exposure to it, such as a girl treated for a rare bone disease acquiring shapeshifting powers. These people are commonly known by the inhabitants of Smallville as "Meteor Freaks". The green variety of the mineral appears in several episodes every season, although other varieties appear, including: red in "Red" (2002), "Exodus", "Exile", "Phoenix" (2003), "Unsafe" (2005), "Crimson" (2007) and "Upgrade" (2010); black, formed when superheating green kryptonite in "Crusade" (2004) and "Doomsday" (2009); silver in "Splinter" (2005); blue in "Blue" (2007), "Persona" (2008), "Kandor" (2009), "Salvation" (2010) and  "Harvest" (2011); as a gem in "Persuasion" (2010) and gold in "Prophecy" and "[[Finale (Smallville)|Finale]]" (2011). ''Smallville'' was the first appearance of a black kryptonite that would split a person into their good and evil halves, before later being brought into the comic canon in ''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #2 (Oct. 2005).
*''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' (2015–present) featured green kryptonite in the episodes: "[[Pilot (Supergirl)|Pilot]]", "[[Stronger Together (Supergirl)|Stronger Together]]", "[[Hostile Takeover (Supergirl)|Hostile Takeover]]", "[[For the Girl Who Has Everything (Supergirl)|For the Girl Who Has Everything]]", and "[[Distant Sun (Supergirl)|Distant Sun]]". In the second part of [[Arrowverse]]'s 2017 crossover "[[Crisis on Earth-X]]," reveals that [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Green Arrow]] of Earth-1 somehow obtains samples of green kryptonite, and uses them to construct [[Trick arrows|kryptonite arrows]] as deterrents against rogue Kryptonians such as Overgirl (Supergirl's parallel universe counterpart from Krypton-X). DEO manages to synthesize and create blue kryptonite which is featured in the episode "[[Bizarro (Supergirl)|Bizarro]]". The red kryptonite is featured in the episode "[[Falling (Supergirl)|Falling]]" as a failed attempt to recreate green kryptonite by [[Maxwell Lord]]. Silver kryptonite is featured in the episode "[[Nevertheless, She Persisted (Supergirl)|Nevertheless, She Persisted]]". In season 3, the black kryptonite is pivotal to its arc, first appearing in the episode "The Fanatical", in which it is being referred to as Harun-El by Kryptonians. The Worldkiller Coven from Krypton, headed by dark priestess Selena, schemes to use the Harun-El to terraform Earth into a Krypton-like planet for Kryptonians to inhabit. The protagonists uses the Harun-El to split the Worldkiller Coven's servant, Reign, from her human alter-ego Samantha Arias. By the end of the season finale, it is implied that Supergirl's being is also divided after her exposure to it during her final battle with Reign.

* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' (1999-2001) the two-part episode "The Call" reveals that kryptonite has been kept safe in the distant future as a deterrent against Superman due to the hero's past as a rogue agent under [[Darkseid]]'s mind manipulation.

===Films===
* In ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) Lex Luthor ([[Gene Hackman]]) deduces that a meteorite found in [[Addis Ababa]] is actually a radioactive piece of the exploded planet Krypton.

Gorman's "supercomputer" later fights Superman and uses a kryptonite ray.
* In ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006) Lex Luthor ([[Kevin Spacey]]) steals the Addis Ababa L9 Pallasite Meteorite and uses kryptonite to create a new Kryptonian landmass and a dagger for use against Superman. The film describes kryptonite's formula as "sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine". A year after the film was released, a substance with a similar formula was discovered, [[jadarite]], a coincidence which led to [[mass-media|media]] attention.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3070418 ABC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/23/britain.kryptonite.reut/index.html CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042401973.html ''Washington Post'']&lt;/ref&gt; The new mineral, unlike the fictional material in the movie, does not contain [[fluorine]] and does not glow green.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{citation| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6584229.stm| title = 'Kryptonite' discovered in mine|date = 24 Apr 2007| work = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kryptonite is then stolen from Luthor by Batman ([[Ben Affleck]]), who uses it to create kryptonite gas pellets and a kryptonite-tipped spear, both of which he later uses in battle with Superman ([[Henry Cavill]]). [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] is also shown to be weakened by kryptonite, allowing Superman to use the spear to kill him in the film's climax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title='Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice': 6 EW exclusive photos|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/batman-v-superman-dawn-justice-first-look-photos/2232978_batman-and-superman-square-first-time|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-level injection''' conditions for a [[p–n junction]] refers to the state where the number of minority carriers generated is small compared to the majority carriers of the material. Essentially, the semiconductor's majority-carrier concentration will remain (relatively) unchanged, while the minority-carrier concentration sees a large increase. In this condition [[Carrier generation and recombination|minority-carrier recombination]] rates are linear.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Nelson, The Physics of Solar Cells, Imperial College Press, UK, 2007 pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following equation must be satisfied for a semiconductor under carrier injection conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;n = \Delta n + n_0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of electrons, &lt;math&gt;\Delta n&lt;/math&gt; is the excess carriers injected into the semiconductor, and &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium concentration of electrons in the semiconductor

The following relation must also be true, because for every electron injected a hole must also be created to keep a balance of charge:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta n = \Delta p.&lt;/math&gt;

The assumption of low-level injection can be made regarding an n-type semiconductor, which affects the equations in the following way:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta n \ll N_D.&lt;/math&gt; 
Therefore &lt;math&gt;n = N_D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p = \Delta p + p_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In comparison, a [[semiconductor]] in [[high injection]] means that the number of generated [[Charge carrier|carriers]] is large compared to the background doping density of the material.  In this condition minority carrier recombination rates are proportional to the number of carriers squared&lt;ref&gt;R. R. King, R. A. Sinton, and R. M. Swanson, Doped Surfaces in one sun, point-contact solar cells, Appl. Phys. Lett. 54 (15), 1989 pp. 1460–1462.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lutetium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Lu''' and [[atomic number]] 71. It is a silvery white [[metal]], which resists corrosion in dry air, but not in moist air. Lutetium is the last element in the [[lanthanide]] series, and it is traditionally counted among the [[rare earths]]. Lutetium is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period [[transition metal]]s, although [[lanthanum]] is more often considered as such.

Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist [[Georges Urbain]], Austrian mineralogist [[Freiherr|Baron]] [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]], and American chemist [[Charles James (chemist)|Charles James]]. All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral [[ytterbia]], which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name ''cassiopeium'' (or later ''cassiopium'') for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.

Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element, although it is significantly more common than [[silver]] in the earth's crust. It has few specific uses.  Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant (2.5%) radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 38 billion years, used to [[Lutetium-hafnium dating|determine the age]] of minerals and [[meteorite]]s. Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element [[yttrium]]{{Citation needed|reason=Did someone confuse Yttrium and Ytterbium here or something? Seems very odd, **but** possible!|date=May 2018}} and is sometimes used in metal [[alloy]]s and as a [[catalyst]] in various chemical reactions. &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-[[DOTA-TATE]] is used for radionuclide therapy (see [[Nuclear medicine]]) on neuroendocrine tumours. Lutetium has the highest [[Brinell scale|Brinell hardness]] of any lanthanide, at 890–1300 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Samsonov, G.

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===
A lutetium atom has 71 electrons, arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] &amp;#91;[[xenon|Xe]]&amp;#93;&amp;nbsp;4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Cotton&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|page=1223}}&lt;/ref&gt; When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons and the single 5d-electron. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the [[lanthanide contraction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cotton&amp;Wilkinson5th|pages=776, 955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book| last=Parker | first= Sybil P.| title =Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms| edition =3rd| location = New York| publisher = McGraw-Hill| date = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties and compounds===
{{category see also|Lutetium compounds}}
Lutetium's compounds always contain the element in the oxidation state +3.  Aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying, with the common exception of the iodide. The soluble salts, such as nitrate, sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization. The [[lutetium(III) oxide|oxide]], hydroxide, fluoride, carbonate, phosphate and [[oxalate]] are insoluble in water.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

Lutetium metal is slightly unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150&amp;nbsp;°C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound is known to absorb water and [[carbon dioxide]], and may be used to remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres.&lt;ref name=aaaaaa&gt;{{cite book| pages = 303–304| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide | last=  Krebs| first= Robert E.| publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group| date = 2006| isbn =978-0-313-33438-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction.&lt;ref name="ffff"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/lutetium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Lutetium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form tri[[halides]]; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.

Lutetium dissolves readily in weak acids&lt;ref name=aaaaaa/&gt; and dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions containing the colorless lutetium ions, which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules, the average being [Lu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;8.2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Persson2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Persson|first1=Ingmar|title=Hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution: How regular are their structures?|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=82|issue=10|date=2010|pages=1901–1917|issn=0033-4545|doi=10.1351/PAC-CON-09-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2&amp;nbsp;Lu + 3&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;Lu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;SO{{su|b=4|p=2–}} + 3&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of lutetium}}
Lutetium occurs on the Earth in form of two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out of these two, only the former is stable, making the element [[monoisotopic element|monoisotopic]]. The latter one, lutetium-176, decays via [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 3.78&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years; it makes up about 2.5% of natural lutetium.&lt;ref name="IS"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges| title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| issue = 1| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode = 2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

To date, 32 [[synthetic radioisotope]]s of the element have been characterized, ranging in mass from 149.973 (lutetium-150) to 183.961 (lutetium-184); the most stable such isotopes are lutetium-174 with a half-life of 3.31 years, and lutetium-173 with a half-life of 1.37 years.&lt;ref name="IS"/&gt; All of the remaining [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 9 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half an hour.&lt;ref name="IS"/&gt; Isotopes lighter than the stable lutetium-175 decay via [[electron capture]] (to produce isotopes of [[ytterbium]]), with some [[alpha emission|alpha]] and [[positron emission]]; the heavier isotopes decay primarily via beta decay, producing hafnium isotopes.&lt;ref name="IS"/&gt;

The element also has 42 [[nuclear isomer]]s, with masses of 150, 151, 153–162, 166–180 (not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer). The most stable of them are lutetium-177m, with half-life of 160.4 days and lutetium-174m, with half-life of 142 days; this is longer than half-lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes, except only for lutetium-173, 174, and 176.&lt;ref name="IS"/&gt;

==History==
Lutetium, derived from the Latin ''[[Lutetia]]'' ([[Paris]]), was independently [[discoveries of the chemical elements|discovered]] in 1907 by French scientist [[Georges Urbain]], Austrian mineralogist Baron [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]], and American chemist Charles James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=James, C. |year=1907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrhMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA495 |title=A new method for the separation of the yttrium earths|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=29|issue=4|pages=495–499|doi=10.1021/ja01958a010}} In a footnote on page 498, James mentions that Carl Auer von Welsbach had announced " … the presence of a new element Er, γ, which is undoubtedly the same as here noted, … ."  The article to which James refers is:  C. Auer von Welsbach (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=myLzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA935#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Über die Elemente der Yttergruppe, (I. Teil)"] (On the elements of the ytterbium group (1st part)), ''Monatshefte für Chemie und verwandte Teile anderer Wissenschaften'' (Monthly Journal for Chemistry and Related Fields of Other Sciences), '''27''' :  935-946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Separation of Rare Earth Elements by Charles James | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/earthelements.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They found it as an impurity in [[ytterbia]], which was thought by Swiss chemist [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]] to consist entirely of [[ytterbium]].&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Un nouvel élément: le lutécium, résultant du dédoublement de l'ytterbium de Marignac|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume=145|date=1907|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3099v/f759.image.langEN|pages=759–762|last= Urbain|first= G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose ''neoytterbium'' and ''lutecium'',&lt;ref name="Fra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lutetium und Neoytterbium oder Cassiopeium und Aldebaranium -- Erwiderung auf den Artikel des Herrn Auer v. Welsbach.|date=1909|journal=Monatshefte für Chemie|volume=31|issue=10|doi=10.1007/BF01530262|first=G. |last=Urbain|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Welsbach chose ''aldebaranium'' and ''cassiopeium'' (after [[Aldebaran]] and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]).&lt;ref name="Deu"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Die Zerlegung des Ytterbiums in seine Elemente|trans-title=Resolution of ytterbium into its elements|journal=Monatshefte für Chemie|volume=29|issue=2|date=1908|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015036977471;view=1up;seq=193|doi=10.1007/BF01558944|pages=181–225, 191|first=Carl A. von|last=Welsbach}}  On page 191, Welsbach suggested names for the two new elements:  ''"Ich beantrage für das an das Thulium, beziehungsweise Erbium sich anschließende, in dem vorstehenden Teile dieser Abhandlung mit Yb II bezeichnete Element die Benennung:  Aldebaranium mit dem Zeichen Ad — und für das zweite, in dieser Arbeit mit Yb I bezeichnete Element, das letzte in der Reihe der seltenen Erden, die Benennung:  Cassiopeïum mit dem Zeichen Cp."''  (I request for the element that is attached to thulium or erbium and that was denoted by Yb II in the above part of this paper, the designation "Aldebaranium" with the symbol Ad — and for the element that was denoted in this work by Yb I, the last in the series of the rare earths, the designation "Cassiopeïum" with the symbol Cp.)&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these articles accused the other man of publishing results based on those of the author.

The [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Commission on Atomic Weights]], which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain;&lt;ref name="1st"/&gt; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. Until the 1950s, some German-speaking chemists called lutetium by Welsbach's name, ''cassiopeium''; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. The reason for this was that Welsbach's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium.&lt;ref name="rare-earth-handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thyssen|first1=Pieter|last2=Binnemans|first2=Koen|editor1-last=Gschneider|editor1-first=Karl A., Jr.|editor2-last=Bünzli|editor2-first=Jean-Claude|editor3-last=Pecharsky|editor3-first=Vitalij K.|chapter=Accommodation of the Rare Earths in the Periodic Table: A Historical Analysis|title=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths|date=2011|page=63|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-444-53590-0|oclc=690920513|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SstnPFSzb0C&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure lutetium. The later discrediting of Urbain's work on element 72 led to a reappraisal of Welsbach's work on element 71, so that the element was renamed to ''cassiopeium'' in German-speaking countries for some time.&lt;ref name="rare-earth-handbook"/&gt; Charles James, who stayed out of the priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time.&lt;ref name="Emsley240"&gt;{{cite book| pages=240–242| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Yhi5X7OwuGkC&amp;pg=PA241| title =Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements|first =John|last=Emsley| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-850341-5| date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953.&lt;ref name="Emsley240"/&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
[[Image:Monazit - Mosambik, O-Afrika.jpg|thumb|Monazite]]
Found with almost all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements. Its principal commercial source is as a by-product from the processing of the rare earth [[phosphate]] mineral [[monazite]] ([[cerium|Ce]],[[lanthanum|La]],...)[[phosphorus|P]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!----please don't touch the formula----&gt;, which  has concentrations of only 0.0001% of the element,&lt;ref name=aaaaaa/&gt; not much higher than the abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. No lutetium-dominant minerals are currently known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/ |title=Mindat.org |author=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |date=1993–2018 |website=www.mindat.org |access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year.&lt;ref name="Emsley240"/&gt; Pure lutetium metal is very difficult to prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of [[gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher = USGS| title =Rare-Earth Metals| author = Hedrick, James B. | accessdate = 2009-06-06| url =http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/740798.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial Minerals and Rocks |chapter=Rare Earth Elements |author=Castor, Stephen B. |author2=Hedrick, James B. |publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration |chapter-url=http://www.rareelementresources.com/i/pdf/RareEarths-CastorHedrickIMAR7.pdf |editor=Jessica Elzea Kogel, Nikhil C.

Crushed minerals are treated with hot concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. [[Thorium]] precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in [[nitric acid]] that excludes one of the main components, [[cerium]], whose oxide is insoluble in HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with [[ammonium nitrate]] by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by [[ion exchange]]. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by [[redox|reduction]] of anhydrous Lu[[chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Lu[[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by either an [[alkali metal]] or [[alkaline earth metal]].&lt;ref name=patnaik&gt;{{cite book|last =Patnaik|first =Pradyot|date = 2003|title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds|publisher = McGraw-Hill|page = 510|isbn =978-0-07-049439-8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Because of production difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially since it is rarer than most of the other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as [[catalyst]]s in [[petroleum]] [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] in [[oil refinery|refineries]] and can also be used in alkylation, [[hydrogenation]], and [[polymerization]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Like other rare-earth metals, lutetium is regarded as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin.&lt;ref name=aaaaaa/&gt; Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may [[Explosion|explode]] and [[fire|burn]] once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.&lt;ref name=aaaaaa/&gt;

Similarly to the other rare-earth metals, lutetium has no known biological role, but it is found even in [[human]]s, concentrating in bones, and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="Emsley240"/&gt; Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides.&lt;ref name="Emsley240"/&gt; Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.&lt;ref name="Emsley240"/&gt;

'''Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission''' '''(NERC)''' is an independent regulatory body with authority for the regulation of the electric power industry in Nigeria. NERC was formed in 2005 under the [[Olusegun Obasanjo|Obasanjo]]  administration’s economic reform agenda through the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, 2005 for formation and review of [[electricity tariff]]s, transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of policies that are efficient and environmentally friendly, and also including forming and enforcing of [[Technical standard|standards]] in the creation and use of electricity in Nigeria. NERC was instituted primarily to regulate the tariff of [[Power generation|Power Generating]] companies owned or controlled by the government, and any other generating company which has a license for [[power generation]] and [[Power transmission|transmission of energy]], and distribution of electricity.

== History ==
Electric power generation in Nigeria began in 1896. 
In 1929, the Nigeria Electric Supply Company (NESCO) was established. In 1951, the Electric Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) was established to take over the assets of NESCO. In 1962, NDA (Nigeria Dams Authority) was established to develop the hydropower potentials in Nigeria. In 1972, ECN and NDA were merged to form NEPA (National Electric Power Authority), which later metamorphosized to [[Power Holding Company of Nigeria]], as a holding company for its imminent unbundling and subsequent privatization.
Previously, the Federal Ministry of Power oversees the electric power sector in Nigeria. 
It served both as the policy making body and the regulator; doing the latter mostly through the Electrical Inspectorate Services, a department in the Ministry.
The electric power sector in Nigeria started with the Niger Dams Authority which controlled the Dams around Shiroro and River Niger.
Due to abysmal power crises in the whole of Nigeria, the government of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] made efforts through the National Council for Privatisation/Bureau for Public Service (under the leadership of [[Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai]] to reform the sector which has seen no investment or major government attention since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2022973/Obasanjo-gambles-with-the-economy.html/ |title=Manta - Rediscover America's Small Business |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NERC was formed through the EPSRAct of 2005 and it was inaugurated on 30 October 2007 with Ramsome Owan as its first Chairman/CEO. Dr. Ransome Owan, a US trained scientist who once worked for GE, was appointed for a five-year term as the executive Chairman of NERC. On his team included other Nigerians living in Diaspora who came in to work for NERC. 
NERC was given additional responsibilities for setting up and administering a fund called “Power Consumer Assistance Fund” which shall subsidize underprivileged power consumers in Nigeria. It also had the mandate to regulate the rural systems and determine the contribution rates to be sent to the Rural Electrification Fund.

== Powers and duties of NERC ==
The Commission's powers and duties are provided for in the EPSRAct 2005, and effectively ushered the privatization of electric power services in Nigeria, unbundling of the defunct National Electricity Power Authority (NEPA)/Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN).
NERC’s primary duty is protect the interests of consumers, issue licenses to operators/investors, set and review electricity tariffs and where possible promote competition.
The Commission's main objective is to protect existing and future consumers' interests in relation to electricity generated and that conveyed by distribution or transmission systems. Consumers' interests are their interests taken as a whole, including their interests in affordable tariffs and safe, reliable and available electricity supply, and the reduction of greenhouse gases to them.

==Structure of NERC==
The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission is governed by a tenured Board of Commissioners, headed by a Chairman. The [[Nigerian President]] nominates one nominee Commissioner to represent his/her geopolitical zone in the country for a fixed tenure of 4 years, renewable once only. The Chairman/CEO, has a period of 5 years, also renewable once only. The nominees are duly screened by the [[Nigerian Senate]].
The Board of Commission of NERC issues orders on electricity matters in Nigeria. It makes regulatory decisions and issues final license to investors/operators. It also settles industrial disputes through its ADR mechanism in an open hearing. 
NERC is divided into seven Divisions:  Office of the Chairman/CEO, Engineering, Standards and Safety Division, Finance and Management Services Division, Government and Consumer Affairs Division, Legal Licensing and Enforcement Division, Market Competition and Rates Division, and the Renewable Energy/Research and Development Division.

==Reform of electricity sector in Nigeria==
The Electric Power Sector Reform Act of 2005 established NERC's authority to impose mandatory [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] standards on the transmission system and to impose [[sanctions (law)|penalties]] on companies that manipulate the electricity markets. Since Independence from the UK, Nigeria has built 12 power plants.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|last=Hinshaw|first=Drea|title=Can Moguls Untangle Nigeria's Power Lines?|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304049904579515183408829094|newspaper=WSJ|accessdate=29 April 2014|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nigeria produces as much electricity as North Dakota for 249 times more people, with blackouts 320 times per year per information from the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;
The EPSRAct of 2005 gave NERC additional responsibilities as outlined in NERC's Wide Important Goals. As part of that responsibility, NERC:
* Regulates the generation, transmission, distribution and marketing of electricity in Nigeria and with Nigeria;
* Licenses and inspects private and corporate electric power projects 10MW and above; where 1-10MW are issued Captive Licenses;
* Ensures the reliability of generation plants, high voltage transmission system and the zonal distribution system;
* Ensures occupational health and safety of persons involved with electricity in the whole sector.
* Monitors and investigates energy markets;
* Uses civil penalties and other means against energy organizations and individuals who violate NERC rules in the energy markets;
* Administers accounting and financial reporting regulations and conduct of regulated companies.

In recent {{when|date=April 2014}} years, the NERC has been promoting the voluntary formation of Independent Electric Transmission Networks (IETNs) and Independent Electric Distribution Networks (IEDNs) to eliminate the potential for undue discrimination in access to the [[electric grid]]. However, since the generation capacity is low and the transmission not robust, NERC has developed regulations to push for the primary provision of supply, electric reliability and implementation of new regulations keeping in sight when the sector fully develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/09/power-sector-reforms-jonathan-the-power-president/ |title=Power sector reforms: Jonathan, the Power President - Vanguard News |publisher=Vanguardngr.com |date=2010-09-06 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NERC regulates over 40 licensees in Nigeria. It is also responsible for permitting the construction of network of transmission lines by the Transmission Company of Nigeria, the transmission monopoly in Nigeria formed as a successor company of the [[Power Holding Company of Nigeria|PHCN]]. NERC works closely with the Nigerian Ministry of Environment and other related bodies in reviewing the safety, security and environmental impacts of proposed power plants and transmission networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/power/20126-why-subsidy-extension-in-power-sector-is-appropriate-now/ |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151045/http://www.businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/power/20126-why-subsidy-extension-in-power-sector-is-appropriate-now/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Nigeria auctioned off 6 power plants, one belonging to [[Tony Elumelu]], chairman of Heirs Holdings. Nigeria will need 170,000MW per day for its 174 million people.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; Transmission lines are outdated, ineffective, and power is stolen from electric poles, since metering does not exist.

==Board of Commissioners==
A new set of commissioners were [https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2017/02/08/fashola-swears-in-nerc-commissioners/ sworn into office on February 7, 2017], filling a vacuum that had existed from December 2015 when the term of the last Board led by Mr. Sam Amadi expired.  Sam Amadi served as Chairman/CEO of the Commission from December 18, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nercng.org/index.php/about-us/the-commission/sam-amadi |title=Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission - Sam Amadi |publisher=Nercng.org |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2015-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221070701/http://nercng.org/index.php/about-us/the-commission/sam-amadi |archivedate=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to December 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13048">The "'''Nuclear Power 2010 Program'''" was launched in 2002 by President George W. Bush in order to restart orders for nuclear power reactors in the U.S. by providing subsidies for a handful of Generation III+ demonstration plants. The expectation was that these plants would come online by 2010, but it was not met.

In March 2017, the leading nuclear-plant maker, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], filed for bankruptcy due to losing over $9 billion in construction losses from working on two nuclear plants. This loss was partly caused by safety concerns due to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], Germany's [[Energiewende in Germany|Energiewende]], the growth of solar and wind power, and low natural gas prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gough|first=Paul|title=Westinghouse cuts 200 employees|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/blog/energy/2012/05/westinghouse-cuts-200-employees.html|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=American City Business Journals.|date=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The "Nuclear Power 2010 Program" was unveiled by the U.S. [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] [[Spencer Abraham]] on February 14, 2002 as one means towards addressing the expected need for new [[power plants]].  The program is a joint government/industry cost-shared effort to identify sites for new [[nuclear power plant]]s, to develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies, evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants, and demonstrate untested regulatory processes leading to an industry decision in the next few years to seek [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) approval to build and operate at least one new advanced nuclear power plant in the United States.

Three consortia responded in 2004 to the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]'s solicitation under the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative and were awarded matching funds.

*The [[Dominion Resources|Dominion]]-led consortium includes General Electric ([[GE]]) Energy, [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi America]], and [[Bechtel Corporation]], and has selected General Electric's Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor ([[ESBWR]], a [[passively safe]] version of the [[BWR]]).
*The NuStart Energy Development, LLC consortium consists of [[DTE Energy]], [[Duke Energy]], [[Électricité de France|EDF]] International North America, [[Entergy]] Nuclear, [[Exelon]] Generation, [[Florida Power &amp; Light]] Co., [[Progress Energy Inc|Progress Energy]], [[SCANA Corporation]], [[Southern Company]], [[GE]] Energy, Tennessee Valley Authority ([[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]]), and [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] and has chosen the General Electric Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) and the Westinghouse Advanced Passive 1000 ([[AP1000]], a [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]]) reactor as candidates. The NuStart consortium was disbanded on 30 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear Energy Public-Private Partnership Achieves Industry Milestones, Now Disbanding|url=http://www.nustartenergy.com/nuclear-energy-public-private-partnership-achieves-industry-milestones-now-disbanding|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=NuStart Energy (press release)|date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The third consortium, led by TVA, includes General Electric, [[Toshiba]], [[USEC]] Inc., Global Fuel-Americas, and Bechtel Power Corp., and will develop a feasibility study for a TVA site based on the General Electric [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] (ABWR).

On September 22, 2005, NuStart selected Port Gibson (the [[Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station|Grand Gulf]] site) and Scottsboro (the [[Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station|Bellefonte]] site) for new nuclear units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Entergy announced it will prepare its own proposal for the River Bend Station in St. Francisville.  Also, Constellation Energy of Baltimore had withdrawn its Lusby and Oswego sites from the NuStart finalist list after on September 15 announcing a new joint venture, UniStar Nuclear, with [[Areva]] to offer [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPR]] (European Pressurized Reactors) in the U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.biz.yahoo.com/050915/323/fs67q.html |accessdate=September 23, 2005 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in October, 2005, Progress Energy announced it was considering constructing a new nuclear plant and had begun evaluating potential sites in central Florida.

South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas announced on February 10, 2006 that it chose Westinghouse for a plant to be built at the [[Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station|V.C. Summer plant]] in [[Jenkinsville, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NRG Energy]] announced in June 2006 that it would explore building two ABWRs at the [[South Texas Nuclear Generating Station|South Texas Project]].  Four ABWRs were already operating in [[Japan]] at that time.

The original goal of bringing two new reactors online by 2010 was missed, and "of more than two dozen projects that were considered, only two showed signs of progress and even this progress was uncertain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/8.abstract?etoc |title=The implications of Fukushima: The US perspective |author=Mark Cooper |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2017, the [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant|Plant Vogtle]] and V.C. Summer plants (a total of four reactors) in the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern U.S.]] that have been under construction since the late 2000s have been left to an unknown fate.&lt;ref name=wsj-files-bankrupt&gt;{{cite news |last=Gold |first=Russell |last2=Negishi |first2=Mayumi |date=March 29, 2017 |title=Toshiba’s Westinghouse Electric Files for Bankruptcy Protection  |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/toshibas-westinghouse-electric-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-1490771532?tesla=y | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |location=[[New York City, New York]], [[United States]] |access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy Policy Act of 2005 ==
The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on August 8, 2005, has a number of articles related to [[nuclear power]], and three specifically to the 2010 Program.&lt;ref name=EB2005&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.nei.org/documents/Energy_Bill_2005.pdf  |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20050907130218/http://www.nei.org/documents/Energy_Bill_2005.pdf  |dead-url=yes  |archive-date=2005-09-07  |accessdate=July 10, 2007  |title=Archived copy  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the [[Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act]] was extended to cover private and DOE plants and activities licensed through 2025.

Also, the government would cover cost overruns due to regulatory delays, up to $500 million each for the first two new nuclear reactors, and half of the overruns due to such delays (up to $250 million each) for the next four reactors.  Delays in construction due to vastly increased regulation were a primary cause of the high cost of some earlier plants.

Finally, "A production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 6,000 megawatt-hours from new nuclear power plants for the first eight years of their operation, subject to a $125 million annual limit. The production tax credit places nuclear energy on an equal footing with other sources of emission-free power, including wind and closed-loop biomass."&lt;ref name=EB2005/&gt;&lt;!--copyright, permission obtained to use in Wikipedia; see discussion.--&gt;

The Act also funds a [[Next Generation Nuclear Plant]] project at [[INEEL]] to produce both [[electricity]] and [[hydrogen]]. This plant will be a [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] project and does not fall under the 2010 Program.

{{Main|Prospective nuclear units in the United States}}

Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] for construction and operating licenses to build 25 new [[nuclear power]] reactors in the [[United States]]. 
However, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak U.S. economy, lack of financing, and uncertainty following the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan after a [[tsunami]].&lt;ref name=us12/&gt; Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled.&lt;ref name=eo&gt;Eileen O'Grady.

A '''pendulum clock''' is a [[clock]] that uses a [[pendulum]], a swinging weight, as its [[time]]keeping element.  The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it approximates a [[harmonic oscillator]]: it swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates.  From its invention in 1656 by [[Christiaan Huygens]] until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world's most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries pendulum clocks in homes, factories, offices and railroad stations served as primary time standards for scheduling daily life, work shifts, and public transportation, and their greater accuracy allowed the faster pace of life which was necessary for the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The home pendulum clock was replaced by cheaper [[synchronous electric clock]]s in the 1930s and '40s, and they are now kept mostly for their decorative and [[antique]] value.

Pendulum clocks must be stationary to operate; any motion or [[acceleration]]s will affect the motion of the pendulum, causing inaccuracies, so other mechanisms must be used in portable timepieces.

The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 by [[Dutch (ethnic group and nation)|Dutch]] scientist and inventor [[Christiaan Huygens]], and patented the following year.  Huygens contracted the construction of his clock designs to clockmaker [[Salomon Coster]], who actually built the clock.  Huygens was inspired by investigations of pendulums by [[Galileo Galilei]] beginning around 1602.  Galileo discovered the key property that makes pendulums useful timekeepers: [[wikt:isochronous|isochronism]], which means that the [[Frequency|period]] of swing of a pendulum is approximately the same for different sized swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These early clocks, due to their [[verge escapement]]s, had wide pendulum swings of 80–100°.  In his 1673 analysis of pendulums, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'',  Huygens showed that wide swings made the pendulum inaccurate, causing its [[Frequency|period]], and thus the rate of the clock, to vary with unavoidable variations in the driving force provided by the [[movement (clockwork)|movement]].  Clockmakers' realization that only pendulums with small swings of a few degrees are [[isochronous (horology)|isochronous]] motivated the invention of the [[anchor escapement]] around 1670, which reduced the pendulum's swing to 4–6°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The anchor became the standard escapement used in pendulum clocks.  In addition to increased accuracy, the anchor's narrow pendulum swing allowed the clock's case to accommodate longer, slower pendulums, which needed less power and caused less wear on the movement.  The [[seconds pendulum]] (also called the Royal pendulum),  0.994 m (39.1&amp;nbsp;in) long,  in which each swing takes one second, became widely used in quality clocks.  The long narrow clocks built around these pendulums, first made by William Clement around 1680, became known as [[Longcase clock|grandfather clock]]s.  The increased accuracy resulting from these developments caused the minute hand, previously rare, to be added to clock faces beginning around 1690.&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th and 19th century wave of [[horological]] innovation that followed the invention of the pendulum brought many improvements to pendulum clocks.  The [[deadbeat escapement]] invented in 1675 by [[Richard Towneley]] and popularized by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] around 1715 in his precision "regulator" clocks gradually replaced the anchor escapement&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.181, 441&lt;/ref&gt; and is now used in most modern pendulum clocks.  Observation that pendulum clocks slowed down in summer brought the realization that [[thermal expansion]] and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in temperature was a source of error. This was solved by the invention of temperature-compensated pendulums; the [[mercury pendulum]] by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] in 1721 and the [[gridiron pendulum]] by [[John Harrison]] in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, pp. 193–195&lt;/ref&gt;  With these improvements, by the mid-18th century precision pendulum clocks achieved accuracies of a few seconds per week.

Until the 19th century, clocks were handmade by individual craftsmen and were very expensive.  The rich ornamentation of pendulum clocks of this period indicates their value as status symbols of the wealthy.  The [[clockmaker]]s of each country and region in Europe developed their own distinctive styles.  By the 19th century, factory production of clock parts gradually made pendulum clocks affordable by middle-class families.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], daily life was organized around the home pendulum clock.  More accurate pendulum clocks, called ''regulators'', were installed in places of business and [[railroad station]]s and used to schedule work and set other clocks.  The need for extremely accurate timekeeping in [[celestial navigation]] to determine [[longitude]] drove the development of the most accurate pendulum clocks, called ''astronomical regulators''.  These precision instruments, installed in [[naval observatory|naval observatories]] and kept accurate within a second by observation of [[star transit]]s overhead, were used to set [[marine chronometer]]s on naval and commercial vessels.  Beginning in the 19th century, astronomical regulators in naval observatories served as primary standards for national [[Time signal|time distribution services]] that distributed time signals over [[telegraph]] wires.&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1909, US National Bureau of Standards (now [[NIST]]) based the US time standard on [[Riefler escapement|Riefler]] pendulum clocks, accurate to about 10 milliseconds per day.  In 1929 it switched to the [[Shortt-Synchronome clock|Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock]] before phasing in [[Quartz clock|quartz]] standards in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Pendulum clocks remained the world standard for accurate timekeeping for 270 years, until the invention of the [[quartz clock]] in 1927, and were used as time standards through World War 2.  The French Time Service used pendulum clocks as part of their ensemble of standard clocks until 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Mechanism==
[[File:Maquinaria de un Ansonia C-1904.jpg |thumb|right|upright | Ansonia Clock model mechanism: c. 1904.]]

The mechanism which runs a mechanical clock is called the [[movement (clockwork)|movement]].  The movements of all mechanical pendulum clocks have these five parts:&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, pp. 74, 197–212&lt;/ref&gt;
* A power source; either a weight on a cord or chain that turns a pulley or sprocket, or a [[mainspring]]
* A [[gear train]] ([[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]) that steps up the speed of the power so that the pendulum can use it.  The [[gear ratio]]s of the gear train also divide the rotation rate down to give wheels that rotate once every hour and once every 12 hours, to turn the hands of the clock. 
* An [[escapement]] that gives the pendulum precisely timed impulses to keep it swinging, and which releases the gear train wheels to move forward a fixed amount at each swing.  This is the source of the "ticking" sound of an operating pendulum clock.
* The pendulum, a weight on a rod, which is the timekeeping element of the clock
* An indicator or dial that records how often the escapement has rotated and therefore how much time has passed, usually a traditional [[clock face]] with rotating hands.

Additional functions in clocks besides basic timekeeping are called [[complication (horology)|complication]]s.   More elaborate pendulum clocks may include these complications:

* [[Striking clock|Striking train]]: strikes a bell or gong on every hour, with the number of strikes equal to the number of the hour. Some clocks will also signal the half hour with a single strike. More elaborate types, technically called ''chiming clocks'', strike on the quarter hours, and may play melodies or Cathedral chimes, usually [[Westminster quarters]].
* Calendar dials: show the day, date, and sometimes month.
* [[Moon phase]] dial: Shows the phase of the moon, usually with a painted picture of the moon on a rotating disk.
* [[Equation of time]] dial: this rare complication was used in early days to set the clock by the passage of the sun overhead at noon.  It displays the difference between the time indicated by the clock and the time indicated by the position of the sun, which varies by as much as ±16 minutes during the year.
* [[Repeater (horology)|Repeater]] attachment: repeats the hour chimes when triggered by hand. This rare complication was used before artificial lighting to check what time it was at night.

In ''electromechanical pendulum clocks'' such as used in mechanical [[Master clock]]s the power source is replaced by an electrically powered [[solenoid]] that provides the impulses to the pendulum by [[magnetic force]], and the escapement is replaced by a [[switch]] or [[photodetector]] that senses when the pendulum is in the right position to receive the impulse. These should not be confused with more recent quartz pendulum clocks in which an electronic [[quartz clock]] module swings a pendulum.  These are not true pendulum clocks because the timekeeping is controlled by a [[quartz crystal]] in the module, and the swinging pendulum is merely a decorative simulation.

==Gravity-swing pendulum==
[[Image:Old Pendulum clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Schoolhouse regulator style pendulum wall clock]]

The pendulum swings with a [[Frequency|period]]  that varies with the square root of its effective length.  For small swings the period ''T'', the time for one complete cycle (two swings), is

:&lt;math&gt;T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the length of the pendulum and ''g'' is the local [[gravitational acceleration|acceleration of gravity]].  All pendulum clocks have a means of adjusting the rate.  This is usually an adjustment nut under the pendulum [[Bob (physics)|bob]] which moves the bob up or down on its rod.  Moving the bob up reduces the length of the pendulum, reducing the pendulum's period so the clock gains time.  In some pendulum clocks, fine adjustment is done with an auxiliary adjustment, which may be a small weight that is moved up or down the pendulum rod.  In some master clocks and tower clocks, adjustment is accomplished by a small tray mounted on the rod where small weights are placed or removed to change the effective length, so the rate can be adjusted without stopping the clock.

The period of a pendulum increases slightly with the width (amplitude) of its swing.   The ''rate'' of error increases with amplitude, so when limited to small swings of a few degrees the pendulum is nearly ''isochronous''; its period is independent of changes in amplitude.  Therefore, the swing of the pendulum in clocks is limited to 2° to 4°.

=== Temperature compensation ===
A major source of error in pendulum clocks is [[thermal expansion]]; the pendulum rod changes in length slightly with changes in temperature, causing changes in the rate of the clock. An increase in temperature causes the rod to expand, making the pendulum longer, so its period increases and the clock loses time.  Many older quality clocks used wooden pendulum rods to reduce this error, as wood expands less than metal.

The first pendulum to correct for this error was the ''mercury pendulum'' invented by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] in 1721, which was used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.  These had a bob consisting of a container of the liquid metal [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. An increase in temperature would cause the pendulum rod to expand, but the mercury in the container would also expand and its level would rise slightly in the container, moving the center of gravity of the pendulum up toward the pivot. By using the correct amount of mercury, the centre of gravity of the pendulum remained at a constant height, and thus its period remained constant, despite changes in temperature.

The most widely used temperature-compensated pendulum was the [[gridiron pendulum]] invented by [[John Harrison]] around 1726. This consisted of a "grid" of parallel rods of high-thermal-expansion metal such as [[zinc]] or [[brass]] and low-thermal-expansion metal such as [[steel]]. If properly combined, the length change of the high-expansion rods compensated for the length change of the low-expansion rods, again achieving a constant period of the pendulum with temperature changes. 
This type of pendulum became so associated with quality that decorative "fake" gridirons are often seen on pendulum clocks, that have no actual temperature compensation function.

Beginning around 1900, some of the highest precision scientific clocks had pendulums made of ultra-low-expansion materials such as the nickel steel alloy [[Invar]] or [[fused silica]], which required very little compensation for the effects of temperature.

===Atmospheric drag===
The viscosity of the air through which the pendulum swings will vary with atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature. This drag also requires power that could otherwise be applied to extending the time between windings.  Traditionally the pendulum bob is made with a narrow streamlined lens shape to reduce air drag, which is where most of the driving power goes in a quality clock.  In the late 19th century and early 20th century, pendulums for precision [[regulator clock]]s in astronomical observatories were often operated in a chamber that had been pumped to a low pressure to reduce drag and make the pendulum's operation even more accurate by avoiding changes in atmospheric pressure. Fine adjustment of the rate of the clock could be made by slight changes to the internal pressure in the sealed housing.

===Leveling and "beat"===
To keep time accurately, pendulum clocks must be absolutely level.  If they are not, the pendulum swings more to one side than the other, upsetting the symmetrical operation of the escapement.  This condition can often be heard audibly in the ticking sound of the clock.  The ticks or "beats" should be at precisely equally spaced intervals to give a sound of, "tick...tock...tick...tock"; if they are not, and have the sound  "tick-tock...tick-tock..." the clock is ''out of beat'' and needs to be leveled.  This problem can easily cause the clock to stop working, and is one of the most common reasons for service calls.  A [[spirit level]] or [[watch timing machine]] can achieve a higher accuracy than relying on the sound of the beat; precision regulators often have a built in spirit level for the task.  Older freestanding clocks often have feet with adjustable screws to level them, more recent ones have a leveling adjustment in the movement.  Some modern pendulum clocks have 'auto-beat' or 'self-regulating beat adjustment' devices, and don't need this adjustment.

===Local gravity===
[[File:Reloj de pendulo Ansonia C-1904.jpg|thumb|upright|Pendulum clock Ansonia. C.1904,SANTIAGO, hanging oak gingerbread clock, eight-day time and strike.]]
Since the pendulum rate will increase with an increase in gravity, and local gravity varies with latitude and elevation on Earth, precision pendulum clocks must be readjusted to keep time after a move.  For example, a pendulum clock moved from sea level to {{convert|4000|ft}} will lose 16 seconds per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Torsion pendulum==
{{main|Torsion pendulum clock}}

Also called torsion-spring pendulum, this is a wheel-like mass (most often four spheres on cross spokes) suspended from a vertical strip (ribbon) of spring steel, used as the regulating mechanism in [[torsion pendulum clock]]s.  Rotation of the mass winds and unwinds the suspension spring, with the energy impulse applied to the top of the spring. With a period of 12—15 seconds, compared to the gravity swing pendulum's period of 0.5—2s, it is possible to make clocks that need to be wound only every 30 days, or even only once a year or more. This type is independent of the local force of gravity but is more affected by temperature changes than an uncompensated gravity-swing pendulum. 

A clock requiring only annual winding is sometimes called a "'''400-Day clock"''' or "'''anniversary clock'''", the latter sometimes given as a wedding memorialisation gift.  German firms Schatz and Kieninger &amp; Obergfell (known as "Kundo", from "K und O"), were the main manufacturers of this type of clock&lt;!-- ; it is no longer being produced --&gt;.   The "'''perpetual motion'''" clock, called the [[Atmos clock|Atmos]] because its mechanism was kept wound by changes in atmospheric temperature, also makes use of a torsion pendulum. In this case the oscillation cycle takes a full 60 seconds.

==Escapement==
{{main|Escapement}}
[[File:Anchor escapement animation 217x328px.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Animation of an [[anchor escapement]], one of the most  common [[escapement]]s used in pendulum clocks ]]

The [[escapement]] is a mechanical linkage that converts the force from the clock's [[wheel train]] into impulses that keep the pendulum swinging back and forth.  It is the part that makes the "ticking" sound in a working pendulum clock.  Most escapements consist of a wheel with pointed teeth called the ''escape wheel'' which is turned by the clock's wheel train, and surfaces the teeth push against, called ''pallets''.  During most of the pendulum's swing the wheel is prevented from turning because a tooth is resting against one of the pallets; this is called the "locked" state.  Each swing of the pendulum a pallet releases a tooth of the escape wheel.  The wheel rotates forward a fixed amount until a tooth catches on the other pallet.  These releases allow the clock's wheel train to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the hands forward at a constant rate, controlled by the pendulum. 

Although the escapement is necessary, its force disturbs the natural motion of the pendulum, and in precision pendulum clocks this was often the limiting factor on the accuracy of the clock.  Different escapements have been used in pendulum clocks over the years to try to solve this problem.  In the 18th and 19th century escapement design was at the forefront of timekeeping advances.   The [[anchor escapement]] (see animation) was the standard escapement used until the 1800s when an improved version, the [[deadbeat escapement]] took over in precision clocks.  It is used in almost all pendulum clocks today.  The [[remontoire]], a small spring mechanism rewound at intervals which serves to isolate the escapement from the varying force of the wheel train, was used in a few precision clocks.    In [[tower clock]]s the wheel train must turn the large hands on the clock face on the outside of the building, and the weight of these hands, varying with snow and ice buildup, put a varying load on the wheel train.  [[Escapement#Gravity escapement|Gravity escapements]] were used in tower clocks.           

By the end of the 19th century specialized escapements were used in the most accurate clocks, called ''[[Regulator clock|astronomical regulators]]'', which were employed in [[naval observatory|naval observatories]] and for scientific research.  The [[Riefler escapement]], used in Clemens-Riefler regulator clocks was accurate to 10 milliseconds per day.  Electromagnetic escapements, which used a switch or [[phototube]] to turn on a [[solenoid]] [[electromagnet]] to give the pendulum an impulse without requiring a mechanical linkage, were developed.  The most accurate pendulum clock was the [[Shortt-Synchronome clock]], a complicated electromechanical clock with two pendulums developed in 1923 by W.H. Shortt and [[Frank Hope-Jones]], which was accurate to better than one second per year.  A slave pendulum in a separate clock was linked by an electric circuit and electromagnets to a master pendulum in a vacuum tank.  The slave pendulum performed the timekeeping functions, leaving the master pendulum to swing virtually undisturbed by outside influences.  In the 1920s the Shortt-Synchronome briefly became the highest standard for timekeeping in observatories before [[quartz clock]]s superseded pendulum clocks as precision time standards.

==Time indication==
The indicating system is almost always the traditional [[Clock face|dial]] with moving hour and minute hands.  Many clocks have a small third hand indicating seconds on a subsidiary dial.  Pendulum clocks are usually designed to be set by opening the glass face cover and manually pushing the minute hand around the dial to the correct time.  The minute hand is mounted on a slipping friction sleeve which allows it to be turned on its arbor.  The hour hand is driven not from the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]] but from the minute hand's shaft through a small set of gears, so rotating the minute hand manually also sets the hour hand.

==Styles==
[[File:One-Year German Regulator Clock.jpg|thumb|One-Year German Regulator Clock. Circa 1850]]
Pendulum clocks were more than simply utilitarian timekeepers; they were [[status symbol]]s that expressed the wealth and culture of their owners.  They evolved in a number of traditional styles, specific to different countries and times as well as their intended use.  Case styles somewhat reflect the furniture styles popular during the period.  Experts can often pinpoint when an [[antique]] clock was made within a few decades by subtle differences in their cases and faces.  These are some of the different styles of pendulum clocks:

'''Perfluorononanoic acid''', or '''PFNA''', is a synthetic [[perfluorinated carboxylic acid]] and [[fluorosurfactant]] that is also an [[environmental contaminant]] found in people and wildlife along with [[PFOS]] and [[PFOA]].

==Chemistry and properties==
In acidic form it is a highly reactive strong [[acid]]. In its [[conjugate base]] form as a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] it is stable and commonly ion paired with [[ammonium]]. In the commercial product [[Surflon S-111]] (CAS 72968-3-88) it is the primary compound present by weight. PFNA is used as [[surfactant]] for the production of the [[fluoropolymer]] [[polyvinylidene fluoride]].&lt;ref name=Prevedouros2006&gt;{{cite journal

'''Petrolex Oil &amp; Gas Limited''' is a [[Nigeria]]n company and part of Petrolex Group, an African integrated energy [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. The company was founded in February 2007 by [[Segun Adebutu]], a Nigerian entrepreneur. It  provides services to the [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas industry]].  It is mainly involved in the refining, storage, distribution and retail of [[petroleum product]]s in Nigeria and [[Africa]]. Petrolex is best known for starting in December 2017, the construction of a 3.6 billion dollar high capacity refinery and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]’s largest tank farm as part of  its Mega Oil City project  in [[Ogun State]], Nigeria.&lt;ref name="bloomnigeria1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=   [[The Guardian]]  |title=  Petrolex Group to launch sub-Saharan Africa’s largest tank farm    |url= https://guardian.ng/energy/petrolex-group-to-launch-sub-saharan-africas-largest-tank-farm/  |date= 7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanguardnigeria2"/&gt; 
	
==Background==

Petrolex CEO,  Adebutu  started an oil and fuel trading business around 2005 but showed interest in “mid-stream infrastructure” for $330 million.&lt;ref name="punchng1"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=   [[The Punch| The Punch (Nigeria)]]  |title=  Petrolex invests $330m in Ogun oil city   |url=   http://punchng.com/petrolex-invests-330m-in-ogun-oil-city/   |date= December 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His experience in family business, laid the foundation for new ideas in his business career. Over the years, Adebutu was involved in bold projects including oil and gas, solid minerals, construction and maritime. This background inspired Adebutu to replicate similar practices with his new initiative Petrolex Oil &amp; Gas Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://allafrica.com/stories/201712110038.html |work=  |publisher= allAfrica  |title= Nigeria: Adebutu - We're Investing in Nigeria and Creating a New World of Possibilities  |date= 11 December 2017 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Petrolex announced its plan to build a $3.6 billion refinery plant with an output capacity of 250,000 barrels a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Amosun signs agreement with Petrolex on refinery in Ogun |url=https://www.businessdayonline.com/amosun-signs-agreement-with-petrolex-on-refinery-in-ogun/ |date=29 September 2016 |newspaper=[[Business Day (Nigeria)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oilreviewafrica.com/exploration/exploration/petrolex-to-develop-us-3-6bn-oil-refinery-in-nigeria |work=  |publisher= Oil Review Africa  |title= Petrolex to develop US$3.6bn oil refinery in Nigeria  |date= 8 December 2017 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is currently working on the “front-end engineering design” and will complete construction in 2021.

== Petrolex Mega Oil City project==

Petrolex provides services in refining, storage, distribution and retailing of petroleum products. The company intends to be listed on the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]] in the coming decade. The company launched the planning, design and development of the Petrolex Mega Oil City in Ibefun, Ogun State in  2012.  The complex spreads over 101 square kilometres, about 10 percent the size of [[Lagos State]]. It houses a residential estate for staff, an army barracks, 30 loading gantries for product disbursement, and a 4,000 truck capacity trailer park with accommodation for drivers.&lt;ref name="punchng2"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=   [[The Punch| The Punch (Nigeria)]]  |title=  Petrolex to invest $6bn in Nigeria’s oil, gas sector   |url=  http://punchng.com/petrolex-to-invest-6bn-in-nigerias-oil-gas-sector/    |date= 6 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; The Oil City project is the original idea of Segun Adebutu, CEO of Petrolex and son of the Nigerian entrepreneur Sir Kesington Adebutu.

NASA engineered the product to have relatively low outgassing (a problem in [[vacuum]] and aboard spacecraft), desirable thermal and acoustic performance, as well as uniformity during distribution and application. Typical uses of the foam include ducting, duct/piping insulation, structural components, and strengthening of hollow components while remaining lightweight. In addition to thermal and acoustic properties, polyimide foam is fire resistant, lightweight and non-toxic.

[[File:The Trafalgar Way. Blue Anchor Inn, Fraddon - geograph.org.uk - 1233038.jpg|thumb|How Lapenotiere carried the news from Falmouth to London]]
A '''post-chaise''' is a fast carriage for [[Stage station#Origin|traveling post]] built in the 18th and early 19th centuries. It usually had a closed body on four wheels, sat two to four persons, and was drawn by two or four horses. 

A [[postilion]] rode on the near-side (left, nearest the roadside) horse of a pair or of one of the pairs attached to the post-chaise&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/_events/trafalgar.php "Re-enactment of Lapenotiere's Journey," ''Exeter Memories'', 15 August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving passengers a clear view of the road ahead.
==Purpose==
Hired when long-distance travel at speed was very important a post chaise would be taken with its own [[postilion]]/s and horses.  At the next [[Stage station|posting station]] the postilions would most likely return to their base with their own horses but might continue the journey with fresh horses. 

Private posting was expensive and passengers — particularly if the only passenger was a woman — would be accompanied by one or two of their own [[footman|footmen]] riding above and behind the body of the post chaise. The footmen would be responsible for making all travel arrangements.

Private individuals did own their own post-chaises, some had their [[Chariot (carriage)|light chariots]] made with the coachman’s seat removable. Designed to withstand rapid long-distance travel the post chaise should have been utilitarian but private vehicles might be extravagantly decorated and finished.&lt;ref name=PHD&gt;Paul H. Downing. A History of Carriages, ''The Carriage Journal,'' Page 160, Vol 4, No 4, Spring 1967, Carriage Association of America&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posting==
In a 1967 article in ''The Carriage Journal'', published for the Carriage Association of America, Paul H Downing recounts that the word post is derived from the Latin ''postis'' which in turn derives from the word which means to place an upright timber (a post) as a convenient place to attach a public notice. Postal and postage follow from this. Medieval couriers were ''caballari postarus'' or riders of the posts. The riders mounted fresh horses at each post on their route and then rode on. Post came to be applied to the riders then to the mail they carried and eventually to the whole system. In England regular posts were set up in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=PHD/&gt;

The riders of the posts carried government messages and letters. The local postmasters delivered the letters as well as providing horses to the royal couriers. They also provided horses to other travellers.&lt;ref name=PHD/&gt;
===Post chaise===
The system of ‘’posting’’ was common in France. An artillery officer, John Trull, entered business in England in 1743 hiring out travelling carriages. At first these carriages had two wheels but they were soon replaced by four wheel carriages given the same name, Post-chaise.&lt;ref name=PHD/&gt;

The original French design was amended, a conventional pole was fitted, no driver was provided for — leaving a view through the front window for the passengers — and the horses were ridden by postilions or post-boys. The postilions went from post to post, stayed with their own horses and took them back home at the end of that stage.&lt;ref name=PHD/&gt;

===America===
At that time there was no perfected posting system in America. George Washington’s tour of the South in 1791 had a target (when there were no other commitments) of an average 35 miles a day whereas in England an average speed of 8 or 10 miles an hour might be achieved right round the clock.&lt;ref name=PHD/&gt;

A true chaise is an open two wheeled carriage with a bench seat for two passengers drawn by one or two horses. Given two more wheels it would have been, if the name  had been used then, a phaeton. A phaeton was for the owner to drive and generally drawn by one or two horses. A four-wheeled chaise would be drawn by at least four horses.&lt;ref name=PHD/&gt;

Around the time Trull was introducing post-chaises to England Americans began to use the same name for  what had been called a four-wheeled chaise.&lt;ref name=PHD/&gt;

According to [[Statistics Canada]] there were 60 percent more rail cars transporting crude oil in Canada from February 2012 to February 2013.{{Sfn|CAPP|June 2013|page=29}} . The destination of approximately 48 percent of the crude oil was exported to the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]]; 43 percent went to [[Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts|PADD I]] and the rest to PADD II and PADD V.{{Sfn|CAPP|June 2013|page=29}}

== Railbit tank cars == 
{{quote|These tank cars hold less volume (~550 Bbl) than “regular” tank cars (~650 Bbl) but can move bitumen with a reduced diluent content (17 percent – railbit) or no diluent at all (raw bitumen). A number of rail offloading terminals on the Gulf Coast are being built out to handle raw bitumen so as to improve the economics of crude-by-rail shipments to the US Gulf versus pipeline alternatives. We will get into the economics later in this series but today we start with a review of the largest offloading terminal operation being built so far in Mobile, Alabama.|Fielden (RBN) 16 September 2013}}

{{quote|[O]ne can consider a reasonable range of estimates of the transport penalty, relative to committed pipeline tariffs, associated with transporting oil sands crude by rail from Alberta to the Gulf Coast as follows: rawbit less than $3.00 per barrel (perhaps even more economic than dilbit by pipeline); railbit $5 to $7 per barrel; and dilbit $7 to $9 per barrel. The transport penalty would be lower if rail costs were compared to uncommitted pipeline tariffs, or if diluent were backhauled.|SEIS 2014}}

Sandy Fielden explained the economics behind railbit, dilbit and raw bitumen.&lt;ref name=Fielden_OGFJ_2013&gt;{{citation|title=How rail beats pipeline transport for heavy crude from Alberta to the Gulf|date=16 September 2013|first=Sandy |last=Fielden|institution=RBN Energy|accessdate=6 March 2014|url=http://www.ogfj.com/articles/2013/09/how-rail-beats-pipeline-transport-for-heavy-crude-from-alberta-to-the-gulf.html|journal=Oil and Gas Financial Journal (OGFJ)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|and as long as diluent prices in Canada are more expensive than dilbit on the Gulf Coast. If these price dynamics continue, then moving bitumen by rail can compete with pipelines – so long as the product moved is railbit or raw bitumen – with the latter having a clear advantage. Unit trains also improve the netbacks considerably over the manifest option. Even moving railbit by manifest rail gives a more than $3/Bbl higher netback than dilbit by pipeline. At the moment, however, our survey of load and discharge terminals in Canada and on the Gulf Coast suggests that the infrastructure is not in place yet to take advantage of this opportunity. Where there are unit train facilities built or under construction, they are primarily shipping dilbit, which produces $6/Bbl less netback than pipelines. The railbit facilities are manifest terminals that have a more slender advantage over pipelines. In other words – for rail to trump pipelines from Canada to the US Gulf, shippers must develop unit rail facilities that can handle railbit or better yet can remove all the diluent to ship raw bitumen.[1] We estimated the railbit price as midway between the raw bitumen price and the dilbit price.  In a more rigorous analysis we would use typical refinery yields for raw bitumen, dilbit, and railbit to determine a more accurate value of these different blends on the Gulf Coast.|Fielden (RBN) 16 September 2013}}

== Western Canadian crude oil supply ==

In their June 2013 report, the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) categorized "the various crude oil types that comprise western Canadian crude oil supply:&lt;ref name=CAPP2013&gt;{{citation|title=Crude Oil Forecast, Markets &amp; Transportation|url=http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=227308|date=June 2013|accessdate=7 March 2014|publisher=[[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Various crude oil types''' 
* Conventional Light 
* Conventional Heavy
* Upgraded Light
* Oil Sands Heavy, for example, ([[Western Canadian Select]])
 
'''Oil Sands Heavy'''

''"Oil Sands Heavy includes some volumes of upgraded heavy sour crude oil and bitumen blended with diluent or ugpraded crude oil."''&lt;ref name=CAPP2013 /&gt; 
* upgraded heavy sour crude oil 
* bitumen diluted with upgraded light crude oil (also known as “'''SynBit'''”) [[Synthetic crude|synthetic crude oil]] (SCO)
* bitumen diluted with condensate (also known as “'''DilBit'''”). "Blending for DilBit differs by project but requires approximately a 70:30 bitumen to condensate ratio while the blending ratio for SynBit is approximately 50:50."&lt;ref name=CAPP2013 /&gt; 
* '''Railbit''' "Bitumen volumes transported by rail are currently relatively minor; however, these volumes would require less diluent for blending versus moving by pipeline or may even be transported as raw bitumen."&lt;ref name=CAPP2013 /&gt;

[[Condensation|Condensate]] is a "mixture of mainly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons. It may be gaseous in its reservoir state but is liquid at the conditions under which its volumes is measured or estimated."&lt;ref name=CAPP2013 /&gt;{{rp|2}}

'''Sleep mode''' is a low power mode for electronic devices such as computers, televisions, and remote controlled devices. These modes save significantly on electrical consumption compared to leaving a device fully on and, upon resume, allow the user to avoid having to reissue instructions or to wait for a machine to [[booting|reboot]]. Many devices signify this power mode with a pulsed or red colored [[LED]] power light.

==Computers==
In computers, entering a sleep state is roughly equivalent to "pausing" the state of the machine. When restored, the operation continues from the same point, having the same applications and files open.

===Sleep===
Sleep mode has gone by various names, including ''Stand By'', ''Suspend'' and ''Suspend to RAM'' . Machine state is held in [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and, when placed in sleep mode, the computer cuts power to unneeded subsystems and places the RAM into a minimum power state, just sufficient to retain its data. Because of the large power saving, most laptops automatically enter this mode when the computer is running on batteries and the lid is closed. If undesired, the behavior can be altered in the [[operating system]] settings.

A computer must consume some energy while sleeping in order to power the RAM and to be able to respond to a wake-up event. A sleeping PC is a case of a machine on [[standby power]], and this is covered by regulations in many countries, for example in the United States limiting such power under the [[One Watt Initiative]], from 2010. In addition to a wake-up press of the power button, PCs can also respond to other wake cues, such as from keyboard, mouse, [[Wake-on-ring| incoming telephone call on a modem]], or [[Wake on lan|local area network signal]]..

===Hibernation===
{{Main article|Hibernation (computing)}}
Hibernation, also called '''Suspend to Disk''' on Linux, saves all computer operational data on the fixed disk before turning the computer off completely. On switching the computer back on, the computer is restored to its state prior to hibernation, with all programs and files open, and unsaved data intact. In contrast with standby mode, hibernation mode saves the computer's state on the hard disk, which requires no power to maintain, whereas standby mode saves the computer's state in RAM, which requires a small amount of power to maintain.

===Hybrid sleep===
Sleep mode and hibernation can be combined: the contents of RAM are first copied to non-volatile storage like for regular hibernation, but then, instead of powering down, the computer enters sleep mode. This approach combines the benefits of sleep mode and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, but it can also be powered down completely (e.g. due to loss of power) without loss of data, because it is already effectively in a state of hibernation. This mode is called "'''hybrid sleep'''" in [[Microsoft Windows]] other than Windows XP.

A hybrid mode is supported by some portable [[Apple Macintosh]] computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/10328.html |publisher=Apple Inc |title=About safe sleep |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402174856/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac%2F10.5%2Fen%2F10328.html |archivedate=April 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; compatible hardware running [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows Vista|Vista]] or newer, as well as [[Linux]] distributions running kernel 3.6 or newer.

===ACPI===
[[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is the current standard for [[power management]], superseding [[Advanced Power Management|APM]] (Advanced Power Management) and providing the backbone for sleep and [[Hibernate (OS feature)|hibernation]] on modern computers. Sleep mode corresponds to ACPI mode '''S3'''. When a non-ACPI device is plugged in, Windows will sometimes disable stand-by functionality for the whole operating system. Without ACPI functionality, as seen on older hardware, sleep mode is usually restricted to turning off the monitor and spinning down the hard drive.

==Reliability==
When sleep mode was first introduced, not all PC hardware supported it correctly, which could cause problems with peripherals that didn't detect the transition. This is rarely a problem with newer hardware and newer versions of Windows.

==Microsoft Windows==
[[Microsoft Windows 2000]] and later support sleep at the operating system level (OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state) without special drivers from the hardware manufacturer. [[Windows Vista]]'s Fast Sleep and Resume feature saves the contents of volatile memory to hard disk before entering sleep mode (aka Hybrid sleep). If power to memory is lost, it will use the hard disk to wake up. The user has the option of hibernating directly if they wish.

In older versions prior to Windows Vista, sleep mode was under-used in business environments as it was [[Green computing#Operating system support|difficult to enable organization-wide]] without resorting to third-party [[PC power management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datasynergy.co.uk/PowerManagerHome.aspx Enable hibernate using group policy]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these earlier versions of Windows were criticized for wasting energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php EcoGeek - How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

There remains a market in third-party [[PC power management]] software for newer versions of Windows, offering features beyond those built into the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsitpro.com/windows/buyers-guide-power-management-software-windows-workstations|title=Power Management Software for Windows Workstations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|title=Energy Star Commercial Packages List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|author=The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|title=HMC: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Building for Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315230900/http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|archivedate=2012-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most products offer [[Active Directory]] integration and per-user/per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans, scheduled power plans, anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting.

==macOS==
Sleep on [[Macintosh|Macs]] running [[macOS]] consist of the traditional sleep, '''Safe Sleep''', and '''Power Nap'''. In [[System Preferences]], Safe Sleep&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4249 OS X Lion: What is safe sleep?]&lt;/ref&gt; is referred to as sleep. Since Safe Sleep also allowed state to be restored in an event of a power outage, unlike other operating systems, [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernate]] was never offered as an option.

In 2005, some Macs running [[Mac OS X v10.4]] began to support Safe Sleep. The feature saves the contents of volatile memory to the system hard disk each time the Mac enters Sleep mode. The Mac can instantaneously wake from sleep mode if power to the RAM has not been lost. However, if the power supply was interrupted, such as when removing batteries without an AC power connection, the Mac would wake from Safe Sleep instead, restoring memory contents from the hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1757 Apple Portables: Progress bar appears after waking from sleep]&lt;/ref&gt;

Safe Sleep capability is found in Mac models starting with the October 2005 revision of the [[PowerBook G4]] (Double-Layer SD{{vague|What is meant by Double-Layer SD?|date=March 2015}}). [[Mac OS X v10.4]] or higher is also required.  A hack enabled the feature as well on older Macs running Mac OS X v10.4.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080105000720/http://andrewescobar.com/archive/2005/11/11/how-to-safe-sleep-your-mac/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Apple introduced Power Nap with [[OS X Mountain Lion]] (10.8) and select Mac models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/mac-answers/os-x-mountain-lion-faq/what-is-power-nap-compatible-macs.html|title=What is Power Nap? Power Nap Macs &amp; Hack Possibilities @ EveryMac.com|last=LLC|first=Kyle Media|website=www.everymac.com|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power Nap allows the Mac to perform tasks silently, such as iCloud syncing and Spotlight indexing. Only low energy tasks are performed when on battery power, while higher energy tasks are performed with AC power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204032|title=How Power Nap works on your Mac|newspaper=Apple Support|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicode==
Because of widespread use of this symbol, a campaign was launched to add a set of power characters to [[Unicode]].&lt;ref name=Unicode&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicode Proposal 14009 Power Symbol|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14009-power-symbol.pdf|website=Unicode|publisher=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=Dec 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, the proposal was accepted by Unicode and the characters were included in Unicode 9.0,.&lt;ref name="unicode90"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2016/01/whats-new-in-unicode-90.html | title = What's new in Unicode 9.0? | first = Andrew | last = West | date = 2016-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters are in the "[[Miscellaneous Technical]]" block, with code points 23FB-FE.&lt;ref name="unicode90-misc"&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-9.0/U90-2300.pdf | title = Unicode Chart - Miscellaneous Technical - Range: 2300–23F | date = 2016-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''They Killed Sister Dorothy''''' is a 2008 documentary film about American-born Brazilian nun [[Dorothy Stang]], who was murdered on February 12, 2005, in [[Anapu, Brazil|Anapu]], a city located in the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. Directed by [[Daniel Junge]], the film is narrated by [[Martin Sheen]] in the English version and by [[Wagner Moura]] in the Portuguese version.

==Plot==
The film traces the reasons of the murder of [[Dayton, Ohio]], native Dorothy Mae Stang, a 73-year-old [[nun]] of the [[Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur]] [[Religious order|order]] who fought for the preservation of the Amazon Rainforest in the Brazilian state of [[Pará]]. It also follows the trial of those convicted for murdering Stang.

==Release and awards==
The film received the Audience Award and the Competition Award at the 2008 [[South by Southwest|South by Southwest Festival]], where it had its worldwide premiere. In Brazil, where the film title received a literal translation, it premiered at the 2007 Rio de Janeiro Film Festival. It was also screened at the 32nd São Paulo International Film Festival. It is planned to receive a nationwide release on February 13, 2009.

The film and its song "Forever", written and performed by [[Bebel Gilberto]], daughter of [[Bossa Nova]] pioneer [[João Gilberto]], were pre-selected for the [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], respectively.

[[File:Tranoljelampa, Lyse socken, Bohuslän, 1800-tal.JPG|thumb|Whale oil lamp in brown-glazed earthenware with candle bowl for the wick and base drip pan. Lyse parish, [[Bohuslän]] - now in [[Nordiska museet]], Stockholm, Sweden]]

'''Whale oil''' is [[oil]] obtained from the [[blubber]] of [[whale]]s. Whale oil was sometimes known as '''train oil''', which comes from the Dutch word ''traan'' ("tear" or "drop").

[[Sperm oil]], a special kind of oil obtained from the head cavities of [[sperm whale]]s, differs chemically from ordinary whale oil: it is composed mostly of liquid wax.  Its properties and applications differ from those of regular whale oil, and is sold at a higher price when marketed.

==Source and use==
Early industrial societies used whale oil widely in [[oil lamp]]s and to make soap and [[margarine]].  With the commercial development of the [[petroleum industry]] and vegetable oils, the use of whale oils declined considerably from its peak in the 19th century into the 20th century. In the 21st century, with most countries having banned [[whaling]], the sale and use of whale oil has practically ceased.

Whale oil was obtained by boiling strips of [[blubber]] harvested from whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rodney |last=Barfield |year=1995 |title=Seasoned by Salt |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=64 |isbn=0-8078-2231-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The removal is known as "[[flensing]]" and the boiling process was called "[[try pot|trying out]]".  The boiling was carried out on land in the case of whales caught close to shore or beached.  On longer deep-sea whaling expeditions, the trying-out was done on the ship, so that the waste carcass could be thrown away to make room for the next catch.

[[Baleen whale]]s were generally the main source of whale oil.

They are slow and docile, and they float when killed.

==Chemistry==
Whale oil has low viscosity (lower than [[olive oil]]),&lt;ref name="etb_viscosity"/&gt; is clear, and varies in color from a bright honey yellow to a dark brown, according to the condition of the blubber from which it has been extracted and the refinement through which it went. It has a strong fishy odor.  When hydrogenated, it turns solid and white and its taste and odor change.&lt;ref name="E3r5DgPUC 1982 pg 231"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-miE3r5DgPUC&amp;pg=PA228 Joh. N.

The composition of whale oil varies with the species from which it was sourced and the method by which it was harvested and processed.  Whale oil is mainly composed of [[triglyceride]]s&lt;ref name="books.google.be"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zIq9UBNQOskC&amp;pg=PA183 Moninder Mohan Chakrabarty (2009). ''Chemistry And Technology Of Oils And Fats''. pg 183]&lt;/ref&gt; (molecules of [[fatty acid]]s attached to a [[glycerol]] molecule).  Oil sourced from toothed whales contains a substantial amount of wax esters (especially the [[sperm oil|oil of sperm whales]]).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;  Most of the fatty acids are unsaturated.  The most common fatty acids are [[oleic acid]] and its isomers (18:1 carbon chains).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nestor R. |last=Bottino |year=1971 |title=The composition of marine-oil triglycerides as determined by silver ion-thin-layer chromatography |journal=Journal of Lipid Research |volume=12 |issue= |pages=24–30 |doi= |url=http://www.jlr.org/content/12/1/24.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:US Whale Oil and Sperm Oil Imports (1805-1905).jpg|thumb|American whale oil and sperm oil imports in the 19th century]]
The use of whale oil had a steady decline starting in the late 19th century due to the development of superior alternatives, and later, the passing of environmental laws. In 1986, the [[International Whaling Commission]] declared a moratorium on commercial whaling, which has all but eliminated the use of whale oil today.  The [[Inuit]] of North America are granted special whaling rights (justified as being integral to their culture), and they still use whale oil as a food and as lamp oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|rjjxUE6XSdQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Aboriginal whaling]].

Whale oil was used as a cheap illuminant, though it gave off a strong odor when burnt and was not very popular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3HOpg4UamUC&amp;pg=PA232 Wilson Heflin (2004). ''Herman Melville's Whaling Years''. pg 232]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was replaced in the late 19th century by cheaper, more efficient, and longer-lasting [[kerosene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/how-capitalism-saved-the-whales/|title=Thefreemanonline.org|author=|date=|website=www.thefreemanonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burning fluid]] known as [[camphine]] was the dominant replacement for whale oil until the arrival of kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/this-post-is-hopelessly-long-w|title=The "Whale Oil Myth"|author=|date=|website=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, whale oil was used in cars as a constituent of [[automatic transmission fluid]] until it was banned by the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4-K0JiefZEoC&amp;pg=PA262|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=1 May 1975|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, whale oil was used in toolmaking machinery as a high-quality lubricant &lt;ref&gt;Norman Atkinson, Sir Joseph Whitworth (Sutton Publishing 1996), p161.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invention of [[hydrogenation]] in the early 20th century, whale oil was used to make margarine,&lt;ref name="E3r5DgPUC 1982 pg 231"/&gt; a practice that has since been discontinued. Whale oil in margarine has been replaced by vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scran.ac.uk/packs/exhibitions/learning_materials/webs/40/margarine.htm|title=Whale oil and margarine|author=|date=|website=www.scran.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whale oil was used to make soap.  Until the invention of hydrogenation, it was used only in industrial-grade cleansers, because its foul smell and tendency to discolor made it unsuitable for cosmetic soap.&lt;ref name="Webb144"/&gt;

Whale oil was widely used in the First World War as a preventive measure against [[trench foot]]. A British infantry battalion on the Western Front could be expected to use 10 gallons of whale oil a day. The oil was rubbed directly onto bare feet in order to protect them from the effects of immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWfoot.htm|title=Trench Foot|author=|date=|website=spartacus-educational.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature, fiction, and memoirs==
The pursuit and use of whale oil, along with many other [[History of whaling|aspects of whaling]], are discussed in [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. In the novel, the preciousness of the substance to contemporary American society is emphasized when the fictional narrator notes that whale oil is "as rare as the milk of queens." [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast in 1802–1805, describes how whale oil was used as a condiment with every dish, even strawberries.

[[Friedrich Ratzel]] in ''The History of Mankind'' (1896), when discussing food materials in Oceania, quoted Captain [[James Cook]]'s comment in relation to "the Maoris" saying "No Greenlander was ever so sharp set upon train-oil as our friends here, they greedily swallowed the stinking droppings when we were boiling down the fat of dog-fish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedrich|first1=Ratzel|title=The Races of OceaniaLabour, Dwellings and Food in OceaniaSimilarities and coincidences in labour and implements of labour, Food|url=http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/oceania-food.htm|website=inquirewithin.biz|accessdate=10 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430110931/http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/oceania-food.htm|archivedate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunwall, a port city in the video game ''[[Dishonored]]'' (2012) and ''[[Dishonored 2]]'' (2016), uses supernaturally-enhanced whale oil as a basis for its industrial revolution.

''[[In the Heart of the Sea (film)|In the Heart of the Sea]]'' (2015) is a film based on the book ''[[In the Heart of the Sea|of the same name]]'' by [[Nathaniel Philbrick]].

'''Wood carving''' is a form of [[woodworking]] by means of a cutting tool (knife) in one hand or a [[chisel]] by two hands or with one hand on a chisel and one hand on a mallet, resulting in a wooden figure or [[figurine]], or in the [[sculpture|sculptural]] ornamentation of a wooden object. The phrase may also refer to the finished product, from individual [[sculpture]]s to hand-worked mouldings composing part of a [[tracery]].

The making of sculpture in wood has been [[History of wood carving|extremely widely practiced]], but survives much less well than the other main materials such as [[Stone sculpture|stone]] and [[bronze]], as it is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire.  It therefore forms an important hidden element in the [[art history]] of many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Martin Robertson, ''A shorter history of Greek art'', p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, {{ISBN|0-521-28084-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28084-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22monumental+sculpture%22&amp;ei=iiL3SbqpFZS6M8Hm0eQD Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;   Outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so it is still unknown how the [[totem pole]] tradition developed.  Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and so are the great majority of [[African sculpture]] and that of [[Oceania]] and other regions.  Wood is light and can take very fine detail so it is highly suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be worn or carried.  It is also much easier to work on than stone.

Some of the finest extant examples of early European wood carving are from the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Germany]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], where the typical themes of that era were [[Iconography#Christian iconography|Christian iconography]]. In England, many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century, where [[oak]] was the preferred medium.

===Wood carving process===

====Selection====
The nature of the wood being carved limits the scope of the carver in that wood is not equally strong in all directions: it is an [[anisotropic]] material. The direction in which wood is strongest is called "[[wood grain|grain]]" (grain may be straight, interlocked, wavy or fiddleback, ''etc''.). It is smart to arrange the more delicate parts of a design along the grain instead of across it. Often however a "line of best fit" is instead employed, since a design may have multiple weak points in different directions, or orientation of these along the grain would necessitate carving detail on end grain, (which is considerably more difficult). Carving blanks are also sometimes assembled, as with carousel horses, out of many smaller boards, and in this way one can orient different areas of a carving in the most logical way, both for the carving process and for durability. Less commonly, this same principle is used in solid pieces of wood, where the fork of two branches is utilized for its divergent grain, or a branch off of a larger log is carved into a beak (this was the technique employed for traditional Welsh shepherd's crooks, and some Native American adze handles). The failure to appreciate these primary rules may constantly be seen in damaged work, when it will be noticed that, whereas tendrils, tips of birds beaks, etc., arranged across the grain have been broken away, similar details designed more in harmony with the growth of the wood and not too deeply undercut remain intact.{{sfn|Crallan|1911|p=791}}

Probably the two most common woods used for carving&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodcraftguild.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CarvingWoods.pdf Woods suitable for carving].  Woodcraft Guild, June 2012.  Accessed 2016-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt; in North America are [[basswood]] (aka tilia or lime) and [[tupelo]]; both are [[hardwood]]s that are relatively easy to work with. [[Chestnut]], butternut, oak, [[Walnut|American walnut]], [[mahogany]] and [[teak]] are also very good woods; while for fine work Italian walnut, [[sycamore maple]], [[apple]], [[pear]], [[Buxus|box]] or [[plum]], are usually chosen.{{sfn|Crallan|1911|p=791}} Decoration that is to be painted and of not too delicate a nature is often carved in [[pine]], which is relatively soft and inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.langevinforest.com/en/expertise/tips/carving/carving-woods Best types of wood to use for carving].  Langevin Forest. (Accessed 2016-11-18.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sculpture====
[[File:Statuette Mambia Nigéria.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Mambila]] figure, Nigeria]]
A wood carver begins a new carving by selecting a chunk of wood the approximate size and shape of the figure he or she wishes to create or, if the carving is to be large, several pieces of wood may be [[laminate]]d together to create the required size. The type of wood is important. [[Hardwood]]s are more difficult to shape but have greater luster and longevity. Softer woods may be easier to carve but are more prone to damage. Any wood can be carved but they all have different qualities and characteristics. The choice will depend on the requirements of carving being done: for example a detailed figure would need a wood with a fine grain and very little figure as strong figure can interfere with 'reading' fine detail.

Once the sculptor has selected their wood, he or she begins a general shaping process using gouges of various sizes. The gouge is a curved blade that can remove large portions of wood smoothly. For harder woods, the sculptor may use gouges sharpened with stronger bevels, about 35 degrees, and a mallet similar to a stone carver's. The terms ''gouge'' and ''chisel'' are open to confusion. Correctly, a gouge is a tool with a curved cross section and a chisel is a tool with a flat cross section. However, professional carvers tend to refer to them all as 'chisels'. Smaller sculptures may require the wood carver to use a knife, and larger pieces might require the use of a saw. No matter what wood is selected or tool used, the wood sculptor must always carve either across or with the grain of the wood, never against the grain.

Once the general shape is made, the carver may use a variety of tools for creating details. For example, a “veiner” or “fluter” can be used to make deep gouges into the surface, or a “v-tool” for making fine lines or decorative cuts. Once the finer details have been added, the wood carver finishes the surface. The method chosen depends on the required quality of surface finish. The texture left by shallow gouges gives 'life' to the carving's surface and many carvers prefer this 'tooled' finish. If a completely smooth surface is required general smoothing can be done with tools such as “rasps,” which are flat-bladed tools with a surface of pointed teeth. “Rifflers” are similar to rasps, but smaller, usually double ended, and of various shapes for working in folds or crevasses. The finer polishing is done with abrasive paper. Large grained paper with a rougher surface is used first, with the sculptor then using finer grained paper that can make the surface of the sculpture slick to the touch.

After the carving and finishing is completed, the artist may seal &amp; color the wood with a variety of natural oils, such as walnut or linseed oil which protects the wood from dirt and moisture. Oil also imparts a sheen to the wood which, by reflecting light, helps the observer 'read' the form. Carvers seldom use gloss [[varnish]] as it creates too shiny a surface, which reflects so much light it can confuse the form; carvers refer to this as 'the toffee apple effect'. Objects made of wood are frequently finished with a layer of wax, which protects the wood and gives a soft lustrous sheen. A wax finish (e.g. shoe polish) is comparatively fragile though and only suitable for indoor carvings.

==Traditions==
The making of [[decoy]]s and [[fish carving]] are two of the artistic traditions that use wood carvings.

From 1918-22 it was the capital of the [[Tripolitanian Republic]], the first formal [[republic]] in the Arab world. Before 2001 it was in the [[‘Aziziya District]] and its capital. ‘Aziziya is a major trade centre of the Sahel Jeffare plateau, being on a trade route from the coast to the [[Nafusa Mountains]] and the [[Fezzan]] region to the south {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

==Geography and climate==
On 13 September 1922, a high temperature of {{convert|58.0|C|F}} was recorded in Al-ʿAzīzīyah. This was long considered the [[List of weather records|highest temperature ever measured]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html |title=Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation|work=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]]|accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Death_Valley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-temperature |title=World: Highest Temperature |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |year=2012 |work=World Weather / Climate Extremes Archive |publisher=Arizona State University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104143844/http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-temperature |archivedate=4 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=El_Azizia&gt;{{cite journal|last=El Fadli|first=KI|title=World Meteorological Organization Assessment of the Purported World Record 58°C Temperature Extreme at El Azizia, Libya (13 September 1922)|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|date=September 2012|doi=10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1|volume=94|issue=2|page=199|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2013BAMS...94..199E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The weather station was first in 'Aziziya town, but, in 1919, it was moved to a hilltop fort, where the [[weather station]] was set up on black [[tarmacadam|tarmac]], which would have absorbed more sunlight and made the air there artificially hotter, explaining a period of very hot readings there from 1919 to 1928.
# Shortly before the record reading on 13 September 1922, the weather station's usual [[maximum thermometer]] had been damaged and then replaced by an un[[calibrated]], ordinary [[maximum-minimum thermometer]] such as often used in [[greenhouse]]s.
#On 11 September 1922, the usual record keeper was replaced by an inexperienced observer, who was untrained in the use of the thermometer and the record log. This is known by the change in handwriting on the log sheets and by the high and low temperatures being recorded in the wrong columns. The thermometer used sliding colored cylinders to record maximum and minimum temperatures, and these cylinders were about 7 to 8 degrees Celsius long on the thermometer scale. The WMO now believes that the inexperienced observer was reading from the wrong end of the high-temperature cylinder inside the thermometer, getting a reading which was 7 to 8 degrees too high.
#On 13 September 2012, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] announced that the WMO Commission of Climatology World Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes had found that the record was invalid. Its world record for hottest temperature is now 56.7&amp;nbsp;°C (134.1&amp;nbsp;°F), recorded on 10 July 1913 at Greenland Ranch in [[Death Valley|Death Valley, California]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/no-956-ninety-year-old-world-temperature-record-el-azizia-libya-invalid-improved |title=WMO Press release No. 956|date=13 September 2012|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
