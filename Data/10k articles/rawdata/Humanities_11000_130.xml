{{one source|date=February 2017}}
'''Ai apaec''' (from the Mochica Aiapæc [a.ja.pøk] or [aiapøk]), also called ''degollador'' was the chief deity of the [[Moche (culture)|Mochica]] culture, was one of their gods punishers, the most feared and adored, is also called the headsman. Ai Apaec was worshiped as the creator god, protector of the Moche, a provider of water, food and military triumphs. Aiapaec means 'doer' in [[Moche (culture)|Mochica]] language.

==Representations==

The most common representation of Ai Apaec is that seen in the murals of the Temples of the moon and sun (picture), which presents an anthropomorphic face with feline fangs and surrounding ocean waves.
 
Ai apaec was represented in several ways, depending on the period, place, and support used.  In metallurgy, for example, Ai apaec is often seen as a spider with eight legs and an anthropomorphic face with jaguar fangs.  In ceramics the divinity is often more anthropomorphic, usually with his head in his hands and sometimes with two snakes sprouting from his head (hair??). In sculpture he is shown with a staff.
 
It is said that during human sacrifices, prisoners were decapitated and their heads given to Ai apaec.

==In popular culture==
[[Ai Apaec (comics)|Ai Apaec]] is a villain in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is depicted as having the torso of a human male (with snakes for hair and large fangs) with the lower body of an enormous spider.  Recruited by [[Norman Osborn]], he is given a special serum that changes him into a six armed version of [[Spider-Man]].  In this form he is a member of Osborne's second version of the [[Dark Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #175&lt;/ref&gt;  He first appeared in ''Osborn'' #1 (2011). He also makes an appearance during the [[Spider-Island]] saga.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu''&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also depicted as a Jaguar God who empowers Jaguar in Archie Comics New Crusaders.

==History==
The Ancient Kano City Walls were built as a [[defensive wall]] with the construction of the foundation laid by Sarki Gijimasu (1095–1134), the third king of in the [[Kano Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ki-Zerbo|first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Ki-Zerbo |title=UNESCO General History of Africa, Vol. IV, Abridged Edition: Africa from the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century |year=1998 |publisher= [[University of California Press]] |isbn=0-520-06699-5 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 14th century during the reign of Zamnagawa, the wall was completed before it was further expanded during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thenationonlineng.net/salvaging-kano-citys-crumbling-walls/ | title=Salvaging Kano City’s crumbling Walls | work=[[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]] | date=11 February 2014 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historians, the then General-Governor of the Colony and Protectorate of [[Nigeria]], [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Fredrick Lugard]], wrote in a 1903 report about the Kano Walls that he had “never seen anything like it in Africa” after capturing the ancient city of Kano along with British forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bawuro M.

'''Aphasiology''' is the study of [[language]] impairment usually resulting from [[brain damage]], due to  neurovascular accident—hemorrhage, stroke—or associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including different types of [[dementia]]. It is also the name of a [[scientific journal]] covering the area. These specific language deficits, termed [[aphasia]]s, may be defined as impairments of language production or comprehension that cannot be attributed to trivial causes such as [[deafness]] or oral [[paralysis]].  A number of aphasias have been described, but two are best known:  [[expressive aphasia]] (Broca's aphasia) and [[receptive aphasia]] (Wernicke's or sensory aphasia).

==Acute aphasias==
'''Acute aphasias''' are often the result of tissue damage following a [[stroke]].

===Expressive aphasia===
{{Main article|Expressive aphasia}}
First described by the [[France|French]] neurologist [[Paul Broca]] in the nineteenth century, expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits.&lt;ref name="Burns 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burns MS, Fahy J |title=Broca's area: rethinking classical concepts from a neuroscience perspective |journal=Top Stroke Rehabil |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=401–10 |year=2010 |pmid=21239364 |doi=10.1310/tsr1706-401 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a halting speech consisting mainly of content words, i.e. nouns and verbs, and, at least in [[English language|English]], distinctly lacking small grammatical function words such as articles and prepositions.  This observation gave rise to the terms telegraphic speech and, more recently, [[agrammatism]].  The extent to which expressive aphasics retain knowledge of grammar is a matter of considerable controversy.  Nonetheless, because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved, and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across, the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences.&lt;ref name="Hillis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hillis AE |title=Aphasia: progress in the last quarter of a century |journal=Neurology |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=200–13 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17620554 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000265600.69385.6f |url=http://cel.huji.ac.il/courses/structureandprocesses/Bibliography/Hillis_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of expressive aphasia as an expressive disorder is supported by its frequent co-occurrence with facial motor difficulties, and its anatomical localization.  Although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions, it is most commonly associated with the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], a region that overlaps with [[motor cortex]] controlling the [[Human mouth|mouth]] and [[tongue]], extending into the periventricular white matter.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Albert, Martin L. |author2=Helm-Estabrooks, Nancy |title=Manual of aphasia and aphasia therapy |publisher=Pro-Ed |location=Austin, Tex |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-89079-963-6 |oclc=51009586 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, this region has come to be known as "[[Broca's area]]".  However, an intriguing line of research has demonstrated specific comprehension deficits in expressive aphasics as well.  These deficits generally involve sentences that are grammatical, but atypical in their word order.  The simplest example is sentences in the [[passive voice]], such as "The boy was chased by the girl."  Expressive aphasics may have quite a hard time realizing that the girl is doing the chasing, but they do much better with "The mouse was chased by the cat," where world knowledge constraints contribute to the correct interpretation.  However, "The cat was chased by the mouse" would likewise be incomprehensible.  This evidence suggests that grammatical competence may be a specific function of Broca's area.

Lesions exclusively to Broca's area (the foot of the [[inferior frontal gyrus]]) do not produce Broca's aphasia, but instead mild [[dysprosody]] and [[agraphia]], sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild [[dysarthria]]. Not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce Broca's aphasia, but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-Rolandic motor strip (the motor cortex region responsible [[glossopharyngeal]] muscle control) is also necessary.

===Receptive aphasia===
{{Main article|Receptive aphasia}}
Receptive aphasia was originally described by the German neurologist [[Karl Wernicke]], a contemporary of Broca.  Receptive aphasics produce speech that seems fluent and grammatical, but is largely devoid of sensible content.  Comprehension is severely impaired, but while patients display a great deal of difficulty comprehending individual words, they can more easily understand words in context.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt;  Receptive aphasia is associated with the posterior third of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the distribution of the inferior division of the [[middle cerebral artery]],&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt; known as "[[Wernicke's area]]", an area adjacent to the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] responsible for auditory processing.  If the damage extends posteriorly, visual connections are disrupted, and the patient will have difficulty understanding written language. Therefore, the localization of the two best-known aphasias mirrors the grossest dichotomy in brain organization:  anterior areas are specialized for motor output, and posterior areas for sensory processing.

A fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language, who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to Expressive and Receptive aphasias in hearing populations.  These studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of Broca's area and the semantic functions of Wernicke's area are indeed deep, abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression.

===Global aphasia===
{{Main article|Global aphasia}}
Another less commonly known aphasia is [[global aphasia]], which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs, including infarction of both divisions of the [[middle cerebral artery]] and generally both Broca's area and Wernicke's area.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt; Survivors with global aphasia may have great difficulty understanding and forming words and sentences, and generally experience a great deal of difficulty when trying to communicate.&lt;ref name="Hillis 2007"/&gt; With considerable speech therapy rehabilitation, global aphasia may progress into expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia.

===Anomic aphasia===
{{Main article|Anomic aphasia}}
A person with [[anomic aphasia]] have word-finding difficulties. Anomic aphasia, also known as anomia, is a non-fluent aphasia, which means the person speaks hesitantly because of a difficulty naming words and/or producing correct syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gale|first=Thomson|title=Anomia|url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/anomia|work=Healthline|publisher=Gale Encyclopedia of Public Health|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The person struggles to find the right words for speaking and writing.&lt;ref name="Maher 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maher LM, Raymer AM |title=Management of anomia |journal=Top Stroke Rehabil |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=10–21 |year=2004 |pmid=14872396 |doi= 10.1310/318R-RMD5-055J-PQ40|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects tend to use circumulations, in which they speak around the word they can not find, to make up for their loss. People also with anomic aphasia tend to know how to use an object, but rather can not name the aforementioned object.  Any damage in or near the zone of language can result in anomic aphasia. Other forms of aphasia often transition into a syndrome of primarily anomic aphasia in the process of recovery.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt;

===Conduction aphasia===
{{Main article|Conduction aphasia}}
Conduction Aphasia is a rare form of aphasia in which fibres in the arcuate fasciculus and [[superior longitudinal fasciculus]] are damaged.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt; These fibres are the link between the Wernicke's and Broca's area. Damage to the area connecting comprehension and expression together has the following symptoms: fluent speech, good comprehension, poor oral reading, repetition is poor and transpositions of sounds within words is very common.

==Primary progressive aphasias==
{{Main article|Primary progressive aphasia}}
'''Primary progressive aphasia''' is a rare disorder where people slowly lose their ability to talk, read, write, and comprehend what they hear in conversation over a period of time.

==History==

The nineteenth century marked the most important time in the evolution of aphasiology, beginning with the works of [[Franz Josef Gall]]. Gall is the founder of the more modern localization theory and is the origin of the idea of a language center in the brain. However, supporting evidence for the theory that language had its own anatomical representation was not found until the case study of Mr. Leborgne, also known as Tan, by Paul Broca in 1861. The discovery of what is now known as Broca's area was followed years later by Carl Wernicke's famous work, 'The Symptom-Complex of Aphasia: A Psychological Study on an Anatomical Basis' in 1874. This paper is regarded as one of the most influential works in the history of the field of aphasiology. In it, Wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;Tesak, Juergen; &amp; Code, Chris (2008).

The '''Arctic Council''' is a high-level [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] forum that addresses issues faced by the [[Arctic]] governments and the [[indigenous people of the Arctic]]. Eight member countries constitute the council: [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]] as these are the eight countries with sovereignty over the lands within the [[Arctic Circle]]. Outside these, there are some observer states.

== History of the Arctic Council ==
The first step towards the formation of the Council occurred in 1991 when the eight Arctic countries signed the [[Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy]] (AEPS). The 1996 Ottawa Declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Arctic Council membership ==
=== Member states===
Only states with territory in the Arctic can be members of the Council. All eight countries are members making the Arctic Council a circumpolar forum. The Council also has permanent and ad hoc observer countries and "permanent participants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = About the Arctic Council
 | website =
 | publisher = The Arctic Council
 | date = April 7, 2011
 | url = http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/about-us/arctic-council/about-arctic-council
 | accessdate = Sep 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/about-us/member-states Member States]&lt;/ref&gt;

The member states consist of the following:
* [[Canada]]
* [[Denmark]]; representing
** [[Greenland]]
** [[Faroe Islands]]
* [[Finland]]
* [[Iceland]]
* [[Norway]]
* [[Russia]]
* [[Sweden]]
* [[United States]]

=== Observer countries ===
Observer status is open to non-Arctic states approved by the Council at the Ministerial Meetings that occur once every two years. Observers have no voting rights in the Council. As of May 2017, thirteen non-Arctic states have Observer status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Category: Observers |url=http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/about-us/arctic-council/observers |title=Six non-arctic countries have been admitted as observers to the Arctic Council: |publisher=Arctic-council.org |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/india-enters-arctic-council-as-observer/article4717770.ece |title=India enters Arctic Council as observer |publisher=Thehindu.com |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observer states receive invitations for most Council meetings. Their participation in projects and task forces within the Working Groups is not always possible, but this poses few problems as few Observer States want to participate at such a detailed level.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghattas |first=Kim |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22528594 |title=Arctic Council: John Kerry steps into Arctic diplomacy |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observer states consist of the following (2017):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/about-us/arctic-council/observers Thirteen Non-arctic States have been approved as Observers to the Arctic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Germany]], 1998
* [[Netherlands]], 1998
* [[Poland]], 1998
* [[United Kingdom]], 1998
* [[France]], 2000
* [[Spain]], 2006
* [[China]], 2013
* [[India]], 2013
* [[Italy]], 2013
* [[Japan]], 2013
* [[South Korea]], 2013
* [[Singapore]], 2013
* [[Switzerland]], 2017

In 2011, the Council clarified its criteria for admission of observers, most notably including a requirement of applicants to "recognize Arctic States' sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the Arctic" and "recognize that an extensive legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean including, notably, the Law of the Sea, and that this framework provides a solid foundation for responsible management of this ocean".&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;

=== Pending observer states ===
Pending observer states need to request permission for their presence at each individual meeting; such requests are routine and most of them are granted. At the 2013 Ministerial Meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, the EU requested full observer status. It was not granted, mostly because the members do not agree on the EU ban on hunting seals.

The indigenous Permanent Participants (PPs) have mixed views about the increasing group of non-Arctic observers. Some fear that their roles will be marginalized if large players such as the EU receive more attention.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Pending observer states are:
[[European Union]]&lt;ref name="Nov2009"&gt;[http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/final_report%2C_sao_meeting_november_2009 SAO meeting November 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000932/http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/final_report%2C_sao_meeting_november_2009 |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
[[Turkey]].

The role of observers was re-evaluated, as were the criteria for admission. As a result, the distinction between permanent and ad hoc observers were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_the_eu_and_the_arctic_council3005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway, Denmark and Sweden have agreed on a set of common priorities for the three chairmanships. They also agreed to a shared secretariat 2009–2013.&lt;ref name="AC 2018"/&gt;

=== Permanent participants ===
Six Arctic indigenous communities have the status of Permanent Participants on the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/about-us/permanent-participants Permanent Participants]&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are represented by the [[Aleut International Association]], [[Arctic Athabaskan Council]], [[Gwich'in Council International]], [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]], [[Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North]], and the [[Saami Council]]. They are assisted by the [[Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat]].

== Nongovernmental observers ==
Approved intergovernmental and interparliamentary organizations (both global and regional) and non-governmental organizations can also obtain Observer Status. They include the Arctic Parliamentarians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcticparl.org/ |title=Arctic Parliamentarians |publisher=Arcticparl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Red Cross Federation]], the [[Nordic Council]], the Northern Forum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northernforum.org |title=Northern Forum |publisher=Northern Forum |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]; and a handful of [[non-governmental organization]]s such as the Association of World [[Reindeer]] [[Herder]]s,&lt;ref name=reindeerherders&gt;[http://arcticportal.org/portal/icr-new/assn.-of-world-reindeer-herders Association of World Reindeer Herders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200138/http://arcticportal.org/portal/icr-new/assn.-of-world-reindeer-herders |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/our-work2/8-news-and-events/462-observer-oceana&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of the Arctic]], and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]-Arctic Programme.

== Indigenous peoples ==
Seven of the eight member states have sizeable indigenous communities living in their Arctic areas (only Iceland does not). Organizations of Arctic indigenous peoples can obtain the status of Permanent Participant to the Arctic Council,&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt; but only if they represent a single indigenous people resident in more than one Arctic State or more than one Arctic indigenous people resident in a single Arctic State. The number of Permanent Participants should at any time be less than the number of members. The category of Permanent Participants has been created to provide for active participation and full consultation with the Arctic indigenous representatives within the Arctic Council. This principle applies to all meetings and activities of the Arctic Council.

Permanent Participants may address the meetings. They may raise points of order that require immediate decision by the Chairman. Agendas of Ministerial Meetings need to be consulted beforehand with them; they may propose supplementary agenda items. When calling the biannual meetings of Senior Arctic Officials, the Permanent Participants must have been consulted beforehand. Finally, Permanent Participants may propose cooperative activities, such as projects. All this makes the position of Arctic indigenous peoples within the Arctic Council quite unique compared to the (often marginal) role of such peoples in other international governmental fora. However, decision making in the Arctic Council remains in the hands of the eight member states, on the basis of consensus.

As of 2014, six Arctic indigenous communities have Permanent Participant status.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt; These groups are represented by the [[Aleut people|Aleut]] International Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleut-international.org/ |title=Aleut International Association |publisher=Aleut-international.org |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arctic Athabaskan Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcticathabaskancouncil.com/aac/ |title=Arctic Athabaskan Council |publisher=Arctic Athabaskan Council |date=2013-04-23 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gwich'in people|Gwich'in]] Council International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwichin.org/ |title=Gwich'in Council International |publisher=Gwichin.org |date=2010-12-21 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]] (ICC), [[Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North]] (RAIPON),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raipon.info/en/ Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826191820/http://www.raipon.info/en/ |date=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saami Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saamicouncil.net/?deptid=1116 |title=Saami Council |publisher=Saami Council |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These indigenous organisations vary widely in their organisational capacities and the size of the population they represent. To illustrate, RAIPON represents some 250,000 indigenous people of various (mostly Siberian) tribes; the ICC some 150,000 [[Inuit]]. On the other hand, the Gwich'in Council and the Aleut Association each represent only a few thousand people.

It is costly for these groups to be represented at every Council meeting, especially since they take place across the entire circumpolar realm. To enhance the capacity of the PPs to pursue the objectives of the Arctic Council and to assist them develop their internal capacity to participate and intervene in Council meetings, the Council has established—and provides financial support to—the [[Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat|Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat]] (IPS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/IPS%20Terms%20of%20Reference%20and%20Guidelines.pdf Terms, Reference and Guidelines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000949/http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/IPS%20Terms%20of%20Reference%20and%20Guidelines.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPS is located in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark and its board decides on the allocation of the funds.

However prominent the role of indigenous peoples, the Permanent Participant status does not confer any legal recognition as peoples. The Ottawa Declaration, the Arctic Council's founding document, explicitly states (in a footnote): "The use of the term 'peoples' in this declaration shall not be construed as having any implications as regard the rights which may attach to the term under international law." Incidentally, the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 13&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;2007 after 22 years of negotiations, was rejected by Canada and the United States, while Russia abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6993776.stm |title=Indigenous rights outlined by UN |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the United States and Canada have their origins as colonies of the United Kingdom and have large non-indigenous immigrant majorities and small indigenous populations. This means that most Arctic indigenous people were not covered by the rights laid out in the declaration. In November 2010, Canada officially endorsed the declaration and in December of that year [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] declared the United States would sign the declaration.

== Administrative aspects ==

=== Meetings ===
The Arctic Council convenes every six months somewhere in the Chair's country for a Senior Arctic Officials (SAO) meeting. SAOs are high-level representatives from the eight member nations. Sometimes they are ambassadors, but often they are senior foreign ministry officials entrusted with staff-level coordination. Representatives of the six Permanent Participants and the official Observers also are in attendance.

At the end of the two-year cycle, the Chair hosts a Ministerial-level meeting, which is the culmination of the Council's work for that period. Most of the eight member nations are represented by a Minister from their Foreign Affairs, Northern Affairs, or Environment Ministry.

A formal, though non-binding, "Declaration", named for the town in which the meeting is held, sums up the past accomplishments and the future work of the Council. These Declarations cover climate change, [[sustainable development]], Arctic monitoring and assessment, persistent organic pollutants and other contaminants, and the work of the Council's five Working Groups.

Arctic Council working groups document Arctic problems and challenges such as [[sea ice]] loss, [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier melting]], [[tundra]] thawing, increase of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in [[food chain]]s, and [[ocean acidification]] affecting the entire marine ecosystem. Arctic Council members agreed to action points on protecting the Arctic but most have never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/Press%20briefing%20Arctic%20Council%20Annual%20Meeting.pdf Press briefing, Arctic Council Annual Meeting, Nuuk May 2011 Stop talking – start protecting] 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The last Ministerial meeting took place May 11, 2017 in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/our-work2/8-news-and-events/451-fairbanks-04 Arctic Council Ministers meet, sign binding agreement on science cooperation, pass Chairmanship from U.S. to Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The secretariat ===
Each rotating Chair nation accepts responsibility for maintaining the [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], which handles the administrative aspects of the Council, including organizing semiannual meetings, hosting the website, and distributing reports and documents. The Norwegian Polar Institute hosted the Arctic Council Secretariat for the six-year period from 2007 to 2013; this was based on an agreement between the three successive Scandinavian Chairs, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. This temporary Secretariat had a staff of three.

In 2012 the Council moved towards creating a permanent secretariat in Tromsø, Norway.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/05/189840.htm |title=Travel of Deputy Secretary Burns to Sweden and Estonia |publisher=State.gov |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnús Jóhannesson]] (Iceland) is the director since 1 February 2013.

=== Working Groups ===
In addition, the Arctic Council works through six Working Groups and four Programs and Action Plans:

==Security and geopolitical issues==
The Arctic Council is often in the middle of security and geopolitical issues since the Arctic has peculiar interests to Member States and Observers. When the Arctic Council was founded in 1996, peace and security concerns were left out of its mandate. However, changes in the arctic environment and participants of the Arctic Council have led to a reconsideration of the relationship between geopolitical matters and the role of the Arctic Council.

Due to [[climate change]] and melting of the Arctic sea-ice, more energy resources and [[waterways]] are now becoming accessible. Large reserves of oil, gas and minerals are located within the Arctic. This environmental factor generated territorial disputes among Member States. [[Law of the Sea|The Law of the Sea]] allows states to extend their [[EEZ]] (which allows exploitation of resources) if the states can prove that their continental shelf extends beyond the 200&amp;nbsp;nm limit.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americansecurityproject1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americansecurityproject.org/featured-items/2013/the-arctic-five-critical-security-challenges/ |title=The Arctic: Five Critical Security Challenges &amp;#124; ASPAmerican Security Project |publisher=Americansecurityproject.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries are claiming their sea at the utmost reach from their coastlines. There are disputes over several rocks located between Greenland and Canada, the [[Bering Sea|Bering]] and [[Chukchi Sea]]s between Russia and America, and [[Hans Island]] and the [[Lincoln Sea]] between Canada and Denmark.&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21571127-will-asian-countries-consolidate-or-disrupt-arctic-stability-roar-ice-cracking |title=Outsiders in the Arctic: The roar of ice cracking |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a poll indicated that half of Canadian respondents said Canada should try to assert its full sovereignty rights over the [[Beaufort Sea]] compared to just 10 percent of Americans.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jill Mahoney |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadians-rank-arctic-sovereignty-as-top-foreign-policy-priority/article563348/ |title=Canadians rank Arctic sovereignty as top foreign-policy priority |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; New commercial trans-Arctic shipping routes can be another factor of conflicts. A poll found that Canadians perceive the Northwest Passage as their internal Canadian waterway whereas other countries perceive it as an international waterway.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;

Increase in number of Permanent Observers drew other national security issues. Observers are showing their interests in the Arctic region. China explicitly shown its desire to extract natural resources in Greenland.&lt;ref name="economist1"/&gt; Other interests are hidden which can eventually weaken Member States' presence in some way.

Military infrastructure is another point to consider. Except for U.S., defense commitment of Canada, Denmark, Norway and Russia is rapidly growing by military presence and building infrastructure.&lt;ref name="americansecurityproject1"/&gt;

However, some say that the Arctic Council facilitates stability despite possible conflicts among Member States.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt; A Norwegian admiral Haakon Bruun Hanssen says the Arctic is "probably the most stable area in the world". They say that laws are well established and followed.&lt;ref name="economist1"/&gt; Member states think that sharing cost of the development of Arctic shipping-lanes, research etc. by cooperation and good relationships between states is beneficial to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21551029 |title=Arctic politics: Cosy amid the thaw |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at these two different perspectives, some suggest that Arctic Council should expand its role by including peace and security issues as its agenda. The survey demonstrates that two thirds of constituencies (Nordic states) were very supportive on the issues of an [[Nuclear Weapons Free Zone|Arctic nuclear-weapons free zone]]. More than 80 percent of Russians agreed that Arctic Council should cover peace-building issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janice Gross Stein And Thomas S. Axworthy |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/the-arctic-council-is-the-best-way-for-canada-to-resolve-its-territorial-disputes/article574575/ |title=The Arctic Council is the best way for Canada to resolve its territorial disputes |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They think that solving security matters in the Arctic Council will shorten a great amount of time than in UN. However, as of June 2014, military security matters are often avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berkman|first1=Paul|title=Stability and Peace in the Arctic Ocean through Science Diplomacy|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-06-23|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2014/stability-and-peace-in-arctic-ocean-through-science-diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on science and resource protection and management is seen as a priority, which may be diluted or strained by geopolitical security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482279767/u-s-russia-relations-are-frosty-but-theyre-toasty-on-the-arctic-council|title=U.S.-Russia Relations Are Frosty But They're Toasty On The Arctic Council|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8845">The '''Bay Area Reference Center''' (BARC) was a [[Reference librarian|reference]] service serving nine [[Northern California]] [[public library]] systems and headquartered at the [[San Francisco Public Library]]. It was established as an experiment in 1967 by the [[California State Library]] and closed down in 1988, when the funding from the US Federal Government that it relied on was ended. It pioneered the use of networking technologies such as [[teletype]] and [[fax machine]]s in providing reference services to patrons at far-flung, sometimes rural libraries. Its magazine, ''Synergy'', won two [[American Library Association|ALA]] awards.

==Background==
Studies of public library services in California had shown that large parts of the state, particularly rural areas, were underserved.&lt;ref name=Wiley176&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter Booth |last=Wiley |title=A Free Library in this City: The Illustrated History of the San Francisco Public Library |location=San Francisco |publisher=Weldon Owen |year=1996 |isbn=9781875137053 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a 1962 master plan called for the establishment of four levels of library services: local libraries, regional reference centers, tertiary reference centers covering larger regions, and as the fourth and final level, the State Library in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. The Bay Area Reference Center was established in August 1967 as a tertiary center, or "source of last resort",&lt;ref name=Wiley176/&gt; as a collaboration between the San Francisco Public Library and the North Bay Cooperative Library System (NBCLS), a consortium of nine public library systems including 17 libraries in six counties north of San Francisco, with its headquarters in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]]. It was made possible by a federal grant under the 1964 [[Library Services and Construction Act]]; the initial grant was $750,735 for a two-year pilot project.&lt;ref name=Synergy&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Coenenberg |title=SYNERGIZING Reference Service in the San Francisco Bay Region |journal=ALA Bulletin |volume=62 |issue=11 |date=December 1968 |pages=1379–84 |jstor=25698028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A corresponding service was set up for Southern California, the [[Southern California Answering Network]] (SCAN).&lt;ref name=Dustin&gt;{{cite book |first=M.

==Services==
Patron questions that could not be answered locally were referred first to one of three secondary reference centers within the system, located at the [[Vallejo Public Library]], the [[Ukiah-Mendocino County Library]], and the [[Santa Rosa-Sonoma County Public Library]]. If still unanswerable, they were sent on via a six-day-a-week teletype link to BARC at the [[San Francisco Main Library]]. Five NBCLS libraries, the San Francisco Main Library and two San Francisco branches, including the downtown business branch, also had fax machines that were sometimes used for delivering information to patrons. BARC had its own director, assistant director, clerical workers, and eight subject specialists, and acquired specialist reference materials to supplement those already available in the San Francisco library system. The staff also researched some questions in person and by phone and fax,&lt;ref name=Synergy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Celeste |last=West |authorlink=Celeste West |contribution=Introduction: ''Revolting Librarians'' Rides Again'' |editor1-first=Toni |editor1-last=Samek |editor2-first=K.

BARC staff conducted biweekly workshops for reference librarians and published bibliographies on topics including the Chinese in California and the San Francisco Public Library's collection on theatrical costumes.&lt;ref name=Synergy/&gt;

===Journals===
Beginning in 1967 BARC published a bibliographic magazine called ''Synergy''. This included controversial topics of the day, such as "the New Left, the New Right, the underground press, feminism, and gay liberation."&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt; It twice won the ALA's H. W. Wilson Library Periodical Award,&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;&lt;ref name=protest&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edward |last=Swanson | title=Synergy Protest |journal=American Libraries |volume=4 |issue=7 |date=July–August 1973 |page=408 |type=Letter |jstor=25619256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was so popular its circulation was capped for cost reasons after reaching 2,000, but after its second editor, [[Celeste West]], published an unflattering photograph of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1973, its funding was withdrawn by the state librarian, [[Ethel Crockett]].&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Swanson, president of the Minnesota Library Association, published a protest resolution in the ALA journal,&lt;ref name=protest/&gt; and West's reprimand for unprofessional behavior was withdrawn, but ''Synergy'' was replaced by ''BARC Notes''.&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;

==Closure==
BARC closed down after the federal funding on which it depended was ended in 1988.&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
When it closed, BARC served a region populated by 12&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt; In 1978, one analyst saw potential in such pooling of resources to serve a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Childers |title=The Future of Reference and Information Service in the Public Library |journal=The Library Quarterly |volume=48 |issue=4: ''Proceedings of the Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference of the Graduate Library School, April 10-11, 1978. The Public Library: Circumstance and Prospects'' |date=October 1978 |jstor=4307020 |page=465 }}&lt;!-- NOT [[Thomas Childers]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, a comparison of responses to the same genuine patron queries by BARC, the second-level reference center in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], and a for-profit reference service, Information on Demand, showed that BARC's answers were usually better than the Fresno center's as a result of the depth of its resources, but that none of the three answered all the test questions correctly and quickly.&lt;ref name=Crowley/&gt; The tertiary reference centers were expensive: in 1986 BARC and its Southern Californian counterpart, SCAN, estimated the cost of answering each query at $150, and the California State Library launched a study of costs of the two centers.&lt;ref name=Dustin/&gt;

==People==
Richard Coenenberg was the first director of BARC. Assistant Director Gil MacNamee later became director. In addition to West, Peggy Barber, later an ALA staff member, was one of the librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Excellence in Action: 1999 ALA Award Winners |journal=American Libraries |volume=30 |issue=8 |date=September 1999 |page=80 |jstor=25637296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bechan Cave''' is a single-room [[sandstone]] [[rock shelter]] located at an elevation of {{convert|1280|m|ft}} along Bowns Canyon Creek, a [[tributary]] of the [[Glen Canyon]] segment of the [[Colorado River]], in [[Kane County, Utah|Kane County]] in southeastern [[Utah]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Agenbroad, et al., 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt;  The cave is roughly {{convert|31|m|ft|sigfig=2}} wide, {{convert|9|m|ft}} high and {{convert|52|m|ft|sigfig=2}} deep.&lt;ref name="Mead &amp; Agenbroad, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Agenbroad &amp; Nelson, 2002"/&gt;  It has a single entrance that faces southwest&lt;ref name="Agenbroad, et al., 1989"/&gt; and is well-lit during the daytime.&lt;ref name="Mead &amp; Agenbroad, 1992"/&gt;

The cave holds [[alluvial deposit]]s containing the remains of [[Pleistocene megafauna]],&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; including [[mammoth]]s,&lt;ref name="Agenbroad &amp; Nelson, 2002"/&gt; [[ground sloth]]s, and [[even-toed ungulate]]s.&lt;ref name="Agenbroad, et al., 1984"/&gt;  [[Excavation (archaeology)|Archaeological excavation]] of the site in 1983 and 1984 by [[paleontologist]]s Larry Agenboard and Jim Mead&lt;ref name="Hitchcock, 2011"/&gt; unearthed animal bones, dung, hair, and teeth dating from 11,555 BCE to 9720 BCE, underneath "a few feet"&lt;ref name="Hoffecker"/&gt; of cave fill, consisting of ceiling [[spall]] and [[Aeolian processes|wind-blown]] sand,&lt;ref name="Mead &amp; Agenbroad, 1992"/&gt; containing evidence of [[Holocene]] habitation from the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] to the [[Basketmaker culture]] and possibly even by [[Navajo]] or [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]].&lt;ref name="Agenbroad, et al., 1989"/&gt;  Among the items unearthed were large dung [[Bolus (digestion)|boluses]], similar in size to the dung of the [[African elephant]], containing the [[Plant stem|stems]] of [[graminoid]]s&lt;ref name="Agenbroad, et al., 1984"/&gt; and sedge (''[[Carex]]'').&lt;ref name="Agenbroad &amp; Mead, 1989"/&gt;  The cave is also one of at least seventeen sites on the [[Colorado Plateau]] where Archaic-era [[Southwestern archaeology|Southwestern sandals]] have been discovered.&lt;ref name="Teague &amp; Washburn, 2013"/&gt;

The cave's name derives from a [[Navajo language|Navajo word]] meaning "big dung"&lt;ref name="Hoffecker"/&gt; or "big feces".&lt;ref name="Agenbroad &amp; Nelson, 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor, 2007"/&gt;  The well-preserved dung layer was deposited over approximately 1,000 years by multiple animal species during a period characterized by the proliferation of [[oak]] and the decline of [[blue spruce]] and [[water birch]].&lt;ref name="Agenbroad, et al., 1984"/&gt;  The organic deposit consists primarily of [[Columbian mammoth]] (''M. columbi'') dung but also includes dung belonging to [[shrub-ox]]en (''E. collinum''), [[Shasta ground sloth]]s (''N. shastensis''), [[Harrington's mountain goat]]s (''O. harringtoni''), [[bighorn sheep]] (''O. canadensis''), [[cottontail rabbit]]s, [[pack rat]]s, and possibly [[equine]]s.&lt;ref name="Mead &amp; Agenbroad, 1992"/&gt;  With a thickness ranging between {{convert|4|and(-)|16|in|cm}},&lt;ref name="Hoffecker"/&gt; an area of more than {{convert|300|m2|ft2|sigfig=1}},&lt;ref name="Mayor, 2007"/&gt; and a volume of {{convert|225|m3|ft3|sigfig=1}},&lt;ref name="Agenbroad, et al., 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDM"/&gt; it is the largest [[coprolite]] deposit in North America.&lt;ref name="Agenbroad &amp; Nelson, 2002"/&gt;  Other [[macrofossil]]s discovered in Bechan Cave include teeth and a bone, a "[[metapodial]] [[condyle]]", belonging to ''E. collinum''.&lt;ref name="Kropf, et al., 2007"/&gt;

The cave is located inside [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]]&lt;ref name="Santucci &amp; McClelland, 2001"/&gt; and, though it is rarely visited, is accessible on foot from Bowns Canyon.&lt;ref name="Intermountain"/&gt;  The {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} round-trip hike between Bowns Canyon, which can be reached from [[Lake Powell]] by boat, and Bechan Cave is considered moderately difficult.&lt;ref name="Intermountain"/&gt;

The '''Blue Collar Comedy Tour''' was a comedy troupe, featuring [[Jeff Foxworthy]] with three of his comedian friends, [[Bill Engvall]], [[Ron White]], and [[Larry the Cable Guy]], who had replaced fellow comedian Craig Hawksley, who performed in the first twenty-six shows on the tour. The troupe toured together for six years beginning in January 2000 at [[Omaha, Nebraska]] before finishing in 2006 at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]] in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/movies|title=Movie Reviews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Jeff Foxworthy]] had already established himself as a well-known, [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], best known for his jokes and stories about life as a [[redneck]]. Foxworthy had cast best friend Engvall in the [[NBC]] version of ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'', and featured Larry on his nationally syndicated, weekly, country radio show ''The Foxworthy Countdown''. White was brought on as his comedy is based around personal experiences retold in his smoking, drinking Southern United States persona. The tour that featured these four "good ole boys" proved to be such a hit that they recorded a live album in November 2001 and the first DVD called ''Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie'' in the spring of 2003.

==DVD==
After the success of the tour, album and live DVD, the comedians recorded a second live DVD called ''Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again'' and a series on [[The WB]] called ''[[Blue Collar TV]]''. Ron White was on the second DVD, and although he was not a regular on the TV show he did make guest appearances. A third  Blue Collar movie was produced for Comedy Central titled ''Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for the Road'', which premiered on the channel in June 2006. ''Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for The Road'' was released on DVD in June 2006.

=== Films ===
* '''''[[Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie]]''''' ([[2003 in film|2003]])
* '''''[[Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again]]''''' ([[2004 in home video|2004]])
* '''''[[Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for the Road]]''''' ([[2006 in home video|2006]])

==Satellite radio==
In March 2006, the group started a Blue Collar Comedy channel on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] titled [[Blue Collar Comedy (radio)|''Blue Collar Radio'']]. The station features not only various stand-up acts from the four members but various acts from other working class-esque comedians such as [[Brian Regan (comedian)|Brian Regan]], [[Rodney Carrington]], [[Kathleen Madigan]], [[John Caponera]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Ray Romano]], and others as well.  When [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] merged with [[XM Satellite Radio]], this brought more coverage of the channel.  Blue Collar Radio can be heard on [[Sirius XM]] 97.

==''Them Idiots''==
As of 2011 Foxworthy, Engvall and Larry still do comedy tours together under the title ''Them Idiots Whirled Tour''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themidiotsontour.com/ Themidiotstour.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419003909/http://www.themidiotsontour.com/ |date=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is keeping true to their claim that ''One for the Road'' was the last ''Blue Collar'' tour, thus respecting the fact that Ron White is not part of it. A CD and DVD of the new show from the [[Consol Energy Center]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] was released on March 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Whirled-Tour-Jeff-Foxworthy/dp/B006YWIFH8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331503328&amp;sr=8-1|title=Them Idiots: Whirled Tour|date=13 March 2012|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarship===
Edwards's first book is ''[[The Practice of Diaspora|The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism]]'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 2003). It examines black writers in the [[interwar period]], focusing on sites of interaction between [[Anglophone]] and [[Francophone]] black writers to develop an argument about the generative potential of translation, specifically in the black diaspora.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Michelle|title=The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism (review)|journal=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|date=Fall 2004|volume=50|issue=3|pages=792–794|doi=10.1353/mfs.2004.0090|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172395|accessdate=9 August 2016|issn=1080-658X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other influences, Edwards draws on [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s use of the concept of [[Articulation (sociology)|articulation]] to develop a theoretical use of the French term décalage, "referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it...[Edwards argues] that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Kristina Kay|title=My Journey From Louisiana to Havana, and Back Again|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/my-journey-from-louisiana-to-havana-and-back-again/|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=The Nation|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claude McKay manuscript discovery===
In 2009, Edwards's graduate student [[Jean-Christophe Cloutier]] discovered a manuscript in Columbia's [[Rare book and manuscript library|Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] in the papers of writer [[Samuel Roth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Driscoll|first1=Molly|title=New manuscript by Harlem Renaissance writer Claude McKay is discovered|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2012/0918/New-manuscript-by-Harlem-Renaissance-writer-Claude-McKay-is-discovered|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Edwards and Cloutier, in consultation with other experts and after examining archival materials and personal correspondence, authenticated the manuscript as a previously unknown 1941 work by [[Claude McKay]], called ''Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Felicia R.|title=Harlem Renaissance Novel by Claude McKay Is Discovered|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/books/harlem-renaissance-novel-by-claude-mckay-is-discovered.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=The New York Times|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Louis Gates]], who served as one of the experts evaluating the manuscript's authenticity, called it a "major discovery...It dramatically expands the canon of novels written by [[Harlem Renaissance]] writers."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3030">The '''conte cruel''' is, as ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'' by [[Brian Stableford]] states, a "short-story genre that takes its name from an 1883 collection by [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]], although previous examples had been provided by such writers as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Some critics use the label to refer only to non-supernatural horror stories, especially those that have nasty climactic twists, but it is applicable to any story whose conclusion exploits the cruel aspects of the 'irony of fate.'&lt;ref name="Stableford2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Stableford|title=The A to Z of Fantasy Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHc3XTdJBxQC&amp;pg=PA85|date=13 August 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6345-3|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection from which the short-story genre of the conte cruel takes its name is ''Contes cruels'' (1883, tr. Sardonic Tales, 1927) by [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]. Also taking its name from this collection is ''[[Contes cruels (Mirbeau)|Contes cruels]]'' ("''Cruel Tales''"), a two-volume set of about 150 tales and short stories by the 19th-century French writer [[Octave Mirbeau]], collected and edited by [[Pierre Michel]] and Jean-François Nivet and published in two volumes in 1990 by Librairie Séguier. 

Some noted writers in the conte cruel genre are [[Charles Birkin]], [[Maurice Level]], [[Patricia Highsmith]] &lt;ref&gt;François Riviere, 
[http://next.liberation.fr/culture/1995/02/06/patricia-highsmith-a-rejoint-les-eaux-profondes_124532 "Patricia Highsmith a rejoint les eaux profondes"] ''[[Libération]]'', 6th February 1995. Retrieved 13th January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roald Dahl]], the latter of whom originated ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (book)|Tales of the Unexpected]]''. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] observed of Level's fiction in his essay ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'' (1927): "This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than a class peculiar to itself—the so-called conte cruel, in which the wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations, frustrations, and gruesome physical horrors".&lt;ref name="Lovecraft1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Phillips Lovecraft|title=At the Mountains of Madness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuWNI905KjIC&amp;pg=PT188|year=1964|publisher=eBookIt.com|isbn=978-9949-9424-4-2|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian M. Stableford]] has observed that, by the 1980s, the conte cruel was the standard narrative form of [[soft science fiction]],&lt;ref name="Stableford2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian M. Stableford|title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzmIPZg5xicC&amp;pg=PA73|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4938-9|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular the works of [[Thomas M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4512">'''Corporate entertainment''' describes private events held by [[corporation]]s or [[business]]es for their staff, clients or stakeholders. These events can be for large audiences such as conventions and conferences, or smaller events such as retreats, holiday parties or even private [[concert]]s.

It is also commonly used to mean corporate hospitality, the process of entertaining guests at corporate events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.showsinabox.com/what-is-a-corporate-event/|title=What Is A Corporate Event? - Shows In a Box|date=2012-12-12|work=Shows In a Box|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies that provides corporate [[entertainment]] are called corporate event planners or corporate booking agencies.

== Types of corporate entertainment events ==
There are various types of corporate events that make use of entertainment.  An opening general session may include entertainment that adds excitement and presents the overall theme of the meeting. Mixers or pre-dinner parties many times use entertainment meant to provide a backdrop for conversation, perhaps an acoustic ensemble or pre-recorded music. Awards or gala events, usually the last event in a series of meetings, can make use of many options, from [[celebrity]] entertainers to exciting bands providing dance music or other options that will leave the attendees with a feeling of excitement and looking forward to the next meeting. There are many different types of corporate entertainment.

=== Corporate team building ===
Corporate entertainment can also include a day of [[team building]] activities. These activities include traditional camp activities like tug of war, scavenger hunts, and relay races. They could also include sports such as volleyball, soccer, or basketball. The goal of team building corporate entertainment is to have employees recognize how the challenges of the activities relate to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Jada A. [http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2014/09/25/corporate-team-building-activities-the-good-the-bad-and-the-really-ugly/* "Corporate Team-Building Activities: The Good, the Bad and the Really Ugly"]. 25 Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Team chemistry, identifying strengths and attributes,  understanding how to work through solving problems as one, and reflecting makes for fruitful team building.

=== Corporate awards events ===
Awards or gala events are usually lavish events that celebrate accomplishment or milestones of a person or group of people in similar industries. Often these events serve as fundraisers for a specific cause. In addition to celebrating and recognizing achievements, it allows attendees to network with others with similar backgrounds or professions.

=== Corporate holiday celebration events ===
Holiday celebration events are ways for companies or departments to celebrate holidays and to show appreciation to employees. Entertainment at these events vary from raffles and door prizes, [[mystery dinner]]s, music and an overall casual, social setting that can build social relationships. For Christmas celebrations, some companies have used the ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' theme.

=== Corporate seminars and educational events ===
Corporate seminars, workshops, symposiums, and conferences are more informative in nature and often focussed on educational purposes.  A conference refers to a formal meeting where participants exchange their views on various topics.  A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at a university or offered by a commercial or professional organization. A workshop includes all the elements of the seminar, but with the largest portion emphasizing “hands-on-practice” or laboratory work.  A symposium is a formal gathering in an academic setting where participants are experts in their fields. Entertainment for these events varies from kick-op brunches to start, special industry guest speakers, and mixers, dinners  afterwards.  There are also booths set up for trade shows to display a companies strengths and for better marketing.

=== Corporate charity events ===
Corporate charity events, whether concerts, golf tournaments, or anything else, play an important role in how businesses interact with the community. Corporate charity events unite people from all levels of the organization; such events are another form of team building which positively influence other aspects of work.

==Bibliography==
Eddings' wife, '''Leigh Eddings''', was uncredited as co-author on several of his early books, but he later acknowledged that she contributed to them all. 
("She thought up '[[Regina's Song]]' in that single afternoon, but it took me 20 years to figure out who the point-of-view character was.")

She was a credited co-author starting in the mid-1990s. It was [[Lester del Rey]] who believed that multi-authorships were a problem and that it would be better if David Eddings' name alone appeared on the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/David-Eddings/biography.html|title=David Eddings biography|work=fantasybookreview.co.uk|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>The name of the author of the third translation was the wrong way round ("Rocco, Sinisgalli") - in the other names the surname comes first. "Rocco" is a common Italian first name, and "Sinisgalli" cannot be anything but a surname, so I've changed this to "Sinisgalli, Rocco".~~~~</comment>

'''''De pictura''''' (English: "On Painting") is a treatise written by the Italian architect and art theorist [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. The first version, written in vernacular Italian in 1435 under the title '''''Della pittura''''', was for a general audience. The Latin version, the ''De pictura'' of 1439–41, was more technical and intended for scholars.&lt;ref name="StAndrews"&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E. F. |title=Mathematics and art - perspective |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Art.html |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is the first in a trilogy of treatises on the "Major arts" which had a widespread circulation during the [[Renaissance]], the others being ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' ("On Architecture", 1454) and ''De statua'' ("On Sculpture", 1462).

==Context==

Alberti was a member of [[history of Florence|Florentine]] family exiled in the 14th century, who was able to return in Florence only from 1434, in the following of the Papal court during the [[Council of Florence]]. Here he knew contemporary art innovators such as  [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Masaccio]], with whom he shared an interest for [[Renaissance humanism]] and classical art. Alberti was the first post-classical writer to produce a work of [[art theory]], as opposed to works about the function of religious art or art techniques, and reflected the developing [[Italian Renaissance art]] of his day.

Book II: a survey of types of painting for teenage trainees in a workshop&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

Book III: advice to the adult painter on how to perfect his skill&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

===Approach===
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

''De pictura'' aimed to describe systematically the figurative arts through "geometry". Alberti divided painting into three parts:
*''Circumscriptio'' (Italian: ''disegno''), consisting in drawing the bodies' contour
*'' Compositio'' (''commensuratio'' in the Italian version of the treatise), including tracing the lines joining the bodies
* ''Receptio luminum'' (''color''), taking into consideration colors and light.

The treatise contained an analysis of all the techniques and painting theories known at the time, in this surpassing medieval works such as ''The book of Art'' by [[Cennino Cennini]] (1390). ''De pictura'' also includes the first description of linear geometric perspective around 1416; Alberti credited the discovery to [[Brunelleschi]], and dedicated the 1435 edition to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgerton|first1=Samuel Y.|title=Brunelleschi's mirror, Alberti's window, and Galileo's 'perspective tube'|journal=História, Ciências, Saúde-Manguinhos|date=October 2006|volume=13|issue=suppl. 0|doi=10.1590/S0104-59702006000500010|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-59702006000500010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', (1985) [1940] [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Paul, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9MoshlkHpFYJ:www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/uploads/docs/s1_23.pdf+Paul+Barlow+Professor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjcjev4zZWsyXRk2Qb0TAbQHs52uwq7cmMmRBnlY97ah2aGpKYtVsGu-QOIeMciCrUfH45N1knB0NFikusclJybCwP5TMoAMaQJNS8TPzZFOBvOQvtUrmEPUT--Kqw8tmhvKr8G&amp;sig=AHIEtbSRK7DWVGwdLbYF38jvUAihfTFS0Q "The Death of History Painting in Nineteenth-Century Art?" PDF], ''Visual Culture in Britain'', Volume 6, Number 1, Summer 2005, pages 1–13&lt;/ref&gt;

''De pictura'' relied heavily on references to art in classical literature; in fact [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome (now effectively lost) was the only{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} modern (post-classical) work described in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Svetlana Alpers |author=Alpers, Svetlana Leontief |title=Ekphrasis and Aesthetic Attitudes in Vasari's Lives |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=23 |issue=3/4 |date=July 1960 |pages=190–192 |jstor=750591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
 [[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione.jpeg|thumb|350px|The accurate perspective in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s paintings such as his ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' (1475–1480) derives from Alberti's ''De pictura''.]]

''De pictura'' influenced the work of artists including [[Donatello]], [[Ghiberti]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Ghirlandaio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lefaivre, Liane  |title=Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: Re-Cognizing the Architectural Body in the Early Italian Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocUH6f3l_E8C&amp;pg=PA135 |year=2005 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-62195-3 |pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] was the most influential of his recommendations, having a powerful effect on [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and through him on the whole Italian renaissance.&lt;ref name=Ackerman&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerman |first=James S. |title=Distance Points: Essays in Theory and Renaissance Art and Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7EadYT-LTUC&amp;pg=PA87 |year=1994 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51077-6 |pages=86–87 |quote=No particular precept in the first part of De pictura had as pervasive an impact as the following section on perspective construction; the specific recommendations on color and shadow were ineffectual.. But the incalculable change that Leonardo wrought was directly dependent on Alberti's vision of art as a branch .. of optics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti made at least 29 uses of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', deriving his key themes of simplicity and seriousness directly from Pliny. For example, Alberti advised artists to use colour with restraint, and to paint in the effect of gold rather than using actual gold in their paintings. Gold did indeed vanish from Italian paintings of the second part of the 15th century. Artists however found their own ways to paint with restraint, rather than following Alberti's actual instructions directly. Similarly, he encouraged artists to add black when modelling shapes, rather than only adding white as [[Cennino Cennini]] had advised in his c.&amp;nbsp;1390 ''Il Libro dell'Arte''. This advice had the effect of making Italian renaissance paintings more sombre. Alberti was here perhaps following Pliny's description of the dark varnish used by Apelles.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grafton |first1=Anthony |last2=Most |first2=Glenn W. |last3=Settis |first3=Salvatore |title=The Classical Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&amp;pg=PA214 |year=2010 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deviancy amplification spiral''' (also called '''deviance amplification''') is a [[media hype]] phenomenon defined by [[media critic]]s as a cycle of increasing numbers of reports on a category of [[antisocial behaviour]] or some other 'undesirable' event, leading to a [[moral panic]].

==Origin of term==
The process of deviancy amplification was first described by Leslie T. Wilkins.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Leslie T. (Tavistock Publications 1964) [Routledge 2001] Social Deviance: Social Policy, Action, and Research (Retrieved 26 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] adopted this theory in ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'',  and applied it to the case scenario of the "Mods and Rockers", in which he identified the concept of the deviancy amplification spiral.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Process==
According to Cohen, the spiral starts with some '[[Deviance (sociology)|deviant]]' act. Usually the deviance is [[crime|criminal]], but it can also involve lawful acts considered morally repugnant by a large segment of society. With the new focus on the issue, hidden or borderline examples that would not themselves have been newsworthy are reported, [[Confirmation bias|confirming the 'pattern]]'.

Reported cases of such 'deviance' are often presented as just 'the ones we know about' or the '[[wiktionary:tip of the iceberg|tip of the iceberg]]', an assertion that is nearly impossible to disprove immediately. For a variety of reasons, the less sensational aspects of the spiraling story that would help the public keep a rational perspective (such as statistics showing that the behavior or event is actually less common or less harmful than generally believed) tend to be ignored by the press.

As a result, minor problems begin to look serious and rare events begin to seem common. Members of the public are motivated to keep informed on these events, leading to high readership for the stories, feeding the spiral. The resulting publicity has the potential to increase the deviant behavior by glamorizing it, or by making it seem common or acceptable. In the next stage, public concern typically forces the police and the law enforcement system to focus more resources on dealing with the specific deviancy than it warrants.

Judges and magistrates then come under public pressure to deal out harsher sentences and politicians pass new laws to increase their popularity by giving the impression that they are dealing with the perceived threat. The responses by those in authority tend to reinforce the public's fear, while the media continue to report police and other law enforcement activity, amplifying the spiral.

The theory does not contend that moral panics always include the deviancy amplification spiral.

[[Eileen Barker]] asserts that the controversy surrounding certain [[new religious movements]] can turn violent in a deviancy amplification spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Eileen, [http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ Introducing New Religious Movements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014065725/http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ |date=October 14, 2007 }}, Retrieved 22 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, [[Lincoln Steffens]] details how news reporting can be used to create the impression of a [[crime|crime wave]] where there is none, in the chapter "I Make a Crime Wave".

Button and Tunley&lt;ref&gt;Button, Mark and Tunley, Martin (2015) Explaining Fraud Deviancy Attenuation in the United Kingdom. Crime, Law and Social Change, 63: 49-64 [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10611-015-9551-0]&lt;/ref&gt; have also presented a theory that offers the opposite to deviancy amplification, which they call deviancy attenuation. In this they argue using the case of fraud that there are some large problems, which those in positions of power are able to attenuate through not accurately measuring it, leading to statistics which under-estimate the problem, leading to less resources dedicated to it, re-enforcing the belief of those in power it is not a problem.

'''''Dick Whittington and His Cat''''' is the English [[folklore]] surrounding the real-life [[Richard Whittington]] (c. 1354–1423), wealthy merchant and later [[Lord Mayor of London]]. The legend describes his rise from poverty-stricken childhood with the fortune he made through the sale of his cat to a rat-infested country. However, the real Whittington did not come from a poor family of common stock, and there is no compelling evidence supporting the stories about the cat, or even whether he owned one. There is also conjecture that certain aspects of the story, in fact, relate to a different occupant of the office of Lord Mayor, [[William Craven (Lord Mayor of London)|Sir William Craven]] who was Lord Mayor in 1610, around the same date as the first written records of the story, and whose life had much more in common with that reflected in the story.

Another element in the legend is that Dick attempted to flee his service as a [[scullery|scullion]] one night, heading towards home&lt;!--according to the early ballad.--&gt; (or reached [[Highgate Hill]] in later tradition&lt;!--about 5 miles north--&gt;), but was dissuaded by the sound of [[St Mary-le-Bow#Bells|Bow bells]], which promised he would be mayor of London one day.

Since the pre-[[Victorian era]], the story has been a favourite subject of English [[pantomime]], especially during [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]].

==Overview==
Written forms date from the early 1600s, long after the death of the historical Whittington. A drama play (1604–5) and ballad (1605) are lost, and [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s ballad of 1612 is the earliest surviving piece that refer to Whittington making his fortune with his cat. This early ballad already contains the tradition that Whittington fled his {{linktext|scullion}}'s service and traveled towards home, but was beckoned back by the London bells which predicted his future of becoming mayor. It has also been speculated that the story, in reality, had its origins as a satire against the humble origins of a different Lord Mayor of London, [[William Craven (Lord Mayor of London)|Sir William Craven]] , who held the office in 1610. This theory is supported by the chronology of the story's origins, and by the fact that Sir William Craven's life had many more real parallels to the story than that of Sir Richard Whittington, who, unlike Craven, was never born into poverty. It seems likely that the story combines elements of both.

The earliest known prose rendition is ''The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington'' by "T. H." ([[Thomas Heywood]]), published 1656 in [[chapbook]] form, which specified that the bells were those of Bow Church ([[St Mary-le-Bow]]), and that the boy heard them at [[Bunhill fields|Bunhill]]. Common chapbooks of a later period wrote that the boy reached as far as [[Holloway, London|Holloway]] on the night he fled. Links to this village has not been corroborated in early folklore or literature, and is thought to be an 18th-century invention. But based on this tradition, the landmark [[Whittington Stone]] at the foot of [[Highgate Hill]] is commonly perceived to be the place where Dick Whittingon stopped and heard the famous bells.

The story was adapted into [[Puppetry|puppet play]] by [[Martin Powell (puppetry)|Martin Powell]] in the early 18th century. Later, it has been performed as stage [[pantomime]]s and children's plays. It has also been retold as a children's story by a number of printers and authors to this day.

A number of foreign and medieval analogues exist that exhibit the motif ("Whittington's cat" motif, N411.2), where the hero obtains wealth by selling a cat, typically in a rodent-infested place direly in need of one. The tale is catalogued [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] (AT) tale type 1651, "Whittington's Cat".

Cheney):&lt;ref name="wh85-latechap"&gt;{{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|pp=xxxii–xlii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;To London
Dick Whittington was a poor orphan boy, languishing in [[Lancashire]] (B), or some unnamed place in the country (H, C).{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Lysons' investigations determined that the historical Whittington family base was in a village in [[Gloucestershire]] by Richard's time. But popular legend localize him variously to "Taunton Dean," "Ellesmere in Shropshire," or "some unknown town in Hereforshire".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Besant|Rice|1881|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He set off to seek his fortune in London (B, H, C), enticed by the rumour that [[London streets are paved with gold|its streets were paved with gold]] (C). But he soon found himself cold and hungry,&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;It is winter season according to H.&lt;/ref&gt; and fell asleep at the gate of the home of a wealthy merchant named Fitzwarren (H, C).&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The ballad does not name the merchant, but the prose versions supply the name of Fitzwarren, the mercer with whom the historical Richard Whittingon apprenticed.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzwarren gave him lodging and hired him to be the [[wikt:scullion|scullion]] in the kitchen (B, H, C).

;Dick and his cat
In the prose versions, an account of the Dick Whittington's cat subsequently follows, but in the ballad, it is preceded by Dick's flight and church bells episode.

In the prose legend, Dick is provided quarter at the Fitzwarrens' [[garret]] (room in the attic) (H, C), which was infested with rats and mice (H, C). But Dick owned a cat (B, H, C), that the prose versions say he had bought for a penny he earned by shining shoes (H, C).&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;"for going of an errand, or for making clean boots or shooes [sic.] or the like" (H); "a gentleman... gave... a penny for brushing his shoes" (C)&lt;/ref&gt; The cat controlled his rodent problem, which made her an indispensable companion.

When Fitzwarren organized a trade expedition sending the merchant ship ''Unicorn'' (H), Dick's cat was "ventured" to this mission to be sold for profit abroad (B, H, C). The versions also differ regarding the circumstances: either Dick relinquished the cat of his own volition, hoping its sale in a foreign land might reap a "store of gold" towards the fulfillment of the omen of the bells (B), or, Dick was compelled to do so by Fitzwarren, who maintained a steadfast rule that everyone in his household should have some article of worth riding on the venture, with due dividends forthcoming from the proceeds (H, C).

;Flight, and the bells tolling
Dick became disenchanted with the scullion's lot and attempted to flee, either because he received room and board only for his labours and was denied monetary wages (B), or because the kitchen maid (H) or female cook named Mrs. Cicely (C) abused and physically beat him beyond his tolerance. He ran as far away as [[Bunhill Fields|Bunhill]] (H) or [[Holloway, London|Holloway]] (C), where he heard "London Bells" (B), [[Bow bells]] (C), or the bells of "Bow Church" (H), that seemed to be telling him,  
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London" (H).
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
which persuaded him to retrace his steps. (The wording of the bells' message differ slightly according to the textual source).

;Rags to riches
The ship was driven off course to the [[Barbary Coast]], where the Moorish king purchased the entire cargo for a load of gold, and insisted on entertaining the English traders with a feast. But the banquet was swarmed with rats and mice, whereby the English "factor" (business agent) informed their hosts that they were in possession of a creature which could exterminate these vermin (H, C). Thus Dick Whittington's cat was immediately put to the test, chasing and destroying the rodents. The Moors, even more pleased to learn that the cat was pregnant, paid more (H) (or ten times more (C)) for the cat than the rest of the cargo combined.

The ship returned to London and Fitzwarren who was apprised of the success of the venture (at his home on [[Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall]] (H)), summoned the besmirched scullion Dick Whittington to the parlour (H) (or compting-room (C)) and sat him in a seat, addressing him in dignified fashion as Master (H) or Mr. Whittington. Dick was upset at first that this was being done in mockery, but Fitzwarren insisted it was all in earnest, explaining that the profits from the ship now made Dick a richer man than himself (C, H).
Dick married his former master's daughter Alice Fitzwarren (C, H), and joined his father-in-law in his business (H). In time, Whittington became the Lord Mayor of London three times, just as the bells had predicted. Whittington's acts of charity included the building of a [[College (canon law)|college]], a church (B, H, C), and [[Newgate Prison]] (B, H, C). He also burnt the bonds he owned, which the Crown had issued to fund the war (B, H).

==Whittington Stone==
{{Main|Whittington Stone}}
Today, on [[Highgate Hill]] in front of [[Whittington Hospital]], there is a statue in honour of Whittington's legendary cat on the site where, according to late versions of the story, the distant [[Bow Bells]] beckoned young Dick back to London to claim his fortune.&lt;ref name=cosh&gt;{{citation |last=Cosh |first=Mary|author-link=Mary Cosh |title=A History of Islington|publisher=Historical Publications |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRwXAQAAIAAJ |page=15 |isbn=978-0-9486-6797-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cat statue was placed atop the [[Whittington Stone]] later, in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Westwood |first1=Jennifer |author-link1=Jennifer Westwood |last2=Simpson |first2=Jacqueline |author-link2=Jacqueline Simpson |title=The Lore of Scotland: A Guide to Scottish Legends |publisher=Penguin |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3USAQAAIAAJ |page=474 |isbn=978-0-1410-2103-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the Whittington Stone lies within confines of "Upper Holloway" according to 19th century writers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tomlins |first=Thomas Edlyne |title=Yseldon: Perambulation of Islington |place=London |publisher=James S. Hodson |year=1858 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj0QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 |pages=128, 140–143 (illustr.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds with some chapbooks that say the boy ran away to as far away as "Holloway".{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|pp=iii, xxxiv}}{{Refn|group="lower-alpha" |Actually [[Upper Holloway]] ends at the foot of Highgate Hill and was once known as Lower or South Highgate,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} until the underground station was renamed to Archway. Therefore the sculpture of Whittington's cat is currently situated at the foot of Highgate Hill in ''Archway''.}}

It is not clear how far back this marker can be dated. Whittington biographer [[Samuel Lysons (priest)|Lysons]] felt it stood there as a marker for "many centuries", even if it was actually just the debris of an old cross with only the [[plinth]] or base remaining, as some had suggested.{{sfnp|Lysons|1860|p=24}} [[Henry B. Wheatley]] argued that Whittington's association to "Holloway" must have been a later embellishment, as it is lacking in the early T. H. text (in which the boy only goes as far as Bunhill, just north of London). He thus does not think the stone could be dated anywhere near-contemporaneously to Whittington's lifespan, but he does allow that a purported stone was removed in 1795, so that the tradition at least predated the relocation of [[Whittington College]] to Highgate.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Note that [[St Michael Paternoster Royal|Whittington College]] was relocated again in c. 1960s to its current location, and the Stone is no longer as near the College as once were.{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|p=iii}}}}

Wheatley also observed that Holloway was at such a distance that it would have been difficult for a child to have reached there by foot and returned the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|p=iii}}: "before the cook had risen".&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was only barely within earshot of the bells of "Bow Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|p=iii}}: "it would be less easy to hear [[Bow Bells]]".&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The general area ([[Islington]]) was on the outer limits of where the bell could be heard in 1851, the year of [[The Great Exhibition]] (undisclosed source). At the launch of the Times Atlas of London, a sound map of London was commissioned to show how far the sound of the bells reached in 2012, and the audible range fell far short. However in 1851, it could be heard the City of London, across Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets and into parts of Camden, Southwark, Newham and Waltham Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2164799/Bow-Bells-mark-area-true-Londoners-drowned-capitals-noise-pollution.html |last=Parsons |first=Chris |title=Could Cockneys soon be brown bread?

==Publication history==
The earliest recorded instance of the folklore in written form is a registry notice dated 1604-5 for a theatrical play.

The drama ''The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe byrth, his great fortune'' was licensed for the stage 1604–1605. Based on the only remaining evidence, which comes from the record at the [[Stationers' Registers]], there is no proof beyond doubt whether the play accounted for Dick's rise from "lowe birth" by means of a cat, but it is considered likely, since a play from the contemporary period entitled ''[[Eastward Hoe]]'' (1605) makes an explicit cat association with the line: "When the famous fable of Whittington and his puss shall be forgotten". This line also stands as the earliest surviving literary reference of Whittington and his cat.{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|p=viii}}

===Ballad===
A lost ballad is also known to have existed from the [[Stationers' Register]] of 1605. It records "A ballad, called The vertuous Lyfe and memorable death of Sr Ri: Whittington mercer sometymes Lo. Maior of the honorable Citie of London" licensed on 16 July 1605 to be printed by John Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Recorded in the same Stationers' Registers as the drama, {{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest surviving complete text of the legend in any form is the ballad written by [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]] on the subject. The 17-[[Octave (poetry)|octave]] piece, included in Johnson's ''Crowne Garland of Goulden Roses'' (1612), begins with the following lines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Here must I tell the praise / Of worthie Whittington..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This ballad of 1612 already contains the tradition that the hero made an attempt to flee his service as a scullion and headed towards "his country", but was persuaded to abort his flight when the London bells beckoned him back, seeming to tell him  "Whittington, back return" and pronouncing the omen that he would eventually become Lord Mayor. The ballad goes on to tell{{Efn|As already noted, in the prose and chap-book, the cat is introduced before the bells.}} how Whittington had a very humble past working as a kitchen [[wikt:scullion|scullion]], but that he "had a cat...And by it wealth he gat".{{sfnp|Johnson|1612|pp=20–25}}&lt;ref name="wh85-johnson-ballad"&gt;Quoted from ''A Collection of Old Ballads'' 1823 (actually 1723), vol. i., p.&amp;nbsp;130 {{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|pp=ix–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ballad was sung to the tune of "Dainty come thou to me".{{sfnp|Johnson|1612|pp=20–25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Philips|first=Ambrose|chapter=XVI.

Of intermediate date is a version entitled "An Old Ballad of Whittington and his Cat," printed and sold in [[Aldermary Church]] Yard, London, dated 1750(?). A copy is owned by the [[Bodleian library]] (bequest of the [[Francis Douce]] collection),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/view/edition/23430 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202152354/http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/view/edition/23430 |archive-date=2014-02-02 |title=An old ballad of Whittington and his cat (Bod23430) |work=Broadside Ballads Online |author=Bodleian Libraries}} (ESTC: N10713)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the U.S., by the [[Huntington Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link|url=http://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15150coll3/id/5588 |name=Huntington library copy}} (ESTC N68225).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link|url=http://images.library.yale.edu/walpoleweb/oneitem.asp?imageId=lwlpr25497 |name=Yale University, Lewis Walpole Library copy}} (ESTC N068225)&lt;/ref&gt; These copies show the same woodcut illustrations. A later edition dated to 1773 was part of the [[Roxburghe Ballads|Roxburghe Collection]] of [[Broadside Ballads]].{{Efn|The artwork reprinted on p. 585 of the ''Roxburghe Ballads'' book differs from the art in the earlier edition.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Chappell|1895|loc=''Roxburghe Ballads'', VII, pp.&amp;nbsp;585–586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[broadside ballad]] printings have been made into the 19th century. A version entitled ''London's Glory and Whittington's Renown; or, A Looking-Glass for Citizens of London'', printed for R.

The story was also set in prose, especially in the form of common [[chapbooks]].

''The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington'' by "T. H." (first edition, 1656) is the earliest extant chapbook version of the tale in the estimation of its editor [[Henry B. Wheatley]].{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Wheatley (1885) used an undated copy assigned a conjectural date of "1670?".{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|pp=ii, xxv}} But a "1656" print date is given elsewhere.{{sfnp|Chappell|1895|loc=''Roxburge Ballads'', VII, p.&amp;nbsp;579}}}} The author's identity is only given as "T.

===Other chapbooks===
A number of other [[chapbook]] editions appeared,{{Efn|10 books are listed in {{harvp|Lane|1902}}, ''Catalogue of English and American Chapbooks'', p. 35, Nos. 601–610.}} such as the one datable to 1730.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|p=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the latest chapbook example is ''The Adventures of Sir Richard Whittingon'', printed by J.

The localization in Holloway or [[Highgate Hill]] that appeared in common chapbooks is not found in any early versions,{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|p=iii}} and Wheatley believed it to be an 18th-century invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|p=i}}: "his change of mind at Highgate Hill.. an invention of the eighteenth century". "Bunhill" in T.H.'s ''History'' may also be an invention, but Wheatley dates that text to 1670.&lt;/ref&gt; Holloway is situated in a historically inconsistent direction since it lies up north, which contradicts the tradition that the boy was fleeing towards home;{{Efn|To "his country" as given in the Ballad of 1612.}} the real Whittington's place of origin being Gloucester, lying westward.&lt;ref name=cosh/&gt;

[https://archive.org/details/historyofdickwhi00cruiiala ''The history of Dick Whittington, Lord Mayor of London: with the adventures of his cat''], Banbury, c. 1820&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Joseph Jacobs]] printed a version that is a composite of three chapbook texts in his ''English Fairy Tales'' (1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Jacobs|1890|loc="Whittington and his Cat", 167–178, 248 (notes)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is only loosely based on the life of Richard Whittington. Although Alice Fitzwarren, Dick's love interest in the play, is named after the historical Richard Whittington's wife, the cat story cannot be traced to any early historical source,{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|p=v}} and there is insufficient evidence that Whittington ever owned a cat.{{sfnp|Pickering|Morley|1993|p=65}}&lt;ref name=oxf-comp-childr-lit&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hahn |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Hahn|title=Dick Whittington |work=The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mb66BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown how the cat story came to be attached to Whittington. Suggestions were made that the cat may be a corruption of the French ''achat'' meaning "purchase" ([[Henry Thomas Riley]]),&lt;ref name=riley/&gt; or that it may come from the word "cat", another name for a coal-carrying boat which Whittington may have engaged in his business ([[Samuel Foote]]),{{Efn|Uttered by Sir Matthew Mite, a character in Foote's 1772 play ''[[The Nabob]]''}}{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|pp=xviii–xvix}}&lt;ref name=riley&gt;{{citation|last=Riley |first=Henry Thomas |author-link=Henry Thomas Riley |title=Liber Albus, Liber Custumarum Et Liber Horn |publisher=Longman, Brown |year=1859 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_FCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR18 |page=xviii–xix, note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these explanations were downplayed as implausible by later commentators.{{sfnp|Besant|Rice|1881|pp=132–133}}{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|p=v}}&lt;!--Wheatley only refutes the coal theory here.--&gt;

The [[Renold Elstracke|Elstracke]] portrait of Whittington and his cat probably dates to around 1605,&lt;ref name=globe/&gt; and does not predate the times of the earliest literary adaptations. But commentators have strived to demonstrate that various pieces of art and architecture might be allusions to the legend of ''Dick Whittington and His Cat'' that predate the early 1600s (See [[#Relics|§Relics]]).

==Parallels==
Antiquarians have noticed similarities to foreign tales of medieval origin, which tells of a character who makes his fortune selling his cat abroad. The motif was later catalogued "Whittington's cat" (N411.2) in [[Stith Thompson]]'s motif-index scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Thompson |first=Stith |author-link=Stith Thompson|title=Motif-index of Folk-literature|publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1955|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIJf9pCiVA8C&amp;pg=PA178 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Italian examples can be noted. One was told by [[Lorenzo Magalotti]] (d. 1732), regarding a 16th-century merchant Ansaldo degli Ormanni who made his fortune selling his cat to the king of the isle of Canary (Canaria).&lt;ref&gt;Published in: {{citation|last=Magalotti |first=Lorenzo  |title=Novella |work=Novelle scelte dai piu celebri autori italiani  |volume=IV |place=Torino |publisher=Giuseppe Pomba |year=1830 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvAnX8VXFOcC&amp;pg=PA112 |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ouseley&gt;Parallel to Magalotti's tale stated, and synopsis given in: {{citation|last=Ouseley|first=William|title=Travels in Various Countries of the East, More Particularly Persia|volume=1|publisher=Rodwell and Martin|year=1819|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1G5BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|pages=170, 171n}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, the ''Novella delle Gatte'' ("Tale of the she-cats") told by [[Piovano Arlotto]] (d. 1484), was published in the collection of witticisms (''Facetiae'') attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Printed in: {{cite book|last1=Mainardi|first1=Arlotto |title=Facezie, motti, buffonerie, et burle, del piovano Arlotto, del Gonnella, &amp; del Barlacchia |year=1568 |place=Firenze |publisher=Appresso i Giunti}} (cited in {{Harvp|Keightley|1834|p=257n}}). For other editions, see e.g. {{cite book|last1=Mainardi|first1=Arlotto|chapter=Il Piovano, a un Prete, che fece mercanzia di palle dice la novella delle Gatte|title=Scelta di facezie, motti, burle, e buffonerie del Piovano Arlotto et altri autori |place=Lucca|publisher=per Salvatore e Gian Domenico Maresc|year=1601|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EAVMlIIeJwC&amp;pg=PA23|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="palgrave"&gt;Arlotto as an analogue was mentioned the piece by {{cite journal|last=Palgrave |first=Francis |author-link=Francis Palgrave |title=Antiquities of Nursery Literature (Review of Tabart, ''Fairy Tales'', 1818) |journal=The Quarterly Review |volume=XXI |year=1819 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gR5l2a2X4CAC&amp;pg=PA99 |pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar tale is "also found in a German chronicle of the thirteenth century",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|p=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the tale is localized in [[Venice]], Italy. [[Albert of Stade|Albert von Stade]] in his ''Chronicon Alberti Abbati Stadensis'', writing on the events in 1175,{{Efn|His main topic was the development that year in the strife between the then-emperor ([[Manuel I Komnenos]]) and Venice.}} sidetracks into a legendary tale involving two early citizens of Venice. The rich man about to mount on a trade expedition offers to take a consignment of merchandise from the poor man (who could only afford 2 cats), and a great profit is realized to reward the poor friend. [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Keightley]], who identified the tale as a parallel Whittington's, said the legend "was apparently an old one in Italy", although nothing was certain beyond it being known in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="keightley"/&gt;

A Persian story localized around Keish ([[Kish Island]]) tells of a certain widow's son who lived in the 10th century and made his fortune in India with his cat. This tale occurs in the ''Tarik al-Wasaf'' (''[[Wassaf|Tārīkḣ-i Waṣṣāf]]''), a 14th-century chronicle. The similarity was noted by [[James Justinian Morier|James Morier]], ''Second Journey'' (1818), and [[William Gore Ouseley]], ''Travels'' (1819).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morier|first=James|title=A second journey through Persia, Armenia, and Asia Minor, to Constantinople, between the year 1810 and 1816|publisher=Longman|year=1818|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVRJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA31|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ouseley|first=William|title=Travels in Various Countries of the East, More Particularly Persia|volume=1|publisher=Rodwell and Martin|year=1819|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1G5BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA171 |pages=170 and 171n}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Morier was staffed to Persian ambassador, [[Gore Ouseley]], from whom he heard the tale. The younger Ouseley was stationed around the same period, 1810–, during his uncle's ambassadorship.&lt;/ref&gt;

A convenient source of the parallels is [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Keightley]], who devoted Chapter VII of his ''Tales and Popular Fictions'' (1834) to the topic, boasting of the largest compilation of these parallels ever.&lt;ref name="keightley"&gt;{{citation|last=Keightley|chapter=Chapter VII Whittington and his cat – Danish legends – Italian stories – Persian legends|title=Tales and Popular Fictions: Their Resemblance, and Transmission from Country to Country|publisher=Whittaker and Co.|year=1834|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4QSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241|pages=241–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he was not the first to make note of the parallels in published form.&lt;ref name=ouseley/&gt;

"Whittington and his Cat" is listed as one of the analogues grouped under [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms' tale]] KHM 70 ''[[:de:Die drei Glückskinder|Die drei Glückskinder]]'' ("[[The Three Sons of Fortune]]") in [[Johannes Bolte|Bolte]] and [[Jiří Polívka|Polívka]]'s ''Anmerkungen''. The list organizes parallel folktales by different language (including Dutch and German printings of "Whittington and his Cat").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolte |first=Johannes |last2=Polívka |first2=Jiří |chapter=70.

Another parallel could be found in [[Puss in Boots]].

===Tale type===
In modern folkloristics, tales with the same plot structure are classified under [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] (AT) tale type 1651 "Whittington's Cat".&lt;ref&gt;Uther, Hans-Jörg (2004), ''The Types of International Folktales'', pp.&amp;nbsp;354–5&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the tale type need not feature a cat, and the helper can be replaced by the angel St. Michael or St. Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitré |first=Giuseppe |editor-last=Zipes|editor-first=Jack |editor-last2=Russo|editor-first2=Joseph |title=115.

==Stage productions==
The story has been adapted into puppet play, opera, dramatic play, and pantomime.

===Puppet play===
There is an early record of puppet performance of the legend, dating to [[Samuel Pepys]]'s diary of 21 September 1668, which reads: "To Southwark Fair, very dirty, and there saw the puppet show of Whittington, which was pretty to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Covent Garden]], performances of "Whittington and his Cat" were put on by the puppeteer [[Martin Powell (puppetry)|Martin Powell]] (fl. 1710–1729).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB| wstitle=Powell, Martin (DNB00) |last=Seccombe |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Seccombe |volume=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeIpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA246 |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powell was a successful showman, providing such a draw that the parish church of St. Paul would be drained of its congregation during hours of prayer when his plays were on.&lt;ref name="spectator-no14"&gt;Steele, ''The Spectator'' No. 14, Friday, 16 March 1711; In [[#morley-spectator|Morley's annoted new edition]], pp.&amp;nbsp;24–26&lt;/ref&gt; An advertisement bill of the puppet show has been copied out in ''Groans of Great Britain'', once credited to [[Daniel Defoe]] but since reattributed to [[Charles Gildon]] (d. 1724), with a description of some of the many extraneously added characters and elements:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At Punch's Theater in the Little Piazza, Covent-Garden, this present Evening will be performed an Entertainment, called, ''The History of Sir Richard Whittington'', shewing his Rise from a Scullion to be Lord-Mayor of London, with the Comical Humours of Old Madge, the jolly Chamber-maid, and the Representation of the Sea, and the Court of Great Britain, concluding with the Court of Aldermen, and ''Whittington Lord-Mayor'', honoured with the Presence of [[Henry VIII|K. Hen. VIII.]] and his Queen [[Anne Boleyn|Anna Bullen]], with other diverting Decorations proper to the Play, beginning at 6 o' clock".&lt;ref&gt;''Groans of Great Britain'', published 1813, at the time considered the work of "[[Daniel Defoe|De Foe]]", quoted in Morley's footnote, p.&amp;nbsp;53n, in: Addison, ''Spectator'' No. 31, Friday, April 5, 1711; In [[#morley-spectator|Morley's annoted new edition]], pp.&amp;nbsp;51–53&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The puppet play ''Whittington and his Cat'' was reviewed by an anonymous correspondent in ''The Spectator'', No. 14, dated 16 March 1711, soon after it opened.&lt;ref name="spectator-no14"/&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha" |Morley, in the added notes to ''Spectator'', No. 14&lt;ref name="spectator-no14"/&gt; states: "Powell,... who, taking up Addison's joke against the opera from No.5 of  the ''Spectator'' (March 6, 1711),&lt;ref name="spectator-no5"/&gt; produced ''Whittington and his Cat'' as a rival to  ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo and Armida]]''". If so, the review in No. 14 of the journal, dated 16 March is less than a fortnight later.}} It featured [[Pulcinella|Punch]] (of the [[Punch and Judy]] shows) as did all of Powell's puppet plays. Punch danced a [[minuet]] with a trained pig in the opening scene. Punch also gave his "reflections on the French" that was a breach of "the Moral", as was King Harry ([[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) resting his leg on his queen in an immodest manner. Little else on the performance can be gleaned, except that the hero's role (i.e., Punch's role) was performed in a squeaky high voice, just like the lead of the Italian opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo and Armida]]'', the rival draw at the time at [[Covent Garden]] which the anonymous reviewer was simultaneously critiquing. The reviewer concludes "as the Wit of both pieces are equal, I must prefer...Mr Powell, because it is in our own language".&lt;ref name="spectator-no14"/&gt;

===Opera===
An opera production that never came into realization was a topic in [[Joseph Addison]]'s piece in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' (1711). Addison states he was "credibly informed that there was once a Design of casting into an Opera the Story of ''Whittington'' and his Cat, and that in order to it, there had been got together a great Quantity of Mice," but that Mr. Rich ([[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]]) who was proprietor of the playhouse (he managed several including [[Drury Lane theatre]]&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Rich at one time also managed [[Haymarket Theatre]], which was where [[sparrows]] were released for the opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo and Armida]]'', which prompted Addison to write about the release of mice for the possible production of Whittington's tale.&lt;/ref&gt;) objected that the rodents once released will not be thoroughly collected.&lt;ref name="spectator-no5"&gt;Addison, ''The Spectator'' No. 5, Tuesday, 6 March 1711; In [[#morley-spectator|Morley's annoted new edition]], p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvp|Wheatley|1885|pp=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|It is not so clear if Addison wrote the mice idea in earnest or in jest, but stage critic [[Dutton Cook]] (1878) in an article on "Stage Properties" repeats this story at face value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cook |first=Dutton |author-link=Edward Dutton Cook |title=Stage Properties |journal=Belgravia |volume=35 |number=139 |year=1878 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oViARV9w59wC&amp;pg=PA288 |pages=288–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sparrows is given as fact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allardyce Nicoll|Nicoll, Allardyce]] (1925) ''A History of Early Eighteenth Century Drama'', p. 30 "verisimilitude down to sparrows and tomtits"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later ''Whittington and his Cat'', an opera written by Samuel Davey, was performed at the [[Smock Alley Theatre|Theatre in Smock Alley]], Dublin, 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al. (1812), ''{{plain link|name=Names of dramas: M-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpAUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA402}}', p.&amp;nbsp;402, citing Hitchcock, Robert (1788), ''{{Plain link|name=An Historial View of the Irish Stage, '''I'''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqU_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA104}}'', p. 104 regarding authorship.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Whittington (opera)|Whittington]]'', with music by [[Jacques Offenbach]] and English text by [[H. B. Farnie]] was first produced at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] over Christmas 1874–75,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gänzl|Gänzl, Kurt]].

===Pantomime===
The first recorded pantomime version of the story was in 1814, starring [[Joseph Grimaldi]] as Dame Cicely Suet, the Cook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Drama, &amp;c.|journal=The Lady's magazine (and museum of the belles lettres...)|series=Improved series enlarged|volume=VIII|date=January 1836|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0cFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|pages=63–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pickering|Morley|1993|p=66}}, spelt "Cecily Suet".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ella Shields]] (Camden Theatre, 1907), [[Sybil Arundale]] ([[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]], Birmingham, 1908), Helen Gilliland ([[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]], 1925) are among the actresses who have played the [[principal boy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=anonymous |title=Patomime Day |journal= The Bystander: An Illustrated Weekly, Devoted to Travel, Literature ... |volume=16 |date=25 December 1907 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdwRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 |page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Moore |first=F.

The pantomime has introduced an arch villain, the Pantomime King Rat (or King of Rats),{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|King Rat has been played by [[Andrew Sachs]]{{sfnp|Pickering|Morley|1993|pp=xvii–xviii}}&lt;!--and others--&gt;, and Queen Rat by [[Honor Blackman]]{{sfnp|Pickering|Morley|1993|p=xviii}} and other actresses.}} as well as the usual pantomime fairy, the Fairy of the Bells, personifying the London bells.{{sfnp|Pickering|Morley|1993|p=67}} An early record of King Rat and fairy occurs in an 1877 production at [[Surrey Theatre]].

==Relics==

There are various pieces of art and architecture which have been used to try to date the Whittington association to earlier than the 1600s. The [[Renold Elstracke|Elstracke]] engraving providing Whittington's portrait with a cat had been ascribed a c. 1590 date by some 19th century authors. A Newgate statue claiming to be Whittington's cat was actually a Libertas goddess statue, and though there were suggestions it was made by the executors of Whittington's will when they rebuilt the prison, the existence of the statues prior to the Great Fire of 1666 cannot be firmly established.

Other relics are a relief tablet of a boy and animal said to be found at a home that belonged to the family, a chariot with a cat carving that was the gift of the family.

===Early painting with cat===
A Whittington portrait painting depicting the mayor with a cat, allegedly dating to 1532, was once kept at the [[Mercers' Hall]].{{sfnp|Lysons|1860|p=42}}{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|pp=}} The original has been lost, prompting [[Henry B. Wheatley|Wheatley]] to remark that the disappeared artwork "can scarcely be put in evidence".{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|p=viii}} However, a facsimile of it has been reproduced in engraving in ''The New Wonderful Museum'' (1805) edited by William Granger and James Caulfield (see image at top).{{sfnp|Granger|Caulfield|1805|p=1419}}

The portrait painting that did exist at [[Mercers' Hall]], affixed with a 1536 date had been witnessed and described by [[James Peller Malcolm]] (d. 1815) in ''Londinium Redivivum'', Vol. 4 (1807). The painting was in the apartment of the clerk of [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|Mercers' Company]] at Mercers' Hall. According to Malcolm, this portrait of Whittington's had "on the left hand.. &lt;!--of the figure is--&gt; a black and white cat, whose right ear reaches up to the band or broad turning down to the shirt of the figure". Malcolm admits that the 1536 date had been repainted at a later date after the canvas was cropped, but commented that "it is hardly to be supposed" that this date "was then invented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Malcolm |first=James Peller |title=Londinium Redivivum |publisher=Nichols and Son |year=1807 |url=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=Sck_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA515 |pages=515–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting had disappeared by the time [[Samuel Lysons (priest)|Rev. Samuel Lysons]], who published the mayor's biography in 1860, requested a viewing of it Mercer's Hall. Another portrait was available for him to see, but it was more modern and did not correspond to Malcolm's descriptions. At Mercer's hall also had on display an engraved portrait of Whittington and his cat by [[Guillaume Philippe Benoist]].{{sfnp|Lysons|1860|p=42}} The Benoist was published 1766, and according to the caption represents the Whittington and cat portrait then still hanging at Mercer's Hall.{{Efn|"S&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;. Rich&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;. Wittington, from an Original Painting at Mercers Hall".&lt;ref name=npg/&gt; The caption and the illustration are virtually the same as the [[:File:Richard Wittington and his Cat.jpg image]] reproduced in ''The New Wonderful Museum'' (1805),{{sfnp|Granger|Caulfield|1805|p=1419}} shown above. One difference is the signature "Benoist sculp" legible on bottom right rim of the 1766 print.&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=npg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitLarge/mw147550/Fictitious-portrait-of-Richard-Dick-Whittington |title=Fictitious portrait of Richard ('Dick') Whittington |work=National Portrait Gallery |year=2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}} (Shelfmark D33978)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The Benoist was used in [[William Thornton]]'s ''The New, Complete, and Universal History, Description, and Survey of the cities of London and Westminster'' (1784),{{sfnp|Lysons|1860|p=42}} as well as in Lambert's ''History and Survey of London'' (1805).&lt;ref name=brit_museum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=1188344001&amp;objectId=3461564&amp;partId=1 |title=Sr Richd Whittington |work=British Museum |accessdate=20 December 2017}} (Shelfmark 1927,1126.1.30.64, from Lambert's 1805 book)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early engraving with cat===
There was also an early engraving by [[Renold Elstracke|Reginald Elstrack]] (1570 – after 1625).  This engraving, entitled the "True Portraicture" or ''Vera Effigies Preclarmi Domini Richardi Whittington Equi Aurat'' is reproduced in the inset of Lyson's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Lysons|1860|pp=15–18, 43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving cannot be definitely dated; Lysons noted that the printmaker flourished c. 1590, and this is the date assigned by [[Walter Besant|Sir Walter Besant]] and [[James Rice (writer)|James Rice]],&lt;ref name="Besant 1881 132"&gt;{{Harvp|Besant|Rice|1881|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources give a 1605 date.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite book|last=Globe |first=Alexander V. |title=Whittington, Sir Richard |work=Peter Stent, London Printseller |place=Vancouver |publisher=University of British Columbia Press |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXwK5LH8v0EC&amp;pg=PA87 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the prints can be read "R. Elstrack ''Sculpsit''" at bottom,&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=fitzwilliam-museum-cambridge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/support/artfund/opac/cataloguedetail.html?&amp;priref=34813&amp;_function_=xslt&amp;_limit_=25 |title=Vera Effigies Preclarmi Domini Richardi Whittington Equi Aurat |work=The Fitzwilliam Museum |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=26 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121034207/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/support/artfund/opac/cataloguedetail.html?&amp;priref=34813&amp;_function_=xslt&amp;_limit_=25 |archivedate=21 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is truncated in Lysons's reproduction.

It has also been noted that the engraving originally depicted Whittington with a skull under his hand, but had been replaced with a cat underneath, to cater to public taste, "as the common people did not care to buy the print without it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Granger|first=James|title=A biographical history of England|volume=1|edition=3|year=1779|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkDdXWZegeQC&amp;pg=PA63|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granger vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;63 is cited in {{Harvp|Lysons|1860|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Lysons adduces the Elstrack's print as bearing a close resemblance ("as identical as can possibly be") to a contemporary source (an illumination on an ordinance).{{sfnp|Lysons|1860|p=44}} But this is a deathbead drawing of the mayor which does not help corroborate the cat legend. A facsimile of the deathbed drawing is given in Lysons' book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lysons|1860}}, {{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books/content?id=vA8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68-IA3|name=p. 68, opposite}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Newgate statue===

The antiquarian [[Thomas Pennant]] believed that a statue of Whittington with his cat was installed in a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] in [[Newgate]]) in 1412, by the executors of Whittington's estate, but that it was damaged in [[The Great Fire of 1666]] and replaced.&lt;ref name="pennant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pennant Thomas |first=|author-link=Thomas Pennant |title=(Some) Account of London |edition=34 |publisher=John Archer |year=1791|origyear=1790|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRJbAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA232 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lysons|1860|p=47}}, citing Pennant.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Lysons|Lysons]]{{sfnp|Lysons|1860|p=47}} and others{{sfnp|Besant|Rice|1881|p=136}} had lent some credance to this statement by Pennant. But much of Pennant's assumptions here have been subjected to corrections and refutations.

This "assertion that a carved figure of a cat existed on Newgate gaol before the great fire is an unsupported assumption," or so it was pronounced by historian [[Charles Lethbridge Kingsford]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|noprescript=1|volume=28|wstitle=Whittington, Richard|page=615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on Newgate at Whittington's bequest did not commence during his lifetime in 1412, but in 1442.&lt;ref name="way"&gt;Way, R. E., correspondence, in ''{{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LosAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA266|name=The Antiquary}}'' '''III''', p. 266, 31 May 1873 (in reply to T. R., p. 200).&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of Whittington's will kept at Guildhall that prescribes this fails to mention a statue, or him and his cat.{{Refn|Latin text and translation of this brief will is given by Price's article in ''Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society'', 5&lt;ref name="price"/&gt;}}

This statue was actually the female [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] ("Libertas" carved on the hat) with a cat at her feet, but it was "alluding to" Richard Whittington, as explained by Maitland.&lt;ref name=maitland&gt;{{cite book|last=Maitland|first=William|title=The history and survey of London: from its foundation to the present time|publisher=T. Osborne and J. Shipton|volume=2|year=1756|page=950|url=https://archive.org/stream/historysurveyofl02mait#page/950/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lysons|1860|p=47}}, citing Maitland.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone Liberty was one of a set of seven, the others being Peace, Plenty, Concord, and Justice, Mercy, and Truth.&lt;ref name=maitland/&gt;&lt;ref name="way"/&gt;

This Whittington statue (Liberty statue) was taken down when the old [[Newgate]] was being demolished, in 1766 or 1776, to be placed in the new [[Newgate Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Year given as 1776 and quote from "diurnal" entry (Tuesday, 9 July, [1776]) in: {{citation|last=Burn|first=Jacob Henry|title=A Descriptive Catalogue|year=1855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEMGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA177|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Year given as 1766, and paraphrase of "journal" in Price's article.&lt;ref name="price"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price |first=John Edward |title=On Recent Discoveries in Newgate Street |journal=Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society |volume=5 |year=1881 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mxIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA416 |pages=416–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Which contradicts Pennant's belief that the statue was demolished when the new [[Newgate prison]] was built.&lt;ref name="pennant"/&gt;}} The Liberty statue could later be seen at the new Newgate Prison, but the cat was not with her.&lt;ref name="way"/&gt;

===Chariot with carved cat===
Also a chariot with a carved cat, purportedly presented by Whittington's heirs to the merchant's guild in 1572, was available for the biographer [[Samuel Lysons]] to examine.{{sfnp|Lysons|1860|p=47}}

===Boy and a cat from Gloucester===
It was purported that in 1862 at the site of a former residence of Whittington (in [[Gloucester]]), there was unearthed a piece of stone, possibly chimney stone, bearing a ''[[bas-relief|basso relievo]]'' of a boy holding a cat. It was allegedly of 15th-century workmanship. The relic came into the possession of [[Samuel Lysons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lysons|first=Samuel |author-link=Samuel Lysons (priest) |title=Whittington and His Cat: |journal=Notes and Queries |series=3 |volume=II |date=16 August 1862 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gdo1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA121 |pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Overall, W. H., correspondence, in ''{{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LosAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA266|name=The Antiquary}}'' '''III''', p. 266, 31 May 1873 (in reply to T. R., p. 200).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Overall contributed assistance to Price's 1881 article later on--&gt; Besant and Rice called this "remarkable proof" that the cat story was in the family,{{sfnp|Besant|Rice|1881|p=137}} but Wheatley thought "this find, however, appears rather suspicious".{{sfnp|Wheatley|1885|p=vi}} This artwork could have been acquired after the cat legend was established, as American folklorist [[Jennifer Westwood]] points out,{{Efn|"The story is sometimes connected, whether as cause or effect, with a limestone bas-relief found in a house in Gloucester in 1862", Westwood (1984), p. 114.}} and the supposed "cat" looked more like a lamb to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Westwood |first=Jennifer |author-link=Jennifer Westwood |title=Albion: A Guide to Legendary Britain  |publisher=HarperCollins Canada, Limited |year=1985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quDZAAAAMAAJ |pages=112–114|isbn=978-0-2461-1789-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cat has been preserved at the Gloucester Folk Museum (now called [[Gloucester Life]] Museum), but taken off display.{{sfnp|Westwood|1985|p=114}}

'''''Early and Medieval Chinese History'''''（''EMCH''《早期中國史研究》） is an academic periodical magazine, about [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient]] and [[Medieval China|Medieval Chinese]] history studies, published by the [[Society of Early and Medieval Chinese History]] ([[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]).

==History==
In 2009, some members of the Studies Group of Medieval Chinese History at [[National Taiwan University]] (NTU),  [[Li-hsin Chao]] [[National Chi Nan University]] as the promoter of this group, starting to emerge a new academic community. The ''EMCH'' is one of their main and routine acativites.

The '''''Encyclopedia of American Studies''''' (EAS) covers the history and culture of the [[United States]], from [[Pre-Colonial America|pre-colonial days]] to the present, and the [[American Studies|American Studies movement]]. The ''Encyclopedia of American Studies'' first appeared in 2001 as a four-volume print edition, published by [[Grolier |Grolier Press]]. The EAS was sponsored by the [[American Studies Association]], which appointed an editorial board consisting of [[Johnnella Butler]], [[Robert A. Gross|Robert Gross]], and [[Miles Orvell]]. (Robert Gross was replaced by [[Jay Mechling]] during the first year of planning.) The intent behind the EAS was to create a work that would serve the needs of scholars, graduate students, college students and a high school audience, a work that would be accessible yet authoritative and that would cover the range of American history and culture from an interdisciplinary perspective. Articles in the EAS range from the singular features of American material culture (e.g. the [[Statue of Liberty]] or [[Barbie Doll]]s) to the broadest concepts of American intellectual culture (e.g. [[Exceptionalism]] and [[Millennialism]]) as well as the methods and theories of American Studies.

In 2003 the EAS appeared in its initial online version, and in 2005 [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] took over as publisher, working with the American Studies Association, and making the EAS a regular benefit of membership in the ASA. Miles Orvell served as Editor in Chief of the online version until 2011 and organized an EAS Advisory Board appointed by the American Studies Association. In 2011, [[Simon J. Bronner]], distinguished professor of American Studies at [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], took over the reins of the EAS as Editor in Chief. Participation in the EAS grew with the involvement of students, staff, faculty, and regional scholars around the doctoral program in American Studies at Penn State Harrisburg in addition to an international roster of contributors and advisory board members. The online version added illustrations, related web links, and bibliographic listings to the original entries. The EAS also sponsored a Forum on the American Studies Association website with essays related to the mission of the Encyclopedia such as "Encyclopedias and American Studies" with a panel of encyclopedia editors and "Organizing a Class on Organizing" by [[Mark Rudd]]. The EAS is expanded and updated quarterly, with an ever-growing database of articles, illustrations, and bibliographies that stay current with the evolution of American Studies scholarship. In 2011, the EAS had over 700 entries, including new topics such as "[[transnationalism]]," "American Studies: A Discipline," and "Women and Labor."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28775">In [[mathematics education]], '''ethnomathematics''' is the study of the relationship between [[mathematics]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio, 1999, 146)  D'Ambrosio. (1999). Literacy, Matheracy, and Technoracy: A Trivium for Today. Mathematical Thinking and Learning 1(2), 131-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Often associated with "cultures without written expression",&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio, 1997, may paraphrases Ascher 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; it may also be defined as "the mathematics which is practised among identifiable cultural groups".&lt;ref&gt;(Powell and Frankenstein, 1997 quoting D'Ambrosio) Powell, Arthur B., and Marilyn Frankenstein (eds.) (1997). Ethnomathematics: Challenging Eurocentrism in Mathematics Education, p.7. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3351-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a broad cluster of ideas ranging from distinct numerical and mathematical systems to multicultural mathematics education. The goal of ethnomathematics is to contribute both to the understanding of culture and the understanding of mathematics, and mainly to lead to an appreciation of the connections between the two.

==The development and meaning of "ethnomathematics"==
The term "ethnomathematics" was introduced by the Brazilian educator and mathematician [[Ubiratàn D'Ambrosio]] in 1977 during a presentation for the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].  Since D'Ambrosio put forth the term, people - D'Ambrosio included - have struggled with its meaning ("An etymological abuse leads me to use the words, respectively, ''ethno'' and ''mathema'' for their categories of analysis and ''tics'' from (from techne)".&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio 1997) D'Ambrosio. (1997). "Foreword", Ethnomathematics, p.xv and xx. {{ISBN|0-7914-3352-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The following is a sampling of some of the definitions of ethnomathematics proposed between 1985 and 2006:

*"The mathematics which is practiced among identifiable cultural groups such as national-tribe societies, labour groups, children of certain age brackets and professional classes".&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio, 1985)  D'Ambrosio. (1985). Ethnomathematics and its place in the history and pedagogy of mathematics. For the Learning of Mathematics, 5, 44-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The mathematics implicit in each practice".&lt;ref&gt;(Gerdes, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The study of mathematical ideas of a non-literate culture".&lt;ref&gt;(Ascher, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The codification which allows a cultural group to describe, manage and understand reality".&lt;ref&gt;(D.Ambrosio, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Mathematics…is conceived as a cultural product which has developed as a result of various activities".&lt;ref&gt;(Bishop, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The study and presentation of mathematical ideas of traditional peoples".&lt;ref&gt;(Ascher, 1991)  Ascher, Marcia (1991). Ethnomathematics: A Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas. Pacific Grove, Calif.: Brooks/Cole. {{ISBN|0-412-98941-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Any form of cultural knowledge or social activity characteristic of a social group and/or cultural group that can be recognized by other groups such as Western anthropologists, but not necessarily by the group of origin, as mathematical knowledge or mathematical activity".&lt;ref&gt;(Pompeu, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The mathematics of cultural practice".&lt;ref&gt;(Presmeg, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The investigation of the traditions, practices and mathematical concepts of a subordinated social group".&lt;ref&gt;(Knijnik, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"I have been using the word ''ethnomathematics'' as modes, styles, and techniques (''tics'') of explanation, of understanding, and of coping with the natural and cultural environment (''mathema'') in distinct cultural systems (''ethnos'')".&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio, 1999, 146)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"What is the difference between ethnomathematics and the general practice of creating a mathematical model of a cultural phenomenon (e.g., the "mathematical anthropology" of Paul Kay [1971] and others)? The essential issue is the relation between intentionality and [[epistemology|epistemological]] status. A single drop of water issuing from a watering can, for example, can be modeled mathematically, but we would not attribute knowledge of that mathematics to the average gardener. Estimating the increase in seeds required for an increased garden plot, on the other hand, would qualify".&lt;ref&gt;(Eglash et al. 2006)  Eglash, R., Bennett, A., O'Donnell, C., Jennings, S., and Cintorino, M. "Culturally Situated Design Tools: Ethnocomputing from Field Site to Classroom." American Anthropologist, Vol. 108, No. 2. (2006), pp. 347–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==

===Numerals and naming systems===

====Numerals====

Some of the systems for representing numbers in previous and present cultures are well known. [[Roman numerals]] use a few letters of the alphabet to represent numbers up to the thousands, but are not intended for arbitrarily large numbers and can only represent positive [[integers]]. [[Arabic numerals]] are a family of systems, originating in India and passing to [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic civilization]], then to Europe, and now standard in global culture—and having undergone many curious changes with time and geography—can represent arbitrarily large numbers and have been adapted to negative numbers, [[fractions]], and [[real numbers]].

Less well known systems include some that are written and can be read today, such as the Hebrew and Greek method of using the letters of the [[alphabet]], in order, for digits 1–9, tens 10–90, and hundreds 100–900.

A completely different system is that of the [[quipu]], which recorded numbers on knotted strings.

Ethnomathematicians are interested in the ways in which numeration systems grew up, as well as their similarities and differences and the reasons for them.  The great variety in ways of representing numbers is especially intriguing.

====Names for numbers====

This means the ways in which number words are formed.&lt;ref&gt;(See Menninger (1934, 1969).) Menninger, Karl (1934), ''Zahlwort und Ziffer''. Revised edition (1958). Göttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht. (See Menninger (1934, 1969).) Menninger, Karl (1969), ''Number Words and Number Symbols''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky (1973) Zaslavsky, Claudia (1973). ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture''. Third revised ed., 1999. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1-55652-350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====English=====
For instance, in English, there are four different systems. The units words (one to nine) and ten are special.  The next two are reduced forms of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] "one left over" and "two left over" (i.e., after counting to ten).  Multiples of ten from "twenty" to "ninety" are formed from the units words, one through nine, by a single pattern.  Thirteen to nineteen, and in a slightly different way twenty-one through ninety-nine (excluding the tens words), are compounded from tens and units words.  Larger numbers are also formed on a base of ten and its powers ("hundred" and "thousand").  One may suspect this is based on an ancient tradition of finger counting.  Residues of ancient counting by 20s and 12s are the words "score", "dozen", and "gross". (Larger number words like "million" are not part of the original English system; they are scholarly creations based ultimately on Latin.)

=====German=====
The German language counts similarly to English, but the unit is placed first in numbers over 20. For example, "26" is "sechsundzwanzig", literally "six and twenty". This system was formerly common in English, as seen in an artifact from the English [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]": ''Sing a song of sixpence, / a pocket full of rye. / Four and twenty blackbirds, / baked in a pie.'' It persists in some children's songs such as "[https://guidezone.e-guiding.com/jmone_twenty.htm One and Twenty]."

=====French=====
In the French language as used in France, one sees some differences. ''Soixante-dix'' (literally, "sixty-ten") is used for "seventy". The words "quatre-vingt" (literally, "four-twenty", or 80) and "quatre-vingt-dix" (literally, "four-twenty ten" 90) are based on 20 ("vingt") instead of 10. [[Swiss French]] and [[Belgian French]] do not use these forms, preferring more standard [[Latin]]ate forms: ''septante'' for 70, ''octante'' for 80 and ''nonante'' for 90; In Swiss, they even replaced 80 with ''huitante'' (See the article [[:fr:80 (nombre)|80 (number) in French Wikipedia]]), which can date back to 12th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Bien écrire et parler juste, guide pratique d'expression et de communication |magazine=[[Reader's Digest|Sélection du Reader's Digest]] |page=21 |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |language=fr |first1=Yves |last1=Cormier |author-link=Yves Cormier |title=Dictionnaire du français acadien |editor=Fides |year=2009 |page=253 |isbn=978-2-7621-3010-2 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mesopotamia=====
In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], the base for constructing numbers was 60, with 10 used as an intermediate base for numbers below 60.

=====West Africa=====
Many West African languages base their number words on a combination of 5 and 20, derived from thinking of a complete hand or a complete set of [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] comprising both fingers and toes. In fact, in some languages, the words for 5 and 20 refer to these body parts (e.g., a word for 20 that means "man complete"). The words for numbers below 20 are based on 5 and higher numbers combine the lower numbers with multiples and powers of 20.  Of course, this description of hundreds of languages is badly oversimplified; better information and references can be found in Zaslavsky (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia (1973). ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture''. Third revised ed., 1999. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1-55652-350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finger counting====
{{Main|Finger counting}}
Many systems of [[finger counting]] have been, and still are, used in various parts of the world. Most are not as obvious as holding up a number of fingers. The position of fingers may be most important.&lt;ref&gt;(See Zaslavsky (1980) for some finger-counting gestures.)  Zaslavsky, Claudia (1980). ''Count On Your Fingers African Style''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell. Revised with new illustrations, New York: Black Butterfly Books. {{ISBN|0-86316-250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One continuing use for finger counting is for people who speak different languages to communicate prices in the marketplace.

In contrast to finger counting, the [[Yuki people]] (indigenous Americans from Northern California) keep count by using the four spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| isbn=0-412-98941-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as an [[octal]] (base-8) counting system.

===The history of mathematics===

This area of ethnomathematics mainly focuses on addressing [[Eurocentrism]] by countering the common belief{{according to whom|date=September 2014}} that most worthwhile{{clarify|date=September 2014}} mathematics known and used today was developed in the Western world.&lt;!--the Greeks attributed mathematics to the Babylonians, the medieval Christians to the Arabs/Persians. So, up to the medieval period, "Western" contribution is rather underemphasized than overemphasized. For *modern* mathematics otoh it is of course true that it was mostly developed in the West, in the 18th to 19th centuries. So if you want to discuss "worthwhile" mathematics, please make clear if this is about historical, medieval mathematics, or about modern mathematics.--&gt;
 
The area stresses that "the history of mathematics has been oversimplified",{{according to whom|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--every field of knowledge has been 'oversimplified' by *somebody* (e.g. in journalism). Explain how this is somehow peculiar to the field of the history of mathematics more than of any other field--&gt;
and seeks to explore the emergence of mathematics from various ages and civilizations throughout human history.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Some examples and major contributors====

D'Ambrosio's 1980 review of the evolution of mathematics, his 1985 appeal to include ethnomathematics in the history of mathematics and his 2002 paper about the historiographical approaches to non-Western mathematics are excellent examples. Additionally, Frankenstein and Powell's 1989 attempt to redefine mathematics from a non-eurocentric viewpoint and Anderson's 1990 concepts of world mathematics are strong contributions to this area. Detailed examinations of the history of the mathematical developments of non-European civilizations, such as the [[Japanese mathematics|mathematics of ancient Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;(Shigeru, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;(Robson, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;(Ritter, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and of Islamic,&lt;ref&gt;(Sesiano, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;(Langermann and Simonson, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and Incan&lt;ref&gt;(Gilsdorf, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; civilizations, have also been presented.

===The philosophy and cultural nature of mathematics===

The core of any debate about the cultural nature of mathematics will ultimately lead to an examination of the nature of mathematics itself. One of the oldest and most controversial topics in this area is whether mathematics is internal or external, tracing back to the arguments of Plato, an externalist, and Aristotle, an internalist. On the one hand, Internalists such as Bishop, Stigler and Baranes, believe mathematics to be a cultural product. On the other hand, externalists, like Barrow, Chevallard and Penrose, see mathematics as culture-free, and tend to be major critics of ethnomathematics. With disputes about the nature of mathematics, come questions about the nature of ethnomathematics, and the question of whether ethnomathematics is part of mathematics or not. Barton, who has offered the core of research about ethnomathematics and philosophy, asks whether "ethnomathematics is a precursor, parallel body of knowledge or precolonized body of knowledge" to mathematics and if it is even possible for us to identify all types of mathematics based on a Western-epistemological foundation.&lt;ref&gt;(Barton, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political math===
{{Further|Anti-racist mathematics}}
The contributions in this area try to illuminate how mathematics has affected the nonacademic areas of society. One of the most controversial and provocative political components of ethnomathematics is its racial implications. Ethnomathematicians purport that the prefix "ethno" should not be taken as relating to race, but rather, the cultural traditions of groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio. (1985). "Ethnomathematics and its place in the history and pedagogy of mathematics". ''For the Learning of Mathematics'', 5, 44-8., 1987; Borba, 1990; Skovsmose and Vithal, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in places like South Africa concepts of culture, ethnicity and race are not only intertwined but carry strong, divisive negative connotations. So, although it may be made explicit that ethnomathematics is not a "racist doctrine" it is vulnerable to association with racism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!-- Huh? This seems like [[:WP:OR]]. At the very least, a citation from a reliable source is needed. --&gt;

Another major facet of this area addresses the relationship between gender and mathematics. This looks at topics such as discrepancies between male and female math performance in educations and career-orientation, societal causes, women's contributions to mathematics research and development, etc.

====Some examples and major contributors====
Gerdes' writings about how mathematics can be used in the school systems of Mozambique and South Africa, and D'Ambrosio's 1990 discussion of the role mathematics plays in building a democratic and just society are examples of the impact mathematics can have on developing the identity of a society. In 1990, Bishop also writes about the powerful and dominating influence of Western mathematics. More specific examples of the political impact of mathematics are seen in Knijik's 1993 study of how Brazilian sugar cane farmers could be politically and economically armed with mathematics knowledge, and Osmond's analysis of an employer's perceived value of mathematics (2000).

===The mathematics of different cultures===

The focus of this area is to introduce the mathematical ideas of people who have generally been excluded from discussions of formal, academic mathematics. The research of the mathematics of these cultures indicates two, slightly contradictory viewpoints. The first supports the objectivity of mathematics and that it is something discovered not constructed. The studies reveal that all cultures have basic counting, sorting and deciphering methods, and that these have arisen independently in different places around the world. This can be used to argue that these mathematical concepts are being discovered rather than created. However, others emphasize that the usefulness of mathematics is what tends to conceal its cultural constructs. Naturally, it is not surprising that extremely practical concepts such as numbers and counting have arisen in all cultures. The universality of these concepts, however, seems harder to sustain as more and more research reveals practices which are typically mathematical, such as counting, ordering, sorting, measuring and weighing, done in radically different ways (see Section 2.1: Numerals and Naming Systems).

One of the challenges faced by researchers in this area is the fact that they are limited by their own mathematical and cultural frameworks. The discussions of the mathematical ideas of other cultures recast these into a Western framework in order to identify and understand them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This raises the questions of how many mathematical ideas evade notice simply because they lack similar Western mathematical counterparts, and of how to draw the line classifying mathematical from non-mathematical ideas.

====Some examples and major contributors====
The majority of research in this area has been about the intuitive mathematical thinking of small-scale, traditional, indigenous cultures including: Aboriginal Australians,&lt;ref&gt;(Harris,1991)&lt;/ref&gt; the indigenous people of Liberia,&lt;ref&gt;(Gay and Cole, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans in North America,&lt;ref&gt;(Pixten,1987 and Ascher, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific Islanders,&lt;ref&gt;(Kyselka, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian construction foremen,&lt;ref&gt;(Carraher, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and tribes in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;(Zaslavsky, 1973) Zaslavsky, Claudia (1973). ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture''. Third revised ed., 1999. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1-55652-350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Gerdes, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Games of skill====

An enormous variety of games that can be analyzed mathematically have been played around the world and through history. The interest of the ethnomathematician usually centers on the ways in which the game represents informal mathematical thought as part of ordinary society, but sometimes has extended to mathematical analyses of games. It does not include the careful analysis of good play&amp;mdash;but it may include the social or mathematical aspects of such analysis.

A mathematical game that is well known in European culture is [[tic-tac-toe]] (noughts-and-crosses). This is a geometrical game played on a 3-by-3 square; the goal is to form a straight line of three of the same symbol. There are many broadly similar games from all parts of England, to name only one country where they are found.

Another kind of geometrical game involves objects that move or jump over each other within a specific shape (a "board"). There may be captures. The goal may be to eliminate the opponent's pieces, or simply to form a certain configuration, e.g., to arrange the objects according to a rule. One such game is [[Nine Men's Morris]]; it has innumerable relatives where the board or setup or moves may vary, sometimes drastically. This kind of game is well suited to play out of doors with stones on the dirt, though now it may use plastic pieces on a paper or wooden board.

A mathematical game found in West Africa is to draw a certain figure by a line that never ends until it closes the figure by reaching the starting point (in mathematical terminology, this is a [[Eulerian path]] on a [[graph theory|graph]]). Children use sticks to draw these in the dirt or sand, and of course the game can be played with pen and paper.

The games of [[checkers]], [[chess]], [[oware]] (and other [[mancala]] games), and [[Go (board game)|Go]] may also be viewed as subjects for ethnomathematics.

====Mathematics in folk art====

One way mathematics appears in art is through [[symmetry|symmetries]]. Woven designs in cloth or carpets (to name two) commonly have some kind of symmetrical arrangement. A rectangular carpet often has [[rectangular symmetry]] in the overall pattern. A woven cloth may exhibit one of the seventeen kinds of [[plane symmetry groups]]; see Crowe (2004) for an illustrated mathematical study of African weaving patterns. Several types of patterns discovered by ethnomathematical communities are related to technologies; see Berczi (2002) about illustrated mathematical study of patterns and symmetry in Eurasia. Following the analysis of Indonesian folk weaving patterns&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, H: ''[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1508/1508.02868.pdf Cellular-Automata and Innovation within Indonesian Traditional Weaving Crafts]'', Computers and Society Technical Report'', November 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Batak]] traditional architectural ornaments,&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, H: ''[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01140 Deconstructing Bataknese Gorga Computationally]'', Computational Geometry Technical Report'', October 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the geometry of Indonesian traditional motifs of [[batik]] is analyzed by [[Hokky Situngkir]] that eventually made a new genre of [[fractal]] batik designs as [[generative art]]; see Situngkir and Surya (2007) for implementations.

===Mathematics education===

Ethnomathematics and mathematics education addresses first, how cultural values can affect teaching, learning and curriculum, and second, how mathematics education can then affect the political and social dynamics of a culture. One of the stances taken by many educators is that it is crucial to acknowledge the cultural context of mathematics students by teaching culturally based mathematics that students can relate to. Can teaching math through cultural relevance and personal experiences help the learners know more about reality, culture, society and themselves? Robert (2006)

Another approach suggested by mathematics educators is exposing students to the mathematics of a variety of different cultural contexts, often referred to as multicultural math. This can be used both to increase the social awareness of students and offer alternative methods of approaching conventional mathematics operations, like multiplication.(Andrew, 2005)

====Examples====
Various mathematics educators have explored ways of bringing together culture and mathematics in the classroom, such as: Barber and Estrin (1995) and Bradley (1984) on Native American education, Gerdes (1988b and 2001) with suggestions for using African art and games, Malloy (1997) about African American students and Flores (1997), who developed instructional strategies for Hispanic students.

== Criticism ==
Some critics claim that [[mathematics education]] in some countries, including the United States, unduly emphasizes ethnomathematics in order to promote [[multiculturalism]] while spending too little time on core mathematical content, and that this often results in [[pseudoscience]] being taught. An example of this criticism is an article by [[Marianne M. Jennings]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne M. Jennings: ''[http://www.csmonitor.com/1996/0402/02182.html ′Rain Forest′ Algebra Course Teaches Everything But Algebra]'', [[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', April 2, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Richard Askey]], who accuses&lt;ref&gt;Richard Askey: [http://library.msri.org/books/Book36/files/askey.pdf ''The Third Mathematics Education Revolution''], published in ''Contemporary Issues in Mathematics Education'' (Press Syndicate, Cambridge, UK, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Focus on Algebra'', the same [[Addison-Wesley]] textbook criticized by Marianne M. Jennings, of teaching pseudoscience, claiming for [[South Sea island]]ers [[mysticism|mystic]] knowledge of [[astronomy]] more advanced than scientific knowledge.

[[File:Memento Timeline.png|thumb|230px|Timeline of fabula vs syuzhet in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'']]
'''Fabula''' ({{lang-rus|фабула|p=ˈfabʊlə}}) and '''syuzhet'''&lt;ref&gt;Also [[romanization of Russian|romanised]] as ''sjuzhet'', ''sujet'', ''sjužet'', ''siuzhet'' or ''suzet''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-rus|сюжет|p=sʲʊˈʐɛt|a=Ru-сюжет.ogg}}) are terms originating in [[Russian formalism]] and employed in [[narratology]] that describe [[narrative]] construction. Syuzhet is an employment of narrative and fabula is the chronological order of the events contained in the story. They were first used in this sense by [[Vladimir Propp]] and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The fabula is "the raw material of a story", and syuzhet is "the way a story is organized".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley, Paul. "Narratology." The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics]]'', narrative plots are supposed to have a beginning, middle and end. This is often achieved in film and novels via [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s or [[flashforward]]s. For example, the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' starts with the death of the main character, and then tells his life through flashbacks interspersed with a journalist's present-time investigation of Kane's life. The fabula of the film is the actual story of Kane's life the way it happened in chronological order, while the syuzhet is the way the story is told throughout the movie, including flashbacks.

==Critical reviews==

===Poststructuralism===
[[Jonathan Culler]] in ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'' (1981) notes a certain contradiction in assigning priority to either fabula or syuzhet (170-172). The operative assumption amongst many literary critics is that fabula precedes the syuzhet, which provides one of many ways of rendering what took place in the story. Culler argues that one can also understand fabula as a production of the syuzhet, whereby certain events are created and ordered at the level of story in order to produce a meaningful narrative. Critics, he argues, subscribe to a view in which fabula precedes syuzhet when debating the significance of a character's actions, but adopt the opposite view when they discuss the "appropriateness" of a narrative's ending (178). 

[[Jacques Derrida]] (1979) is also critical of the logocentric hierarchic ordering of syuzhet and fabula. He raises the question, "What if there are story ways of telling as well as narrative ways of telling? And if so, how is it that narrative in the American-European tradition has become privileged over story?" One answer is that narrative is both syuzhet (employment) and a subjection of fabula (the stuff of story, represented through narrative). For example, Derrida views narrative as having a terrible secret, in its way of oppressing story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question-of-narrative covers, with a certain modesty, a demand for narrative, a violent putting-to-the-question, an instrument of torture working to wring out the narrative as if it were a terrible secret, in ways that can go from the most archaic police methods to refinements for making (and even letting) one talk unsurpassed in neutrality and politeness, most respectfully medical, psychiatric, and even psychoanalytic. (Derrida, 1979: 94).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If story is more than fabula, dominated by narrative, it could have its own manner of discourse, rather than being subordinate to narrative. Derrida plays with just such an idea as follows in setting story in relation to its homonym:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each "story" (and each occurrence of the word "story", each "story" in the story) is part of the other, makes the other part (of itself), each "story" is at once larger and smaller than itself, includes itself without including (or comprehending) itself, identifies itself with itself even as it remains utterly different from its homonym. (Derrida, 1979: 99-100).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
[[Jerome Bruner]] also raises issues about fabula and syuzhet. He summarizes syuzhet as the plot of narrative, and fabula as a timeless underlying theme (Bruner, 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;7, 17-21). Bruner wants fabula to be a little more "loose fitting a constraint" on story: "I think we would do well with as loose fitting a constraint as we can manage concerning what a story must 'be' to be a story" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).

The problem for Bruner is to explore the underlying narrative structures (syuzhets) in not only Russian formalism, but also [[Structuralism|French Structuralism]] ([[Roland Barthes]], [[Tzvetan Todorov]] and others). The European formalists posit narrative grammars (i.e. Todorov's simple transformations of mode, intention, result, manner, aspect and status, as well as complex transformations of appearance, knowledge, supposition, description, subjectification and attitude). For Bruner, the story (fabula stuff) becomes the "virtual text" (p.&amp;nbsp;32) to the narrative grammars. "Nevertheless, Shotter suggests that Bruner failed to engage these 'particularities of otherness' in favour of abstractive explanation of meaning-making processes rather than in a description of dialogical performances" (Mos, 2003: 2). In other words, there is a need to consider how narrative pursues grammars and abstract meaning frames, whereas story can be dialogic and in the web of the social.

===Language studies===
[[Mikhail Bakhtin]] is also not convinced that fabula and syuzhet is a complete explanation of the relationship of narrative and story. Like Derrida, he is suspicious of the hegemony of narrative over story.

For Bakhtin (1973: 12) "narrative genres are always enclosed in a solid and unshakable monological framework." Story, for Bakhtin, is decidedly more dialogue-based, for example in the "polyphonic manner of the story" (Bakhtin, 1973: 60).

[[Benjamin Whorf]] (1956: 256), following up an observation by [[Franz Boas]], contended that the [[Hopi]] Indians do not experience themselves, or life as narrative grammar, or pattern. Rather than past-present-future, as segregated syuzhet, the Hopi experience is one of "eventing." Shotter (1993: 109) refers to Whorf's "eventing" and to the Hopi's differences with Euro-American space and time.

'''Guy Franke Cobb''' (born October 27, 1963) is an American artist born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States.

==Career==
In 1983 Cobb left the [[University of Mississippi]] to join his older brother, Ty Cobb, as a co-founder of an acrobatic basketball show called the [[Bud Light Daredevils]].  The group entertained audiences at NBA and college basketball games in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.&lt;ref name="storysouth.com"&gt;Gill, William [http://www.storysouth.com/summer2004/guycobbsarticle.html "Imitating Art: Guy Cobb, Shelby Farms, and the Distillation of Life and Place"] ''storySouth'', Summer 2004, Retrieved 2 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Guy Cobb Thorn Painting.jpg|thumb|left|175px|"Thorn Painting" by Cobb]]
By 1990 Cobb had relocated to rural [[Fair Grove, Missouri]]&lt;ref name="storysouth.com"/&gt;  where he was inspired by a documentary of [[Jackson Pollock]] and began working with sheet metal and locust tree thorns.  His first painting titled, ''Down in the Valley of Rural Violence'' was an examination of the 1987 James Schnick massacre at [[Elkland, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="storysouth.com"/&gt;

In 1993 Cobb moved to Memphis and began painting again.  His work was first exhibited in the lobby of the Memphis ''Commercial Appeal's'' newspaper office.&lt;ref name="artofgiving"&gt;Morton, Victoria Y., "The Art of Giving" (August 17, 2003), ''The Commercial Appeal'', Section D, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="giftforart"&gt;"A Gift for Art" (July 4, 2004), ''The Commercial Appeal'', Section CR5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cobb donated paintings to raise funds for  WKNO Public Television and the Memphis Orpheum Theater and other works to hospitals and mental institutions.&lt;ref name="artofgiving"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Memphis Artist Donating Original Paintings To Mississippi State Hospital" (July 23, 2003), ''The Independent Weekly'', page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cobb has donated more than 60 paintings to not-for-profit organizations and museums throughout the region.&lt;ref name="artofgiving"/&gt;  In 2003 Cobb was invited to Nashville to view his paintings on permanent display at the [[Tennessee State Capitol|Tennessee State Capitol building]] and the Tennessee State Museum.&lt;ref name="giftforart"/&gt;

[[File:Guy Cobb Braille Painting.jpg|thumb|left|Cobb's "Braille painting" at [[Christian Brothers University]] in 2006.]]
In 2004 Cobb began experimenting with "visual color blending" in his paintings&lt;ref name="storysouth.com"/&gt;  and he created a series of paintings for the sight impaired and the blind.&lt;ref name="storysouth.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abbeytrescott"&gt;Trescott, Abbey ''University of Missouri Museum of Art &amp; Archeology''&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb  incorporated thick textures onto the surface of his paintings by squeezing the paints onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artofgiving"/&gt;  By 2005 he had completed a series of "Braille paintings" designed to be touched and interpreted by the blind.  One of these paintings was used as a subject for the [[Museum of Art and Archaeology|University of Missouri's Museum of Art &amp; Archeology]]'s 2009 [[Art In Bloom]] event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maa.missouri.edu/photogalleries/aib09.html University of Missouri Museum of Art &amp; Archeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Art critics John Simmons and Camille Howell wrote: "Down in the Valley of Rural Violence is typical of what Cobb calls his 'thorn paintings'.....His use of tortured metal, abstract forms and an overlay of projecting thorns all combine in this and the other paintings in the series to produce statements of anger and frustration". "Guy Cobb is an artist worth watching. He could well become a real force on the regional art scene."&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, John, "Artist depicts violence with sheet metal, shotguns" (May 8, 1992), ''Springfield News Leader''&lt;/ref&gt; "Cobb's works are unsettling, disquieting, and impossible to ignore."&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Camille, "Nature drawings look dug from the ground" (February 21, 1992), ''Springfield News Leader''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heritage Conservation Act''' ({{lang-fr|Loi sur la conservation du patrimoine}}) is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] [[statute]] which allows for the preservation of [[cultural heritage]] properties and areas in the province of [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]].

==Designation of historic places and areas==
Depending on their nature and significance, historic places in New Brunswick may be eligible for recognition and/or protection under the Heritage Conservation Act under one of the following types of designations:

# Provincial Heritage Place (places which are provincially significant, as designated by the government of New Brunswick through the Minister of the [[Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture]]); 
# Municipal Heritage Conservation Area (districts within a municipality having unique heritage value as a conservation area, as designated by the municipality); and
# Local Historic Place (places that exhibit local historic significance, as designated by the municipality with the consent of the property owner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Designations in New Brunswick|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/thc/heritage/content/historic_places/designations.html|work=Heritage|publisher=Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once designated, the character-defining elements of a Provincial Heritage Place cannot be altered without a provincial heritage permit, nor can work or development occur in a Municipal Heritage Conservation Area without a permit issued by the municipality's heritage board.  The designation of a site as a Local Historic Place does not impose any restrictions or obligations on the owner of the property.&lt;ref name="HCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Conservation Act, SNB 2009, c H-4.05|url=http://laws.gnb.ca/en/ShowPdf/cs/H-4.05.pdf|publisher=Attorney General of New Brunswick|accessdate=18 February 2013|location=Sections 38, 63, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Conservation Act received [[Royal Assent]] on February 26, 2010.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;  It replaced and repealed the Historic Sites Protection Act of 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Sites Protection Act, RSNB 1973, c H-6 |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/laws/stat/rsnb-1973-c-h-6/latest/rsnb-1973-c-h-6.html |work=New Brunswick Statutes and Regulations |publisher=[[CanLII]] |accessdate=18 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113023454/http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/laws/stat/rsnb-1973-c-h-6/latest/rsnb-1973-c-h-6.html |archivedate=13 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Municipal Heritage Preservation Act of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Heritage Preservation Act, SNB 1978, c M-21.1 |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/laws/stat/snb-1978-c-m-21.1/latest/snb-1978-c-m-21.1.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414123003/http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/laws/stat/snb-1978-c-m-21.1/latest/snb-1978-c-m-21.1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 April 2013 |work=New Brunswick Statutes and Regulations |publisher=[[CanLII]] |accessdate=18 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   A site that had been designated as an historic or anthropological site under the former Historic Sites Protection Act is deemed to be a Provincial Heritage Place under the new statute, while a by-law establishing a Municipal Heritage Conservation Area under the former Municipal Heritage Preservation Act is deemed to continue to be in force under the new legislation.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;

==Archaeological protection==
Section 5 of the Heritage Conservation Act establishes that the [[Monarchy in New Brunswick|provincial Crown]] has [[ownership]] of all "[[archaeological]], [[palaeontological]] and burial site heritage objects in New Brunswick".  If the object is of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] origin it is to be 'held in trust' on behalf of the Aboriginal communities.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;

The Act provides guidelines and standards on how professional research is to be conducted, and how the management of objects is to be done. There are also guidelines regarding how amateur researchers can participate and gain approval for specific type of heritage exploration.  Included in the Act is a clause that enforces the mandatory reporting of all possible discoveries of heritage objects to the provincial authority. It outlines regulations of heritage impact assessment, and "prohibits the alteration of any heritage place in the Province without specific government approval".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeological Field Research|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/thc/heritage/content/heritage_conservationact/archaeological.html|work=Heritage|publisher=Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial grounds==
In New Brunswick, burial grounds are mainly covered under the Cemetery Companies Act.  However, the Heritage Conservation Act protects places that have been used in the past for the placement of human remains or related objects, including old family plots, ancient burial grounds and abandoned cemeteries.  A "burial ground" is defined in the heritage legislation as any place containing [[Cadaver|human remains]] and/or their associated objects. The discovery of such a site must be reported to the Heritage Branch of the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture as soon as possible specifying the location, and date and time it is discovered. Upon this reporting it will be reviewed by the Minister who will then make a decision as to whether or not to implement procedures to the protect the site.  It is illegal for anyone to alter or disturb a burial ground or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Burial Grounds|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/thc/heritage/content/heritage_conservationact/protection.html|work=Heritage|publisher=Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mauro Biglino''' (born September 13, 1950, [[Torino]]) is an Italian [[author]], [[essayist]] and [[translator]].

Biglino has translated the [[Masoretic text]] for the publisher [[Edizioni San Paolo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/profeti-minori-sefer-tere-asar-libro-dei-dodici-profeti/oclc/526076746&amp;referer=brief_results Traduzione interlineare reperibile presso [[WorldCat]]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by the Italian national television and several radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNT9wmE3CZw&lt;/ref&gt;

==The assumptions arising from his translations==
According to Biglino, knowledge and understanding of religious thought is nowadays more accessible thanks to the direct analysis of the Bible in its original languages. Biglino translates the [[Old Testament]] verbatim from the original languages, Hebrew and Aramaic  (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia), deliberately ignoring interpretations based on doctrines elaborated with the rise of Christianity. In particular, he emphasizes the technological knowledge of the ''elohim'', beings unwarrantedly rendered as a singular "God" in Greek theological translations of the book, who, according to the author, would have created humanity and the Adamite race in their own image and likeness. Furthermore, he argues that in the Bible there are references to highly technological devices owned by the ''elohim''. He exposes what he considers to be unfaithful and unwarranted translations of the Bible to make it compatible with Christianity, and the latter's monotheism and creationism which, in his view, do not find support in the book. In his book ''La Bibbia non è un libro sacro'', the author seeks to show that concepts of divinity and spirituality are not present in the Old Testament, highlighting how the text was changed over centuries.

==Other theorists before Biglino==
Although the work of Biglino is original, several other authors have theorized an alien presence in the sacred texts. Among these [[Erich von Däniken]], [[Zecharia Sitchin]], [[Walter Raymond Drake]], [[Mario Pincherle]], [[Peter Kolosimo]], Father Barry Downing, Father Enrique Lopez Guerrero, Corrado Malanga, and Biagio Russo. Erich von Däniken is one of the main supporters of the [[ancient astronaut hypothesis]], he translated mainly from the Greek and Latin but not from the Hebrew, while Zecharia Sitchin translated from Sumerian sources.

'''Medical jurisprudence''' or '''legal medicine''' is the branch of [[science]] and [[medicine]] involving the study and application of scientific and medical knowledge to legal problems, such as [[inquest]]s, and in the field of [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodric Romeyn Beck and William Dunloop. (1825.) ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'', 2 ed., Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[modern medicine]] is a legal creation, regulated by the state, and medicolegal cases involving [[death]], [[rape]], [[Parent|paternity]], etc. require a medical practitioner to produce evidence and appear as an [[expert witness]], these two fields have traditionally been interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Mohr. (1993.) ''Doctors and the Law: Medical Jurisprudence in Nineteenth-Century America'', Oxford University Press, New York City.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic medicine, which includes [[forensic pathology]], is a narrower field that involves collection and analysis of medical evidence (samples) to produce objective information for use in the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Swaine Taylor and Frederick John Smith (ed.). (1920.) ''Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence'', 7 ed., Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Paul Zacchias]] is one of the earliest figures of medical jurisprudence, with association with the [[Papal States]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title='On the Beliefs of the Greeks': Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy|last=Hartnup|first=Karen|date=2004-01-01|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004131809|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacchias was the personal physician to [[Pope Innocentius X]] and [[Pope Alexander VII]], as well as legal adviser to the [[Rota Romana]].&lt;ref name="medico"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7RXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA532&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=The Medico-legal journal, Volume 2|publisher=Medico-Legal Journal Association|year=1885|author=Medico-Legal Society of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most well known book, ''Quaestiones medico-legales'' (1621-1651) established [[legal medicine]] as a topic of study.&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFTlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1572&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=JAMA.: The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 38|last=|first=|publisher=American Medical Association, HighWire Press|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacchias work contains [[Superstition|superstitious]] views on [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], and [[demon]]s which were widely held at the time.&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=Northwestern lancet, Volume 18|year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical jurisprudence had a chair founded at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1807, first occupied by [[Andrew Duncan, the younger]]. It was imposed on the university by the administration of [[Charles James Fox]], and in particular [[Henry Erskine (lawyer)|Henry Erskine]] working with [[Andrew Duncan, the elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=8213|title=Duncan, Andrew (1773–1832)|first=Brenda M.|last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Medical jurisprudence is concerned with a broad range of medical, legal, and ethical issues, as well as [[human right]]s and [[Individual and group rights|rights of individuals]].

Physicians have a duty to act in their patients best interest and can be charged in a court of law if they fail to do so. On the other hand, a physician may be required to act in the interest of third parties if his patient is a danger to others. Failure to do so may lead to legal action against the physician.

Medical jurisprudence includes:
*questions of the legal and [[medical ethics|ethical duties]] of physicians;
*questions affecting the civil

Under the second heading, there are many aspects, including:
*questions of [[competence (law)|competence]] or [[sanity]] in civil or criminal proceedings;
*questions of competence of [[Minor (law)|minors]] in matters affecting their own health; and,
*questions of lawful fitness or safety to drive a motor vehicle, pilot an aeroplane, use [[scuba gear]], play certain sports, or to join certain occupations.

Under the third heading, there are also many aspects, including:
*assessment of illness or injuries that may be work-related (see [[workers' compensation]] or [[occupational safety and health]]) or otherwise compensable;
*assessment of injuries of minors that may relate to [[Neglect (English law)|neglect]] or [[Child abuse|abuse]]; and,
*[[death certificate|certification of death]] or else the [[Coroner|assessment of possible causes of death]]. This, however, is the more commonly understood, albeit narrow, meaning of forensic medicine.

'''Michael R. Taylor''' is an American lawyer. From 2010 to 2016, he was the Deputy Commissioner for Foods at the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

==Early career==
Taylor received a B.A. degree in political science from [[Davidson College]] and a law degree from the [[University of Virginia]]. In 1976, after passing the [[bar examination]], he became a staff attorney for the [[Food and Drug Administration]], where he was executive assistant to the FDA Commissioner.&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007&gt;Marion Nestle [http://www.foodpolitics.com/2009/07/michael-taylor-appointed-to-fda-a-good-choice/ Michael Taylor appointed to FDA: A good choice!] Food Politics (Blog) 7 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WilsonCenterBio&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/sept_20_bios.pdf Woodrow Wilson Center bio] Woodrow Wilson Center, 19 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 - 1991 Taylor worked in private law practice at [[King &amp; Spalding]], one client of which was the [[biotechnology]] company [[Monsanto]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Monique Robin: The World According to Monsanto&lt;/ref&gt; He established and led the firm's food and drug law practice.&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WilsonCenterBio /&gt;

In 1988 he published an article entitled "The De Minimis Interpretation of the Delaney Clause: Legal and Policy Rationale" in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology (now called the International Journal of Toxicology), which he had previously presented in December 1986 at a symposium on Topics in Risk Analysis, sponsored by International Life Sciences Institute Risk Science Institute, Society for Risk Analysis, and [[Brookings Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor MR. [http://ijt.sagepub.com/content/7/4/529.full.pdf+html The De Minimis Interpretation of the Delaney Clause: Legal and Policy Rationale.] International Journal of Toxicology July/August 1988, 7: 529-537. (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper was delivered and published during the midst of a debate and litigation over federal agencies' interpretation of the [[Delaney clause]], a part of a 1958 federal law that prohibits any carcinogenic chemical from being added, in any amount, to food that is processed. As analytical instrumentation increased in power and more agents were found to be carcinogenic at very low levels, the agencies had developed a quantitative [[risk assessment]] approach to interpreting the Delaney Clause, which stated that if a carcinogen was present at levels less than 1 in 1,000,000 parts (1ppm), the risk of that carcinogen was "de minimis", and it could be allowed on the market.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;Merrill, Richard A. [http://aseh.net/teaching-research/teaching-unit-better-living-through-chemistry/historical-sources/lesson-2/Merrill-Food%20Safety%20Regulation-1997.pdf "Food Safety Regulation: Reforming the Delaney Clause"] in ''Annual Review of Public Health'', 1997, 18:313-40. (27pp) --includes a historical review of prior food safety regulation.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, Taylor presented arguments in favor of this approach.  Advocates in favor of organic food have criticized Taylor for taking this stance and have attributed the stance not to a good faith effort to reasonably regulate, but to an alleged desire to benefit [[Monsanto]] financially.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Luoma .

==US Food and Drug Administration, 1991-1994==
On July 17, 1991, Michael Taylor left King &amp; Spalding for the FDA, accepting the newly created post of 'Deputy Commissioner for Policy'. 
In 1992, he signed a guidance that milk from cows treated with BGH did not have to be labeled as such.&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/FoodLabelingNutrition/ucm059036.htm Federal Register Labeling Notice]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921132625/http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/FoodLabelingNutrition/ucm059036.htm |date=September 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
His name is not on the FDA's May 1992 guidance on genetically modified (GM) plant foods,&lt;ref name=1992Guidance&gt;FDA. [http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/biotechnology/ucm096095.htm FDA Guidance to Industry for Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties] Federal Register. Volume 57 - 1992. Friday, May 29, 1992. Note. Taylor's name does not appear in this document, Maryansky's does.&lt;/ref&gt; but he is said to have been a co-author.&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007 /&gt; Both documents are part of a regulatory framework developed since the mid-1980s under the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] Administrations to ensure the public's safety and development of the fledgling biotechnology industry without overly burdensome regulation.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Emily Marden, [http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2236&amp;context=bclr Risk and Regulation: U.S. Regulatory Policy on Genetically Modified Food and Agriculture], Boston College Law Review 733 Volume 4, Issue 3 Number 3 (5-1-2003) 56 pages&lt;/ref&gt; The guidance had three tenets: "(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of GM techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products."&lt;ref name=Marsden /&gt; 
These tenets were first described in the 'Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology', published by the President's Domestic Policy Council Working Group on Biotechnology through the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.usgs.gov/usbiotechreg/ Coordinated Framework]  United States Regulatory Agencies Unified Biotechnology Website decommissioned per 27 March 2013 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819200427/http://www1.usgs.gov/usbiotechreg/ |date=August 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1992 guidance, for example, treats "transferred genetic material and the intended expression product or products" in food derived from GM crops as [[food additives]] subject to existing food additive regulation, under which that material may be considered either [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS) or not GRAS, initially at the producer's determination.&lt;ref name=1992Guidance /&gt;  If the food additive is not GRAS, the producer is required to submit data proving that the food additive does not "adulterate" the food - in other words, that the additive is not injurious to health.&lt;ref name=1992Guidance /&gt;  With respect to GM food, the FDA retained its ability to take enforcement action any food it found to be "adulterated", which would make its producer "subject to the full range of enforcement measures under the act, including seizure, injunction, and criminal prosecution of those who fail to meet their statutory duty."&lt;ref name=1992Guidance /&gt;

==United States Department of Agriculture, 1994-1996==
Between 1994 and 1996 Taylor moved to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), where he was Administrator of the Food Safety &amp; Inspection Service. During that term he implemented a science-based approach called [[Hazard analysis and critical control points]] (HACCP) to raising safety standards for meat and poultry production&lt;ref&gt;Pathogen Reduction; Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-02-03/pdf/95-2366.pdf Federal Register Meat Production]&lt;/ref&gt; over the protests from industry, which food safety advocates have called "a truly heroic accomplishment".&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes2010&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/health/policy/14fda.html?_r=1 NY Times profile 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 1994 anti-biotechnology activist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] charged that Taylor had a [[conflict of interest]] with respect to the approval of rBST.&lt;ref name=WashPost1994&gt;[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/documentStore/e/n/t/ent92e00/Sent92e00.pdf Washington Post article 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA replied that Taylor had recused himself from all but the final stages of the review.&lt;ref name=WashPost1994 /&gt; The Washington Post reported that:  "On March 15, FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler sent Rifkin a four-page letter stating that 'none of the activities of Mr. Taylor cited in your petition were in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or were otherwise inappropriate.... I believe that Mr. Taylor's behavior adhered to all applicable ethical standards.'  Kessler said that Taylor had not been 'intimately' involved in Monsanto's efforts to obtain approval, as Rifkin charged, and that he was involved in the FDA's bST policy only in the final stages of review. Kessler attached a nine-page memo by FDA ethics official Jack M. Kress supporting that position. Upon arriving at the FDA in the summer of 1991, Taylor recused himself for one year from taking part in any agency action dealing directly with Monsanto or any other King and Spalding clients."&lt;ref name=WashPost1994 /&gt; It also reported that "Some longtime agency critics found the charges against Taylor misplaced, like Sidney Wolfe, a physician who heads the Public Citizen Health Research Group and has filed complaints with the FDA about revolving-door ethics issues concerning other officials."&lt;ref name=WashPost1994 /&gt;

==Monsanto, 1996 - 2000==
Between 1996 and 2000, after briefly returning to King &amp; Spalding, Taylor worked for Monsanto as a Vice President for Public Policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlerblog.com/2010/01/articles/case-news/michael-r-taylor-named-deputy-commissioner-for-foods-at-fda Michael R. Taylor, Named Deputy Commissioner for Foods at FDA] marlerblog.com, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a lawsuit (Alliance For Bio-Integrity v. Shalala&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/EnforcementStory/EnforcementStoryArchive/ucm109493.htm FDA report of decision]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biointegrity.org/report-on-lawsuit.htm Alliance report on lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;) and GAO report revealed considerable disagreement within the FDA concerning decisions about biotechnology products made during Taylor's tenure. The lawsuit and report also said that Taylor had recused himself from matters related to Monsanto's BGH and had "never sought to influence the thrust or content" of the agency's policies on Monsanto's products.&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marion Nestle.  Safe Food: Bacteria, Biotechnology, and Bioterrorism (California Studies in Food and Culture) {{ISBN|0520242238}}, p=205&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for Risk Management, 2000 - 2009 ==
In June 2000, he joined the [[think tank]] [[Resources for the Future]] (RFF) in the position of Senior Fellow and Director of RFF's Center for Risk Management,&lt;ref name=ResolveBio&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=12314350&amp;privcapId=12190103&amp;previousCapId=24504&amp;previousTitle=AIRGAS%20INC Bio as Director of Resolve]&lt;/ref&gt; where he published two documents on U.S. aid for African agriculture, both of which were funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. During this time he was also a Director at 'Resolve', a nonprofit environmental and public health mediation and [[dispute resolution organization]], and was an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center.&lt;ref name=ResolveBio /&gt;

During this time, Taylor made strong arguments for a more rigorous and unified approach to food safety, in which he argued for:

* "A single agency accountable for providing consistent and coordinated oversight of food safety, from farm to table.
* Institution of Pathogen Reduction: HACCP, with performance standards verified by pathogen testing, at every step of food production.
* Recall authority, access to records, and penalties for lapses in safety procedures.
* Standards for imported foods equivalent to those for domestic foods.
* Food safety to take precedence over commercial considerations in trade disputes."&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Taylor and Stephanie D. David. [http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/21310.pdf Stronger Partnerships for Safer Food: An Agenda for Strengthening State and Local Roles in the Nation’s Food Safety System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor has been a professor at the [[University of Maryland]]'s School of Medicine. In 2007, he became a Research Professor of Health Policy at the [[George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services]].&lt;ref name=MarionNestle2007 /&gt;

[[File:Soft moccasin.jpg|thumb|A soft-soled moccasin]]
A '''moccasin''' is a [[shoe]], made of [[deer]]skin or other soft leather, consisting of a sole (made with leather that has not been "worked") and sides made of one piece of leather, stitched together at the top, and sometimes with a vamp (additional panel of leather). The sole is soft and flexible and the upper part often is adorned with embroidery or beading.  Though sometimes worn inside, it is chiefly intended for outdoor use.  Historically, it is the footwear of many indigenous people of [[North American Indians|North America]]; moreover, hunters, traders, and European settlers wore them. Etymologically, the ''moccasin'' derives from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] [[Powhatan language|Powhatan]] word ''makasin'' (cognate to [[Massachusett language|Massachusett]] ''mohkisson'' / ''mokussin'', [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwa]] ''makizin'', [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]] ''mksɨn''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/moccasin moccasin: definition, usage and pronunciation - YourDictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=moccasin Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[Proto-Algonquian]] word *''maxkeseni'' (shoe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moccasin|title=Moccasin - Define Moccasin at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the 1800s, moccasins usually were part of a Canadian regalia, e.g. a [[powwow]] suit of clothes. The most common style is that of the [[Plains Indians]] moccasin.

Moccasins protect the foot while allowing the wearer to feel the ground. The [[Plains Indians]] wore hard-sole moccasins, given that their territorial geography featured rock and cacti. The eastern Indian tribes wore soft-sole moccasins, for walking in leaf-covered forest ground. Moccasins are usually all brown, the same color.

== Contemporary use ==
In [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], [[sheep shearer]]s' moccasins are constructed of a synthetic, cream-colored [[felt]], with a back seam and gathered at the top of the rounded toe. These moccasins are laced in the front, and the lacing is covered with a flap fastened with a [[buckle]] at the shoe's outer side. The fastener arrangement prevents the shearer's handpiece comb from catching in the laces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=158222&amp;search=Working+life&amp;images=&amp;c=&amp;s=1|title=97/311/1 Shearing moccasins (pair), mens, synthetic felt, Australia, 1997 - Powerhouse Museum Collection|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearers' moccasins protect the feet, grip wooden floors well, and absorb sweat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/sheep/10042.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202084159/http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/sheep/10042.html |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''moccasin'' can also denote a shoe of deer [[leather]] adorned with laces.

===Driving moccasins===
A ''driving moccasin'' (driving moc) is a contemporary version of the traditional Native American moccasin with the addition of rubber tabs on the sole.  The addition of rubber-pad sole adds to the versatility and longevity of the shoe while maintaining the flexibility and comfort of a traditional moccasin. They were invented for men who wanted extra grip while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-rules-of-wearing-driving-shoes-summer-footwear|title=The Rules of Wearing Driving Shoes|last=Gustashaw|first=Megan|date=2016-06-05|work=GQ|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two variations of the sole including:
*''Rubber-dotted'' - These have a uniform covering of small, round rubber pads.
* ''Separated Pad'' - These have larger, flat rubber pads separated by only small areas.

=== Work boot moccasins ===
Moc Toe Boots, commonly referred as a "Moc Toe", the boots are normally combined with hard rubber compounded soles. The moccasin toe [[Work boots|work boot]] is a style that reflects the Native American moccasin. Normally by weld stitching two pieces of leather or fabric, the pattern creates a U-shaped design around the toe box.

In [[Ancient Greek]] [[Ancient Greek grammar|grammar]], a '''perispomenon''' ({{lang|grc|περισπώμενον}}) is a word with a high-low [[Ancient Greek accent|pitch]] contour on the last syllable, indicated in writing by a [[circumflex]] [[accent mark]]. A '''properispomenon''' has the same kind of accent, but on the penultimate syllable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek Grammar''. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1f_uni.htm#157 paragraph 157].&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
*{{lang|grc|θεοῦ}}, ''theoû'', "of a god",  is a perispomenon
*{{lang|grc|πρᾶξις}} ''prâxis'' "business" is a properispomenon

==Etymology==
''Peri-spō&amp;#769;menon'' means "pronounced with a circumflex",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|perispwme/nws|περισπωμένως|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[grammatical gender|neuter]] of the [[present tense|present]] [[passive voice|passive]] [[participle]] of ''peri-spáō'' "pronounce with a circumflex" (also "draw off").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|perispa/w|περισπάω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pro-peri-spō&amp;#769;menon'' adds the prefix ''pró'' "before".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pro/|πρό|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|el|περισπωμένη}} is the Greek name for the accent mark ({{angle brackets|῀}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4026">'''Peter Charanis''' (1908 &amp;ndash; 23 March 1985), born '''Panagiotis Charanis''' ({{lang-el|Παναγιώτης Χαρανής}}), was a [[Greece]]-born American scholar of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and the Voorhees Professor of History at [[Rutgers University]]. Dr. Charanis was long associated with the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] research library.

== Biography ==
Dr. Charanis was born in [[Lemnos]], [[Greece]].  He immigrated to the United States as a pre-teen leaving his family in Lemnos and settling in [[New Jersey]] in 1920. He received his bachelor's degree from Rutgers and his doctorate from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where he studied under [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]]. He continued his studies as a postgraduate in the [[University of Brussels]] under the eminent Byzantinist, [[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]]. From 1936 to 1938, he participated in Grégoire's seminar where he met his future wife Madeleine Schiltz and befriended the likes of [[Nicholas Adontz]] and [[Paul Wittek]]. According to Charanis himself, during his stay in Brussels, he acquired a profound interest in the [[Armenian people|Armenians]]. That interest bore abundant fruit in various studies, notably ''The Armenians in the Byzantine Empire'' (Byzantinoslavica, 1961) and ''A Note on the Ethnic Origin of Emperor Maurice'' (Byzantion, 1965).

Charanis also spent some time at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in Greece, and upon his return to the United States joined the Rutgers faculty in 1938, becoming Voorhees Professor of History in 1963. At that time, [[Byzantine Studies]] was still at its infancy in the United States. Charanis persuaded the history department to begin a course in Byzantine Studies, which eventually became one of the most popular courses at Rutgers. From 1964 to 1966, he served as chairman of the university's history department.  He retired in 1976.

'''''Portrait of Ms Ruby May, Standing''''' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting made in 2012 by the British visual artist Leena McCall, portraying her friend Ruby May.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 7 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Luke|title=Painting Pulled From Exhibition Because of "Disgusting" Pubic Hair|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/art-culture/painting-pulled-gallery-disgusting-pubic-hair/|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=[[Vocativ]]|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting depicts May, a tattooed black-haired woman, smoking a pipe. May is coolly scrutinizing the viewer, her other hand on her hip, with her trousers unbuttoned such that her [[pubic hair]] is visible. McCall's intention in painting May was to explore "how women choose to express their sexual identity beyond the [[male gaze]]".&lt;ref name="Independent 8 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=‘Pornographic and disgusting’ painting removed from top London exhibition – because it features a woman’s pubic hair|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/pornographic-and-disgusting-painting-removed-from-top-london-exhibition--because-it-features-a-womans-pubic-hair-9592705.html|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The painting received public attention after the [[Mall Galleries]] removed it from the [[Society of Women Artists]]'s annual exhibition in 2014, after which it was replaced with another nude portrait. According to a statement by the Galleries, this was done because of "a number of complaints regarding the depiction of the subject and taking account of its location en route for children to our learning centre", and, according to McCall, because the painting had been deemed "disgusting" and "pornographic". Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Rowan Pelling]] interpreted this reaction as implying that "the minute a woman is alive and free to move, an active agent of her own sexuality, she is a menace to society", whereas Mall Galleries viewers appeared to feel more comfortable with a nude woman who is a "more passive and unthreatening recipient of the wandering viewer's gaze".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 7 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelling|first1=Rowan|title=How is this painting 'pornographic' and 'disgusting'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/07/painting-pornographic-pubic-hair-outrage|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the removal of the work, McCall started a [[Twitter]] campaign with the [[hashtag]] #eroticcensorship.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 7 July 2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6185">{{About|a philosophical thought-experiment|the comic book character with similar backstory|Swamp Thing}}
{{Refimprove | date = August 2011}}
'''Swampman''' is the subject of a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[thought experiment]] introduced by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his 1987 paper "Knowing One's Own Mind".

==Overview==
The experiment runs as follows:

{{Quote|Suppose Davidson goes hiking in the swamp and is struck and killed by a lightning bolt.  At the same time, nearby in the swamp another lightning bolt spontaneously rearranges a bunch of molecules such that, entirely by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form that Davidson's body had at the moment of his untimely death.

This being, whom Davidson terms "Swampman," has, of course, a brain which is structurally identical to that which Davidson had, and will thus, presumably, behave exactly as Davidson would have. He will walk out of the swamp, return to Davidson's office at Berkeley, and write the same essays he would have written; he will interact like an amicable person with all of Davidson's friends and family, and so forth.}}

Davidson holds that there would nevertheless be a difference, though no one would notice it. Swampman will appear to recognize Davidson's friends, but it is impossible for him to actually recognize them, as he has never seen them before. As Davidson puts it, "It can't recognize anything, because it never cognized anything in the first place."

These considerations lead Davidson to deny that the Swampman's utterances can be construed as referring to anything in particular. To take a fairly specific example, suppose that at some point the previous day Davidson had looked at a glass marble on a shelf; unbeknownst to him there was another, visually identical, glass marble hidden right behind it.  When he makes an assertion about "the marble I saw yesterday", we take him to be referring to the one that he did in fact see, even if he could not supply enough descriptive information to identify it later. Had the marbles been arranged in the other order, therefore, we would take him to be referring to the other marble, yet his internal state would be identical.

The Swampman has no causal history. He is in the same state as the actual Davidson and the [[counterfactual]] Davidson considered above, whose utterances refer to different marbles. As a result, ''his'' utterance could refer to either marble. In principle, Davidson tells us, the above indeterminacies can be extended to any degree we like: the fact that the Swampman happens to be identical to Davidson does not change the fact that he could have arrived at that state by any one of countless histories, each of which would demand we interpret him differently. Until the Swampman has begun interacting with and using language among the objects of the real world, we can have no grounds to attributing any meanings or thoughts to him at all.

Amongst those who accept the force of this argument, there are two distinct ways of viewing its consequences. On the one hand, many philosophers have taken it to affect merely how we should evaluate Swampman. The argument is believed to demonstrate that Swampman's utterances and thoughts do not mean anything, and do not refer to anything in particular. On this view, Swampman's [[subjectivity]] and [[consciousness]] are considered to be unchanged. Others have argued that this lack of a causal history renders incoherent the notion that Swampman could have a [[mind]] at all, which in turn raises the question of whether he is, in fact, a [[person]] (note that Davidson calls Swampman "it" rather than "he").

This argument depends upon the acceptance of [[semantic externalism]], the claim that the meaning of one's words is determined not merely by some internal state, but also by the causal history of the speaker.

==Criticism==

===Explicit criticism===
Davidson holds that there would "nevertheless be a difference", though no one would notice it. However he did not provide further elaboration and justification for the assertion. Objectors hold that there would be no difference.

One point of objection is that Davidson and the Swampman become individuals in their own rights immediately when they make choices of their own. Regardless of their physical make-up, neither can be defined in any way as individuals until their choices are considered. Thus, the two are only identical people insofar as they make their own choices, which is something that the thought experiment does not consider.

===Implicit criticism===
[[Daniel Dennett]], in ''Consciousness Explained'', has called into question the validity of this sort of thought experiment altogether, maintaining that when a thought experiment is too far removed from the actual [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]], our intuitions cease to be meaningful.

==Implications==
This concept has been said to have implications for [[mind uploading]] or mind transference, as it indirectly addresses the question of whether an exact replica of one's brain patterns, created within an alternative brain, an android brain, or a virtual universe, is the same being as the person it was copied from, or another being entirely. The same question is to be considered if a technology to [[teleportation|teleport]] people arises.

The '''Teen Dance Ordinance''' was a controversial [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] law which severely curtailed the ability of concert and club promoters to hold events for underaged patrons. During its existence from 1985 to 2002, it was routinely criticized for its severity (often labeled "[[wikt:draconian|draconian]]") and its effects on the local music scene and industry. After several unsuccessful attempts to repeal it through lobbying and later court action, it was finally repealed and replaced with the All-ages Dance Ordinance.

==History==
From 1977 to 1985, teen dances were unregulated in Seattle. Activities at underage clubs were attracting the attention of the public and a club called The Monastery was particularly notorious for allegations of [[sexual abuse]], [[child prostitution]], and drug and alcohol use. The Monastery was run by George Freeman and was ostensibly a non-profit church of the [[Universal Life Church]], whose dance events were "religious services". During daytime hours it was a youth center that attracted runaways and homeless youth. The Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO) was conceived and passed the [[Seattle City Council|City Council]] on July 29, 1985 to stop abuses at underage clubs. It was amended in 1988. Key among its provisions were:

* Age limits: Underage dances (allowing those under 18 to attend) may only admit patrons age 15-20 unsupervised. Anyone younger would require a parent or guardian [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]] and anyone older would need to be accompanying a youth under 18.
* Security requirement: Two off-duty police officers were required on premises, with one off-duty officer outside to patrol the area.
* [[Insurance]]: $1,000,000 in liability insurance was required;
* Exemptions: Non-profits and schools were exempt from these restrictions.&lt;ref name=Licata&gt;Licata, Nick. [http://www.ci.Seattle.wa.us/council/licata/up92.htm Urban Politics #92.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101021222/http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/council/licata/up92.htm |date=2006-01-01 }} Seattle City Council, Office of Councilman Nick Licata. September 9, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

With these requirements, teen dances outside of schools were virtually banned in the city, as no [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] would undertake the costs involved. For a city the size of Seattle, shows that would only allow 15- to 20-year-olds could not draw a large enough crowd for the event to break even. In addition to the $1 million insurance bond, hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. The non-profit exemption meant the ordinance did not apply to the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] abatement laws. In the 15 years of the ordinance, almost no one applied for a promoter's license for youth events, and no one has been prosecuted with it.&lt;ref name=Licata /&gt;

While the ordinance only regulated "dances," the distinction between a concert and a dance was not outlined by law, and the police were accused of defining a dance so liberally that the dancing done in the audience of a concert was enough to qualify the entire event as a "dance." All-ages concerts were thus subject to being shut down by police who were vigilant in making sure promoters did not skirt the law. As a result, some nationally touring acts refused to do shows in Seattle because they insisted on all-ages audiences. With Seattle becoming an epicenter for [[alternative rock]] and the [[grunge]] scene in the early 90's, teens had to go to neighboring cities to attend concerts and dances.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Jennifer.

Proponents of the TDO said that the ordinance ensured the safety of underage patrons and discouraged gatherings where youth consumed drugs and alcohol. They also invoked the memory of the Monastery, where they said adults preyed upon vulnerable kids susceptible to offers of drugs or quick cash. Excluding adults from underage youth would, in their eyes, create a "bubble of safety."&lt;ref&gt;Paynter, Susan. [http://www.seattlepi.com/paynter/payn078.shtml Repeal teen dance law? Let's sit this one out]. ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer.'' August 7, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal of the ordinance was a key goal of [[JAMPAC]], a musicians' and promoters' [[political action committee]] founded by [[Krist Novoselic]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Since its founding in 1995, the group lobbied the City Council to repeal the TDO.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Deborah.

The ordinance was a focal point for a vocal young activist community in Seattle, notably those consolidated as The All Ages Music Organization, and later by the Music and Youth Task Force, which allowed for youth and public officials to meet regularly to find resolution to conflicting points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Howland Jr., George. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0220/nc-howland.php A time to dance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427134646/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0220/nc-howland.php |date=2006-04-27 }}. ''The Seattle Weekly.''  May 15, 2002. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ordinance proposed to replace the TDO was passed by the City Council in 2000, however it was quickly vetoed by Mayor [[Paul Schell]]. The veto caused JAMPAC to launch a suit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the TDO's virtual outlawing of dance infringed on the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free expression. A judge however ruled for the City on JAMPAC's suit in May 2002, claiming there was no infringement on the First Amendment and that the matter is a political one for the Council to decide, not the courts. Nevertheless, during the course of the suit, Schell was voted out of office (in the aftermath of the disastrous [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO meetings of 1999]]) and the new mayor [[Greg Nickels]], a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Council. The new All-ages Dance Ordinance, written by members of the Music and Youth Task Force, was passed on August 12, 2002, replacing the TDO.

==All-Ages Dance Ordinance==

The new provisions of the All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) eased on restrictions to accommodate new youth events. They include:
* a definition of a ''dance'' as an event where dancing is the primary activity intended
* allowing all-ages events to occur absent any alcohol served
* requiring only the requesting of off-duty officers at an event, to be granted by the Seattle Police Guild
* elimination of the $1 million insurance requirement&lt;ref name=Howland&gt;Howland Jr., George. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0233/news-howland3.php Slow Dance.] ''The Seattle Weekly.''  August 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rules, while more liberal than before, still disappointed many activists who pushed for the TDO's repeal. They viewed the new ordinance as only moderate changes to the rules and not liberal enough to actually encourage all ages shows.&lt;ref name=Howland /&gt; Proponents of the TDO also criticize the new AADO, saying the new all-ages events are now ignored by the police, and that the new law is confusing and ignored by unlicensed promoters. [[Rave]]s have also been points of criticism; they have now been classified as ''concerts'' and are outside the scope of the ordinance while frequent use of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] by attendees have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Sharon Pian.

Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, in the aftermath of the [[Capitol Hill massacre]] where a gunman shot several partygoers after a rave, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' editorialized against the new dance rules and called for the city's all-ages dance rules to be "thoroughly re-examined and re-tooled."&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/2002892098_shooted27.html Soul-searching after Capitol Hill tragedy], ''Seattle Times'' editorial, March 26, 2006.

'''''The Lorax''''' is a [[children's literature|children's book]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and first published in 1971.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012/&gt; It chronicles the plight of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the Lorax, who speaks for the trees against the Once-ler. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book.

The book is commonly recognized as a [[fable]] concerning the danger corporate greed poses to nature, using the literary element of [[anthropomorphism|personification]] to give life to industry as the Once-ler and the environment as the Lorax.

''The Lorax'' was Dr. Seuss's personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing economic and [[environmental issue|environmental]] issues without it being dull. "''The Lorax''," he once explained, "came out of me being angry. In ''The Lorax'' I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Lebduska. "Rethinking Human Need: Seuss's ''The Lorax''." Children's Literature Association Quarterly 19.4 (1994): 170-176. Project MUSE. Web. October 20, 2014. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A boy living in a polluted area visits a strange isolated man called the Once-ler on the Street of the Lifted Lorax. The boy pays the Once-ler fifteen cents, a nail, and the shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail to hear the legend of how the Lorax was lifted and taken away.

The Once-ler tells the boy of his arrival in a beautiful valley containing a forest of Truffula trees and a range of animals. The Once-ler, having long searched for such a tree as the Truffula, chops one down and uses its silk-like foliage to knit a Thneed, an impossibly versatile garment. The Lorax, who "speaks for the trees" as they have no tongues, emerges from the stump of the Truffula and voices his disapproval both of the sacrifice of the tree and of the Thneed itself. However, the first other person to happen by purchases the Thneed for $3.98, so the Once-ler is encouraged and starts a business making and selling Thneeds.

The Once-ler's small shop soon grows into a factory. The Once-ler's relatives all come to work for him and new vehicles and equipment are brought in to log the Truffula forest and ship out Thneeds. The Lorax appears again to report that the small bear-like Bar-ba-loots, who eat Truffula fruits, are short of food and must be sent away to find more. The Lorax later returns to complain that the factory has polluted the air and the water, forcing the Swanee-Swans and Humming-Fish to migrate as well. The Once-ler is unrepentant and defiantly tells the Lorax that he will keep on "biggering" his business, but at that moment one of his machines fells the very last Truffula tree.

Without raw materials, the factory shuts down and the Once-ler's relatives leave. The Lorax says nothing but with one sad backward glance lifts himself into the air "by the seat of his pants" and disappears behind the smoggy clouds. Where he last stood is a small monument engraved with a single word: "UNLESS".  The Once-ler ponders the message for years, in solitude and self-imposed exile.

In the present, his buildings falling apart around him, the Once-ler at last realizes out loud what the Lorax meant: "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not." He then gives the boy the last Truffula seed and urges him to grow a forest from it, saying that, if the trees can be protected from logging, then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.

==Reception==
Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named ''The Lorax'' one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 33 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'' – the second of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= ''A Fuse No. 8 Production''.

In a retrospective critique written in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2011 upon the 40th anniversary of the book's publication, [[Emma Marris]] described the Lorax character as a "parody of a [[misanthropic]] ecologist". She called the book "gloomy" and expressed skepticism that its message would resonate with small children in the manner intended. Nevertheless, she praised the book as effective in conveying the consequences of ecological destruction in a way that young children will understand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7359/full/476148a.html In retrospect: The Lorax].

==Controversy==
In 1988, a small school district in California kept the book on a reading list for second graders, though some in the town claimed the book was unfair to the logging industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958654,00.html?iid=chix-sphere "California: Chopping Down Dr. Seuss"].

Terri Birkett, a member of a family-owned hardwood flooring factory, authored ''The Truax'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714145354/http://www.myteacherpages.com/webpages/NDow/files/TRUAX1.pdf "Truax"].

(PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; offering a logging-friendly perspective to an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tree known as the ''Guardbark''.  This book was published by the National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA).  Just as in ''The Lorax'', the book consists of a disagreement between two people.  The logging industry representative states that they have efficiency and re-seeding efforts. The Guardbark, a personification of the [[environmentalist]] movement much as the Once-ler is for big business, refuses to listen and lashes out.  But in the end, he is convinced by the logger's arguments. However, this story was criticized for what were viewed as skewed arguments and clear self-interest, particularly a "casual attitude toward endangered species" that answered the Guardbark's concern for them. In addition, the book's approach as a more blatant argument, rather than one worked into a storyline, was also noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcdf.org/meadows/truax.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020509134328/http://www.pcdf.org/meadows/truax.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 9, 2002|title=The People-Centered Development Forum - Living Economies Forum|publisher=|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aadl.org/node/9624|title=What's A Truax?

The line "I hear things are just as bad up in [[Lake Erie]]" was removed more than fourteen years after the story was published, after two research associates from the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to Seuss about the clean-up of Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6rnHjVaTKMMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA276&amp;lpg=RA1-PA276&amp;dq=lorax+lake+erie+line+removed&amp;source=web&amp;ots=In0YHjRebf&amp;sig=WkYwbVQXEzCTQP78cekSaexw1kQ&amp;hl=en "Dr. Seuss &amp; Mr. Geisel : a biography"].

==Adaptations==

===1972 television special===
{{Main article|The Lorax (1972 film)}}
The book was adapted as an animated musical television special produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], directed by [[Hawley Pratt]] and starring the voices of [[Eddie Albert]] and [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]]. It was first aired by [[CBS]] on February 14, 1972. A reference to pollution of [[Lake Erie]] was spoken by one of the Humming-Fish as they depart; it remains in DVD releases of the show, although later removed from the book. The special also shows the Once-ler arguing with himself, and asking the Lorax whether shutting down his factory (thus putting hundreds of people out of work) is practical. An abridged version of the special is used in the 1994 TV movie ''[[In Search of Dr. Seuss]]'', with [[Kathy Najimy]]'s reporter character hearing the Once-ler's story.

===2012 feature film===
{{Main article|The Lorax (film)}}
On March 2, 2012, [[Universal Studios]] and [[Illumination Entertainment]] released a [[3D film|3-D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film based upon the book. The release coincided with the 108th birthday of Seuss, who died at 87 in 1991. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Zac Efron]] as Ted (the boy in the book), and [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler. The film includes several new characters: [[Rob Riggle]] as villain Aloysius O'Hare, [[Betty White]] as Ted's Grammy Norma, [[Jenny Slate]] as Ted's neurotic mother Mrs. Wiggins, and [[Taylor Swift]] as Audrey, Ted's romantic interest. The film debuted in the No. 1 spot at the box office, making $70&amp;nbsp;million, though it received mixed reviews. The film eventually grossed a domestic total of $214,030,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|lorax|The Lorax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio books===
Two audio readings have been released on CD, one narrated by [[Ted Danson]] in the United States (Listening Library, {{ISBN|978-0-8072-1873-0}}) and one narrated by [[Rik Mayall]] in the United Kingdom (HarperCollins, {{ISBN|978-0-00-715705-1}}).

===Musical===
A musical adaptation of ''The Lorax'' was originally included in script for the Broadway musical ''[[Seussical]]'', but was cut before the show opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Kenneth|title=Ahrens &amp; Flaherty Double Bill of Musicals Pairs Lorax and Emperor's New Clothes|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/ahrens-flaherty-double-bill-of-musicals-pairs-lorax-and-emperors-new-clothe-141201|publisher=Playbill|accessdate=December 26, 2014|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 2, 2015, to January 16, 2016, a musical version of the book ran at the [[Old Vic]] theatre in London. With former [[Noah and the Whale]] frontman, [[Charlie Fink]], who wrote the music for the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/dr.-seusss-the-lorax/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702104801/http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/dr.-seusss-the-lorax/ |archivedate=July 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tongyeong-city-from-air.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photo of Tongyeong.]]
Tongyeong is situated in the southern tip of Goseong peninsula and its three sides are surrounded by the sea. It consists of 41 inhabited and 110 uninhabited islands. Tongyeong Port, the east gate of Hallyeo Marine National Park, is referred to as the most beautiful port in South Korea.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=3007549&amp;v=43 |script-title=ko:통영시의 자연환경 |trans-title=Environment of Tongyeong |publisher=Nate / Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610070442/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=3007549&amp;v=43 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alash-5x5-300dpi.jpg|thumb|The [[Alash Ensemble]]]]
'''Tuvan throat singing''', '''Khoomei''', '''Hooliin Chor''' (in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], ‘throat harmony’), or '''Mongolian throat singing'''  is one particular variant of [[overtone singing]] practiced by people in [[Mongolia]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Tuva]] and [[Siberia]]. In 2009, it was inscribed on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] of [[UNESCO]], under the name ''Mongolian art of singing, Khoomei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00210|title=Mongolian art of singing, Khoomei - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mongolian throat singing, the performer produces a fundamental pitch and—simultaneously—one or more pitches over that.&lt;ref&gt;Aksenov, A. N. Tuvan Folk Music. Asian Music, Vol. 4, No. 2 (1973), pp. 7-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Mongolian throat singing reaches far back. Many male herders can throat sing, but women are beginning to practice the technique as well. The popularity of throat singing among Mongolians seems to have arisen as a result of geographic location and culture. The open landscape of Mongolia allows for the sounds to carry a great distance. [[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] studying throat singing in these areas mark ''khoomei'' as an integral part in the ancient pastoral [[animism]] that is still practiced today. Often, singers travel far into the countryside looking for the right river, or go up to the steppes of the mountainside to create the proper environment for throat-singing.&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, Mark. ''Ethnomusicology''. Volume 36, No. 3, Special Issue: Music and the Public Interest. (1992), pp 444-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The animistic world view of this region identifies the spirituality of objects in nature, not just in their shape or location, but in their sound as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levin |first1=Theodore |authorlink=Theodore Levin (ethnomusicologist) |title=When Rivers and Mountains Sing |location=Bloomington, IN |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-253-34715-7 |format=cloth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, [[Imitation of natural sounds in various cultures|human mimicry of nature's sounds]] is seen as the root of throat singing. An example of this is the Mongolian story of the waterfall above the Buyant Göl (Deer River in Tuvan), where mysterious harmonic sounds are said to have attracted deer to bask in the waters, and where it is said harmonic sounds were first revealed to people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Indeed, the cultures in this part of Asia have developed many instruments and techniques to mimic the sounds of animals, wind, and water. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} While the cultures of this region share throat singing, their styles vary in breadth of development.

Ordinarily, melodies are created by isolating the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th [[Harmonic series (music)#Harmonic vs. partial|partial]] in accordance with the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. Thus, if the fundamental frequency were C3, the overtones would be G5, B♭5, C6, D6, E6, G6. However, it is possible to reach as low as the 2nd and as high as the 24th. The fundamental pitch is typically around a G below [[middle C]], and this affects the range of partials the singer can reach, with higher partials more easily reached on lower notes, and vice versa.

The numbers above the harmonic indicate the number of [[Cent (music)|cents]] difference from [[equal temperament]] (rounded to the nearest [[Cent (music)|cent]]). Blue notes are flat and red notes are sharp.]]

The people of Tuva have a wide range of throat singing vocalizations, and were the pioneers of six pitch harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-throat-singers-of-tuv |title=The Throat Singers of Tuva |date=September 1999 &lt;!-- |day=20 --&gt; |journal=[[Scientific American]] |first1=Theodore C. |last1=Levin |first2=Michael E. |last2=Edgerton}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different classification schemes for Tuvan throat singing. In one, the three basic styles are khoomei, kargyraa and sygyt, while the sub-styles include borbangnadyr, chylandyk, dumchuktaar, ezengileer and kanzyp. In another, there are five basic styles: khoomei, sygyt, kargyraa, borbangnadyr and ezengileer.  The substyles include chylandyk, despeng borbang, opei khoomei, buga khoomei, kanzyp, khovu kargyraazy, kozhagar kargyraazy, dag kargyraazy, Oidupaa kargyraazy, uyangylaar, damyraktaar, kishteer, serlennedyr and byrlannadyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khoomei.narod.ru/khorekteereng.html |title=International Scientific Centre "Khoomei" |publisher=Khoomei.narod.ru |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schemes all use [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]] terminology.

== Khorekteer ==
Khorekteer refers to the "chest voice".  This is the voice that throat singers use when using khoomei, kargyraa, or any other harmonic-inducing style.  The term can also be used to refer to all styles of Tuvan throat singing, much like khoomei.  It can also refer to the feeling of chest resonance or pressure that one experiences when throat singing.  Khorekteer is often used as a launching pad into the khoomei, sygyt, or kargyraa styles of throat singing.

== Khoomei ==
The most popular style of Tuvan throat singing is known as Khoomei (or Khöömei, in [[Cyrillic]]: '''Хөөмей'''). Khoomei is traditionally a softer sounding style, with the fundamental (or [[Drone (music)|drone]]) usually in the low-mid to midrange of the singer’s normal voice.  In this style, usually 2 or 3 harmonics can be heard between one and two octaves above the fundamental. In Khoomei, the abdomen is fairly relaxed, and there is less tension on the larynx than in other styles. Pitch is manipulated through a combination of movements of the lips, throat, tongue or jaw.

Singing in this style gives the impression of wind swirling among rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khoomei.com/videos/kokhoomeism.mov|title=The website Khoomei.com has a great video demonstrating khomeii style.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Khoomei'' is also used as a generic term to designate all throat singing techniques in this region.

== Sygyt ==
Sygyt (in [[Cyrillic]]: '''Сыгыт'''), literally 'whistling', has a midrange fundamental and is characterized by strong, flute-like or rather piercing harmonics, reminiscent of whistling.  Also described{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} as an imitation of the gentle breezes of summer, the songs of birds, the ideal sound for the harmonics is called Чистый звук—Russian for ''clear sound''.

To perform Sygyt, the tongue rises and seals around the gums, just behind the teeth. A small hole is left back behind the molars, either on the left or right side.  The sound is then directed between the teeth to the front of the mouth. The lips form a bell-like shape, usually with an “ee" vowel, and the sound is directed through this small opening.  Pitch is manipulated exactly the same way as in khoomei style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khoomei.com/videos/gennadism.mov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Miles]] was a 1920s Texan singer of [[cowboy songs]].  He is credited with independently creating a style of [[Overtone singing|throat singing]], similar to sygyt, as a supplement to the normal [[yodeling]] of [[Country music|Country Western music]]. Two recordings exist that are attributed to Arthur Miles. The recordings are the first and second parts of a tune titled "Lonely Cowboy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes | title = When I Was A Cowboy, Vol. 1 | date = September 24, 1996 | others = Various Artists | publisher = [[Yazoo Records]] | location = Newton, NJ | id = 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kargyraa ==
The more deep sounding style of throat singing is known as Kargyraa (in [[Cyrillic]]: '''Каргыраа''').  Kargyraa has a deep, almost growling sound to it and is technically related to [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[Buddhist chant]] and has some similarities with [[vocal fry]] and the way [[Popeye]]'s cartoon voice was created. It uses both the vocal and the [[vestibular fold]]s (also known as "false vocal chords") simultaneously, creating two connected sources of sound.

By constricting the [[larynx]], the vestibular folds can be brought together (adducted) and, under certain conditions, vibrate. It can produce an [[Undertone series|undertone]] exactly half the frequency of the fundamental produced by the vocal folds. Therefore, for each second vibration of the vocal folds, the vestibular fold completes a whole vibration cycle. While the larynx generates such rich sound, the mouth cavity may be shaped, just like in the manipulation of vowels, to select some particular harmonics, resulting in a sound that may be perceived as having different pitches simultaneously.

This vocal mechanism has been only recently elucidated and shown to be similar to the chant practiced in Tibet by the Gyuto monastery and other Buddhist orders.&lt;ref&gt;Fuks et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindestad et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
There are two types of Kargyraa: ''Dag'' (mountain) and ''Xovu'' (steppe).  The Dag style is deeper and has more nasal effects, while Xovu is raspier and sung at a higher pitch with more throat tension and less chest resonance.&lt;ref&gt;Alden-ool Sevek (1995). [http://khoomei.com/videos/seveksm.mov "Dag (Muntain)Kargyraa"]. (MOV video). khoomei.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaigal-ool. [http://khoomei.com/videos/orphan.mov "Orphan's Lament"]. (MOV video). khoomei.com. "Kaigal-ool sings his heart out in several khoomei styles."&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also the distinctive kargyraa styles of [[Vladimir Oidupaa]] and [[Albert Kuvezin]], the latter also bearing the name ''kanzat''.  This is sometimes described{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} as the howling winds of winter or the plaintive cries of a mother camel after losing her calf.

== Effects and other styles ==
Of the following list, two effects that commonly employed in the khomeii, sygyt and kargyraa styles: Borbangnadyr and Ezengileer.

* '''Borbangnadyr''' ('''Борбаңнадыр''') is a trill reminiscent of birds and traveling brooks, made by a light rapid quivering of the lips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khoomei.com/videos/olegsm.mov|title=An excellent example of Borbangnadyr.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ezenggileer''' ('''Эзеңгилээр''') is a pulsating style, attempting to mimic the rhythms of horseback riding. It is named after the Tuvan word for stirrup, ''ezengi''.
* '''Chylandyk''' ('''Чыландык''') is simultaneous Sygyt and Kargyraa. This creates an unusual sound of low undertones mixed with the high Sygyt whistle. It has also been described as the "chirping of crickets." A careful listener can further break down this style into Dag Chylandyk and Xovu Chylandyk.
* '''Dumchuktaar''' ('''Думчуктаар''') could be best described as "throat humming".  The singer creates a sound similar to sygyt using only the nasal passage.  The word means to sing through the nose (''dumchuk''). The mouth does not need to be closed, but of course it demonstrates the point better.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

== Women in Tuvan throat singing==

There were a few female throat singers in Tuva's history, though it was believed a woman performing throat singing could hurt her male relatives and cause her difficulties during childbirth. Choldak-Kara Oyun, the mother of the famous throat singer Soruktu Kyrgys and grandmother of the husband of famous Tuvan actress Kara-Kys Namzatovna Munzuk, throat sang throughout her life while milking her cows, singing lullabies to her children and sometimes while she was drinking Tuvan araga (fermented milk alcohol). Close relatives of famous singers, like Khunashtaar-ool's niece (in the 1960s) and Kombu's daughter (in the 1940s or 1950s), performed khoomei (throat singing) in public more than once. The wife of the throat singing shaman Bilek-ool from Manchurek, Aldinsova Tortoyavna, said that she has always sung khoomei "because it was innate to [her] from birth." She could not resist singing khoomei after she got married and had children, and sang khoomei in public in the 1950s and 1960s. But her sister, who also sang khoomei as a girl, gave up when others repeatedly reminded her of the supposed dangers.
 
In the Soviet era it was rare for women to perform on stage, except during Republican festivals. Valentina Salchak performed throat singing in public in 1979. Valentina Chuldum from Mongun-Taiga (1960- Autumn 2002) toured European countries as a throat singer in the early 1990s. With the start of the International Symposium of Khoomei women could sing publicly there.

[[Tyva Kyzy]] (Тыва Кызы, pronounced {{IPA-tyv|tɯˈva kɯˈzɯ|}}) (Daughters of Tuva, in Tuvan Turkish), founded in 1998, is an all-female folk ensemble performing Tuvan throat singing, under the direction of Choduraa Tumat. It is the first and only women's group in Tuva that performs all styles of Tuvan throat singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyvakyzy.com/|title=TYVAKYZY.COM|website=www.tyvakyzy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Umm Leisun inscription''' ({{lang-ka|უმმ ლეისუნის წარწერა}}) is the [[Georgian language]] ''[[limestone]]'' ''[[tombstone]]'' [[Concrete slab|slab]] inscription written in the Georgian ''[[Asomtavruli]]'' script which was discovered in 2002, after the renewal of 1996&lt;ref&gt;Tchekhanovets, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], at a Georgian monastery of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, in the neighborhood of Umm Leisun, 4.5 km southeast of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]],&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; found in a [[burial]] [[crypt]] under the [[polychrome]]&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; [[mosaic]] [[floor]].&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In total about 24 interments were discovered in the crypt.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Per sex estimation for [[human skeleton]]s, all of them were adult males, as would be expected in a monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Tchekhanovets, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; The occupant of the most important tomb identified by a Georgian inscription was a "[[Georgians|Georgian]] ''[[bishop]]'' ''Iohane''" ([[John (given name)|John]] in [[Old Georgian]]), who was also the oldest and his age underlined his special status.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; He would have been aged 66 or 67 when he died, and had suffered from [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Khurtsilava, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is the earliest known example for an [[ethnonym]] ႵႠႰႧႥႤႪႨ (''kartveli'' [[i.e.]] Georgian) on any [[archaeological artifact]], both in the [[Holy Land]] and in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tchekhanovets, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khurtsilava, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription covers an area of 81 × 49 [[Centimetre|cm]] cut into the tombstone. It is dated to the end of the 5th or the first half of the 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is kept at the Archaeological Garden of [[Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ursula Flora Schneider (Wolff)''' (popularly known as '''Ursula Wolff Schneider''') (August 14, 1906 - August, 1977) was a German [[photographer]] and [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]]. Her photographs of the [[Interwar period|pre-World War II period]] are a significant record of the society and culture of [[Weimar Germany]], and they serve as an important example of early photojournalism. 

== Biography ==
Ursula Wolff was born in [[Berlin]], Germany, and is the daughter of renowned Sanskrit scholar Dr. Fritz Wolff and Minna Wolff.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/wolff-fritz|title=WOLFF, FRITZ – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to German architect [[Karl Schneider (architect)|Karl Schneider]] ([[:de:Karl_Schneider_(Architekt)|de]]). 

In the mid-to-late 1920s, Ursula Wolff spent two years in Berlin, [[Vienna]], and [[Hamburg]] working as an apprentice in photographers' studios and honing her talents. In 1928 - at the age of 22 - she established her own studio, Foto Wolff Lichtbildwerkstatt, and began working as a free-lance photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/ursula-wolff-schneider-papers-and-photographs-1923-1983|title=Ursula Wolff Schneider Papers and Photographs, 1923-1983 {{!}} University of New Hampshire Library|website=www.library.unh.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She left Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1937.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; She spent her life in Chicago and was killed August 4, 1977 in an automobile accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/ursula-wolff-schneider-papers-and-photographs-1923-1983|title=Guide to the Ursula Wolff Schneider Papers and Photographs, 1923-1983|language=en|website=www.library.unh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wildenstein Institute''' is a French art institute that publishes [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] and scholarly inventories.  

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1970 by [[Daniel Wildenstein]] as the ''Fondation Wildenstein'', and it was renamed the Wildenstein Institute in 1990. It is an offshoot of the art dealing company ([[Wildenstein &amp; Co.]]) owned by the Wildenstein family for five generations.

It houses the historic documents and photographic archives assembled by Nathan Wildenstein (the company founder) and his son [[Georges Wildenstein|Georges]], which have been added to by subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/special_sites/wildenstein/printer.asp?page=3|title=The Wildenstein Institute|publisher=Christies|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Wildenstein established the [[Wildenstein Index Number]] used by the Institute to identify paintings.

It publishes catalogues raisonnés and scholarly inventories of impressionists such as Monet, and other modern artists such as Gauguin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-buying-art-dealer-wildenstein8217s-manhattan-headquarters-1391049030?tesla=y|title=Qatar Buying Art Dealer Wildenstein's Manhattan Headquarters|last=Maloney|first=Jennifer|date=29 January 2014|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes itself as a center for research in art history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=accueil&amp;lang=en Institute web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently headed by [[Guy Wildenstein]].

==Controversy==
The Institute publishes a Monet catalogue raisonné and is regarded as the "official" authenticator of Monet paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tom-flynn.blogspot.com/2011/07/exclusive-more-on-monet-rejected-by.html|title=More on the Monet rejected by the Wildenstein Institute|last=Flynn|first=Tom|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance of a Monet by the Institute significantly increases the commercial value of a painting. The Institute controversially refused to authenticate ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' after an investigation by [[Fiona Bruce]] (a journalist) and [[Philip Mould]] (an art dealer and historian) in the BBC television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', which first aired on 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{Cite episode
