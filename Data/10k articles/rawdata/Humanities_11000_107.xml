A '''3D selfie''' is a [[3D printing|3D-printed]] scale replica of a person. These [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[selfie]]s are also known as 3D portraits, 3D figurines, 3D-printed figurines, mini-me figurines and miniature statues. The 3D figurine is usually printed in full color using [[Powder bed and inkjet head 3D printing|gypsum-based binder jetting]] techniques, giving the figurine a sandstone-like texture and look.&lt;ref name="Huffingtonpost-taking-a-3d-selfie"/&gt;   While the printing process is fairly standardized, the [[3D scanner|capture]] of a subject as a [[3D modeling|3D model]] can be accomplished in many ways. Most systems use [[digital camera]] or cameras to take 2D pictures of the subject, under normal lighting, under [[Structured light|projected light patterns]], or a combination of these. A piece of software then [[3D reconstruction from multiple images|reconstructs a 3D model]] of the subject from these pictures.&lt;ref name="Wired-2015-3d-printed-selfies"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Popsci-2015-selfie-future-is-3d-figure"/&gt;

Inexpensive systems use a single camera which is moved around the subject in 360° at various heights, over minutes, while the subject stays immobile.&lt;ref name="Popsci-2015-selfie-future-is-3d-figure"/&gt;   More elaborate systems have a vertical bar of cameras rotate around the subject, usually achieving a full scan in 10 seconds.&lt;ref name="Ibtimes-3d-printed-selfie-service"/&gt;  Most expensive systems have an enclosed 3D photo booth with 50 to 100 cameras statically embedded in walls and the ceiling, firing all at once, eliminating differences in image capture caused by movements of the subject.&lt;ref name="Wired-2015-3d-printed-selfies"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Huffingtonpost-taking-a-3d-selfie"/&gt;

'''Acrophony''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|r|ɒ|f|ə|n|i|}}; Greek: ἄκρος ''akros'' uppermost + φωνή ''phone'' sound) is the naming of [[grapheme|letter]]s of an [[alphabet]]ic writing system so that a letter's name begins with the letter itself. For example, Greek letter names are acrophonic: the names of the letters α, β, γ, δ, are spelled with the respective letters: {{lang|el|αλφα}} (''alpha''), {{lang|el|βήτα}} (''beta''), {{lang|el|γάμμα}} (''gamma''), {{lang|el|δέλτα}} (''delta'').

The paradigm for acrophonic alphabets is the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]] and the succeeding [[Phoenician alphabet]], in which the letter A, representing the sound {{IPAblink|ʔ}}, is thought to have derived from an [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] representing an [[ox]], and is called "ox", ''ʾalp'', which starts with the [[glottal stop]] sound the letter represents. The [[Latin alphabet]] is descended from the Phoenician, and the stylized head of an ox can still be seen if the letter A is turned upside-down: ∀. The second letter of the Phoenician alphabet is ''bet'' (which means "house" and looks a bit like a shelter) representing the sound {{IPA|[b]}}, and from ''ālep-bēt'' we have the word "alphabet"{{snd}}another case where the beginning of a thing gives the name to the whole, which was in fact common practice in the ancient Near East.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The [[Glagolitic]] and [[early Cyrillic alphabet]]s, although not consisting of ideograms, also have letters named acrophonically.  The letters representing /a, b, v, g, d, e/ are named ''Az'', ''Buky'', ''Vedi'', ''Glagol'', ''Dobro'', ''Est''.  Naming the letters in order, one recites a poem, a [[mnemonic]] which helps students and scholars learn the alphabet: ''Az buky vedi, glagol’ dobro est’'' means "I know letters, [the] word is good" in [[Old Church Slavonic]].

In [[Irish orthography|Irish]] and [[Ogham]], letters were formerly named after [[tree]]s, for example A was ''ailm'' ([[white fir]]), B was ''beith'' ([[birch]]) and C was ''coll'' ([[hazel]]). The [[rune]] alphabets used by the Germanic peoples were also named acrophonically; for example, the first three letters, which represented the sounds /f, u, þ/, were named ''fé, ur, þurs'' in Norse (wealth, slag/rain, giant) and ''feoh, ur, þorn'' in Old English (wealth, ox, thorn). Both sets of names probably stemmed from Proto-Germanic ''*[[fehu]], *[[ur (rune)|uruz]], *[[thurisaz]]''.

The [[Thai alphabet]] is learned acrophonically, each letter being represented pictorially in school-books (chicken, egg, ox, snake, bell, etc.).

[[Rudyard Kipling]] gives a fictional description of the process in one of his ''[[Just So Stories]]'', "How the Alphabet was Made."&lt;ref&gt;Just So Stories, Rudyard Kipling&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[radiotelephony]] and aviation uses [[spelling alphabet]]s (the best-known of which is the [[NATO Phonetic Alphabet]], which begins with ''Alfa'', ''Bravo'', ''Charlie'', ''Delta''...) in which the letters of the English alphabet are arbitrarily assigned words and names in an acrophonic manner to avoid misunderstanding.

Most notes of the [[solfege]] scale{{snd}}namely ''re'', ''mi'', ''fa'', ''sol'', and ''la''{{snd}}derive their names from the first [[syllable]] of the lines of ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', a [[Latin]] hymn.

{{prerogative writs}}
In the [[Philippines]], '''''amparo''''' and '''''habeas data''''' are [[prerogative writ]]s to supplement the inefficacy of the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' (Rule 102, Revised Rules of Court). ''[[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]'' means 'protection,' while ''[[habeas data]]'' is 'access to information.'&lt;ref&gt;Literally, 'may you have the data' in [[Latin]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[writ]]s were conceived to solve the extensive Philippine [[extrajudicial killing]]s and [[forced disappearances]] since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/publications/benchmark/2007/07/070717.php Supremecourt.gov.ph, National Consultative Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Enforced Disappearances Summary of Recommendations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205205717/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/publications/benchmark/2007/07/070717.php |date=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2007, Philippine Chief Justice [[Reynato S. Puno]] and Justice [[Adolfo Azcuna]] officially declared the legal conception of the Philippine Writ of Amparo ("''Recurso de Amparo''"), at the historic [[Manila Hotel]] National Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Enforced [[Forced disappearance|Disappearance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/publications/benchmark/2007/07/070701.php Supremecourt.gov.ph, Summit on Extrajudicial Killings Sows Hope] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205205709/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/publications/benchmark/2007/07/070701.php |date=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 Extrajudicial killings, ‘View from the mountaintop’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605022710/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 |date=2009-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2007, Reynato Puno declared the legal conception of amparo's twin, the supplemental Philippine Habeas Data. Puno by judicial fiat proclaimed the legal birth of these twin peremptory writs on October, 2007, as his legacy to the Filipino nation. Puno admitted the inefficacy of Habeas Corpus, under Rule 102, Rules of Court, since government officers repeatedly failed to produce the body upon mere submission of the defense of alibi.

By invoking the truth, Habeas Data will not only compel military and government agents to release information about the [[desaparecidos]] but require access to military and police files. Reynato Puno's ''writ of amparo''—[[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'protection'—will bar military officers in judicial proceedings to issue denial answers regarding petitions on disappearances or extrajudicial executions, which were legally permitted in Habeas corpus proceedings.&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=85704 Inquirer.net, SC drafting writ of habeas data invoking right to truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] announced that the draft guidelines (Committee on Revision of Rules) for the writ of amparo were approved on September 23, to be deliberated by the En Banc Court on September 25.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin==

=== Mexican amparo ===
Chief Justice Reynato Puno noted that the model for Amparo was borrowed from [[Mexico]]: the right of Amparo is a Mexican legal procedure to protect [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1025063|title=The Writ of Amparo. Mexican Procedure to Protect Human Rights|first=Carlos Sánchez|last=Mejorada|date=1 January 1946|publisher=|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=243|pages=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Mexican origin, thus, “Amparo” literally means “protection” in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;[Barker, R., “Constitutionalism in the Americas: A Bicentennial Perspective,” 49 University  of Pittsburgh Law Review (Spring, 1988) 891, 906.]&lt;/ref&gt; de Tocqueville’s "Democracy in America" had been available in Mexico, in 1837 and its description of  [[judicial review]] practice in the U.S. appealed to many Mexican [[jurists]].&lt;ref&gt;[Id., citing Zamudio, F., “A Brief Introduction to the Mexican Right of Amparo,” 9 California Western International Law Journal (1979) 306, 309]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican justice Manuel Crescencio Rejón, drafted a constitutional provision for his native state, [[Yucatan]], which empowered jurists to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their constitutional and legal rights.  This was incorporated into the 1847 national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[“At the time it adopted Rejón’s amparo, Yucatan had separated itself from Mexico. After a few months, the secession ended and the state resumed its place in the union.” (Barker, R., supra at 906.)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Acta de Reformas, art. 25 (1847) (amending Constitution of 1824).]&lt;/ref&gt; The great right proliferated in the [[Western Hemisphere]], slowly evolving into various fora. Amparo became, in the words of a Mexican Federal Supreme Court Justice, Mexico’s “task of conveying to the world’s legal heritage that institution which, as a shield of human dignity, her own painful history conceived.”&lt;ref&gt;[Rule on the Right of Amparo: Annotation, p. 45.  See Article 107 of the Constitution of Mexico; Article 28(15) of the Constitution of Ecuador; Article 77 of the Constitution of Paraguay; Article 43 of the Constitution of Argentina; Article 49 of the Constitution of Venezuela; Article 48 (3) of the Constitution of  Costa Rica; and Article 19 of the Constitution of Bolivia.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Provost, R., supra at 698, citing Ramirez, F., “The International Expansion of the Mexican Amparo,” 1 Inter-American Law Review (1959) 163, 166.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amparo's evolution and metamorphosis had been witnessed, for several purposes: "(1) amparo libertad for the protection of personal freedom, equivalent to the habeas corpus right; (2) amparo contra leyes for the judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes; (3) amparo casación for the judicial review of the constitutionality and legality of a judicial decisión; (4) amparo administrativo for the judicial review of administrative actions; and (5) amparo agrario for the protection of peasants’ rights derived from the agrarian reform process." &lt;ref&gt;[Rule on the Right of Amparo: Annotation, p. 45; see also Zagaris, B., “The Amparo Process in Mexico,” 6 Mexico Law Journal (Spring 1998) 61, 66 and Provost, R., supra at 708-709.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latin America]]n countries, except [[Cuba]], used the great right to protect against human rights abuses especially committed in countries under [[military juntas]], adopting an all-encompassing amparo, even to protect socio-economic rights. But other countries like Colombia, Chile, Germany and Spain, opted to limit amparo shield only to some constitutional guarantees or fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;[Brewer-Carias, A., “The Latin American Amparo Proceeding and the Right of Amparo in the Philippines,” Second Distinguished Lecture, Series of 2007, Supreme Court, Philippine Judicial Academy in coordination with the Philippine Association of Law Schools, March 7, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Philippines, while the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] failed to expressly provide for amparo, several amparo protections are already guaranteed, thus: by paragraph 2, Article VIII, Section 1, the "''Grave Abuse Clause''" - which grants a similar general protection to human rights extended by the amparo contra leyes, amparo casacion, and amparo administrativo. Amparo libertad is similar to [[habeas corpus]] in the 1987 Constitution. The Clause is borrowed from the U.S. [[common law]] tradition of [[judicial review]] (1803 case of [[Marbury v. Madison]]).&lt;ref&gt;[See 1987 Phil. Const. Art. III, §§ 13 &amp; 15; Art. VII, § 18; Art. VIII, § 5(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ 5 U.S. 137 (1803).  See Gormley, K. “Judicial Review in the Americas: Comments on the United States and Mexico,” 45 Duquesne Law Review (Spring, 2007) 393.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Adolfo Azcuna, a member of two Constitutional Commissions of 1971, and 1986 previously made a study on the Right amparo as published in the [[Ateneo Law Journal]] (see Adolfo S. Azcuna, The Right of Amparo: A Remedy to Enforce Fundamental Rights, 37 ATENEO L.J. 15 (1993).).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/Annotation_amparo.pdf|title=supremecourt.gov,  ANNOTATION TO THE right OF AMPARO|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "''recurso de amparo''" is an exhaustive [[Legal remedy|remedy]] which originated from [[Latin America]]'s [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] legal systems, ''inter alia''. Mexico's amparo is found in Articles 103 and 107 of the [[Mexican Constitution]] --  the [[judicial review]] of governmental action, to empower  state courts to protect individuals against state abuses. Amparo was sub-divided into 5 legal departments:
:(a) the Liberty Amparo (''amparo de libertad''); &lt;br&gt;(b) the Constitutionality Amparo (''amparo contra leyes''); &lt;br&gt;(c) the Judicial or “''Cassation''” Amparo, aimed at the constitutionality of a judicial interpretation; &lt;br&gt;(d) the Administrative Amparo (''amparo como contencioso-administrativo''); and &lt;br&gt;(e) the Agrarian Amparo (''amparo en matera agraria, ejidal y comunal'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html Inquirer.net, Joaquin G. Bernas, The Mexican amparo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015062605/http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html |date=2010-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argentine amparo ===
Amparo was also legally enshrined in [[Latin America]] legal systems. It is now an extraordinary legal remedy in [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]]  [[Peru]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Amparo in Argentina is a limited, summary, emergency  procedure, and merely supplementary, requiring previous exhaustion of administrative remedies before rendition of judgment of [[mandamus]] or [[injunction]].

=== Habeas corpus ===
Historically, [[Philippine]] [[Habeas Corpus]] (from 1901 until the present) failed to provide an efficacious legal remedy to victims of extra-judicial killings and ''[[desaparecidos]]''. The ''amparo de libertad'' transcends the protection of  ''[[habeas corpus]]''. Once a [[lawsuit]] is filed under Habeas Corpus, Rule 102, Rules of Court, the defendants, government officers would merely submit the usual defense of alibi or non-custody of the body sought to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/court%20issuances/rules/index.php|title=Supremecourt.gov.ph, Rules of Court|publisher=|access-date=2007-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011015056/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/court%20issuances/rules/index.php|archive-date=2007-10-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is an "extraordinary", "[[common law]]", or "[[prerogative writ]]", which were historically issued by English courts in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''.
The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority, so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something, failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party.

==National Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Enforced Disappearances==
On July 16, 2007, Justices, activists, militant leaders, police officials, politicians and [[prelates]] attended the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]'s 2-day summit at the [[Manila Hotel]], [[Metro Manila]] to solve extrajudicial killings. Chief Justice Reynato Puno stated that the "''National Consultative Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Forced Disappearances: Searching for Solutions''" would help stop the murders. Based on [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] - [[Bishop]] Deogracias Yniguez-church's count, the number of victims of extrajudicial killings was record at 778, while survivors of "''political assassinations''" was 370; 203 "''massacre''"  victims; 186 [[desaparecidos|desaparecido]]; 502 tortured, and those illegally arrested.&lt;ref&gt;

Puno requested for truce and talks with [[Insurgency|insurgents]]: "''Let us rather engage in the conspiracy of hope…and hope for peace''." Puno forwarded the summit's recommendation to President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], the [[Senate of the Philippines]] and House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;

“''Extralegal killings''” (UN instruments term) are those committed without [[due process of law]], which include summary and arbitrary executions, “''salvagings''”, threats to take the life of journalists, ''inter alia''. “''Enforced disappearances''” (defined by Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances), include: arrest, detention or abduction by a government official or organized groups under the government; the refusal of the State to disclose the fate or whereabouts of missing persons, ''inter alia''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Writs of amparo and habeas data==
On August 17, 2007 Puno said that the [[writ]] of amparo, would bar the military [[plea]] of denial (at a speech at the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption's 9th anniversary, Camp Crame). Under the writ, plaintiffs or victims will have the right of access to information on their lawsuits—a constitutional right called the "''habeas data''" derived from constitutions of [[Latin America]]. The final draft of these twin writs (retroactive) will be promulgated on October. Puno tersely summed the writs "''In other words, if you have this right, it would be very, very difficult for State agents, State authorities to be able to escape from their culpability.''"&lt;ref&gt;

Puno stated that with the writ of Habeas corpus, the writs of Habeas Data and  writ of amparo will further assist "''those looking for missing loved ones''".&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"/&gt;
On August 30, 2007, Puno (speech at [[Silliman University]] in [[Dumaguete]] City, [[Negros Oriental]]) promised to institute the ''writ of habeas data'' (“''you should have the idea''” or “''you should have the data''”). Puno explained that  amparo bars [[alibi]], while Habeas Data "''can find out what information is held by the officer, rectify or even the destroy erroneous data gathered''". [[Brazil]] used the writ, followed by [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Argentina]] and [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=85617  Inquirer.net, Habeas data: SC’s new remedy vs killings, disappearances]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippine]] 1987 Constitution was derived from the 1973 [[Ferdinand Marcos]] Constitution, its 1981 amendment, from the 1935 constitution, and from the [[United States Constitution]]. The United States Constitution was adopted in its original form on September 17, 1787, by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and later ratified by conventions in each state in the name of "''the People''." The U.S. Constitution is the oldest written national constitution except possibly for San Marino 's Statutes of 1600, whose status as a true constitution is disputed by scholars. The Writ of Amparo is a remedy to enforce fundamental rights. “''among the different procedures that have been established for the protection of human rights, the primary ones that provide direct and immediate protection are habeas corpus and amparo. The difference between these two writs is that habeas corpus is designed to enforce the right to freedom of the person, whereas amparo is designed to protect those other fundamental human rights enshrined in the Constitution but not covered by the writ of habeas corpus''.”&lt;ref&gt;

The literal translation from Latin of [[Habeas Data]] is “''you should have the data''”. Habeas Data is a constitutional right to protect, per lawsuit filed in court, to protect the image, privacy, honour, information self-determination and freedom of information of a person. Habeas Data can used to discover what information is held about his or her person (via rectification or destruction of the personal data held. Habeas Data originated, ''inter alia'', from the Council of Europe’s 108th Convention on Data Protection of 1981 (aimed at protecting the privacy of the individual regarding the automated processing of personal data; with right to access their personal data held in an automated database.&lt;ref&gt;

===Historical promulgations of amparo and habeas data===

====A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC, the Rule on the Writ of Amparo ====     

On September 25, 2007, Chief Justice Reynato Puno officially announced the approval or promulgation of the Writ of Amparo: "Today, the Supreme Court promulgated the rule that will place the constitutional right to life, liberty and security above violation and threats of violation. This rule will provide the victims of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances the protection they need and the promise of vindication for their rights. This rule empowers our courts to issue reliefs that may be granted through judicial orders of protection, production, inspection and other relief to safeguard one's life and liberty The writ of amparo shall hold public authorities, those who took their oath to defend the constitution and enforce our laws, to a high standard of official conduct and hold them accountable to our people. The sovereign Filipino people should be assured that if their right to life and liberty is threatened or violated, they will find vindication in our courts of justice."[36]

==International criticism==
On September 28, 2007, the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]] (AHRC) described the new writs of ''amparo'' and ''habeas data '' as insufficient to resolve the problems of extra-legal killings and enforced disappearances in the Philippines. It argued that there must be a cooperative action on all parts of the government and civil society:

:Though it responds to practical areas it is still necessary that further action must be taken in addition to this. The legislative bodies, House of Representatives and Senate, should also initiate its own actions promptly and without delay. They must enact laws which ensure protection of rights—laws against torture and [[enforced disappearance]] and laws to afford adequate legal remedies to victims.

The AHRC objected that the writs fail to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Competition law theory''' covers the strands of thought relating to [[competition law]] or antitrust policy.

==Classical perspective==
{{see also|Classical economics}}
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]] believed the [[restraint of trade]] doctrine was justified to preserve [[liberty]] and [[competition]]]]
The classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the [[individual liberty]] of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 7, para 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [[Adam Smith]] also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate legal measures to combat them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN4.html#B.I,%20Ch.10,%20Of%20Wages%20and%20Profit%20in%20the%20Different%20Employments%20of%20Labour%20and%20Stock Book I, Chapter 10], para 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith also rejected the very existence of, not just dominant and abusive corporations, but [[corporation]]s at all.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book V, Chapter 1, para 107&lt;/ref&gt;

By the latter half of the nineteenth century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s approach was laid down in his treatise ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil..."&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1859) Chapter V, para 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of the word "society" to mean the state, and the false claim that because a "social act" effects the "interest" of other persons it comes under the "jurisdiction" of the state, even if the act is entirely voluntary (i.e. an act of Free Will, agency, for both parties in the exchange). Liberty in commercial matters (in the voluntary buying and selling of goods and services) is not some different "principle" to liberty generally - it is clearly the same principle.

==Neo-classical synthesis==
{{see also|Neo-classical economics}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:1schumpeter.jpg|right|thumb|[[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued competition drove the progress of capitalist democracies]] --&gt;
After Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasised a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes [[social welfare]]. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no [[barriers to entry]]. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver [[allocative efficiency|allocative]], [[productive efficiency|productive]] and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as [[Pareto efficiency]] after the Italian economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and means that resources in an economy over the [[long run]] will go precisely to those who are [[Consumerism|willing]] and [[Poverty|able]] to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last [[Marginalism|marginal unit]] of possible output - or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced - there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and [[Utilitarianism|utility]] is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency.  Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who [[Protestant work ethic|work hard]], and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the [[Production possibility frontier|frontier of its possible production]].&lt;ref&gt;for one of the opposite views, see [[Kenneth Galbraith]], ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s notion that a "perennial gale of creative destruction" is ever sweeping through [[capitalism|capitalist]] economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], ''The Process of Creative Destruction'' (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices raise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing [[social welfare]] by creating a [[deadweight loss]]. Sources of this market power are said to include the existence of [[externalities]], [[barriers to entry]] of the market, and the [[free rider problem]]. Markets may [[market failure|fail]] to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of ''[[laissez faire]]'' is justified. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that [[perfect competition]] is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called "workable" or "[[effective competition]]".&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, "Towards a Concept of Workable Competition" (1940) 30 Am Ec Rev p.241-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markham, "An Alternative Approach to the Concept of Workable Competition" (1950) 40 Am Ec Rev p.349-361&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Lipsey and Lancaster, "The General Theory of Second Best" (1956-7) 24 Rev Ec Stud 11-32&lt;/ref&gt; by using the law to tame market operation where it can.

==Chicago School==
{{see also|Chicago School (economics)}}
[[File:Robert Bork.jpg|thumb|Robert Bork|right|[[Robert Bork]] argued that competition law was fundamentally flawed]]
A group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the [[University of Chicago]], advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition. The [[US Supreme Court]] has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.'', 433 U.S. 36 (1977), ''Broadcast Music Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.'', ''NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma'', ''Spectrum Sports Inc. v. McQuillan'', ''State Oil Co. v. Khan'', ''Verizon v. Trinko'', and ''Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.''&lt;/ref&gt; One view of the Chicago School approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's books''Antitrust law''&lt;ref&gt;Posner, ''Antitrust Law'' (2001) 2nd ed., {{ISBN|978-0-226-67576-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Economic Analysis of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Posner, ''Economic Analysis of Law'' (2007) 7th ed., {{ISBN|978-0-7355-6354-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posner once worked in the Department of Justice's antitrust division, has long been a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and is likely the most widely cited antitrust scholar and jurist in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Posner (2001) p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bork]] was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bork, Robert H. ''The Antitrust Paradox'' (1978)  New York Free Press {{ISBN|0-465-00369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was pursuit ''only'' of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors.&lt;ref name="Bork 1978 p.405"&gt;Bork (1978) p.405&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and [[price discrimination]] on the grounds that it did not harm consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1978) p.406&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Easterbrook]], ''The Limits of Antitrust'', 63 U. Tex. L. Rev. 1 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; "The only cure for bad theory", writes Bork, "is better theory".&lt;ref name="Bork 1978 p.405"/&gt; The late [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Phillip Areeda]], who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooke Group v. Williamson'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=509&amp;invol=209 509 US 209] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- why is this case more notable than the rest? --&gt;

==Other critiques==
Some [[economic libertarian]]s have criticised competition law in its entirety,
challenging the legitimacy of action against price fixing and [[cartel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For a criticism of the libertarian view see Michael E. DeBow (2007) ''What's Wrong with Price Fixing: Responding to the New Critics of Antitrust'', published by the [http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv12n2/reg12n2-debow.html Cato Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

See Dominic Armentaro "Antitrust: The Case for Repeal" (Ludwig Von Mises Institute 1986) and "The Case Against Antitrust" by Robert A. Levy (Cato Institute 2004). The case being that "competition law" (or "Antitrust") is based upon a false view of economics - that it harms rather than benefits consumers in the long term. And that "competition law" (or "Antitrust") is based upon principles of law and philosophy that are both false and confused.

==Policy developments==
Anti-[[cartel]] enforcement is a key focus of competition law enforcement policy. In the [[United States]] the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act 2004 raised the maximum imprisonment term for price fixing from three to ten years, and the maximum fine from $10 million to $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;see generally, Pate (2004) at [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/206479.htm USDOJ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[British Airways]] and [[Korean Air]] pleaded guilty to fixing cargo and passenger flight prices.&lt;ref&gt;see, USDOJ Antitrust's [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2007/224928.htm press release] and the [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f224900/224943.htm court filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

These actions complement the private enforcement which has always been an important feature of [[United States antitrust law]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] summarised why [[United States Congress|Congress]] allows punitive damages in ''Hawaii v. Standard Oil''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California'' 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[European Union|EU]], the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 means that the [[European Commission]] is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of [[European Community competition law]]. This was done in order to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a [[Green Paper]] on ''Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules'',&lt;ref&gt;''Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules'' {SEC(2005) 1732} /* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2005:0672:FIN:EN:HTML COM/2005/0672]&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.&lt;ref&gt;see FAQ on the Green paper [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/05/489&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise was used in [[ancient Rome]], where it was, with the ''[[suasoria]]'', the final stage of a course in rhetoric at an [[academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Declamation and contestation in satire |author=Susanna Morton Braund |page=148 |title = Roman Eloquence: Rhetoric in Society and Literature |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=9780415125444}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''controversia'' is distinguished from this rhetorical practice because of the complexity of its structural system of argument and the greater range of situations and characters employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric, Volume 1|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780195125955|location=Oxford|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction can also be explained in the way students who focused on this exercise end up as forensic [[Public speaking|orators]] while those who trained in ''suasoria'' followed a career in [[deliberative rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philo and Paul Among the Sophists|last=Winter|first=Bruce|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521591082|location=Cambridge|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Seneca the Elder]] was an expert rhetorician and, from memory, compiled a set of classical themes for this exercise: the ''Controversiæ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=276 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome|volume=1 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9780195170726}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Controversia'' is demonstrated in the case of [[Quintilian|Quintillian]]'s ''Declamationes Minores'' where ''suasoria'' was turned into this exercise by using a courtroom as a setting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Roman Rhetoric|last=Dominik|first=William|last2=Hall|first2=Jon|publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons|year=2010|isbn=9781405120913|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot addressed the issue of a son who married the daughter of his father's enemy so he could use the [[dowry]] to ransom his who was captured by pirates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Department of Central Eurasian Studies''', often abbreviated as '''CEUS''', is a specialized academic department in the School of Global and International Studies at the [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Bloomington campus]] of [[Indiana University]], in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]]. Since its original formation in 1943 as a language-training program for the [[U.S. military]],&lt;ref name="Aranaga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/educ-english/2009/February/20090212192544ECaganarA0.1429407.html?CP.rss=true|title=University Studies Introduce Central Asia to Americans|last=Aranaga|first=Carlos|date=  12 February 2009|publisher=U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Program|accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the department has become the sole independent degree-granting academic unit staffed with its own faculty dedicated to [[Central Eurasia]] in the country.&lt;ref name=dept&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~ceus/ Department of Central Eurasian Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the department and the presence of several additional centers - the Inner Asian &amp; Uralic National Resource Center, the Denis Sinor Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies, and the Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region - Indiana University currently hosts the premier program of [[Central Asian studies]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Inner Asian and Uralic National Resource Center|publisher=International Education Programs Service, U.S. Department of Education|url=http://iris.ed.gov/iris/ieps/grantshow.cfm?award_Number=P015A060057|accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{cite web|last=Aranaga|first=Carlos|title=University Studies Introduce Central Asia to Americans|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=February 12, 2009|url=http://www.america.gov/st/educ-english/2009/February/20090212192544ECaganarA0.1429407.html|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEUS is home to many notable scholars of Central Eurasian studies, past and present, including [[Christopher Beckwith]], [[Yuri Bregel]], [[Jamsheed Choksy]], [[Devin Deweese]], [[William Fierman]], [[Gyorgy Kara]], [[Nazif Shahrani]],  [[Denis Sinor]], and [[Elliot Sperling]]. The department teaches many [[Less Commonly Taught Languages|less commonly taught languages]], including [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Pasto language|Pashto]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]].&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

==History of the Department==

In 1942, after the entry of the [[United States]] into [[World War II]], an Army Specialized Training Program was created to provide training in several Eurasian languages, including [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. As such, the Department was founded in 1943 as an "Army Specialized Training Program for Central Eurasian languages".  It was formally organized as the Program in [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Altaic]] Studies in 1956.  In 1965 it became the Department of Uralic and Altaic Studies.  Since 1993 it has been known under its current name.&lt;ref name=dept/&gt;

Professor Denis Sinor arrived from Cambridge University in the academic year of 1962-63. On his initiative, in 1965, the Program in Uralic and Altaic Studies was recognized as a graduate department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Affiliated Centers==

===Inner Asian &amp; Uralic National Resource Center===

In 1962, Indiana University became home to the Uralic and Altaic Language and Area Center, which in 1981 was renamed the Inner Asian and Uralic National Resource Center (IAUNRC). It is part of the [[National Resource Center]] program, and is funded by a Title VI grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]], through which it receives approximately $230,000 a year.&lt;ref name=edu/&gt; It scope includes the civilizations of Central Asia, Mongolia, and Tibet, together with neighboring areas and peoples that in certain periods formed cultural, political, or ethnolinguistic unities with these regions. It is the only national resource center focusing on Inner Asia.The center awards [[Foreign Language Area Studies|FLAS]] fellowships and engages in outreach and educational activities in the local area and throughout the country.

===Denis Sinor Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies===

Established in 1967 as the Asian Studies Research Institute (ASRI), its name was changed to the Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies (RIFIAS) in 1979, and then renamed the Denis Sinor Institute for Inner Asian Studies (SRIFIAS) in 2007. It is an independent, non-profit institution accountable to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences of the Bloomington campus of Indiana University. The SRIFIAS has had five directors, all members of the faculty of the Department of Central Eurasian Studies at Indiana University: Denis Sinor (1967–1981), Stephen Halkovic (1982–1985), Yuri Bregel (1986–1997), Devin DeWeese (1997–2007), and Edward Lazzerini (since 2007). The mission of the SRIFIAS is to encourage and support scholarly research in all aspects of Inner Asian Studies. One of the central tasks of the SRIFIAS is to maintain and develop scholarly and technical resources necessary for research in Inner Asian studies.

===Institute of Hungarian Studies===

The Institute of Hungarian Studies was established in 1991 to disseminate knowledge about Hungarian society and civilization; to support organizations and projects related to Hungarian Studies at Indiana University; and to house the Institute's impressive library of several thousand volumes of Hungarica. During the 2002/2003 academic year, the Institute was closed as a separate operation, while continuing to be administered by CEUS, which offers graduate degrees in Hungarian Studies. The significant collection of materials from the Institute’s Library and Archives was integrated into the Indiana University [[Herman B Wells]] Library collections.

===Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region===

Indiana University's Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region (CeLCAR) is one of fifteen current Language Resource Centers funded by the [[U.S. Department of Education]]’s Title VI grants. Additional support comes from the College of Arts and Sciences. The goal of CeLCAR is to enhance U.S. national capacity for teaching and learning the languages and cultures of Central Asia and surrounding regions. In 2008 the center was awarded a $100,000 grant from the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] to train U.S. government personnel in the history, cultures, and languages of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/6422.html IU receives grant to train Provincial Reconstruction Team commanders heading to Afghanistan] IU News Room, Indiana University.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">In [[pragmatics]], '''exophora''' is reference to something extralinguistic, i.e. '''not in the same text''', and contrasts with [[endophora]].  Exophora can be [[deixis|deictic]], in which special words or grammatical markings are used to make reference to something in the context of the utterance or speaker.  For example, [[pronoun]]s are often exophoric, with words such as "this", "that", "here", "there", as in ''that chair over there is John's'' said while indicating the direction of the chair referred to.  Given "Did the gardener water those plants?", it is quite possible that "those" refers back to the preceding text, to some earlier mention of those particular plants in the discussion.  But it is also possible that it refers to the environment in which the dialogue is taking place&amp;mdash;to the "context of situation", as it is called&amp;mdash;where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary.  The interpretation would be "those plants there, in front of us".  This kind of reference is called exophora, since it takes us outside the text altogether.  Exophoric reference is not [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesive]], since it does not bind the two elements together into a text.

==Homophora==
A type of exophora, homophora relates to a generic phrase that obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context; a specific example of homophora can variably be a "homophor" or a "homophoric reference".

For example, the meaning of the phrase ''"the Queen"'' may be determined by the country in which it is spoken. Because there are many Queens throughout the world, the location of the speaker provides the extra information that allows an individual Queen to be identified.

The precise origin of the term is not fully clear, but it is probably intended to suggest a [[referring expression]] that always has the same (Greek ''hómos'') referent (within a given cultural context, of course). "Homophoric" seems to have been first used in the influential book by M.A.K. Halliday and R. Hasan, ''Cohesion in English'' (Longman, 1976, pp. 71 and 73).

'''Family resemblance''' refers to physical similarities shared between close relatives, especially between [[parents]] and children and between [[siblings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abroadintheyard.com/dna-family-resemblance-across-generations/ Who Do You Look Like? DNA and Family Resemblance Across Generations]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the similarities of [[personality]] are also observed.

==Genetics==
[[Heritability]], defined as a measure of family resemblance, causes traits to be genetically passed from parents to offspring ([[heredity]]), allowing evolutionarily advantageous traits to persist through generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolinska B | title = Resemblance and investment in children | language = fr | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–90 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 22385106 | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2011.645482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay BL, Guénard F, Lamarche B, Pérusse L, Vohl MC | title = Familial resemblances in human whole blood transcriptome | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 300 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29703154 | pmc = 5921553 | doi = 10.1186/s12864-018-4698-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bochud M | title = Estimating heritability from nuclear family and pedigree data | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 850 | pages = 171–86 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22307699 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-555-8_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Princeton Guide to Evolution|last=Brodie|first=Edmond | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2014 |isbn=|location=|pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sharing parents, siblings do not inherit identical genes, making [[Twin study|studies on identical twins]] (who have identical DNA) especially effective at analyzing the role genetics play in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plomin R, Daniels D | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21807642 | pmc = 3147063 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have found that generational resemblance of many [[phenotypic trait]]s results from the inheritance of multiples genes that collectively influence a trait ([[Genetic variance|additive genetic variance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polderman TJ, Benyamin B, de Leeuw CA, Sullivan PF, van Bochoven A, Visscher PM, Posthuma D | title = Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies | language = En | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 7 | pages = 702–9 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25985137 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of heritability in personality traits. For example, one study found that approximately half of personality differences in high-school aged fraternal and identical twins were due to [[genetic variation]] - and another study suggests that no one personality trait is more heritable than another.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahern|first=Frank M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Ronald C.|last3=Wilson|first3=James R.|last4=McClearn|first4=Gerald E.|last5=Vandenberg|first5=Steven G. | name-list-format = vanc |date= May 1982 |title=Family resemblances in personality |journal=Behavior Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=261–280|doi=10.1007/bf01067847|issn=0001-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fat Leonard scandal''' is a corruption scandal and ongoing investigation within the [[United States Navy]] involving ship support contractor Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA), a subsidiary of the [[Glenn Marine Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig Whitlock, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fat-leonard-scandal-swells-three-more-navy-figures-charged/2016/05/27/2e1d7b0e-2442-11e6-aa84-42391ba52c91_story.html ‘Fat Leonard’ scandal swells; three more Navy figures charges], ''The Washington Post'' (May 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ManWhoSeduced"&gt;Craig Whitlock, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2016/05/27/the-man-who-seduced-the-7th-fleet/ The man who seduced the 7th Fleet], ''The Washington Post'' (May 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post'' called the scandal "perhaps the worst national-security breach of its kind to hit the Navy since the end of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name="ManWhoSeduced"/&gt; At the heart of the scandal was Glenn Defense Marine Asia, a firm run by playboy Leonard Glenn Francis,&lt;ref name="$35 million"/&gt; a [[Malaysia]]n national of Portuguese and Sri Lankan extraction. Six foot three inches tall, and weighing 350 pounds despite a stomach stapling, he was known as "Fat Leonard."&lt;ref name="ManWhoSeduced"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RS /&gt; Francis disbursed hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, travel expenses, luxury items, and prostitutes among a large number of U.S. uniformed officers of the [[United States Seventh Fleet]].&lt;ref name=RS /&gt; They in turn gave him classified material about the movements of U.S. ships and submarines, confidential contracting information, and information about active law enforcement investigations into Glenn Defense Marine Asia.&lt;ref name="ManWhoSeduced"/&gt; Francis then "exploited the intelligence for illicit profit, brazenly ordering his moles to redirect [[aircraft carrier]]s to ports he controlled in Southeast Asia so he could more easily bilk the Navy for fuel, tugboats, barges, food, water and sewage removal."&lt;ref name="ManWhoSeduced"/&gt; He also directed them to author "Bravo Zulu" memos, commending GDMA for doing supposed work "well done."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/questions/bzulu.html Bravo Zulu], ''[[U.S. Navy]]''. Retrieved July 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first activities of the conspiracy were confirmed to have existed in 2006 when Francis recruited numerous Navy personnel to engage in corruption, including directing contracts toward his firm, disfavoring competitors, and inhibiting legitimate fiscal and operational oversight. The initial co-conspirators labelled themselves "the cool kids" and "the wolf pack."&lt;ref name=USNINews&gt;[https://news.usni.org/2017/03/16/timeline-fat-leonard-case Timeline: Fat Leonard Case], ''[[U.S. Naval Institute]] News'', Cid Standifer, March 16, 2017. Retrieved July 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

U.S. federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against 33 people in connection with the Fat Leonard scandal. Of those, 21 pleaded guilty: Francis himself,&lt;ref name="censured" /&gt; four of his top aides, and 16 Navy officials (specifically, ten commissioned officers, two [[petty officer first class|petty officers]], one former [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]] special agent, and two civilian Navy contracting officials). Nine others are awaiting trial in [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. district court in San Diego]]. Separately, five Navy officers were charged with crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and have been subject to [[court-martial]] proceedings. An additional civilian pleaded guilty to a scandal-related crime in [[Singapore]] court.&lt;ref name="WaPoGraphic"/&gt;

Suffering health problems, Francis was hospitalized and released in March 2018. Rather than returning to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, he was granted a medical furlough and allowed to stay in San Diego at a private residence owned by one of his physicians, under 24-hour surveillance for which his family paid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/fat-leonard-is-ailing-and-the-feds-are-keeping-his-whereabouts-a-secret/2018/05/22/44a785fc-5d09-11e8-a4a4-c070ef53f315_story.html ‘Fat Leonard’ is ailing and the prosecutors are keeping his whereabouts a secret], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Craig Whitlock, May 22, 2018.

==Initiation and conduct of investigation== 
===Discounting whistleblower warnings===
In 2006, Dave Schauss, a NCIS investigator, became suspicious of GDMA contracts, but Francis was alerted by an informant, Paul Simpkins, to the scrutiny. Simpkins, a decorated veteran of the U.S. Air Force employed as a civilian contracting officer by the Navy in Singapore, managed to quash any inquiry and had Schauss' position eliminated.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/fat-leonards-crimes-on-the-high-seas-w517146 Fat Leonard's Crimes on the High Seas], ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', Jesse Hyde, March 11, 2018. Retrieved March 21, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; "What else could I have done to expose this racket?," Schauss asked. Exposed as a whistleblower, he said officers, "made my life hell" after discovering he had attempted to initiate an investigation of GDMA.&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt; In 2007, the Navy's Inspector General forwarded a document claiming GDMA was grossly overcharging the Navy for providing port security but NCIS may have failed to follow up the warning. According to a senior Navy officer, "Everybody knew that [Glenn Defense] had been under investigation." "Everybody also knew that nothing ever happened with those investigations." After that, the Manila NCIS office got an anonymous letter and documents, alleging GDMA had overcharged for fees, armed guards and other services during a [[Subic Bay, Philippines]] port visit by the [[USNS GySgt. Fred W. Stockham (T-AK-3017)|Fred Stockham]] container support ship. "I hope you share the same concern when reading these documents and take swift action to stamp out this fraud, waste and abuse," the letter said. Manila's NCIS agents forwarded the paperwork to the Navy's Singapore contracting office, but it had been infiltrated by GDMA's moles, and they claimed the allegations were false, closing the case. Mike Lang, a contracting officer who worked there from 2006 to 2008, said, "They'd always side with Glenn Defense and paint us as troublemakers. They'd say, 'Why are you harassing our contractors? You're making my job hard'." Two officials from that office, Simpkins and his subordinate, Sharon Gursharan Kaur who was also a civilian Navy contracting officer, as well as a former GDMA employee, were sentenced to six years and 33 months, respectively, the latter doing her time in Singapore.&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt; NCIS reportedly opened and closed as many as 27 investigations without taking action against GDMA, demonstrating a staggering level of incompetence while regularly traveling throughout South and Southeast Asia accomplishing nothing of significance.

===Tepid responses===
Documents obtained by the [[Washington Post]] via [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Requests]] (FOIAs) revealed that after [[al-Qaeda]] committed the October 2000 [[USS Cole bombing|suicide attack on the USS ''Cole'']] and the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Navy's Economic Crimes unit was reduced from a staff of 140 to only nine persons, most having been reassigned to focus on terrorism.&lt;ref name=RS /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt;  At least 27 separate investigations had been opened, but later closed without action, thanks to the intervention of senior Navy personnel who were in league with Francis.&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt; John Hogan, the NCIS executive assistant director for criminal operations, admitted, "In hindsight, maybe we could have dug a little deeper than we did."&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt; [[Ray Mabus]], who was appointed Navy Secretary by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2009, admitted his branch was vulnerable to contracting fraud and should have performed better oversight: "I'm not going to defend at all opening and closing 27 cases. Something should have raised a red flag along there somewhere...There were people inside the Navy who were trying to shut this down, who were coming up with reasons not to pursue it."&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt; In 2010, a civilian Navy attorney drafted restrictive ethics guidelines for the 7th Fleet. Two admirals friendly to Francis were said to be responsible for seeing that it was delayed and diluted over the next 2 1/2 years, before being implemented.&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt;

===Eventual actions===
In 2010, Navy officials became suspicious that some of the bills submitted by GDMA from Thailand were padded.&lt;ref name="captain"&gt;{{cite news|title=Navy captain admits providing classified info in massive bribery scheme |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us/navy-captain-admits-providing-classified-info-in-massive-bribery-scheme-1.324105 |work=Stars and Stripes |author=Tony Perry |date=January 15, 2015 |accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The escalating and somewhat unrestrained costs prompted the Navy to build a logistics team to keep contracts somewhat in check, but it was frustrated because Francis had a spy, Jose Luis Sanchez, feeding its information back to him.&lt;ref name="WhitlockDec2016" /&gt; (Sanchez has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and awaits sentencing.)

[[National University of Singapore]], corporate governance expert Mak Yuen Teen, noted that procurement in the defense industry is particularly vulnerable to bribery and corruption. "It is usually not that transparent," with infrequent bidding for large contracts. Blowing the whistle on superior officers might also be discouraged, he indicated. "Those at the top probably thought they could get away with it as their underlings were unlikely to squeal on them."

==Corruption prevention==
In February 2018, through Admiral Bill Moran, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, the navy announced the implementation of increased oversight and other measures and policies to deter a repeat of the widespread corruption in the "Fat Leonard" case. Glenn Fine, the principal deputy in the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, said the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of the DOD's OIG, said GDMA, Francis’ contract firm, created a scheme to defraud the Navy of tens of millions of dollars via overbilling for supplying goods and services. The Navy created a Consolidated Disposition Authority, or CDA, tasked with determining whether hundreds of Navy officers should be charged under the UCMJ, or alternatively, to be subjected to administrative actions. Fine said the CDA has already adjudicated 300-plus cases.

It was moved to the [[Château de Saint-Cloud|park of Saint-Cloud]] in 1900 when the palais de l'Industrie was demolished. The center group, composed of the three [[allegory|allegories]] (France, Art and Industry) is a work by sculptor [[Élias Robert]]. The two [[putto|putti]] groups located on its sides are by [[Georges Diebolt]]. The [[wreath]]s France was carrying in her hands and most of the rays of the [[radiant crown]] she wears have now disappeared.

==Iconographic precedents==
[[File:Le Louvre.JPG|thumb|East entrance of the Louvre]]
This sculpture is thought to have been inspired by [[Pierre Cartellier]]'s [[bas-relief]] ''Victory in a quadriga distributing wreaths'' (1810), at the East entrance of the [[Louvre]] palace, and to be a possible inspiration for the New York [[Statue of Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Trachtenberg, "The Statue of Liberty", New York : Penguin Books, 1977, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

A bas-relief on the same subject : ''France distributing wreaths to the Arts and Industry'', sculpted by [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Roman]] in 1830, is located on the wall behind the seat of the president of the National Assembly in the hemicycle of [[Palais Bourbon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/visite/7cfe.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, [[Georges Diebolt]] sculpted ''La France rémunératrice'' (Remunerative France), a colossal female figure wearing and distributing wreaths, for a ceremony of awards on the [[Champs-Élysées]], for the French industrialists who had been distinguished at the London [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Agulhon, "Marianne au Combat", Paris : Flammarion, 1979, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; A small size bronze reduction which was exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle of 1855]]&lt;ref&gt;Louis Gustave Vapereau, "Dictionnaire universel des contemporains", "Georges Diebolt", 1858, p.537&lt;/ref&gt; is now in [[Musée d'Orsay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photo.rmn.fr/cf/htm/CPicZ.aspx?E=2C6NU0HJ9TPL photography on photo.rmn.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12160">'''Augmentation''' of a [[global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) is a method of improving the navigation system's attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability, through the integration of external information into the calculation process. There are many such systems in place and they are generally named or described based on how the GNSS sensor receives the external information. Some systems transmit additional information about sources of error (such as [[clock drift]], [[ephemeris]], or [[ionospheric delay]]), others provide direct measurements of how much the signal was off in the past, while a third group provide additional vehicle information to be integrated in the calculation process.

== Satellite-based augmentation system ==
[[Image:SBAS Service Areas.png|thumb|300px|right|Service areas of satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS).]]
'''Satellite-based augmentation systems''' (SBAS) support wide-area or regional augmentation through the use of additional satellite-broadcast messages. Using measurements from the ground stations, correction messages are created and sent to one or more satellites for broadcast to end users as differential signal. SBAS is sometimes synonymous with WADGPS, wide-area [[DGPS]].&lt;ref&gt;Kee, C., Parkinson, B. W., and Axelrad, P. (1991), "Wide area differential GPS", Navigation, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, 38, 2 (Summer, 1991), &lt;http://ion.org/search/view_abstract.cfm?jp=j&amp;idno=207{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The GBAS and SBAS that have been implemented or proposed include:
*The [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), operated by the [[United States]] [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA).
*The [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), operated by the [[European Satellite Services Provider|ESSP]] (on behalf of [[EU]]'s [[European GNSS Agency|GSA]]).
*The [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS), operated by [[Japan]]'s [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport]] [[Japan Civil Aviation Bureau]] (JCAB).
*The [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System]] (QZSS), being implemented by Japan, scheduled to commence in November 2018.
*The [[GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation]] (GAGAN) system being operated by [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://isro.gov.in/pressrelease/scripts/pressreleasein.aspx?Jan03_2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gagan-system-ready-for-operations/article5565700.ece&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[GLONASS]] (System for Differential Correction and Monitoring, SDCM), operated by [[Russia]] with global coverage.
*The [[Satellite Navigation Augmentation System]] (SNAS), proposed by [[China]].
*The [[Wide Area GPS Enhancement]] (WAGE), operated by the [[United States Department of Defense]] for use by military and authorized receivers.
*The commercial [[StarFire (navigation system)|StarFire navigation system]], operated by [[Deere &amp; Company|John Deere]] and [[C-Nav]] Positioning Solutions ([[Oceaneering]]).
*The commercial [[Starfix DGPS System]] and [[OmniSTAR]] system, operated by [[Fugro]]
*The [[GPS·C]], short for GPS Correction, was a Differential GPS data source for most of Canada maintained by the Canadian Active Control System, part of [[Natural Resources Canada]] - now decommissioned.
*Australia and New Zealand have recently (2018) commenced R&amp;D into a second generation SBAS system (as yet unnamed) for their operational areas. Work is proceeding in using a multi frequency and multi constellation approach to reduce certain errors that first generation system like WAAS cannot handle. Also under research is using [[Precise Point Positioning]] as part of the design.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caa.govt.nz/nss/satellite-based-augmentation-system-sbas-development&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting system is expected to reliability produce multi centimetre accuracy fixes.

== Ground-based augmentation system ==

&lt;!--description--&gt;
'''Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS)''' provides [[Differential GPS]] (DGPS) corrections and integrity verification near an airport, replacing [[instrument landing system|ILS]]s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
Reference receivers in [[surveyed]] positions measure GPS deviations and calculate corrections emitted at 2 Hz through [[VHF Data Link|VHF data]] broadcast (VDB) within {{cvt|23|nmi|km}}.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
One GBAS supports up to 48 [[Final approach (aeronautics)|approach]]es and covers many [[runway]] ends with more installation flexibility than an ILS with localizer and glideslope antennas at each end.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
A GBAS can provide multiple approaches to reduce [[wake turbulence]] and improve [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]], maintaining [[availability]] and operations continuity.&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018/&gt;

&lt;!--first installations--&gt;
In December 2008, the [[New York Port Authority]] invested $2.5 million to install a GBAS at [[New York EWR]] with [[Continental Airlines|Continental]] (now [[United Airlines|United]]) equipping 15 aircraft for $1.1 million while the [[FAA]] committed $2.5 million to assess the technology.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
[[Honeywell]]’s SLS-4000 GBAS design was approved by the FAA in September 2009 and is still the only one.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
It offers Cat. 1 [[instrument landing]]s with a {{cvt|200|ft}} [[decision height]] and can be upgraded to a {{cvt|100|ft}} Cat. 2  with real-time monitoring of ionospheric conditions through SBAS, while the more precise Cat. 3 SLS-5000 is waiting for compatible airliners.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
The first installations were approved in EWR in 2012 and [[Houston / IAH]] in 2013.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
The Port Authority recommends a GBAS for [[New York JFK]] and [[LaGuardia]] (LGA) to alleviate congestion.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
Newark and Houston GBAS were upgraded to Cat. 2, [[Seattle-Tacoma]], San Francisco [[SFO]], JFK and LGA are expected next.&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018/&gt;

&lt;!--other installations--&gt;
Among the 20 Honeywell GBAS installations worldwide, the other U.S. installations are: Honeywell's test facility in [[Johnson County Executive Airport|Johnson County]], Kansas; the FAA Technical Center at [[Atlantic City Airport]], New Jersey; Boeing's test facility in [[Grant County International Airport|Grant County]], Washington; the B787 plant in [[Charleston International]], South Carolina; and [[Anoka County–Blaine Airport]] near Minneapolis.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
Airports equipped in Europe are [[Bremen Airport|Bremen]], [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]], [[Málaga Airport|Málaga]] and [[Zurich Airport|Zurich]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
in Asia-Pacific, airport with installations are [[Chennai Airport|Chennai]], [[Kuala Lumpur Airport|Kuala Lumpur]], [[Melbourne Airport|Melbourne]], [[Seoul-Gimpo]], [[Shanghai-Pudong]] and [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
Other locations are [[St. Helena Airport|St. Helena]] in the South Atlantic, [[Punta Cana Airport|Punta Cana]] in the Dominican Republic and [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
There are around 100 Cat. 1 GBAS landing systems (GLS) installations in [[Russia]] with Russian-specific technology.&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- US usage--&gt;
In the US, GBAS was previously known as the [[Local-area augmentation system]] while a [[satellite-based augmentation system|SBAS]] with a ground references network providing GPS corrections is called [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
In June 2016, the FAA ditched Cat. 1 GBAS as the WAAS has similar capabilities.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
In the US, there were more WAAS [[localizer performance with vertical guidance|LPV]] approaches reaching {{cvt|200|ft}} than Cat. 1 ILS approaches by March 2018.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
The FAA support airport installations but does not fund GBAS as of September 2018, as it analyses its [[cost-benefit]]s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
An installed Cat. 1 GBAS costs $3-4 million; and $700,000 more for Cat. 2.&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018/&gt;

&lt;!--airliners--&gt;
By Spring 2018, [[Boeing]] delivered 3,500 GLS-capable airliners, with 5,000 on order: GLS Cat. 2/3 is standard on the Boeing 747-8, 787 and 777 while GLS Cat. 1 is optional on the 737NG/MAX and GLS Cat. 2/3 will be offered from 2020.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
[[Airbus]] offers GLS Cat. 1 with [[autoland]] on the A320, A330, A350 and A380.&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018/&gt;

&lt;!--reception--&gt;
The FAA’s [[Next Generation Air Transportation System|NextGen]] promotes GBAS and GLS to increase airport capacity and to lower noise and weather delays.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
Boeing prefers FAA support than funding while the [[National Air Traffic Controllers Association]] argues rigid approaches will lower traffic management flexibility, losing throughput and capacity, a viewpoint shared by [[Delta Air Lines]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;--&gt;
Some [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] members vetter GBAS Approach Service Types-D (GAST-D) supporting Cat. 2/3 approach and landing.&lt;ref name=AvWeek11sep2018&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/gps-augmentation-airport-us-locales-lack-system |title= GPS Augmentation At The Airport, But U.S. Locales Lack System |date= Sep 11, 2018 |author= Bill Carey |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are stricter Safety requirements on GBAS systems relative to SBAS systems since GBAS is intended mainly for the landing phase where real-time accuracy and signal integrity control is critical, especially when weather deteriorates to the extent that there is no visibility (CAT-I/II/III conditions) for which SBAS is not intended or suitable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gps.gov/multimedia/presentations/2011/09/ICG/lawrence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Nationwide Differential GPS System (NDGPS) is an augmentation system for users on U.S. land and waterways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gps.gov/systems/augmentations/ US Government page on GPS augmentation systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aircraft-based augmentation system (ABAS) ==
The augmentation may also take the form of additional information from navigation sensors being blended into the position calculation, or internal algorithms that improve the navigation performance. Many times the additional [[avionics]] operate via separate principles than the GNSS and are not necessarily subject to the same sources of error or interference. A system such as this is referred to as an aircraft-based augmentation system (ABAS) by the ICAO. The most widely used form of ABAS is [[receiver autonomous integrity monitoring]] (RAIM), which uses redundant GPS signals to ensure the integrity of the position solution, and to detect faulty signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ICAO|title=Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Manual|date=2005|edition=First|url=http://www.icao.int/Meetings/PBN-Symposium/Documents/9849_cons_en%5b1%5d.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional sensors may include:
* [[LORAN#eLORAN|eLORAN]] receivers
* Automated [[celestial navigation]] systems
* [[Inertial navigation system]]s
* Simple [[dead reckoning]] systems (composed of a gyro compass and a distance measurement)

'''Galileo''' is the [[satellite navigation|global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) that is being created by the [[European Union]] (EU) through the [[European GNSS Agency]] (GSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On a Civil Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) between the European Community and its Member States and Ukraine|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/243190/7199.pdf|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The opening ceremony of GSA Agency´s headquarters was attended by VIPs in space activities &amp; satellite navigation|url=http://www.czechspaceportal.cz/en/section-7/news/the-opening-ceremony-of-gsa-agencys-headquarters-was-attended-by-vips-in-space-activities--satellite-navigation.html|work=www.czechspaceportal.cz|date=10 September 2012|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two ground operations centres, [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] near [[Munich]] in Germany and [[Fucine Lake|Fucino]] in Italy. The €10&amp;nbsp;billion project&lt;ref name=BREXIT&gt;{{cite web|title=Brexit is breaking up Europe’s €10 billion plan to launch a new constellation of satellites|url=https://qz.com/1264365/brexit-is-breaking-up-galileo-europes-e10-billion-plan-to-launch-new-satellites|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo navigational system enters testing stage|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,16304096,00.html|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is named after the Italian astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]]. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European nations do not have to rely on the Russian [[GLONASS]],  Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]] or U.S. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.esa.int/esaNA/GGG0H750NDC_galileo_0.html |title= Why Europe needs Galileo |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services will be free and open to everyone. The higher-precision capabilities will be available for paying commercial users. Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre precision, and better positioning services at higher [[latitude]]s than other positioning systems.
Galileo is also to provide a new global [[search and rescue]] (SAR) function as part of the [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme#MEOSAR|MEOSAR system]]. 

The first Galileo test [[satellite]], the [[GIOVE-A]], was launched 28 December 2005, while the [[List of Galileo satellites|first satellite]] to be part of the operational system was launched on 21 October 2011. As of July 2018, 26 of the planned 30 active satellites are in orbit.&lt;ref name="July 2018 Galileo Launch"&gt;{{cite web |title=New Satellite Launch Extends Galileo's Global Reach |url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/New_satellite_launch_extends_Galileo_s_global_reach |website=European Space Agency |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Four more satelites launched"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Galileo_launch_brings_navigation_network_close_to_completion/ |title= Galileo launch brings navigation network close to completion |date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galileo started offering Early Operational Capability (EOC) on 15 December 2016,&lt;ref name="operational"/&gt; providing initial services with a weak signal, and is expected to reach Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Galileo’s contribution to the MEOSAR system|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/space/galileo/sar/meosar-contribution/index_en.htm|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete 30-satellite Galileo system (24 operational and 6 active spares) is expected by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/satnav/galileo/satellite-launches/index_en.htm Launch of first 2 operational Galileo IOV Satellites] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001205023/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/satnav/galileo/satellite-launches/index_en.htm |date=1 October 2011 }}.

==History==
[[File:Nábřeží Kapitána Jaroše, budova Galileo.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Galileo system in [[Prague]]]]

===Main objectives===
In 1999, the different concepts of the three main contributors of [[ESA]]  (Germany, France and Italy)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/italy-and-germany-make-step-towards-galileo-satellit-219857/|title=Italy and Germany make step towards Galileo satellite navigation programme financing resolution|date=23 November 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Galileo were compared and reduced to one by a joint team of engineers from all three countries. The first stage of the Galileo programme was agreed upon officially on 26 May 2003 by the [[European Union]] and the [[European Space Agency]].
The system is intended primarily for civilian use, unlike the more military-oriented systems of the United States (GPS), Russia (GLONASS), and China (BeiDou-1/2). The European system will only be subject to shutdown for military purposes in extreme circumstances (like armed conflict).&lt;ref name="dublin.usembassy.gov"&gt;Christine Johnson [http://dublin.usembassy.gov/ireland/gps_galileo.html U.S., EU to Sign Landmark GPS-Galileo Agreement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121074828/http://dublin.usembassy.gov/ireland/gps_galileo.html |date=21 January 2012 }}. dublin.usembassy.gov. U.S.-EU Summit: County Clare 25–26 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It will be available at its full precision to both [[civilian|civil]] and [[military]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetrumpet.com/3092-eu-admits-military-use-for-galileo|title=EU Admits Military Use for Galileo|website=theTrumpet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; users. The countries that contribute most to the Galileo Project are [[German Aerospace Center|Germany]] and [[Italian Space Agency|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/20005_en.html|title=Italy and Germany reach agreement on Galileo contributions - News - CORDIS - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The [[European Commission]] had some difficulty funding the project's next stage, after several allegedly "per annum" sales projection graphs for the project were exposed in November 2001 as "cumulative" projections which for each year projected included all previous years of sales. The attention that was brought to this multibillion-euro growing error in sales forecasts resulted in a general awareness in the Commission and elsewhere that it was unlikely that the program would yield the [[return on investment]] that had previously been suggested to investors and decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Jagt, Culver "Galileo: The Declaration of European Independence" a presentation at the Royal Institute of Navigation 7 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2012}}
On 17 January 2002, a spokesman for the project stated that, as a result of US pressure and economic difficulties, "Galileo is almost dead."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sample [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/08/world.internationaleducationnews Europe and US clash on satellite system]. Guardian.co.uk. 8 December 2003. Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, however, the situation changed dramatically. European Union member states decided it was important to have a satellite-based positioning and timing infrastructure that the US could not easily turn off in times of political conflict.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Chalmers | last = Johnson | title = Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic | date = 2008 | publisher = Holt|page= 235|isbn=0-8050-8728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union and the European Space Agency agreed in March 2002 to fund the project, pending a review in 2003 (which was completed on 26 May 2003). The starting cost for the period ending in 2005 is estimated at €1.1&amp;nbsp;billion. The required satellites (the planned number is 30) were to be launched between 2011 and 2014, with the system up and running and under civilian control from 2019. The final cost is estimated at €3&amp;nbsp;billion, including the infrastructure on [[Earth]], constructed in 2006 and 2007. The plan was for private companies and investors to invest at least two-thirds of the cost of implementation, with the EU and ESA dividing the remaining cost. The base ''Open Service'' is to be available without charge to anyone with a Galileo-compatible [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], with an encrypted higher-bandwidth improved-precision ''Commercial Service'' available at a cost. By early 2011 costs for the project had run 50% over initial estimates.&lt;ref name="costoverruns" /&gt;

===Tension with the United States===
[[File:Galileo - Wolfowitz - Letter.jpg|thumb|A December 2001 letter from [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul Wolfowitz]] to the [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] of the [[Member State of the European Union|EU states]] as part of the US-[[lobbying]] campaign against Galileo]]

Galileo is intended to be an EU civilian GNSS that allows all users access to it. Initially [[GPS]] reserved the highest quality signal for military use, and the signal available for civilian use was intentionally degraded ([[Selective Availability]]). This changed with President [[Bill Clinton]] signing a policy directive in 1996 to turn off Selective Availability. Since May 2000 the same precision signal has been provided to both civilians and the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |title=GPS &amp; Selective Availability Q&amp;A |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921115614/http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Galileo was designed to provide the highest possible precision (greater than GPS) to anyone, the US was concerned that an enemy could use Galileo signals in military strikes against the US and its allies (some weapons like missiles use GNSSs for guidance). The frequency initially chosen for Galileo would have made it impossible for the US to block the Galileo signals without also interfering with its own GPS signals. The US did not want to lose their GNSS capability with GPS while denying enemies the use of GNSS. Some US officials became especially concerned when Chinese interest in Galileo was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_12_13/ai_n27579865 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628141723/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_12_13/ai_n27579865 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-06-28 |title=EU, U.S. split over Galileo M-code overlay |date=December 2002 |publisher=GPS World.

An anonymous EU official claimed that the US officials implied that they might consider shooting down Galileo satellites in the event of a major conflict in which Galileo was used in attacks against American forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/milspace-04zc.html|title=US Could Shoot Down EU Satellites if Used by Foes in Wartime|date=24 October 2004|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's stance is that Galileo is a neutral technology, available to all countries and everyone. At first, EU officials did not want to change their original plans for Galileo, but have since reached the compromise that Galileo is to use a different frequency. This allowed the blocking or jamming of either GNSS without affecting the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

====GPS and Galileo====
{{Comparison satellite navigation orbits}}
One of the reasons given for developing Galileo as an independent system was that position information from GPS can be made significantly inaccurate by the deliberate application of universal [[Selective Availability]] (SA) by the US military. GPS is widely used worldwide for civilian applications; Galileo's proponents argued that civil infrastructure, including airplane navigation and landing, should not rely solely upon a system with this vulnerability.

On 2 May 2000, SA was disabled by the President of the United States, [[Bill Clinton]]; in late 2001 the entity managing the GPS confirmed that they did not intend to enable selective availability ever again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/gps/policy/availability/index.cfm ''Selective Availability'']. Retrieved 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Selective Availability capability still exists, on 19 September 2007 the US Department of Defense announced that newer GPS satellites would not be capable of implementing Selective Availability;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11335 |title=DoD Permanently Discontinues Procurement of Global Positioning System Selective Availability |publisher=DefenseLink |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=17 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218050849/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11335 |archivedate=18 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
the wave of [[GPS Block IIF|Block IIF]] satellites launched in 2009, and all subsequent GPS satellites, are stated not to support SA. As old satellites are replaced in the [[GPS Block IIIA]] program, SA will cease to be an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/sa/|title=GPS.gov: Selective Availability|website=www.gps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modernisation programme also contains standardised features that allow GPS III and Galileo systems to inter-operate, allowing receivers to be developed to utilise GPS and Galileo together to create an even more accurate GNSS.

===Cooperation with the United States===
In June 2004, in a signed agreement with the United States, the European Union agreed to switch to a modulation known as BOC(1,1) ([[Binary Offset Carrier]] 1.1) allowing the coexistence of both GPS and Galileo, and the future combined use of both systems.

The European Union also agreed to address the "mutual concerns related to the protection of allied and US national security capabilities."&lt;ref name="dublin.usembassy.gov"/&gt;

===First experimental satellites: GIOVE-A and GIOVE-B===
The first experimental satellite, [[GIOVE-A]], was launched in December 2005 and was followed by a second test satellite, [[GIOVE-B]], launched in April 2008. After successful completion of the In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase, additional satellites were launched. On 30 November 2007 the 27 EU transport ministers involved reached an agreement that Galileo should be operational by 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7120041.stm |title= 'Unanimous backing' for Galileo |publisher=BBC |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later press releases suggest it was delayed to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/7&amp;language=en |title= Commission awards major contracts to make Galileo operational early 2014 |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding again, governance issues===
In mid-2006 the [[public-private partnership|public/private partnership]] fell apart, and the European Commission decided to nationalise the Galileo programme.&lt;ref name="insidegnss.com"&gt;http://www.insidegnss.com/node/1426 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112230642/http://www.insidegnss.com/node/1426 |date=12 January 2014 }} [[Inside GNSS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007 the EU had yet to decide how to pay for the system and the project was said to be "in deep crisis" due to lack of more public funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070511011357/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/05/08/galileo.troubles.ap/index.html EU: Galileo project in deep 'crisis']. CNN. 8 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; German Transport Minister [[Wolfgang Tiefensee]] was particularly doubtful about the consortium's ability to end the infighting at a time when only one testbed satellite had been successfully launched.

Although a decision was yet to be reached, on 13 July 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19750947/ MSN.com] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU countries discussed cutting €548m ($755m, £370m) from the union's competitiveness budget for the following year and shifting some of these funds to other parts of the financing pot, a move that could meet part of the cost of the union's Galileo satellite navigation system. European Union research and development projects could be scrapped to overcome a funding shortfall.

In November 2007, it was agreed to reallocate funds from the EU's agriculture and administration budgets&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225004015/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1195858921.15 EU agrees 2008 budget to include Galileo financing].

In April 2008, the EU transport ministers approved the Galileo Implementation Regulation. This allowed the €3.4bn to be released from the EU's agriculture and administration budgets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7335833.stm | work=BBC News | title=Galileo legal process ticks over | date=7 April 2008 | accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the issuing of contracts to start construction of the ground station and the satellites.

In June 2009, the [[European Court of Auditors]] published a report, pointing out governance issues, substantial delays and budget overruns that led to project stalling in 2007, leading to further delays and failures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/2760294.PDF European Court of Auditors – Special Report on the management of the Galileo programme's development and validation phase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128132057/http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/2760294.PDF |date=28 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the [[European Commission]] cut the number of satellites definitively planned from 28 to 22, with plans to order the remaining six at a later time. It also announced that the first OS, PRS and SoL signal would be available in 2013, and the CS and SOL some time later. The €3.4&amp;nbsp;billion budget for the 2006–2013 period was considered insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/Gal102609.xml&amp;headline=Europe%20Cuts%20Galileo%20Sats%20Order Europe Cuts Galileo Sats Order].

Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the think-tank Open Europe estimated the total cost of Galileo from start to 20 years after completion at €22.2 billion, borne entirely by taxpayers. Under the original estimates made in 2000, this cost would have been €7.7 billion, with €2.6 billion borne by taxpayers and the rest by private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease |url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/media-centre/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=142 |title=The EU's Galileo satellite project could cost UK taxpayers £2.6 billion more than originally planned |date=17 October 2010 |publisher=openeurope.org.uk |accessdate=24 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719162515/http://www.openeurope.org.uk/media-centre/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=142 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, a ground station for Galileo was inaugurated near [[Kourou]] ([[French Guiana]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMYN6TP82G_galileo_0.html|title=Inauguration of site of Galileo station at Kourou|first=|last=esa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the first four in-orbit validation (IOV) satellites was planned for the second half of 2011, and the launch of full operational capability (FOC) satellites was planned to start in late 2012.

In March 2010 it was verified that the budget for Galileo would only be available to provide the 4 IOV and 14 FOC satellites by 2014, with no funds then committed to bring the constellation above this 60% capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/civil/100310-initial-galileo-validation-satellites-delayed.html Initial Galileo Validation Satellites Delayed]. Spacenews.com (10 March 2010). Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Verhoef, the satellite navigation program manager at the European Commission, indicated that this limited funding would have serious consequences commenting at one point "To give you an idea, that would mean that for three weeks in the year you will not have satellite navigation" in reference to the proposed 18-vehicle constellation.

In July 2010, the European Commission estimated further delays and additional costs of the project to grow up to €1.5-€1.7 billion, and moved the estimated date of completion to 2018. After completion the system will need to be subsidised by governments at €750 million per year.&lt;ref name="sp"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,721761,00.html |title=EU Expects Galileo Project Costs to Explode |publisher=Spiegel |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional €1.9 billion was planned to be spent bringing the system up to the full complement of 30 satellites (27 operational + 3 active spares).&lt;ref name="costoverruns"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taverna|first=Michael A.|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/awst/2011/01/24/AW_01_24_2011_p39-284139.xml|newspaper=Aviation Weekly|title=Completing Galileo To Cost $2.5 Billion|date=1 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM4JMSRJHG_index_1.html#subhead5 |title= Galileo's navigation control hub opens in Fucino |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, EU ministers in Brussels voted [[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]], as the headquarters of the Galileo project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/prague_galileo_agency/2245066.html Prague To Host EU Satellite Navigation Agency] – Radio Free Europe, 13 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, infrastructure costs up to 2020 were estimated at €5.3&amp;nbsp;billion. In that same month, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Wikileaks revealed]] that Berry Smutny, the CEO of the German satellite company [[OHB-System]], said that Galileo "is a stupid idea that primarily serves French interests".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110114200247/http://www.aftenposten.no/spesial/wikileaksdokumenter/article3985655.ece OHB-System CEO Calls Galileo a Waste of German Tax Payer Money] Date 22 October 2009.

===Clock failures===

In January 2017, news agencies reported that six of the passive [[hydrogen maser]] and three of the [[Rubidium standard|rubidium]] [[atomic clock]]s had failed. Four of the full operational satellites have each lost at least one clock; but no satellite has lost more than two. The operation of the constellation has not been affected as each satellite is launched with three spare clocks. The possibility of a systemic flaw is being considered.&lt;ref name="clock failures2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Galileo_clock_anomalies_under_investigation|title=Galileo clock anomalies under investigation|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=19 January 2017|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/atomic-clocks-failed-onboard-galileo-navigation-satellites-103538395.html| title=Atomic clocks 'failed' onboard Galileo navigation satellites| date=18 January 2017| accessdate=19 January 2017| publisher=Agence France-Presse AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clock failures"/&gt;

Additionally some refurbishment is required for the rubidium atomic clocks that still have to be launched. For the passive hydrogen masers operational measures are being studied to reduce the risk of failure.&lt;ref name="clock failures2"/&gt; China and India use the same SpectraTime-built atomic clocks in their satellite navigation systems. ESA has contacted the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) who initially reported not having experienced similar failures.&lt;ref name="clock failures3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clock failures"/&gt; However, at the end of January 2017, Indian news outlets reported that all three clocks aboard the IRNSS-1A satellite (launched in July 2013 with a 10-year life expectancy) had failed and that a replacement satellite would be launched in the second half of 2017, these atomic clocks were said to be supplied under a four-million-euro deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://defencenews.in/article/ISRO-readies-replacement-satellite-after-clock-failure-283932|title=ISRO readies replacement satellite after clock failure|website=defencenews.in|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/isro-irnss-1h-readies-replacement-satellite-irnss-1h-after-clock-failure-4818259/|title=ISRO readies replacement satellite after clock failure|date=2017-08-29|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Atomic-clocks-on-indigenous-navigation-satellite-develop-snag/article17114134.ece|title=Atomic clocks on indigenous navigation satellite develop snag|last=D.S.|first=Madhumathi|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/103934/atomic-clock-rubidium-irnss/|title=3 Atomic Clocks Fail Onboard India's 'Regional GPS' Constellation|last=Mukunth|first=Vasudevan|website=thewire.in|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
The Galileo system will have five main services:
;Open access navigation: This will be available without charge for use by anyone with appropriate mass-market equipment; simple timing, and positioning down to 1 metre.
;Commercial navigation (encrypted): Accuracy to 1 centimetre and guaranteed service for which service providers will charge fees.
;Safety of life navigation: Open service; for applications where guaranteed precision is essential. Integrity messages will warn of errors.
;Public regulated navigation (encrypted): Continuous availability even if other services  are disabled in time of crisis. Government agencies will be main users.
;Search and rescue: System will pick up distress beacon locations; feasible to send feedback, e.g. confirming help is on its way.

Other secondary services will also be available.

===Concept===
[[File:ESA Galileo Passive Hydrogen Maser.jpg|thumb|Space Passive Hydrogen Maser used in Galileo satellites as a master clock for an onboard timing system]]

Each Galileo satellite has two master passive [[hydrogen maser]] [[atomic clock]]s and two secondary [[Rubidium standard|rubidium]] atomic clocks which are independent of one other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectratime.com/products/ispace/passive-maser/|title=Passive Hydrogen Maser (PHM)|work=spectratime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectratime.com/products/ispace/rb/|title=Rb Atomic Frequency Standard (RAFS)|work=spectratime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a [[nanosecond]] or 1 billionth of a second (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1,000,000,000&lt;/sub&gt; s) translates into a {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on|1|lk=on}} positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate the time that it takes the signal to reach it.&lt;ref name="Galileo’s clocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Galileo/Galileo_s_clocks|title=Galileo's clocks|publisher=European Space Agency|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About errors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/What_about_errors|title=What about errors|publisher=European Space Agency|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clock failures"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38664225|title=Galileo satellites experiencing multiple clock failures|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|date=17 January 2017|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by [[Trilateration|trilaterating]] the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.

The onboard passive hydrogen maser and rubidium clocks are very stable over a few hours. If they were left to run indefinitely, though, their timekeeping would drift, so they need to be synchronized regularly with a network of even more stable ground-based reference clocks. These include active hydrogen maser clocks and clocks based on the caesium frequency standard, which show a far better medium and long-term stability than rubidium or passive hydrogen maser clocks. These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffhofen Galileo Control Centres. The ground based clocks also generate a worldwide time reference called Galileo System Time (GST), the standard for the Galileo system and are routinely compared to the local realizations of UTC, the UTC(k) of the European frequency and time laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectratime.com/uploads/pdfs/gstpg_ptti06.pdf|title=38th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Meeting GALILEO SYSTEM TIME PHYSICAL GENERATION|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Search and rescue ==
Galileo is to provide a new global [[search and rescue]] (SAR) function as part of the [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme#MEOSAR|MEOSAR system]]. Satellites will be equipped with a transponder which will relay distress signals from [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|emergency beacons]] to the [[Rescue coordination centre]], which will then initiate a rescue operation. At the same time, the system is projected to provide a signal, the Return Link Message (RLM), ''to'' the emergency beacon, informing them that their situation has been detected and help is on the way. This latter feature is new and is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme|Cospas-Sarsat system]], which does not provide feedback to the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.esa.int/esaNA/GGGMX650NDC_galileo_0.html |title= What is Galileo? |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests in February 2014 found that for Galileo's [[search and rescue]] function, operating as part of the existing International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, 77% of simulated distress locations can be pinpointed within 2&amp;nbsp;km, and 95% within 5&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsdaily.com/reports/Galileo_works_and_works_well_999.html|title=Galileo works, and works well|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galileo satellite test beds: GIOVE===
{{Main|GIOVE}}
[[File:Giovea.jpg|thumb|[[GIOVE#GIOVE-A|GIOVE-A]] was successfully launched 28 December 2005]]
In 2004 the Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1) project validated the on-ground algorithms for Orbit Determination and Time Synchronisation (OD&amp;amp;TS). This project, led by ESA and [[European Satellite Navigation Industries]], has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the Galileo positioning system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEM6KYP3K3E_index_0.html Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 experimentation is now complete], ESA News release, 7 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[GIOVE|GIOVE-A]] is the first GIOVE ([[GIOVE|Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element]]) test satellite. It was built by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]] (SSTL), and successfully launched on 28 December 2005 by the European Space Agency and the Galileo Joint. Operation of GIOVE-A ensured that Galileo meets the frequency-filing allocation and reservation requirements for the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), a process that was required to be complete by June 2006.
* [[GIOVE|GIOVE-B]], built by [[Astrium]] and [[Thales Alenia Space]], has a more advanced payload than GIOVE-A. It was successfully launched on 27 April 2008 at 22:16 [[UTC]] (4.16&amp;nbsp;am [[Baikonur]] time) aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]]/[[Fregat]] rocket provided by [[Starsem]].

A third satellite, [[GIOVE|GIOVE-A2]], was originally planned to be built by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd|SSTL]] for launch in the second half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM8LNN0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE-A2 to secure the Galileo programme], ESA News release, 5 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of [[GIOVE|GIOVE-A2]] was terminated due to the successful launch and in-orbit operation of [[GIOVE|GIOVE-B]].

The [[GIOVE Mission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMWL4N0LYE_index_0.html GIOVE mission core infrastructure], ESA press release, 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaNA/SEMUGJRMTWE_galileo_0.html One year of Galileo signals; new website opens], ESA press release, 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; segment operated by [[European Satellite Navigation Industries]] used the [[GIOVE|GIOVE-A/B]] satellites to provide experimental results based on real data to be used for risk mitigation for the IOV satellites that followed on from the testbeds. [[European Space Agency|ESA]] organised the global network of ground stations to collect the measurements of [[GIOVE|GIOVE-A/B]] with the use of the GETR receivers for further systematic study. GETR receivers are supplied by [[Septentrio]] as well as the first Galileo navigation receivers to be used to test the functioning of the system at further stages of its deployment. Signal analysis of [[GIOVE|GIOVE-A/B]] data confirmed successful operation of all the Galileo signals with the tracking performance as expected.

===In-Orbit Validation (IOV) satellites===
These testbed satellites were followed by four IOV Galileo satellites that are much closer to the final Galileo satellite design. The Search &amp; Rescue feature is also installed.&lt;ref&gt;Galileo IOV Satellites. (2014, November 3). Navipedia, . Retrieved 21:22, May 1, 2015 from http://navipedia.net/index.php?title=Galileo_IOV_Satellites&amp;oldid=13446.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two satellites were launched on 21 October 2011 from [[Guiana Space Centre]] using a [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre|Soyuz]] launcher,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/262547/soyuz-carrying-galileo-satellites-launched Soyuz carrying Galileo satellites launched].

On 12 March 2013, a first fix was performed using those four IOV satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Galileo_fixes_Europe_s_position_in_history|title=Galileo fixes Europe's position in history|first=|last=esa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase has been completed, the remaining satellites will be installed to reach the Full Operational Capability.

===Full Operational Capability (FOC) satellites===
{{Main article|List of Galileo satellites}}
On 7 January 2010, it was announced that the contract to build the first 14 FOC satellites was awarded to [[OHB System]] and [[Surrey Satellite Technology|Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL)]].
Fourteen satellites will be built at a cost of €566M (£510M; $811M).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8442090.stm |title=EU awards Galileo satellite-navigation contracts |newspaper= [[BBC News]] | first=Jonathan |last=Amos |date=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Arianespace]] will launch the satellites for a cost of €397M (£358M; $569M).
The European Commission also announced that the €85 million contract for system support covering industrial services required by [[European Space Agency|ESA]] for integration and validation of the Galileo system had been awarded to [[Thales Alenia Space]]. Thales Alenia Space subcontract performances to [[EADS Astrium|Astrium GmbH]] and security to [[Thales Group|Thales Communications]].

In February 2012, an additional order of eight satellites was awarded to OHB Systems for €250M ($327M), after outbidding EADS Astrium tender offer. Thus bringing the total to 22 FOC satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/01/eu-satellite-contract-idUSL5E8D14XW20120201 |title=UPDATE 1-OHB beats EADS to Galileo satellite contract -sources |newspaper= [[Reuters]] | first=Charlie |last=Dunmore |date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second generation (G2G) satellites===
As of 2014, ESA and its industry partners have begun studies on Galileo Second Generation satellites, which will be presented to the EC for the late 2020s launch period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Electric_thrusters_may_steer_Galileo_in_future|title=Electric thrusters may steer Galileo in future|first=|last=esa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One idea is to employ [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]], which would eliminate the need for an upper stage during launch and allow satellites from a single batch to be inserted into more than one orbital plane.

==Applications and impact==

===Science projects using Galileo===
In July 2006 an international consortium of universities and research institutions embarked on a study of potential scientific applications of the Galileo constellation. This project, named GEO6,&lt;ref name="gnss-geo6.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnss-geo6.org/|title=gnss-geo6.org|publisher=|access-date=5 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213175442/http://www.gnss-geo6.org/|archive-date=13 February 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a broad study oriented to the general scientific community, aiming to define and implement new applications of Galileo.

Among the various GNSS users identified by the Galileo Joint Undertaking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galileoju.com|title=Galileoju.com|website=Galileoju.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GEO6,&lt;ref name="gnss-geo6.org" /&gt; project addresses the Scientific User Community (UC).

The GEO6&lt;ref name="gnss-geo6.org" /&gt; project aims at fostering possible novel applications within the scientific UC of GNSS signals, and particularly of Galileo.

The AGILE&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galileo-in-lbs.com/ galileo-in-lbs.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606235159/http://www.galileo-in-lbs.com/ |date=6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; project is an EU-funded project devoted to the study of the technical and commercial aspects of [[Location-based service|location-based services (LBS)]]. It includes technical analysis of the benefits brought by Galileo (and EGNOS) and studies the hybridisation of Galileo with other positioning technologies (network-based, WLAN, etc.). Within these project, some pilot prototypes were implemented and demonstrated.

On the basis of the potential number of users, potential revenues for Galileo Operating Company or Concessionaire (GOC), international relevance, and level of innovation, a set of Priority Applications (PA) will be selected by the consortium and developed within the time-frame of the same project.

These applications will help to increase and optimise the use of the [[EGNOS]] services and the opportunities offered by the Galileo Signal Test-Bed (GSTB-V2) and the Galileo (IOV) phase.

===Coins===
[[File:2006 Austria 25 Euro European Satellite Navigation back.jpg|thumb|Austrian €25 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2006 coinage|European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin]], back]]

The European Satellite Navigation project was selected as the main motif of a very high-value collectors' coin: the Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2006 coinage|European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin]], minted on 1 March 2006. The coin has a silver ring and gold-brown [[niobium]] "pill". In the reverse, the niobium portion depicts navigation satellites orbiting the Earth. The ring shows different modes of transport, for which satellite navigation was developed: an airplane, a car, a lorry, a train and a container ship.

Until late 2018, GNSS was not authorized for use in the United States, and as such, only variably worked on devices that could receive Galileo signals, within United States territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@sjbarbeau/where-is-the-world-is-galileo-6bb7bfa29e|title=Where is the world is Galileo?|last=Barbeau|first=Sean|date=2018-10-25|website=Sean Barbeau|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Communications Commission's position on the matter was (and remains) that non-GPS radio navigation satellite systems (RNSS) receivers must be granted a license to receive said signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://insidegnss.com/official-foreign-gnss-signals-need-fcc-authorization-for-use-in-united-states/|title=Official: Foreign GNSS Signals Need FCC Authorization for Use in United States - Inside GNSS|date=2014-12-16|work=Inside GNSS|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A waiver of this requirement for Galileo was requested by the EU and submitted in 2015, and on January 6, 2017, public comment on the matter was requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0106/DA-17-18A1.pdf|title=FCC Public Notice, docket 17-16|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2018, the FCC granted the requested waiver, explicitly allowing non-federal consumer devices to access Galileo E1 and E5 frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18097154/fcc-ajit-pai-gps-location-accuracy-galileo|title=FCC paves the way for improved GPS accuracy|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-355098A1.pdf|title=FCC APPROVES USE OF GALILEO GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES|last=Grace|first=Neil|date=2018-11-15|website=FCC.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giovanni Pontiero''' (10 February 1932 – 10 February 1996) was a British scholar and  translator of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] fiction, most notably the works of [[José Saramago]]. His translation of the Saramago work ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' was awarded the [[Teixeira-Gnomes Prize|Teixeira-Gomes Prize for Portuguese translation]].

Pontiero was born in Glasgow and graduated from the university of Glasgow in 1960. In 1962 he was appointed lecturer in Latin American studies at Manchester. He was later promoted to senior lecturer and finally Reader in [[Latin-American Literature]] in the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] until his retirement in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-giovanni-pontiero-1341546.html|accessdate=2011-06-09|publisher=Independent (The)|title=Giovanni Pontiero|author=Griffin, Nigel|location=London|date=11 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the principal translator into [[English language|English]] of the works of [[Clarice Lispector]], and met acclaim for his translation of Lispector's ''[[The Hour of the Star|A Hora da Estrela]]'', known in English as ''[[The Hour of the Star]]''.  He was amongst those to note [[Pandeism]] to be an influence on the writings of noted mid-twentieth-century [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] poet [[Carlos Nejar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Not a pantheist poetry, but pandeist. I want to say, a cosmogony, one I sing generally, a [[chansonnier]] of the human being and the holy ghost. But the holy ghost in the human being.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pontiero is known for saying, "Encounters with the animal world are frequent in Lispector’s stories. Untouched by human contradictions, animals are more alive because they are more secure than human beings."

Giovanni Pontiero's papers are held by the [[John Rylands Library]], [[University of Manchester]].

'''Hallstatt''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhalʃtat|lang}}; [[Central Bavarian]]: ''Hoistod'') is a small town in the district of [[Gmunden District|Gmunden]], in the [[Austria]]n state of  [[Upper Austria]].  
Situated between the southwestern shore of [[Hallstätter See]] and the steep slopes of the [[Dachstein]] massif, the town lies in [[Salzkammergut]] region, on the national road linking [[Salzburg]] and [[Graz]]. 

Hallstatt is known for its [[Salt mining|production of salt]], dating back to prehistoric times, and gave its name to the [[Hallstatt culture]], the archaeological culture  linked to [[Proto-Celtic]] and early [[Celts|Celtic]]  people of the [[Iron Age Europe|Early Iron Age]] in Europe, c.800–450 BC. 

Hallstatt is at the core of the "[[Hallstatt-Dachstein/Salzkammergut Cultural Landscape]]" declared as one of the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Austria|World Heritage Sites in Austria]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1997.

==History==
{{see also|Hallstatt Museum}}

===Iron Age===
In 1846, [[Johann Georg Ramsauer]] (1795–1874) discovered a large [[Grave field|prehistoric cemetery]] at the Salzberg mines near Hallstatt ({{coor|47.561|N|13.642|E|}}), which he excavated during the second half of the 19th century. Eventually the excavation would yield 1,045 burials, although no settlement has yet been found.  This may be covered by the later village, which has long occupied the whole narrow strip between the steep hillsides and the lake.  

Some 1,300 burials have been found, including around 2,000 individuals, with women and children but few infants.&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, 26 &lt;/ref&gt; Nor is there a "princely" burial, as often found near large settlements.  Instead, there are a large number of burials varying considerably in the number and richness of the grave goods, but with a high proportion containing goods suggesting a life well above subsistence level. 
[[File:Dominic Groebner Hans Reschreiter NHM Wien Abb Salz-Reich 2008 Seite 67 1.tif|thumb|Section of the Iron Age Hallstatt salt workings]]
The community at Hallstatt exploited the [[salt mine]]s in the area, which had been worked from time to time since the [[Neolithic]] period, from the 8th to 5th centuries BC. The style and decoration of the grave goods found in the cemetery are very distinctive, and artifacts made in this style are widespread in [[Europe]]. In the mine workings themselves, the salt has preserved many organic materials such as textiles, wood and leather, and many abandoned artefacts such as shoes, pieces of cloth, and tools including miner's backpacks, have survived in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finds at Hallstatt extend from about 1200 BC until around 500 BC, and are divided by archaeologists into four phases:

[[File:Museum Hallstatt 35.JPG|thumb|"Antenna hilt" Hallstatt 'D' swords, from Hallstatt]]
Hallstatt A-B are part of the [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] [[Urnfield culture]]. Phase A saw [[Villanova culture|Villanovan]] influence. In this period, people were cremated and buried in simple graves. In phase B, [[tumulus]] (barrow or [[kurgan]]) burial becomes common, and [[cremation]] predominates. Little is known about this period in which the typical Celtic elements have not yet distinguished themselves from the earlier Villanova-culture.
The "Hallstatt period" proper is restricted to HaC and HaD (8th to 5th centuries BC), corresponding to the early [[European Iron Age]]. Hallstatt lies in the area where the western and eastern zones of the Hallstatt culture meet, which is reflected in the finds from there.&lt;ref&gt;Koch&lt;/ref&gt;  Hallstatt D is succeeded by the [[La Tène culture]].

Hallstatt C is characterized by the first appearance of iron swords mixed amongst the bronze ones. Inhumation and cremation co-occur.
For the final phase, Hallstatt D, daggers, almost to the exclusion of swords, are found in western zone graves ranging from c. 600–500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, 40&lt;/ref&gt; There are also differences in the pottery and [[brooch]]es. Burials were mostly inhumations.  Halstatt D has been further divided into the sub-phases D1-D3, relating only to the western zone, and mainly based on the form of brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Major activity at the site appears to have finished about 500 BC, for reasons that are unclear. Many Hallstatt graves were robbed, probably at this time. There was widespread disruption throughout the western Hallstatt zone, and the salt workings had by then become very deep.&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; By then the focus of salt mining had shifted to the nearby [[Hallein Salt Mine]], with graves at [[Dürrnberg]] nearby where there are significant finds from the late Hallstatt and early La Tène periods.  

Much of the material from early excavations was dispersed,&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, 26&lt;/ref&gt; and is now found in many collections, especially German and Austrian museums, but the [[Hallstatt Museum]] in the town has the largest collection.

===Romans onwards===
There are no recorded notable events that took place in Hallstatt during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule or the early [[Middle Ages]]. In 1311, the Hallstatt citizens were vested with [[market rights]] by Queen dowager [[Elizabeth of Carinthia, Queen of Germany|Elizabeth]], a sign that it had not lost its economic value. Today, apart from production of salt, which since 1595 has been transported 40 kilometres from Hallstatt to [[Ebensee]] via a [[brine pipeline]], [[tourism]] plays a major factor in the town's economic life. 

Tourists are told that Hallstatt is the site of "the world's oldest pipeline",&lt;ref&gt;Neal Bedford, Gemma Pitcher. ''Austria''. Lonely Planet, 2005. Page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; which was constructed 400 years ago from 13,000 hollowed-out trees.&lt;ref name="virtual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/billie/hallstatt/hallstatt.html |title=Hallstatt's White Gold - Salt |accessdate=2007-05-15 |author=Billie Ann Lopez |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work=Virtual Vienna Net |publisher=Silvia McDonald &amp; Fritz Froemel |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210142713/http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/billie/hallstatt/hallstatt.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is so little space for cemeteries that every ten years bones used to be exhumed and removed into an [[ossuary]], to make room for new burials.&lt;ref name="virtual"/&gt; A collection of elaborately decorated skulls with the deceased's name, profession, date of death inscribed on them is on display at the local chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Matys, Simon.

===19th century===
[[File:Hallstatt 1899. pogled sa sjevera.jpg|thumb|View of Hallstatt in 1899]]
Until the late 19th century, it was only possible to reach Hallstatt by boat or via narrow [[trail]]s. The land between the lake and mountains was sparse, and the town itself exhausted every free patch of it. Access between houses on the river bank was by boat or over the ''upper path'', a small corridor passing through attics. The first road to Hallstatt was only built in 1890, along the west shore, partially by rock blasting.  Nevertheless, this secluded and inhospitable landscape counts as one of the first places of [[human]] settlement due to the rich sources of natural [[salt]], which have been mined for thousands of years, originally in the shape of hearts owing to the use of [[antler]] picks.&lt;ref name="virtual"/&gt; 

Some of Hallstatt's oldest archaeological finds, such as a [[shoe-last celt]], date back to around 5500 BC. In 1846 [[Johann Georg Ramsauer]] discovered a large [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[cemetery]] near the current location of Hallstatt.  Ramsauer's work at the Hallstatt cemeteries continued until 1863, unearthing more than 1000 burials.  It is to his credit and to the enormous benefit of archaeology that he proceeded to excavate each one with the same slow, methodical care as the first.  

His methods included measuring and drawing each find. In an age before colour photography, he produced very detailed watercolours of each assemblage before it was removed from the ground.  In the history of archaeology Ramsauer's work at Hallstatt helped usher in a new, more systematic way of doing archaeology.  In addition, one of the first [[blacksmith]] sites was excavated there. Active [[trade]], and thus wealth, allowed for the development of a highly developed culture, which, after findings in the Salzberghochtal, was named the [[Hallstatt culture]]. This lasted from approximately 800 to 500 BC.

'''Hegemon of [[Thasos]]''' ({{lang-el|Ἡγήμων ό Θάσιος}}) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] writer of the [[Old Comedy]]. Hardly anything is known of him, except that he flourished during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. According to [[Aristotle]] (''Poetics'', ii. 5) he was the inventor of a kind of [[parody]]; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. When the news of the disastrous defeat of the [[Sicilian Expedition]] reached [[Athens]], his parody of the ''[[Gigantomachy|Gigantomachia]]'' was being performed: it is said that the audience were so amused by it that, instead of leaving to show their grief, they remained in their seats. He was also the author of a comedy called ''Philinne'' (Philine), written in the manner of [[Eupolis]] and [[Cratinus]], in which he attacked a well-known [[courtesan]]. [[Athenaeus]] (p.&amp;nbsp;698), who preserves some parodic [[hexameter]]s of his, relates other anecdotes concerning him (pp.&amp;nbsp;5, 108, 407).

==Criticisms==
In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics]]'', Aristotle states: ''[[Homer]], for example, makes men better than they are; [[Cleophon (poet)|Cleophon]] as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the inventor of parodies, and [[Nicochares]], the author of the [[Diliad]], worse than they are.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.html |title=Poetics |author=Aristotle |date=350 B.C.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pucara de Chena.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chena Pukara]]
'''Huaca de Chena''', also known as the '''Chena Pukara''', is an [[Inca]] site on [[Chena Mountain]], in the basin of [[San Bernardo, Chile|San Bernardo]], commune of [[Calera de Tango]], [[Maipo Province]], [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/oaiart? Codigo=2209769 Concerning(Around) The symbolism of the Pucará of Chena - Dialnet]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tala Canta Ilabe]] was the last Inca who celebrated [[Inti Raymi]] in its [[Ushnu]].

The word ''Chena'' means [[cougar|puma]] in [[estrous cycle]] in the [[Quechuan language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceapucara.blogspot.com/2007/11/el-cerro-chena.html C.E.A. Indian fortress: The Hill Chena]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
{{see also|Incas in Central Chile}}
Constructed during the [[Inca Empire|domination]] of the [[Qullasuyu]], the fortress of [[Chena Mountain]] is located at Cucará Point, up to where one accedes for the Catemito Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanbernardo.cl/index.php? Option=com_content*task=view*id=130*Itemid=49 San Bernardo's Municipality(Corporated town) - Indian fortress of the Chena Hill ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[archeologist]] [[Rubén Stehberg]] published the report "Chena's Fortress and its relation with the inca occupation of central Chile".&lt;ref&gt;Stehberg Ruben, La Fortaleza de Chena y su relación con la ocupación incaica de Chile central. Occasional publication N ° 23, História Natural's National Museum, Santiago, Chile, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The topographic raising that the engineer [[Hans Niemeyer]]  realised at it, emphasised the needings of a researcher in [[archaeology]].

== Architecture ==
This fortress possesses a set of nine enclosures placed in the summit of the hill and of two defensive walls of surrounding. The first approximation to a new interpretation, was published in 1991. This one points that the perimeter of the walls of the pucara, it suggests the form of an animal, possibly a [[Felidae|feline]].&lt;ref&gt;Article in Magazine 21st century, Diary The Mercury of Santiago," Astronomic Archaeology, Astronomers Before Illapel " (September 5, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; And the defensive walls would not be such but three areas of the [[Inca]] [[Inca religion|cosmovision]] .

== Form of a feline as Cuzco's City ==

This form similar to an animal (unique in Chile), is similar to the figure of a [[cougar|puma]] that was represented in the plant of the cardinal city of [[Inca Empire]], [[Cusco]].

Sarmiento de Gamboa &lt;ref&gt;Sarmiento de Gamboa[, Pedro. 1999. History of the Incas. Dover Publications, New Cork, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that the city was conceived for you builders with the form of a puma. Fernando and Edgardo Elorrieta,&lt;ref&gt;Elorrieta Salazar Fernando and Elorrieta Salazar Edgardo, 1996, The Sacred Valley of The Incas, Myths and Symbols, Society Pacaritampu Hatha, Cusco, Peru.&lt;/ref&gt; describe great quantity of incaic buildings located in the sacred valley, which forms of animals resemble, some of them related to the dark constellations that they saw in the night sky. Also they describe associations of these buildings with the astronomy.

The back part of this feline, presents openings of doors, corridors and separations between walls, which allow the step of the first beam of the Sun in [[solstice]] and [[equinox]]. The step of the first beam of the Sun in the winter solstice on (June 21) across four doors crosses a sense. During the dawn of the summer solstice (December 21) a months later, the last beam of the Sun crosses the inverse way.

== The astronomic observatory of Huaca de Chena  ==
In 1996, published a new article in a magazine of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Bustamante Patricio, " The Huaca of the Hill Chena, Sacred Architecture of the People(Village) Inca ". Magazine CIMIN (Construction, Industry and Mining industry), 1996, N ° 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

It approached a new offer of interpretation, according to which the [[pucara]] might be a ritual site and an [[astronomic observatory]] not a [[fortress]]. The abundant specialized literature indicates that the Inca astronomers realised observations of high precision and were constructing observatories along the territory that they were occupying. These observatories were necessary for elaboration of calendars with agricultural, religious, civil purposes, etc. Boccas,&lt;ref&gt;Boccas M., Bustamante P., González C., y Monsalve C. 1999 Promising archaeoastronomy investigations in Chile", En: actas del Congreso OXFORD VI and SEAC -99, Astronomía y Diversidad Cultural, Organismo Autónomo de Museos del Cabildo de Tenerife, Tenerife. Vol 1: 115 — 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S071773562004000400039&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=es SciELO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628161046/http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S071773562004000400039&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=es |date=2009-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boccas et to., 1999 and Boccas 2004&lt;/ref&gt; penetrates into this line of analysis.

== Calendar ==
Due to the big distances that normally existed between villages and the need to cross them afoot, makes presume that every accession of relative importance, was relying on an observatory that  was allowing the inhabitants, your own and one handled [[calendar]]. The Inca accession that the Spanish found on having come to the valley of Santiago surely was not the exception.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer Brian, Dearborn David, Astronomy and Empire of the Andes, Center of Andean Studies Bartolomé of The houses, Cuzco, Peru, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan William, The Secret of The Incas, Grijalbo, Barcelona, Spain, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The date in which the Sun passes for [[nadir]] ([[antizenith]]) also was known, and a temporary axis was forming with the step for [[zenith]]. In the Inca city [[Wanuku Pampa]] Aveni discovered two important buildings which orientation is glaringly different from the rest of the city: they align with the axis( zenith - anticenit, which names later " [[standard time of Cuzco]] ", since he suggests that the Incas, on not having been able to apply the same temporary criteria in all your empire (s passed the tropics, the Sun never passes for the zenith - Chena's case-), had to support a calendar coherence between remote places of your empire and the capital. In Chena, we have not seen this type of alignment towards "[[Cuzco's time zone]]".

=== Skills of observation ===
June 21 is the holiday of [[Inti Raymi]], new year Inca. If the Inca was stopping in the beginning of the most short red line, he was observing the first beam of the Sun went out across a groove between two walls. The Sun was rising after [[Ushnu]] or altar. During the celebration of the Inti Raymi of 2006 in the pucara, the young archeologist and mountaneer Ricardo Moyano observed the exit of the Sun and recognized hills the depression in where the Sun goes out, as the so-called [[Portezuelo del Inca]]. Up to this moment this name did not have explanation. From this observation, in Stehberg's opinion, it might be a question of the first line of ceque found in Santiago. In Cuzco, the ceques were consisting of imaginary lines that [[Coricancha]] was departing from and they were going towards every huaca, shaping a whole of 328 [[huaca]]s. They were fulfilling functions of political, social and religious order. '''The Coricancha was the principal temple of the Inca culture'''.

To the dawn of the equinox, the Sun crosses the door of the enclosure orient and then crosses the corridor. To the late afternoon it realizes the inverse way. The diagonal of the corridor of access indicates the line North - South.

By means of this simple method, and using mud and stones as materials of construction, the astronomers Incas were achieving observations of great precision.

=== Determination of geographical North - South Axis ===
For example, to determine the astronomic or geographical north, is enough to observe the point of exit and the point of putting of the star [[Vega]] (Lira's Alpha), ''Urcu Chillay'' or [[macho calls]] for the Incas, about the winter solstice. Then to look for the average point, this represents the north. Probably this simple method allowed to the former astronomers to determine the axis North - South. The following scheme, product of more than one decade of observation in situ of astronomic events, shows the system of astronomic observation to simple sight, probably used by the Incas astronomers to design the pucara and then to realize your observations of the apparent movement of the stars.

===Winter solstice===
The surrise of the winter solstice occurs in a "key" point from Chena's ushnu: the intersection of the most nearby horizon (Chena's cord) and of the most distant (mountain chain of the Coast). In addition, in this precise direction one finds the summit of the highest hill (1.166 msnm) that reaches to the south of the [[Cuesta Zapata]].&lt;ref&gt;map IGM Santiago 3300-7030 to scale 1:250.000&lt;/ref&gt; This detail might not be a coincidence, but a topographic important requirement, due to the association known about the high hills with the worship to the water in several cultures&lt;ref&gt;Broda, J. 1991 Cosmovisión y observación de la naturaleza: el ejemplo del culto de los cerros en Mesoamérica. En Arqueoastronomía y etnoastronomía en Mesoamérica, editado por J. Broda, S. Iwanizewski y L. Maupomé, pp. 461-500. Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, México.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Huaca de Chena ==
A [[huaca]] ([[Quechuan]] ''Wak'a'') is a sacred place, a space of ritual use. The previous descriptions seem to indicate that Chena's Pucará was and it is a huaca.
{{Cita|''" This Andean sacralización of his geography has precedents of long byline in the Andes and there must not be thought that it is only incaica, though, [[Tawantinsuyu]] He adapts it of the way that more is convenient to his political interests. In addition, one must not believe that this geographical perception is applied only to the nuclear Andean area. On the contrary, to where they were the state civil servants Tawantinsuyu or his influence was coming, there spreads this particular way of perceiving and organizing the physical world "''|[[Archeologist]] [[Ruben Stehberg]]}}

The reasons that they support this place as ceremonial and not as military compound:

* During the excavations weapon was not found, the water is to 2,5&amp;nbsp;km from distance, the housings for 6 persons were insufficient for the garrison that is supposed it should have defended the extensive walls perimetrales;
* The pucara has a form zoomorfa (he looks like a "puma"") and this it is a characteristic of the ceremonial centers Incas;
* If it is observed, the pucara consists of three separated spaces (the first wall perimetral, the second wall perimetral and the central enclosures), which can interpret as the typical one "Tripartición Inca of [[Pachacuti Yamqui]]" (A low zone, a terrestrial zone and a celestial zone);
* Finally, it is possible to observe in the principal enclosure the existence of one [[Ushnu]] (Place of observation). Curiously, it is possible to plan a perfectly straight line between Chena's ushnu and the place where the Sun puts on all the winters solsticio (in the Mountain chain of the Coast)

== Pre-Hispanic cemetery ==
{{coord|33|36|39.94|S|70|45|15.81|W|region:CL_type:landmark|name=Pre-Hispanic cemetery}}

At basement of the monunt they found also two cemeteries, presumably [[diaguita]], separated one of other one for approximately {{convert|600|m|ft}}. The diaguitas, for the especial preoccupation showed in your burials, think that they have a life post-death in which the flame has a basic role. The dual ceramics appear towards the belief of the existence of two worlds in which them [[shaman]]that they are the link. With the arrival of the Incas there was brought the tradition of doing altars in the highest hills of the valley

== Sacred place today==
In contrast with this physical abandon, in the last decade, diverse groups and persons are re-discovering the pucara. [[Quechuan]][[Aymara people|Aymará]] distinguishes the community from Santiago, which realizes negotiations with the authorities in order to recover the Huaca de Chena as a ritual space for the new generations of descendants from the original Andean etnias. The communities estimate importantly that the descendants from the Andean villages could recover this sacred place (nowadays in virtual abandon), to possess a ritual own space inside the city. This would allow them to establish a physical and spiritual link with your cultural inheritance.

The '''Illusive Man''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in [[BioWare]]'s [[Mass Effect|''Mass Effect'' video game franchise]]. He is the leader of the [[Anthropocentrism|pro-human]] group Cerberus. The Illusive Man wears an open suit that connotes both futuristic style and the "casual swagger of a charming billionaire". His eye implants make him appear slightly inhuman. He is normally seen in an empty office with no indication of his living arrangements. He is voiced by [[Martin Sheen]].

The character first appeared in 2008's novel ''[[Mass Effect: Ascension|Ascension]]'', and made his video game debut in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' as a supporting character. In the game, he arranges to revive [[Commander Shepard]] from death, provides Shepard with a ship and crew, and sends Shepard on several missions against the human-abducting Collectors. The Illusive Man later appears in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' as one of the main antagonists, where he works against Shepard's attempts to destroy the Reapers, wishing to control them instead. He appears in several other ''Mass Effect'' comics series and novels. ''Mass Effect: Evolution'' tells his [[origin story]].

His critical reception has been positive, with Martin Sheen praised for his voice acting. However, some criticized ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s story for forcing the player to work with the Illusive Man and Cerberus despite their antagonistic role in the first game.

==Concept and characteristics==
[[File:Sheen, Martin (2008).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Martin Sheen]] provides the voice for the Illusive Man.]]

The Illusive Man is the leader of Cerberus, a pro-human group officially regarded as a terrorist organisation by the Citadel Council and the humans' Systems Alliance.&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt; The character was voiced by [[Martin Sheen]] in both ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 3|3]]''.&lt;ref name="Voice Cast"/&gt; According to [[Casey Hudson]], Sheen really got into the role.&lt;ref name="Sheen Dares"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Got Into"/&gt; Sheen has said he would suck on a pen to simulate smoking when recording lines, as he himself did not smoke.&lt;ref name="Return"/&gt;

At one point, the Illusive Man was planned as the boss fight for ''Mass Effect 3'', having been altered by the Reapers. However, this was changed to avoid a clichéd ending.&lt;ref name="Mass Effect 4"/&gt; Additionally, BioWare felt it did not fit the Illusive Man—the Illusive Man's "weapon" being his intelligence, not physical strength—and wanted to let the player fight a character they recognised.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

===Design===
His face was based off a catalog model, a decision made early in his development.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; He is largely symmetrical, and is meant to appear almost "perfect".&lt;ref name="Cho Interivew"/&gt; He smokes, drinks, and is in his fifties but shows no signs of age due to [[Fictional universe|in-universe]] medical improvements.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; His eye implants were designed to make him appear slightly inhuman.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; These implants are explained in ''Evolution'' as the result of interaction with a mysterious artifact that huskified those who directly touched it.&lt;ref name="Evolution"/&gt; For his indoctrinated appearance in ''Mass Effect 3'', numerous facial concepts were drawn to determine just how much the character had been indoctrinated, with some referencing [[Saren Arterius]] (the main antagonist of the [[Mass Effect (video game)|first ''Mass Effect'' game]]).&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

His suit was designed to both be recognizable as a suit and to combine "an impeccable futuristic style" and "the casual swagger of a charming billionaire".&lt;ref name="Digital Art"/&gt; While the suit was designed with futuristic style in mind, it also had to not fit into any particular decade.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; It was decided that the Illusive Man's suit should be open, in order to give the impression he could do whatever he pleased.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

The Illusive Man's main setting is his spacious and barren office. His personal quarters are never shown. The holographic computer terminals surrounding his office desk serve two functions: to show his connection to "a vast web of information" while decreasing his humanity for only communicating through holograms. He does not see actual people, but rather only facsimiles of them. His office view of a dying star reinforces his desire for full control of his environment. Only a small amount of concept art was made for the Illusive Man's room.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

{{Quote box
 |width = 25em
 |align = right
 |quote = I look at the Illusive Man as a searcher, someone plumbing the mysteries of the galaxy—but with a specific mindset to his approach. He's sure there's a darker side to some of the great things humanity's discovered, and he's rushing to find what that is before it's too late. His adventures force him to be a jack-of-all-trades—part [[Astrobiology|xenobiologist]], part [[intelligence agent]], part [[Archaeology|archaeologist]].
 |source = [[John Jackson Miller]]&lt;ref name="SDCC"/&gt;
}}

===Personality and traits===
The Illusive Man is described as believing "[[the end justifies the means]]",&lt;ref name="Talk Up"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Character Bio"/&gt; and was made to be morally [[Grey area (disambiguation)|gray]].&lt;ref name="How BioWare"/&gt; [[John Jackson Miller]], who penned the script for ''Mass Effect: Evolution'', ''Invasion'', and ''Redemption'', personally viewed him as a searcher that saw a "darker side to some of the great things humanity's discovered", the object of his search.&lt;ref name="SDCC"/&gt; During the course of the games, the writers did not want to reveal too much about him. His character development's "basic idea" was "one of these guys we don't know much about". BioWare considered his backstory and motivations, but could not elaborate in the games due to this narrative technique.&lt;ref name="SDCC"/&gt;

A "shadowy puppetmaster", he is also a smoker, a womaniser and a drinker, but is very charming.&lt;ref name="Cho Interivew"/&gt; This helps him serve as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the Commander.&lt;ref name="Cho Interivew"/&gt; Adrien Cho, producer for ''Mass Effect 2'', described him as being both the best and worst traits of humanity rolled into one person.&lt;ref name="Cho Interivew"/&gt;

==Appearances==

===In video games===
''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', a 2010 [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing video game]], marked the Illusive Man's first in-game appearance. The [[player character]] and protagonist, [[Commander Shepard]], is recalled to life by the Illusive Man's Cerberus after being killed by an unknown ship at the beginning of the game. The Illusive Man debriefs and tells Shepard about how the someone has been abducting human colonies and may be working with the Reapers, a [[Sentience|sentient]] machine race dedicated to wiping out all [[Carbon-based life|organic life]].&lt;ref name="Meeting"/&gt; In order to help Shepard launch an assault on the Reaper base, he provides the Commander with a ship, crew, and dossiers on potential squadmates. Over the course of the game, he sends Shepard to investigate Freedom's Progress, a recently abducted colony where Shepard discovers that the Collectors are behind the attack;&lt;ref name="Meeting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedom's Progress"/&gt; Horizon, a colony in the process of being abducted;&lt;ref name="Horizon"/&gt; and a Collector ship, which turns out to be a trap—one that the Illusive Man knew about.&lt;ref name="Turian Call"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Set Up"/&gt; At the end of the game, the Illusive Man sends Shepard to the Collector base, where the player decides whether to disable and turn over the base, or to destroy the base and cut all ties with Cerberus.&lt;ref name="Ending"/&gt;

The character returns in the game's sequel, ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', released on March 6, 2012. He is first seen as a hologram on Mars when Shepard is retrieving data to stop the concurrent Reaper invasion of Earth. The Illusive Man tells Shepard his plan to control the Reapers and attempts to foil Shepard when Shepard resists. Over the course of the game, the Illusive Man commands Cerberus to attack the planet Sur'Kesh, homeworld of the salarians, to instigate a war between two allied races and to take control of the allied interspecies forces' base, the Citadel. He makes another appearance on the asari home planet, Thessia, where he again tries to convince Shepard that controlling the Reapers is the best solution. Shepard refuses and suggests that the Illusive Man is indoctrinated. In response, the Illusive Man commands the assassin Kai Leng to steal vital information necessary to combat the Reapers. Shepard tracks the VI to Cerberus's headquarters and discovers videos of the Illusive Man having himself implanted with Reaper technology and warning Kai Leng of Shepard. In these videos, the Illusive Man shows the Commander a great deal of respect. The Illusive Man makes his penultimate appearance at the headquarters. The Illusive Man appears at the Citadel in the endgame. Depending on prior in-game choices, players then decide whether to shoot him, or to convince him that he is indoctrinated, which makes him shoot himself. If the player shoots him he remarks how beautiful Earth is while gazing out through the Citadel arms, wishing Shepard could see it the same way, before succumbing to his wounds.

===In other media===
Outside of the video games, the Illusive Man had earlier appeared in the 2008 ''[[Mass Effect: Ascension]]'', the 2010 comic series ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'', and the 2010 novel ''[[Mass Effect: Retribution]]'', wherein the Illusive Man becomes obsessed with indoctrination and decides to study it.

The ''Mass Effect: Evolution'' comics series was announced to expand on the Illusive Man's backstory,&lt;ref name="SDCC"/&gt; and was released throughout 2011. The story opens during the First Contact War, the war between the alien turians and the humans after humanity discovered alien life and the Mass Relays. The Illusive Man is Jack Harper, a [[mercenary]] working for the Human System Alliance under the command of General Williams. In one incident, Jack leads two other mercenaries, Ben Hislop and Eva Coré, in attacking a group of turians, and captures one as prisoner. The turian, named Desolas Arterius, lead them to an artifact that turns Ben into a zombie-like monster and leaves Jack with strange eyes and the mysterious ability to understanding alien languages. After being captured and subsequently released by the Turians, Jack begins to search for clues about his mysterious visions of destruction. He and Eva were later captured by Desolas and his brother Saren who revealed to have custody of Ben. The Jack and Eva are brought to a temple on the turian homeworld of Palaven where Desolas has excavated an artifact. Desolas reveals that he plans to use the artifact to create a new breed of turian soldiers. Jack realizes that the new turians would be feral and dangerous, but Desolas ignores his warning. Jack manages to convince Saren that converted turians are a threat just as they begin to turn on Desolas. In the end, Jack escapes as the turian military destroy the beacon and the converted turians. However, he loses both Ben and Eva and creates a manifesto for Cerberus in their name.

In ''[[Mass Effect: Deception]]'', a 2012 novel, the Illusive Man is targeted by an extremist group, The Biotic Underground.&lt;ref name="Deception"/&gt;

The Illusive Man is the main [[antagonist]] of ''Mass Effect: Invasion'', a 2012 comic series.

The character appears in the fourth issue of the 2012 ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', where he monitors Liara for her Prothean research on Reaper-defeating technologies. He sends a Phantom to kill her, which she defeats. He attempts to contact her afterwards. claiming the phantom to be a rogue agent, and proposes an alliance between the two. Liara is not convinced and cuts him off.

==Reception==
The Illusive Man was received well, and gained accolades for his appearance in ''Mass Effect 2''. [[IGN]] called him the best PC character of 2010: "[a]n enigma, a crusader, an agent of calm in a vortex of chaos".&lt;ref name="Best Character"/&gt; In a vote for by ''[[Game Informer]]'' for their top 30 favorite characters of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s decade]], the Illusive Man placed 27th.&lt;ref name="Top 30"/&gt; [[Giant Bomb]]'s 2010 [[Game of the Year]] listed the Illusive Man as the character with which they would most like to party.&lt;ref name="Partying"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Joe Juba listed the Illusive Man's appearance in ''[[Mass Effect: Retribution]]'' as a reason to read the book.&lt;ref name="Five Reasons"/&gt; Dan Ryckert, also writing for ''Game Informer'', felt that [[Bruce Greenwood]] would best suit the character in the forthcoming ''Mass Effect'' film.&lt;ref name="Casting Call"/&gt; When comparing ''Mass Effect'' to previous works that may have inspired the series, IGN's Christopher Monfette compared the character to the [[Smoking Man]] from ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref name="Inspiration"/&gt; [[GamesRadar]] praised his moral sense, putting Illusive Man in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-100-villains-video-games/|title=100 best villains in video games|publisher=GamesRadar|date=May 17, 2013  |access-date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Sheen was praised for his voice acting. Sheen was nominated for best performance by a human male at the 2010 [[Spike Video Game Awards]],&lt;ref name="Spike1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spike2"/&gt; and David Houghton, writing for [[GamesRadar]], listed it as an example of "[w]hen celebrity voice-acting goes very right".&lt;ref name="Celebrity Voice-Acting"/&gt; When reviewing ''Mass Effect 2'', IGN's Erik Brudvig called Sheen's performance a "high point" in the game's cast.&lt;ref name="Review"/&gt; Similarly, [[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]]'s Aylon Herbet called him a "show-stealing personality".&lt;ref name="Gameplanet"/&gt;

Tom Francis of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' criticized how the player was forced to work with the Illusive Man and Cerberus in ''Mass Effect 2'', saying that it was an interesting idea if an option, but "it's just frustrating" if the player was forced to do it.&lt;ref name="15 Things"/&gt; Nic Vargus, writing for GamesRadar, felt similarly and called it "one of the biggest narrative stretches in ''Mass Effect''".&lt;ref name="21 Facts"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61989">'''Indian art''' consists of a variety of art forms, including plastic arts (e.g., [[pottery]], [[sculpture in the Indian subcontinent|sculpture]]), [[visual arts]] (e.g., [[Indian painting|paintings]]), performing arts and [[textile arts]] (e.g. [[Silk in the Indian subcontinent#Origin|woven silk]]). Geographically, it spans the entire [[Indian subcontinent]], including what is now [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and eastern [[Afghanistan]]. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.

The origin of Indian art can be traced to [[Prehistoric Sweden|pre-historic]] settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as [[Hindu art|Hinduism]], [[Buddhist art|Buddhism]], [[Jain art|Jainism]], [[Sikh art and culture|Sikhism]] and [[Islam in India#Indo-Islamic art and architecture|Islam]]. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.

In historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. [[Indian funeral]] and philosophic traditions exclude [[grave goods]], which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.

===Rock art===
[[File:Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|upright|right|150px|Replica of the "dancing girl of [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]]"]]

Rock art of India includes [[rock relief]] carvings, engravings and paintings. It is estimated there are about 1300 rock art sites with over a quarter of a million figures and figurines.&lt;ref name="Gupta1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jagadish Gupta|title=Pre-historic Indian Painting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8zpAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=North Central Zone Cultural Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest rock carvings in India were discovered by [[A.C.L. Carlleyle|Archibald Carlleyle]], twelve years before the [[Cave of Altamira]] in Spain,&lt;ref name="Tiwari2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiv Kumar Tiwari|title=Riddles of Indian Rockshelter Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jO0fvT4r9gC&amp;pg=PA8|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-086-3|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his work only came to light much later via J Cockburn (1899).&lt;ref name="cockburn1899"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cockburn|first1=John|title=Art. V.—Cave Drawings in the Kaimūr Range, North-West Provinces.|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland |series=New Series|date=1899|volume=31|issue=1|pages=89–97|doi=10.1017/S0035869X00026113|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0035869X00026113|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[V. S. Wakankar|Dr. V. S. Wakankar]] discovered several painted rock shelters in Central India, situated around the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya mountain range]]. Of these, the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] have been deemed a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/925|title = Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka|date = 2003|accessdate = 12 November 2014|website = UNESCO World Heritage Convention|publisher = UNESCO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings in these sites commonly depicted scenes of human life alongside animals, and hunts with stone implements. Their style varied with region and age, but the most common characteristic was a red wash made using a powdered mineral called ''geru'', which is a form of Iron Oxide ([[Hematite]]).&lt;ref name=pathak&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pathak|first1=Dr. Meenakshi Dubey|title=Indian Rock Art - Prehistoric Paintings of the Pachmarhi Hills|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/india/pachmarhi/index.php|publisher=Bradshaw Foundation|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indus Valley Civilization ({{circa|lk=no|5000 BCE|1500 BCE}})===
{{main|Indus Valley Civilization}}
Despite its widespread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilization seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, [[terracotta]] and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of [[dance]]. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultist significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.&lt;ref name=" Keay, John 2000"&gt;Keay, John, India, a History.  New York: Grove Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous piece is the bronze ''Dancing Girl'' of [[Mohenjo-Daro]], which shows remarkably advanced modelling of the human figure for this early date.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Seals have been found at Mohenjo-Daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a [[yoga]]-like pose. This figure, sometimes known as a ''Pashupati'', has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Sir John. Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilisation, 3 vols, London: Arthur Probsthain, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, there is a surprising absence of art of any great degree of sophistication until the Buddhist era.  It is thought that this partly reflects the use of perishable organic materials such as wood.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mauryan art ({{circa|lk=no|322 BCE|185 BCE}})===
{{main|Mauryan art}}
[[File:Pataliputra capital front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pataliputra capital]], an early example of Mauryan stone sculpture, displaying [[Persian art|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] influences.]]
[[File:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India 2007-01-29.jpg|thumb|right|200 PX|Single Lion capital at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].]]
The north Indian [[Maurya Empire]] flourished from 322 BCE to 185 BCE, and at its maximum extent controlled all of the sub-continent except the extreme south as well as influences from [[Ancient Persia|Indian ancient traditions, and Ancient Persia]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22-28&lt;/ref&gt; as shown by the [[Pataliputra capital]].

The emperor [[Ashoka]], who died in 232 BCE, adopted [[Buddhism]] about half-way through his 40-year reign, and patronized several large [[stupa]]s at key sites from the life of the [[Buddha]], although very little decoration from the Mauryan period survives, and there may not have been much in the first place.  There is more from various early sites of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]. The most famous survivals are the large animals surmounting several of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], which showed a confident and boldly mature style and craft and first of its kind iron casting without rust until date, which was in use by vedic people in rural areas of the country, though we have very few remains showing its development.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; The famous detached [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]], with four animals, was adopted as the official [[Emblem of India]] after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 State Emblem] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511134823/http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 |date=May 11, 2012 }}, Know India india.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; Many small popular [[terracotta]] figurines are recovered in archaeology, in a range of often vigorous if somewhat crude styles.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 39-42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist art ({{circa|lk=no|1 CE|500 CE}})===
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Karla caves Chaitya.jpg|thumb|A monumental rock-cut cave, the Great Chaitya at [[Karla caves]], built circa 120 CE.]]
The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives after many Hindu, buddhist and jain temples destroyed by mughal rulers time to time. some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 105-117, 26-47&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mathura]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59-70&lt;/ref&gt;  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.

Buddhism developed an increasing emphasis on statues of the Buddha, which was greatly influenced by Hindu and Jain religious figurative art, The figures of this period which were also influenced by the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the centuries after the defeat of [[Alexander the Great]].  This fusion developed in the far north-west of India, especially [[Gandhara]] in modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 105-117, 71-84 on Gandhara&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian [[Kushan Empire]] spread from [[Central Asia]] to include northern India in the early centuries CE, and briefly commissioned large statues that were portraits of the royal dynasty, [[Mughal miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 68-70 (but see p. 253 for another exception)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) ====
''Main article:'' [[Shunga Empire]]

With the fall of the [[Maurya Empire]], control of India was returned to the older custom of regional dynasties, one of the most significant of which was the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) of central India. During this period, as well as during the Satavahana Dynasty which occurred concurrently with the Shunga Dynasty in south India, some of the most significant early Buddhist architecture was created. Arguably, the most significant architecture of this dynasty is the stupa, a religious monument which usually holds a sacred relic of Buddhism. These relics were often, but not always, in some way directly connected to the Buddha. Due to the fact that these stupas contained remains of the Buddha himself, each stupa was venerated as being an extension of the Buddha's body, his enlightenment, and of his achievement of nirvana. The way in which Buddhists venerate the stupa is by walking around it in a clockwise manner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art History|last=Stokstad|first=Marilyn|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2018|isbn=9780134475882|location=United States|pages=306 - 310}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:The great stupa.jpg|thumb|The Great Stupa at Sanchi, c. 273 BCE - 232 BCE (Mauryan Empire), enlarged c. 150 BCE - 50 BCE (Shunga Dynasty)]]
One of the most notable examples of the [[Stupa|Buddhist stupa]] from the Shunga Dynasty is The Great Stupa at Sanchi, which was thought to be founded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka c. 273 BCE - 232 BCE during the Maurya Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/shun/hd_shun.htm|title=Shunga Dynasty (ca. Second - First Century B.C.)|last=Department of Asian Art|first=|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Stupa was enlarged to its present diameter of 120 feet, covered with a stone casing, topped with a balcony and umbrella, and encircled with a stone railing during the Shunga Dynasty c. 150 BCE - 50 BCE.      

====[[Satavahana dynasty]] (c. 1st/3rd century BCE  – c. 3rd century CE) ====
[[File:Nymph of Sanchi.JPG|thumb|Yakshi Bracket Figure. East torana of the Great Stupa at Sanchi. 1st century BCE.]]''Main article: [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana Dynasty]]''[[File:Kanishka enhanced.jpg|thumb|King Kanishka. Uttar Pradesh, India. 2nd-3rd century CE. ]]
Satavahana dynasty was originally under the rule in central India, and after 1st century CE, in the south region. During Satavahana dynasty, a great number of significant Buddhist artworks were produced during this period. [[Stupa|Stupas]] and temples are the most typical Buddhist architectures in this period. Stupas are religious monuments built on burial mounds, which contain relics beneath a solid dome. Stupas in different areas of India may vary in structure, size, and design; however, their representational meanings are quite similar. They are designed based on [[mandala]], a graph of cosmos specific to Buddhism. A traditional stupa has a railing that provides a sacred path for Buddhist followers to practice devotional [[circumambulation]] in ritual settings. Also, ancient Indians considered caves as sacred places since they were habitants of holy men and monks. The Chaitya was constructed from a cave. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art History|last=|first=|publisher=Pearson|year=|isbn=9780134475882|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Kushan Empire (c. 30 CE - c. 375 CE) ====
''Main article: [[Kushan Empire]]''
[[File:Standing Buddha.Gandhara.Asian Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Standing Buddha. Schist with traces of gilding, H. 64.8 cm x W. 29.2 cm x D. 15.2 cm. Gandhara, approx. 200-350 ACE. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco.]]
Officially established by [[Kujula Kadphises]], the first Kushan emperor who united the [[Yuezhi]] tribes, Kushan empire was a syncretic empire in central Asia. In this period, Kushan art inherited the [[Greco-Buddhist art]], and the depictions of Buddha himself first appeared in art. Wearing a monk’s robe and a long length of cloth draped over the left shoulder and around the body, the Buddha was depicted with 32 major [[Lakshana|lakshanas]] (distinguishing marks), including a golden-colored body, an [[ushnisha]] (a protuberance) on the top of his head, heavy earrings, elongated earlobes, long arms, the impression of a [[chakra]] (wheel) on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet, and the [[urna]] (a mark between his eyebrows)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.   

===Gupta art ({{circa|lk=no|320 CE|550 CE}})===
{{main|Gupta_Empire#Art}}
The Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of north Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and [[Jain]] ''[[tirthankara]]'' figures, these last often on a very large scale.  The two great centers of sculpture were [[Mathura]] and [[Gandhara]], the latter the center of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].

Although the Gupta period marked the "golden age" of classical Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hinduism: Past and Present|last = Michaels|first = Axel|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-691-08953-9|location = |pages = 40|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PD-flQMc1ocC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the early architectural style of Hindu temples were sophisticated and scientific in nature, consisting large courtyards, garbh grah, siting area, prayer area a large complex and well planned architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1062933|title = A Fitting Approach to God: On Entering the Western Temples at Khajurāho|last = Alles|first = Gregory D.|date = November 1993|journal = History of Religions|doi = 10.1086/463362|pmid = |volume = 33|issue = 2|pages = 161–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in stark contrast to the complex plans with multiple ''shikaras'' (towers) and ''mandapas'' (halls) of various utility as stated in veda outlining building of temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://www.academia.edu/2408684|title = The Representation of Women in the Erotic Sculptures of Khajuraho|date = 29 December 2012|accessdate = 8 November 2014|website = academia.edu|publisher = School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University|last = Saini|first = Shilpi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shore Temple]] at [[Mamallapuram]] constructed by the [[Pallavas]] symbolizes early [[Dravidian architecture|Hindu architecture]], with its monolithic [[rock relief]] and sculptures of Hindu deities. They were succeeded by Chola rulers who were prolific in [[Chola art|their pursuit of the arts]].

Thanks to the Hindu kings of the [[Chalukya dynasty]], [[Jainism]] flourished alongside Islam evidenced by the fourth of the [[Badami cave temples]] being Jain instead of [[Vedic]]. The kingdoms of South India continued to rule their lands until the Muslim invasions that established sultanates there and destroyed much of the temples and marvel examples of architectures and sculptures

==Early Modern and Colonial Era ({{circa|lk=no|1400 CE|1800 CE}}){{Anchor|EarlyModernAndColonialEra}}==

=== Mughal art ===
{{Main|Mughal painting}}
Although [[Islam in India|Islamic footholds in India]] were made as early as the first half of the 10th century, it wasn't until the [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal Empire]] that one observes emperors with a patronage for the fine arts. [[Humayun|Emperor Humayun]], during his reestablishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1555, brought with him [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] and [[Abd al-Samad]], two of the finest painters from [[Tahmasp I|Persian Shah Tahmasp]]'s renowned atelier.

During the reign of [[Akbar]] (1556—1605), the number of painters grew from around 30 during the creation of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' in the mid-1560s, to around 130 by the mid 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal|title = Scribal Notes on Mughal Manuscript Illustrations|last = Seyller|first = John|date = 1987|journal = Artibus Asiae|doi = |pmid = |volume = 48|issue = 3/4|pages = 247–277|jstor = 3249873}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court historian [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazal]], Akbar was hands-on in his interest of the arts, inspecting his painters regularly and rewarding the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ain-i Akbari|last = Fazl|first = Abu'l|publisher = Asiatic Society of Bengal|year = 1927|isbn = |location = |pages = |others = Translated by H Blochmann.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is during this time that Persian artists were attracted to bringing their unique style to the empire. Indian elements were present in their works from the beginning, with the incorporation of local Indian flora and fauna that were otherwise absent from the traditional Persian style. The paintings of this time reflected the vibrancy and inclusion of Akbar's kingdom, with production of [[Persian miniature]]s, the [[Rajput painting]]s (including the [[Kangra painting|Kangra school]]) and the [[Pahari painting|Pahari style]] of Northern India. They also influenced the [[Company style]] watercolor paintings created during the British rule many years later.{{Gallery

With the death of Akbar, his son [[Jahangir]] (1605–1627) took the throne. He preferred each painter work on a single piece rather than the collaboration fostered during Akbar's time. This period marks the emergence of distinct individual styles, notably [[Bishandas|Bishan Das]], [[Manohar Das]], [[Abu al-Hasan (Mughal painter)|Abu al-Hasan]], [[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], and Daulat.&lt;ref name="daulat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Daulat |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152389/Daulat |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Razmnama]]'' (Persian translation of the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'') and an illustrated memoir of Jahangir, named ''Tuzuk-i Jahangiri'', were created under his rule. Jahangir was succeeded by [[Shah Jahan]] (1628–1658), whose most notable architectural contribution is the [[Taj Mahal]]. Paintings under his rule were more formal, featuring court scenes, in contrast to the personal styles from his predecessor's time. [[Aurangzeb]] (1658–1707), who held increasingly orthodox Sunni beliefs, forcibly took the throne from his father Shah Jahan. With a ban of music and painting in 1680, his reign saw the decline of Mughal patronage of the arts.

=== Other medieval Indian Kingdoms ===
[[Mughal painting|Mughal art]] influenced the [[Rajput painting|Rajput]], [[Pahari painting|Pahari]], [[Deccan painting|Deccan]], [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and various other local styles of art. 

In South-Central India, during the late fifteenth century after the Middle kingdoms, the [[Bahmani sultanate]] disintegrated into the [[Deccan sultanates]] centered at [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Golconda Sultanate|Golconda]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Bidar]], and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]]. They used vedic techniques of metal casting, stone carving, and painting, as well as a distinctive architectural style with the addition of citadels and tombs from Mughal architecture. For instance, the Baridi dynasty (1504–1619) of Bidar saw the invention of [[Bidriware|''bidri'' ware]], which was adopted from Vedic and Maurya period ashoka pillars of zinc mixed with copper, tin, and lead and inlaid with silver or brass, then covered with a mud paste containing sal ammoniac, which turned the base metal black, highlighting the color and sheen of the inlaid metal. Only after the Mughal conquest of Ahmadnagar in 1600 did the Persian influence patronized by the Turco-Mongol Mughals begin to affect Deccan art.

===British period (1841–1947)===

British colonial rule had a great impact on Indian art. Old patrons of art became less wealthy and influential, and Western art more ubiquitous as the British Empire established schools of art in major cities, e.g. the [[Bombay Art Society]] in 1888. The [[Company style]] of paintings became common, created by Indian artists working for European patrons of the [[East India Company]]. The style was mainly [[Romanticism|Romanticized]], with watercolor the primary medium used to convey soft textures and tones.&lt;ref name="MichellLampert1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Michell|author2=Catherine Lampert|author3=Tristram Holland|title=In the Image of Man: The Indian Perception of the Universe Through 2000 Years of Painting and Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evtIAQAAIAAJ|year=1982|publisher=Alpine Fine Arts Collection|isbn=978-0-933516-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Government of India Act 1858|1858]], the British government took over the task of administration of India under the [[British Raj]]. The fusion of Indian traditions with European style at this time is evident from [[Raja Ravi Varma]]'s oil paintings of [[sari]]-clad women in a graceful manner.{{Gallery

With the [[Swadeshi Movement]] gaining momentum by 1905, Indian artists attempted to resuscitate the cultural identities suppressed by the British, rejecting the Romanticized style of the Company paintings and the mannered work of Raja Ravi Varma and his followers. Thus was created what is known today as the [[Bengal School of Art]], led by the reworked Asian styles (with an emphasis on Indian nationalism) of [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871—1951), who has been referred to as the father of Modern Indian art.&lt;ref name="India2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hachette India|title=Indiapedia: The All-India Factfinder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCEYAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT130|date=25 October 2013|publisher=Hachette India|isbn=978-93-5009-766-3|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists of the Tagore family, such as [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941) and [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (1867–1938) as well as new artists of the early 20th century such as [[Amrita Sher-Gil]] (1913–1941) were responsible for introducing [[Avant-garde]] western styles into Indian Art. Many other artists like [[Jamini Roy]] and later [[S.H. Raza]] took inspiration from [[folk traditions]]. In 1944, [[K.C.S. Paniker]] founded the Progressive Painters' Association (PPA) thus giving rise to the "madras movement" in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=For art's sake  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/02/12/stories/2009021251330400.htm |date= February 12, 2009|publisher= [[The Hindu]]|page=|accessdate=Nov 23, 2014|newspaper=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raza painting.JPG|thumb|''View of a village colored street'' by [[S.H. Raza]] (1948). Watercolor and gouache.]]
In 1947, India became independent of British rule. A group of six artists - [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza]] - founded the [[Progressive Artists' Group|Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]] in the year 1952, to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], V. S. Gaitonde, [[Krishen Khanna]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. G. Subramanyan]], [[A. Ramachandran]], [[Devender Singh]], Akbar Padamsee, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Himmat Shah and [[Manjit Bawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp |title=Showcase – Artists Collectives |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2014-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day Indian art is varied as it had been never before.  Among the best-known artists of the newer generation include [[Bose Krishnamachari]] and [[Bikash Bhattacharya]]. Another prominent Pakistani modernist was [[Ismail Gulgee]], who after about 1960 adopted an abstract idiom that combines aspects of [[Islamic calligraphy]] with an [[abstract expressionist]] (or [[gestural abstraction]]ist) sensibility.

Painting and sculpture remained important in the later half of the twentieth century, though in the work of leading artists such as [[Nalini Malani]], [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Narayanan Ramachandran]], [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Jitish Kallat]], they often found radical new directions. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.

The increase in discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, changed the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous; critics like [[Geeta Kapur]], [[R. Siva Kumar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/benodebehari_late.asp | title=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asiasociety.org/arts/asia-society-museum/past-exhibitions/rabindranath-tagore-last-harvest | title=Rabindranath Tagore: The Last Harvest}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Shivaji K. Panikkar]], [[Ranjit Hoskote]], amongst others, contributed to re-thinking contemporary art practice in India.

==Contextual Modernism==
{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}

The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the influential Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition “Place for People”—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s benchmark exhibition and related publication, A [[Contextual Modernism]], restored the [[Santiniketan]] artists—[[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]—to their proper place as the originators of an indigenously achieved yet transcultural modernism in the 1930s, well before the Progressives composed their manifesto in the late 1940s. Of the Santiniketan artists, Siva Kumar observed that they “reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf | title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]
The idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.

Several terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]'s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that 'Contextual Modernism' is a more suited term because “the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan's artist teachers' refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Siva Kumar]] "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/ | title=Humanities underground » All the Shared Experiences of the Lived World II}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"/&gt;

''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711 | title="Contextual modernism" – is it possible?

==Material history of Indian art==
===Sculpture===
{{main|sculpture in the Indian subcontinent}}
[[File:Nataraja01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chola art|Chola bronze]] statue of ''Nataraja'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]
The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the [[Indus Valley civilization]] (3300–1700 BC), found in sites at [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. These include the famous small bronze male dancer. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted.  After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from [[Daimabad]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin relatively late, with the reign of [[Ashoka]] from 270 to 232 BCE, and the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all [[Sanchi]]; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood.&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"&gt;Harle, 26–38&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, wood continued to be the main sculptural and architectural medium in [[Kerala]] throughout all historic periods until recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 342-350&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern [[India]], in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]] from what is now southern [[Afghanistan]] and northern [[Pakistan]], sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because [[Gandhara]]n Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Persia]]n artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.

The pink sandstone Hindu, [[Jain]] and Buddhist sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture.&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"/&gt; The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. 320-550) which remains a "classical" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier [[Ellora Caves]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 87; his Part 2 covers the period&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Elephanta Caves]] are probably slightly later.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and [[yakshi]] often have sensuously curving poses.  Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief.  The celebrated [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] bronzes of the [[Chola]] dynasty (c. 850–1250) from [[south India]], many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of [[Shiva]] as [[Nataraja]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 301-310, 325-327&lt;/ref&gt; with the massive granite carvings of [[Mahabalipuram]] dating from the previous [[Pallava]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 276–284&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra. ''et al.'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the existing specimens in the various [[museums]] of the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, [[Vishnu]] and his wife [[Lakshmi]], Siva saints and many more.&lt;ref name="tri479"&gt;Tri. ''[Title needed]''. p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Cave paintings in India}}

The tradition and methods of Indian cliff painting gradually evolved throughout many thousands of years - there are multiple locations found with prehistoric art. The early caves included overhanging rock decorated with [[Petroglyph|rock-cut art]] and the use of natural caves during the [[Mesolithic]] period (6000 BCE). Their use has continued in some areas into historic times.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]] are on the edge of the [[Deccan Plateau]] where deep erosion has left huge [[sandstone]] outcrops. The many caves and [[grotto]]s found there contain primitive [[tool]]s and decorative rock paintings that reflect the ancient tradition of human interaction with their landscape, an interaction that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The oldest surviving frescoes of the historical period have been preserved in the [[Ajanta Caves]] with Cave 10 having some from the 1st century CE, though the larger and more famous groups are from the 5th century. Despite climatic conditions that tend to work against the survival of older paintings, in total there are known more than 20 locations in India with paintings and traces of former paintings of ancient and early medieval times (up to the 8th to 10th centuries CE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Best/As/IndMedCavePaint.htm |title=Ancient and medieval Indian cave paintings - Internet encyclopedia |accessdate=2010-06-04 |date=2010-06-10 |work=Wondermondo }}&lt;/ref&gt; although these are just a tiny fraction of what would have once existed. The most significant frescoes of the ancient and early medieval period are found in the Ajanta, [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Ellora]], and [[Sittanavasal Cave|Sittanavasal]] caves, the last being [[Jain]] of the 7th-10th centuries. Although many show evidence of being by artists mainly used to decorating palaces, no early secular wall-paintings survive.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chola]] fresco paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the [[Brihadisvara Temple]] at [[Thanjavur]], [[Tamil Nadu]], and are the first Chola specimens discovered. Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments. During the [[Thanjavur Nayak|Nayak]] period the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescoes lying underneath have an ardent spirit of [[saivism]] is expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Cholan the Great.

[[Kerala mural painting]] has well-preserved [[fresco]] or [[mural]] or [[wall painting]] in temple walls in Pundarikapuram, [[Ettumanoor]] and [[Aymanam]] and elsewhere.

===Miniature painting===
Although few Indian miniatures survive from before about 1000 CE, and some from the next few centuries, there was probably a considerable tradition. Those that survive are initially illustrations for Buddhist texts, later followed by Jain and Hindu equivalents, and the decline of Buddhist as well as the vulnerable support material of the [[palm-leaf manuscript]] probably explain the rarity of early examples.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 361-366&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mughal painting]] in miniatures on paper developed very quickly in the late 16th century from the combined influence of the existing miniature tradition and artists trained in the [[Persian miniature]] tradition imported by the [[Mughal Emperor]]'s court.  New ingredients in the style were much greater realism, especially in portraits, and an interest in animals, plants and other aspects of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 372-382&lt;/ref&gt;

Miniatures either illustrated books or were single works for [[muraqqa]]s or albums of painting and [[Islamic calligraphy]].  The style gradually spread in the next two centuries to influence painting on paper in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts, developing into a number of regional styles often called "sub-Mughal", including [[Kangra painting]] and [[Rajput painting]], and finally [[Company painting]], a hybrid [[watercolour]] style influenced by European art and largely patronized by the people of the [[British raj]].  From the 19th century Western-style [[easel painting]]s became increasingly painted by Indian artists trained in Government art schools.

===Jewellery===
[[File:Andhra Pradesh Royal earrings 1st Century BCE.jpg|left|thumb|Pair of gold earrings, 1st century BCE, [[Andhra Pradesh]].]]

The [[Indian subcontinent]] has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery-making, with a history of over 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Untracht, Oppi p15"&gt;Untracht, Oppi. ''Traditional Jewelry of India''. New York: Abrams, 1997 {{ISBN|0-8109-3886-3}}. p15.&lt;/ref&gt; Using jewellery as a [[store of value|store of capital]] remains more common in India than in most modern societies, and gold appears always to have been strongly preferred for the metal. India and the surrounding areas were important sources of high-quality [[gemstone]]s, and the jewellery of the ruling class is typified by using them lavishly. One of the first to start jewellery-making were the people of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].  Early remains are few, as they were not buried with their owners.

===Other materials===
Wood was undoubtedly extremely important, but rarely survives long in the Indian climate. Organic animal materials such as [[ivory]] or bone were discouraged by the [[Dharmic religions]], although Buddhist examples exist, such as the [[Begram ivories]], many of Indian manufacture, but found in [[Afghanistan]], and some relatively modern [[Ivory carved tusk depicting Buddha life stories|carved tusks]]. In Muslim settings they are more common.

==Contextual history of Indian art==
===Temple art===
{{Main|Indian rock-cut architecture}}

Obscurity shrouds the period between the decline of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]] and the definite historic period starting with the [[Maurya]]s, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was [[Buddhism]]. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are no physical evidences for these except textual references.  Soon after the Buddhists initiated [[Indian rock-cut architecture|rock-cut caves]], [[Hindu]]s and [[Jain]]s started to imitate them at [[Badami]], [[Aihole]], [[Ellora]], [[Salsette]], [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] and [[Mamallapuram]] and [[Mughals]]. It appears to be a constant in Indian art that the different religions shared a very similar artistic style at any particular period and place, though naturally adapting the [[iconography]] to match the religion commissioning them.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Probably the same groups of artists worked for the different religions regardless of their own affiliations.

[[File:Statuetta indiana di Lakshmi, avorio, da pompei, 1-50 dc ca., 149425, 02.JPG|thumb|Indian art also found its way into Italy, within the context of [[Indo-Roman trade]]: in 1938 the [[Pompeii Lakshmi]] was found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] (destroyed in an eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 CE).]] 
Buddhist art first developed during the [[Gandhara]] period and [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] Periods around the 1st century BCE. It flourished greatly during the [[Gupta]] Periods and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] Periods that comprise the Golden Age of India. Although the most glorious art of these Indian empires was mostly Buddhist in nature, subsequently Hindu Empires like the [[Pallava]], [[Chola]], [[Hoysala]] and [[Vijayanagara]] Empires developed their own styles of Hindu art as well.

There is no time line that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures began in the 5th century, while rock-cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. An example of a free-standing structural temple is the [[Shore Temple]], a part of the [[Mahabalipuram]] World Heritage Site, with its slender tower, built on the shore of the [[Bay of Bengal]] with finely carved [[granite]] rocks cut like bricks and dating from the 8th century.&lt;ref name="binda"&gt;{{cite book

===Folk and tribal art===

Folk and tribal art in India takes on different manifestations through varied media such as pottery, painting, metalwork,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiansculptor.net/index.htm dhokra art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229115852/http://indiansculptor.net/index.htm |date=2010-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; paper-art, weaving and designing of objects such as jewellery and toys. These are not just aesthetic objects but in fact have an important significance in people's lives and are tied to their beliefs and rituals. The objects can range from sculpture, masks (used in rituals and ceremonies), paintings, textiles, baskets, kitchen objects, arms and weapons, and the human body itself (tattoos and piercings). There is a deep symbolic meaning that is attached to not only the objects themselves but also the materials and techniques used to produce them.

Often [[puranic]] gods and legends are transformed into contemporary forms and familiar images. Fairs, festivals, local heroes (mostly warriors) and local deities play a vital role in these arts (Example: [[Nakashi art]] from [[Telangana]] or [[Cherial scroll painting|Cherial Scroll Painting]]).

Folk art also includes the visual expressions of the wandering nomads. This is the art of people who are exposed to changing landscapes as they travel over the valleys and highlands of India. They carry with them the experiences and memories of different spaces and their art consists of the transient and dynamic pattern of life. The [[rural]], [[tribal]] and arts of the [[nomad]]s constitute the matrix of folk expression. Examples of folk arts are Warli, [[Madhubani art|Madhubani Art]], [[Manjusha Art]], [[Tikuli art|Tikuli Art]] and Gond etc.

While most tribes and traditional folk artist communities are assimilated into the familiar kind of civilised life, they still continue to practice their art. Unfortunately though, market and economic forces have ensured that the numbers of these artists are dwindling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gramin Vikas Seva Sanshtha |last1=GVSS |title=Evaluation Study of Tribal/Folk Arts and Culture in West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh and Bihar |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/sereport/ser/ser_folk2211.pdf |website=Planning Commission |publisher=Socio-Economic Research (SER) Division, Planning Commission, Govt. of India New Delhi |date=12 June 2011 |page=53 |accessdate=2 March 2015 |quote="... globalization has triggered the emergence of a synthetic macro-culture...is gaining popularity day by day and silently engineering the gradual attrition of tribal/folk art and culture."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decline of tribal and folk arts lamented|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Jul32008/district2008070276661.asp|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=Deccan Herald|date=3 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302045047/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Jul32008/district2008070276661.asp|archivedate=2 March 2015|location=Gudibanda, Karnataka, India|quote="In the wave of electronic media, our ... ancient culture and tribal art have been declining, ..., said folklore researcher J Srinivasaiah."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of effort is being made by various NGOs and the Government of India to preserve and protect these arts and to promote them. Several scholars in India and across the world have studied these arts and some valuable scholarship is available on them.

The folk spirit has a tremendous role to play in the development of art and in the overall consciousness of indigenous cultures.

'''Piety ([[Sawab]]) in Islam''' is considered to be one of the most important [[Islamic ethics]].  Piety is normally referred to as [[Taqwa]] in the Arabic language, which is derived from the root ‘waqaya,’ meaning ‘to safeguard’ or ‘to abstain.’  In Islamic terminology, this is defined as the act of restraining oneself from disobeying the commands of Allah.  Pious acts of self-restraint or self-control, wherein an individual abstains from committing a sin, are believed to bestow virtue upon that individual.  These acts of abstinence are considered the result of the individual's overall capability for self-restraint.  No single act itself constitutes piety; piety describes possessing the power of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self building|first=Amini|last=Ayatollah Ibrahim| publisher=  Author house, Bloomington|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/booksid=hEzv08LMbocC&amp;dq=Appendix+Three:+Ritual+Practices+in+Shiism |isbn=978-1-4918-4881-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allah tells us in Quran that he does not differentiate between people expect on "taqwa."

==Meaning==
Piety has been defined in various ways by different people and among whom are as follow:
*“Taqwa(piety), means to be conscious of the existence of Allah, acting toward pleasing Allah, fear Allah and seek protection from the anger of Allah and His punishment. This protection is realized by doing what Allah commands, and refraining from everything that Allah forbids. In brief, this protection is realized by obeying Allah which emanates only from the correct and strong belief in Him. This belief comprises the genuine love of Allah as well as the genuine fear of Him….”&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recharge.net/profile/Khalid_Ahmad/publication/228221597|title= Implications of Piety (Taqwa) on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) from Islamic Perspective: A Study of Professionals in Southeast Asia=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;	 
Also other define it as thus:
*“Taqwa(piety) is .. a religious belief...which is important in Islam.  Taqwa… in Islam is one of the interpretations of Islamic insight people would understand…that is…surrender to the will of God. Surrender to the will of God is basically what Taqwa is… " &lt;ref name="web" /&gt;	
*“Taqwa(piety) is whereby a Muslim intentionally evades actions that lead to Allah`s fury and displeasure and at the same time deliberately undertakes steps and acts that will gratify Allah as mentioned in Suratul Al-Imran.  In other words, it permits a person to be always conscious for both Allah's all-encompassing knowledge and characteristics and a reminder of their relationship and responsibility to Allah as his creation and servant. Hence, the way to Taqwa is through obedience of Allah, avoiding disobedience, and striving to stay away from doubtful matters” &lt;ref name="web" /&gt;
*When Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq was asked to elaborate on the meaning of the word, ‘Taqwa’(piety), he replied, “Submit to the command of Allah and do not go near the prohibited.” It means that one should endeavor to fulfill all the commands of Allah and abstain from the prohibited things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greater sin|first=Dastghaib|last=AbdulHussein| publisher=Ansariyan|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com|isbn=9789644386060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
in another place he define piety as thus: "Piety is that Allah does not miss you in the place where He has commanded you to be,and does not see (find) you where He has forbidden you from." &lt;ref name=define&gt;{{cite book|title=A Bundle of flower|first=Sadr-'amali|last=Sayyid Abbas| publisher=Lulu.com|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com|isbn=9781312522206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in '''Grenada''' may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents.

== Issues ==
=== Illegality of male homosexuality ===
Male-on-male homosexuality is illegal in [[Grenada]]. Under the Grenada Criminal Code, Section 431, the offence of “unnatural crime” is committed by way of sexual intercourse per anum, i.e., [[anal sex|anal penetration]]. Such offence is punishable by imprisonment for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=253233|title=Grenada: Criminal Code|website=www.wipo.int|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Criminal Code does not specify the ‘penetrating’ object, although by reliance on the common law, the penetrating object is the penis. The offence is committable by male person with/to male person and/or male person with/to female. The offence cannot, however, be committed by two female persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/LGBTShadow_Grenada_annex.pdf|title=Criminal Law Concerning Same-Sex Intimacy in Grenada|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Legal protections ===
There are no explicit clause on equality or protection of privacy in the Grenada Constitution of 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/constitutions/grenada/gren73eng.html|title=Grenada: Constitution, 1973|website=pdba.georgetown.edu|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT rights movement in Grenada==
In May 2013, the president of the country's Senate called the island to reconsider its ban on same-sex sexual relationships and said that “the day is fast approaching” for Grenada and other Caribbean countries to repeal their sodomy laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]].

The '''''Life of Castruccio Castracani''''' (Italian: ''Vita di Castruccio Castracani'') is a short work by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. It is made in the form of a short biographical account of the life of the medieval [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[condottiere]], [[Castruccio Castracani]], who lived in and ruled [[Lucca]].
[[File:Serravalle Pistoiese - Panorama.JPG|350px|right|thumb|A view of [[Serravalle Pistoiese]], which is set upon a hill with some sides being quite steep. Machiavelli describes an attack by the [[Lucca]]n forces of Castracani on the ridge of this town, that successfully caught [[Florence|Florentine]] forces by surprise.]]
The book is thought to have been written during a visit to Lucca in 1520. It was dedicated to Zanobi Buondelmonti and Luigi Alamanni. The former was also one of the two men to whom the ''Discourses on Livy'' was dedicated. Both, along with Machiavelli, are considered members of the so-called [[Orti Oricellari]] group.

Despite being in the form of a biography the sayings of Castracani are generally considered to have been fabricated by Machiavelli. It is therefore sometimes compared to his more well-known works including ''[[The Prince]]'', the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', and the ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|Art of War]]''.

A distinct section of sayings appears at the end of the work, after Castracani's life has ended. [[Leo Strauss]], in 1958, analyzed the various speeches attributed to Castracani in this work and found that they had mostly come from classical Roman and Greek sources, including most significantly several that had been attributed to [[Democritus]] by [[Diogenes Laertius]].

Machiavelli treats Castracani as a person whose aim was to unite Tuscany, but who failed because, as Machiavelli has the dying Castracani tell his heir "[[Fortuna|Fortune]], who is admitted to be arbiter of all human things, did not give me so much judgement that I could early understand her, nor so much time that I could overcome her". This proposal that leaders can overcome the arbiter of all things is a common theme in Machiavelli's better known political works such as ''The Prince''.

By treating Castracani as a founder, almost, of a new state, Machiavelli used him as an example of the most important type of prince according to his other writings. In fact Machiavelli opens with a passage that treats prophets as the highest type of secular prince.

{{quotation|...the larger part, of those who in this world have done very great things, and who have been excellent among the men of their era, have in their birth and origin been humble and obscure, or at least have been beyond all measure afflicted by Fortune. Because all of them either have been exposed to wild beasts or have had fathers so humble that, being ashamed of them, they have made themselves out sons of [[Jove]] or some other god. Who these are, since many of them are known to everybody, would be boring to repeat and little acceptable to readers...{{harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1958|p=533}}}}

Castracani was found as a baby left in a field, Machiavelli reports.

Machiavelli ends by touching upon another theme found in his other works, which is that Italy in his time was weak.

{{quotation|...because when living he was inferior neither to [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s father, nor to [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio of Rome]], he died at the age of both; without doubt he would have surpassed both if instead of Lucca he had had for his native country [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] or [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].{{harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1958|p=559}}}}

== History ==
{{See also|Open source video game#History}}
[[File:Doom ingame 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was one of the first major commercial games to be released for Linux.]]

Linux gaming started largely as an extension of the already present [[Unix]] gaming scene, with both systems sharing many similar titles. These games were either mostly original or clones of arcade games and text adventures. A notable example of this was the so-called "[[Berkley Software Distribution|BSD]] Games", a collection of [[interactive fiction]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4169|title=Ghost of Fun Time's Past|publisher=[[Linux Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[free software]] and [[Open-source software|open source]] methodologies which spawned the development of the operating system in general also spawned the creation of various early free games. Popular early titles included ''[[NetHack]], [[Netrek]], [[XBill]], [[XEvil]], [[xbattle]], [[Xconq]]'' and ''[[XPilot]]''. As the operating system itself grew and expanded, the amount of free and open-source games also increased in scale and complexity.

=== Early 1990s ===
The beginning of Linux as a gaming platform for commercial video games is widely credited to have begun in 1994 when [[Dave D. Taylor]] ported the game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' to Linux, as well as many other systems, during his spare time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1 | title = DOOM | publisher = Linux Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3180|title=Getting Started with Quake|publisher=[[Linux Journal]]|date=January 1, 1999|last=Zimbinski|first=Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he would also help found the development studio ''[[Crack dot Com]]'', which released the video game'' [[Abuse (video game)|Abuse]]'', with the game's Linux port even being published by Linux vendor [[Red Hat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Partnership with Crack dot Com Brings Games to Linux |url=http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/1997/10/press-crackdotcom |publisher=[[Red Hat]] |date=1997-10-07 |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.10/guest/|title=So Long, Crack.com|publisher=loonygames |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[id Software]], the original developers of ''Doom'', also continued to release their products for Linux. Their game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was ported to Linux in 1996, once again by Dave D. Taylor working in his free time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blankmaninc.com/david-taylor-interview | title='Dave Taylor Interview - game developer' | publisher=blankmaninc.com | date=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=11261|title=How To Install Quake 1|publisher=Linux.com|date=November 15, 2000|last=Mrochuk|first=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later id products continued to be ported by [[David Kirsch]] and [[Timothee Besset]], a practice that continued until the studio's acquisition by [[ZeniMax Media]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/121945-John-Carmack-Argues-Against-Native-Linux-Games|title=John Carmack Argues Against Native Linux Games|first=Andy |last=Chalk |date=2013-02-06 |accessdate=2013-09-29 |publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 DUX Software contracted Don Hopkins to port ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' to Unix, which he later ported to Linux and eventually released as open source for the [[OLPC XO|OLPC XO Laptop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/|title=History and Future of OLPC SimCity / Micropolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early commercial Linux games included ''[[Hopkins FBI]]'', an adventure game released in 1998 by [[MP Entertainment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=6937|title=Hopkins FBI|publisher=Linux.com|date=February 9, 2000|last=Kuhnash|first=Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Inner Worlds (video game)|Inner Worlds]]'' in 1996, which was released for and developed on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sleepless.com/iw/article.html |title=Internet Based Software Development |publisher=Sleepless Software Inc |date=September 19, 2001 |last=Hitchens |first=Joe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011231003158/http://sleepless.com/iw/article.html |archivedate=December 31, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, two programmers from [[Origin Systems|Origin]] ported ''[[Ultima Online]]'' to Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reverser.hut.ru/old/linux.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040229150312/http://reverser.hut.ru/old/linux.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-02-29|title=Ultima Online for Linux}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website called The Linux Game Tome began to catalog games created for or ported to Linux in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/site-review-linux-game-tome|title=Site review: Linux Game Tome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ryan-Gordon-SELF-2009.png|thumb|left|200px|Former Loki Software employee Ryan C. Gordon]]

=== Late 1990s: Loki and growth ===
On November 9, 1998 a new software firm called [[Loki Software]] was founded by [[Scott Draeker]], a former lawyer who became interested in porting games to Linux after being introduced to the system through his work as a software licensing attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3521|title=Interview: Scott Draeker and Sam Latinga, Loki Entertainment|work=[[Linux Journal]]|date=August 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loki, although a commercial failure, is credited with the birth of the modern Linux game industry. Loki developed several free software tools, such as the Loki installer (also known as Loki Setup),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.macologist.org/viewtopic.php?t=607 |title=Interview with Ryan Gordon: Postal2, Unreal &amp; Mac Gaming – Macologist |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309061407/http://www.macologist.org/viewtopic.php?t=607 |archivedate=March 9, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the development of the [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]], as well as starting the [[OpenAL]] audio library project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4400|title=The Story of OpenAL|publisher=[[Linux Journal]]|date=January 1, 2001|last=Kreimeier|first=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/articles/loki_a.shtm|title=Loki and the Linux World Expo – GameSpy chats with Linux legend Scott Draeker about the future of Linux gaming|publisher=GameSpy|last=Hills|first=James|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315020137/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/articles/loki_a.shtm|archivedate=2006-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are still often credited as being the cornerstones of Linux game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/article/2785732/open-source-tools/does-ragnarok-for-loki-spell-doom-for-linux-games-.html|title=Does Ragnarok for Loki Spell Doom for Linux Games?|first=Eric|last=Foster-Johnson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also responsible for bringing nineteen high-profile games to the platform before its closure in 2002. Loki's initial success also attracted other firms to invest in the Linux gaming market, such as [[Tribsoft]], [[Hyperion Entertainment]], [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Digital Publishing USA]], [[Titan Computer]], [[Xatrix Entertainment]] [[Philos Laboratories]], and [[Vicarious Visions]]. During this time [[Michael Simms (software developer)|Michael Simms]] founded [[Tux Games]], one of the first online Linux game retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.linuxgamepublishing.com/2009/05/15/lgp-history-pt-1-how-lgp-came-to-be/ |title=Linux Game Publishing Blog, LGP History pt 1: How LGP came to be |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713212344/http://blog.linuxgamepublishing.com/2009/05/15/lgp-history-pt-1-how-lgp-came-to-be/ |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s: Developers go it alone ===
After Loki's closure, the Linux game market experienced some changes. Although some new firms, such as [[Linux Game Publishing]] and [[RuneSoft]], would largely continue the role of a standard porting house, the focus began to change with Linux game proponents encouraging game developers to port their game products themselves or through individual contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=ODkwOA|title=Alternative Games Is All About Linux Gaming|publisher=[[Phoronix]]|date=December 14, 2010|last=Larabel|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Larabel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential to this was [[Ryan C. Gordon]], a former Loki employee who would over the next decade port several game titles to multiple platforms, including Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardware.no/artikler/ryan_c_gordon_and_michael_simms/68450/2|title=Porting games to Linux|publisher=hardware.no|date=March 10, 2009|last=Heggelund Hansen|first=Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time many companies, starting with id Software, also began to release legacy [[source code]] leading to a proliferation of [[source port]]s of older games to Linux and other systems. This also helped expand the already existing free and open-source gaming scene, especially with regards to the creation of free [[first person shooters]].&lt;ref name="ljquake3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9867 | title = Quake, Meet GPL; GPL, Meet Quake | date = 2007-12-01 | accessdate = 2012-01-12 | publisher = [[Linux Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Linux gaming market also started to experience some growth towards the end of the decade with the rise of [[independent video game development]], with many "indie" developers favouring support for multiple platforms.&lt;ref name="OSNews.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/25328/The_State_of_Linux_Gaming_2011 | title = The State of Linux Gaming 2011 | date = 2011-11-14 | accessdate = 2012-01-12 | publisher = OSNews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humble Indie Bundle]] initiatives helped to formally demonstrate this trend, with Linux users representing a sizable population of their purchase base, as well as consistently being the most financially generous in terms of actual money spent.&lt;ref name="humble gdc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33272/GDC_2011_Humble_Indie_Bundle_Creators_Talk_Inspiration_Execution.php | title = GDC 2011: Humble Indie Bundle Creators Talk Inspiration, Execution | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = 2011-02-28 | accessdate =2011-02-28 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humblemoney"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/linux-users-continue-to-most-for-the-humble-indie-bundle/ | title = Linux Users Continue To Pay Most for the @Humble Indie Bundle | first = Joey | last = Sneddon | date = 2011-12-21 | accessdate =2012-01-12 | publisher = [[OMG!

In the same year, LGP released Shadowgrounds which was the first commercial game for Linux using the Nvidia PhysX middleware.

=== 2010s: Steam, GOG, and Beyond ===
In July 2012, game developer and content distributor [[Valve Corporation|Valve Software]] announced a port of their [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]] for Linux as well as stating their intention to release their [[Steam (software)|Steam]] digital distribution service for Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Albanesius |first=Chloe |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407237,00.asp |title=Valve Moves Forward With Steam for Linux &amp;#124; News &amp; Opinion |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/ | title = Steam’d Penguins | publisher = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2012-07-16 | accessdate = 2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/16/3163717/left-4-dead-2-to-be-first-valve-game-on-linux | title = 'Left 4 Dead 2' to be first Valve game on Linux | first = Tracey | last = Lein | date = 2012-07-16 | accessdate= 2012-07-16 | publisher = [[The Verve]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential availability of a Linux Steam client has already attracted other developers to consider porting their titles to Linux,&lt;ref name="arstechnica2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2012/07/25/serious-sam-3-bfe-headed-to-steam-ubuntu/ | title = Serious Sam 3: BFE headed to Steam Ubuntu | first = Brenna | last= Hillier | date = 2012-07-24 | accessdate = 2012-07-24 | publisher = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=ODI4NA | title = Valve's Linux Play May Lead More Games To Follow Suit | first = Michael | last= Larbel | date = 2010-05-25 | accessdate = 2012-10-29 | publisher = [[Phoronix]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTIzMTY | title = Egosoft Wants To Bring Games To Steam On Linux | first = Michael | last= Larbel | date = 2010-11-18 | accessdate = 2012-11-25 | publisher = [[Phoronix]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; including previously [[Mac OS]] only porting houses such as [[Aspyr Media]] and [[Feral Interactive]].&lt;ref name="GOLEditorial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/editorial-linux-gaming-will-be-fine-even-without-steam-machines-succeeding.4992|title=Editorial: Linux Gaming Will Be Fine Even Without Steam Machines Succeeding|publisher=[[GamingOnLinux]]|date=2015-02-20|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, [[Unity Technologies]] ported their [[Unity (game engine)|Unity engine]] and game creation system to Linux starting with version 4. All of the games created with the Unity engine can now be ported to Linux easily.&lt;ref name="UnityLinux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/unity-40-launches-1726144.htm|title=Unity 4.0 Launches|publisher=[[Marketwire]]|date=2012-11-14|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 Valve announced that they were releasing a gaming oriented Linux based operating system called ''[[SteamOS]]'' with Valve saying they had "come to the conclusion that the environment best suited to delivering value to customers is an operating system built around Steam itself."&lt;ref name="arstechnica2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/valve-reveals-steamos-6414851 |title=Valve reveals SteamOS |date=23 September 2013 |accessdate=25 September 2013 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |work=GameSpot |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926171011/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/valve-reveals-steamos-6414851 |archivedate=26 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014 [[GOG.com]] announced they would begin to support Linux titles on their [[Digital rights management|DRM]] free store starting the same year, after previously stating they would not be able due to too many distributions.&lt;ref name="GOGLinux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/gogcom-are-going-to-support-linux-confirmed.3288|title=GOG.com Are Going To Support Linux, Confirmed!|publisher=[[GamingOnLinux]]|date=2014-03-18|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOG.com began their initial roll out on July 24, 2014 by offering 50 Linux supporting titles, including several new to the platform.&lt;ref name="GOGLinuxLaunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/gog-com-now-officially-support-linux-games.4076|title=GOG Com Now Officially Support Linux Games|publisher=[[GamingOnLinux]]|date=2014-07-24|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and April 2014 two major developers [[Epic Games]] and [[Crytek]] announced Linux support for their next generation engines [[Unreal Engine 4]] and [[CryEngine]] respectively.&lt;ref name="UE4Linux"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/41-update-preview|title=Unreal Engine 4.1 Update Preview|date=2014-04-03|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CryengineLinux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crytek.com/news/conference-attendees-can-also-see-a-brand-new-mobile-game-extra-engine-updates-and-much-more-at-crytek-s-booth|title=CRYENGINE adds Linux Support as Crytek Prepare to Offer New Possibilities at GDC|date=2014-03-11|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2018, Valve released their fork of [[Wine (software)|Wine]] called Proton, aimed at gaming. It features some improvements over the vanilla Wine such as Vulkan-based DirectX 11 and 12 implementations, Steam integration, better full screen and game controller support and improved performance for multi-threaded games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561|title=Steam for Linux :: Introducing a new version of Steam Play|date=2018-08-21|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market share vs. installed base ==
{{see also|Linux adoption#Desktop Linux adoption}}
Market share can be estimated based on sales numbers, e.&amp;nbsp;g. during Q2 2013, 79.3% of smartphones ''sold'' worldwide were running [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/07/android-nears-80-market-share-in-global-smartphone-shipments-as-ios-and-blackberry-share-slides-per-idc/ | title = Android Nears 80% Market Share In Global Smartphone Shipments}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When discussing free and open-source software, the term "installed base" seems rather popular. It is installation, not embedment or pre-installation, that tailors a product to the owner's personal needs. Unfortunately, installed base, as opposed to market share, proves to be a tricky thing to gauge.

Surveys conducted by software such as [[Ubuntu Software Center]] or Steam can only tell about the "installed base" of a particular program or version or hardware, only on the machines on which the digital distribution software is already installed.

In 2010, in the first [[Humble Bundle]] sales, Linux accounted for 18%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfire.com/humble/stats |title=Humble Budle data}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Steam (software)|Steam]] client tracks usage and reported in March 2014 that less than 1.2% of users are using some form of Linux as their platforms primary operating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/ |title=Steam Hardware &amp; Software survey|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2015 it was below 1%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/140901-Linux-Steam-Users-Under-1 Linux Users Drop to Under 1% In Latest Steam Survey] by Steven Bogos on the [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] (26 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] [[game engine]] gathers user statistics and showed in that March 2016 Linux users accounted for 0.4% of players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hwstats.unity3d.com/pc/os.html Platforms Top on 2016-03] ''Windows Players: 97.3%, OS X Players: 2.3%, Linux Players: 0.4%''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supported hardware ==
Linux as a gaming platform can also refer to operating systems based on the Linux kernel and specifically designed for the ''sole purpose'' of gaming. Examples are [[SteamOS]], which is an operating system for [[Steam Machine (hardware platform)|Steam Machines]] and computers, [[video game console]]s built from components found in the classical home computer, (embedded) operating systems like [[Tizen]] and [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]], and [[handheld game console]]s like [[GP2X]], and [[Neo Geo X]]. The [[Nvidia Shield]] runs Android as an operating system, which is based on a modified Linux kernel.

The [[Open-source software|open source]] design of the Linux software platform allows the operating system to be compatible with various computer [[instruction set]]s and many [[peripherals]], such as [[game controller]]s and [[head-mounted display]]s. As an example, [[HTC Vive]], which is a [[virtual reality]] head-mounted display, [[list of games with HTC Vive support|supports]] the Linux gaming platform.

=== Performance ===
In 2013, tests by [[Phoronix]] showed real-world performance of games on Linux with proprietary Nvidia and AMD drivers were mostly comparable to results on Windows 8.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=gpus_windows81_ubuntu&amp;num=1 |title=Ubuntu Linux Gaming Performance Mostly On Par With Windows 8.1 |publisher=[[Phoronix]] |date=2013-10-27 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoronix]] found similar results in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=win10-nv-ubu1504&amp;num=4|title=NVIDIA GeForce: Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu 15.04 Linux OpenGL Benchmarks Review - Phoronix|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Ars Technica]] described a 20% performance drop with Linux drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/|title=SteamOS gaming performs significantly worse than Windows, Ars analysis shows|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software architecture ==
An operating system based on the Linux kernel and customized specifically for gaming, could adopt the [[Vanilla (software)|vanilla]] Linux kernel with only little changes, or&amp;mdash;like the Android operating system&amp;mdash;be based on a relative extensively modified Linux kernel. It could adopt [[GNU C Library]] or [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]] or something like it. The entire [[middleware]] or parts of it, could very well be closed-source and [[proprietary software]]; the same is true for the video games. There are free and open-source video games available for the Linux operating system, as well as proprietary ones.

=== Linux kernel ===
The subsystems already mainlined and available in the [[Linux kernel]] are most probably performant enough so to not impede the gaming experience in any way{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, however additional software is available, such as e.g. the [[Brain Fuck Scheduler]] (a process scheduler) or the Budget Fair Queueing (BFQ) scheduler (an I/O scheduler).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/ |title=Budget Fair Queueing I/O Scheduler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the way the Linux kernel can be, for example, adapted to run better on supercomputers, there are adaptations targeted at improving the performance of games. A project concerning itself with this issue is called [[Liquorix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=liquorix_311_kernel&amp;num=1 |title=Phoronix: Liquorix-benchmarks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liquorix.net/ |title=Liquorix homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Available software for video game designers ===

==== Debuggers ====
Several game development tools have been available for Linux, including [[GNU Debugger]], [[LLDB (debugger)|LLDB]], [[Valgrind]], glslang and others. [[VOGL]], a [[debugger]] for [[OpenGL]] was released on {{date|2014-03-12}}. See also [[Game Editor]], APITrace and [[GtkRadiant]]. [[AMD CodeXL]]. An open-source, cross-platform clone of [[Enterbrain]]'s [[RPG Maker]] (2000, 2003, XP, VX), called OpenRPG Maker, is currently in development.

==== {{Anchor|APIs}}Available interfaces and SDKs ====
There are a couple of [[Application programming interface|interfaces]] and [[Software Development Kit]]s available for Linux, almost all of them are [[cross-platform]]. Most are [[free and open-source software]] subject to the terms of the [[zlib License]], making it possible to static link against them from fully closed-source proprietary software. One difficulty due to this abundance of interfaces, is the difficulty for programmers to choose the best suitable audio API for their purpose. The main developer of the [[PulseAudio]] project, [[Lennart Poettering]], commented on this issue.&lt;ref name="guideaudiojungle"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/guide-to-sound-apis.html

Physics engines, audio libraries, that are available as modules for game engines, have been available for Linux for a long time.

The book ''[[Programming Linux Games]]'' covers a couple of the available APIs suited for video game development for Linux, while ''[[The Linux Programming Interface]]'' covers the [[Linux kernel interfaces]] in much greater detail.

==== Available middleware ====
Beside majority of the software which acts as an interface to various subsystems of the operating system, there is also software which can be simply described as middleware. A multitude of companies exist worldwide, whose main or only product is software that is meant to be licensed and integrated into a game engine. Their primary target is the [[video game industry]], but the film industry also utilizes such software for special effects. Some very few well known examples are
* classical physics: [[Havok (software)|Havok]], [[Newton Game Dynamics]] and PhysX
* audio: [[Audiokinetic Wwise]], [[FMOD]]
* other: [[SpeedTree]]
A significant share of the available middleware already runs natively on Linux, only a very few run exclusively on Linux.

==== Available IDEs and source code editors ====
Numerous [[source code editor]]s and [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]s are available for Linux, among which are [[Visual Studio Code]], [[Sublime Text]], [[Code::Blocks]], [[Qt Creator]], [[Emacs]], or [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]].

=== Multi-monitor ===
A [[multi-monitor]] setup is supported on Linux at least by [[AMD Eyefinity]] &amp; [[AMD Catalyst]], [[Xinerama]] and [[RandR]] on both X11 and Wayland. ''[[Serious Sam 3: BFE]]'' is one example of a game that runs natively on Linux and supports very high resolutions and is validated by AMD to support their Eyefinity.&lt;ref name="AMD Eyefinity Validated"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.amd.com/en-us/recommended/eyefinity-software |title=AMD Eyefinity Validated and Ready Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Civilization V]]'' is another example, it even runs on a [[List of AMD Accelerated Processing Unit microprocessors#"Kaveri" (2014, 28 nm)|"Kaveri" desktop APU]] in 3x1 portrait mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0BN20BnRbg |title=Multi-monitor: Civilization V on A10-7850K "Kaveri" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voice over IP ===
The specifications of the [[Mumble (software)|Mumble]] protocol are freely available and there are BSD-licensed implementations for both servers and clients. The positional audio API of Mumble is supported by e.g. ''[[Cube 2: Sauerbraten]]''.

=== Wine ===
{{Main article|Wine (software)}}
[[wine (software)|Wine]] is a [[compatibility layer]] that provides binary compatibility and makes it possible to run software, that was written and compiled for Microsoft Windows, on Linux. The Wine project hosts a user-submitted application database (known as Wine AppDB) that lists programs and games along with ratings and reviews which detail how well they run with Wine. Wine AppDB also has a commenting system, which often includes instructions on how to modify a system to run a certain game which cannot run on a normal or default configuration. Many games are rated as running flawlessly, and there are also many other games that can be run with varying degrees of success. The use of Wine for gaming has proved controversial in the Linux community as some feel it is preventing, or at least hindering, the further growth of native gaming on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/may01/wine/ |title=Ports vs. Wine |publisher=GameSpy |last=Hills |first=James |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010511055620/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/may01/wine/ |archivedate=May 11, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_gaming_frank&amp;num=3|title=An Interview With A Linux Game Porter|publisher=[[Phoronix]]|date=July 3, 2009|last=Larabel|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Larabel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emulators ===
There are numerous [[emulator]]s for Linux. There are also APIs, virtual machines, and machine emulators that provide binary compatibility:

{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Basilisk II]] for the [[Motorola 68040|68040]] [[Macintosh]];
* [[DOSBox]] and [[DOSEMU]] for MS-DOS/PC DOS and compatibles;
* [[Dolphin (emulator)|Dolphin]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[Wii]], and the [[Triforce (arcade system board)|Triforce]];
* [[FCEUX]], [[Nestopia]] and [[TuxNES]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]];
* [[Frotz]] for Z-Machine text adventures;
* [[Fuse (emulator)|Fuse]] for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum;

=== Linux homebrew on consoles ===
{{Main article|Homebrew (video games)}}
Linux has been ported to several game consoles, including the [[Xbox Linux|Xbox]], [[Linux for PlayStation 2|PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3|PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4|PlayStation 4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2015/console-hacking-2015-liner-notes.html|title = Console Hacking 2015: Liner Notes|publisher = fail0verflow.com|date = 30 Dec 2015|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameCube]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page |title=Gamecube Linux Wiki |publisher=Gc-linux.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wii]] which allows game developers without an expensive [[game development kit]] to access console hardware. Several gaming peripherals also work with Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=ODY1Mw|title=A Gaming Mouse Vendor That Has Linux Drivers|publisher=[[Phoronix]]|date=October 5, 2010|last=Larabel|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Larabel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTg3NA|title=Roccat Linux Support Keeps Coming|publisher=[[Phoronix]]|date=September 5, 2011|last=Larabel|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Larabel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption by game engines ==
[[File:Linux kernel and OpenGL video games.svg|thumb|300px|The [[game engine]] is important for players and developers alike. The development-kit is built around it, game editors use it to build levels. Tools such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]] or [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3ds Max]] are employed to create the geometry of object and/or animations of those. Game data has reached enormous amounts. While game engines are sometimes released under some free software license, instead or additionally to licensing them, the game data is usually not.]]
{{See also|List of game engines|List of game engine recreations}}

The game engine is the software solely responsible for the ''game mechanics'', or rules defining game play. There are different game engines for [[first-person shooter]]s, [[strategy video game]]s, etc. Besides the game mechanics, software is also needed to handle graphics, audio, physics, input handling, and networking.

Game engines that are used by many video games and run on top of Linux include:

* [[C4 Engine]] ([[Terathon Software]])
* [[CryEngine]] ([[Crytek]])
* [[Diesel (game engine)|Diesel]] 2.0 ([[Grin (company)|Grin]])
* [[HPL Engine]] 1–3 ([[Frictional Games]])
* [[id Tech]] 1–4. ([[id Software]])
* [[Serious Engine]] ([[Croteam]])
* [[Source (game engine)|Source]] ([[Valve Corporation]])
* [[Unigine]] ([[Unigine Corp]])
* [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] 5 ([[Unity Technologies]])
* [[Unreal Engine]] 1-4 ([[Epic Games]])

== Adoption by video games ==

"It took Halo for the first Xbox to kick off and go crazy — usually, it takes one killer app or game and then people are more than willing [to adopt it] — it is not hard to get your hands on Linux, for example, it only takes one game that motivates you to go there.}}

=== Commercial games for non-x86 instruction sets ===
Some companies ported games to Linux running on instruction sets other than x86, such as [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[PowerPC]], [[Sparc]], MIPS or ARM. Loki Entertainment Software ported ''Civilization: Call to Power'', ''Eric's Ultimate Solitaire'', ''Heroes of Might and Magic III'', ''Myth II: Soulblighter'', ''Railroad Tycoon II Gold Edition'' and ''Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri'' with Alien Crossfire expansion pack to Linux PowerPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxgames.com/?s=PPC+loki|title=PPC games made by Loki software – rrelated posts LinuxGames|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019170037/http://www.linuxgames.com/?s=PPC+loki|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also ported ''Civilization: Call to Power'', ''Eric's Ultimate Solitaire'', ''Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri'' with Alien Crossfire expansion pack to Linux Alpha and ''Civilization: Call to Power,'' ''Eric's Ultimate Solitaire'' to Linux SPARC.

Runesoft hired Gunnar von Boehn which ported ''Robin Hood – The Legend of Sherwood'' to Linux PowerPC. Later Runesoft ported ''Airline Tycoon Deluxe'' to [[Raspberry Pi]] was running [[Debian GNU/Linux]].

=== Source ports ===
{{Main article|Source port}}
[[File:SimCity-Indigo.gif|right|200px|thumb|''[[Micropolis (video game)|Micropolis]]'', an open source port of ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'']]

Several developers have released the source code to many of their legacy titles, allowing them to be run as native applications on many alternative platforms, including Linux. Examples of games which were ported to Linux this way include ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', ''[[Shadow Warrior]]'', ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'', ''[[Ken's Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Seven Kingdoms (video game)|Seven Kingdoms]]'', ''[[Warzone 2100]]'', ''[[Homeworld]]'', ''[[Call to Power II]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic|Hexen]]'', ''[[Hexen II]]'', ''[[Aliens versus Predator (video game)|Aliens versus Predator]]'', ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'', ''[[Descent II]]'' and ''[[Freespace 2]]''. Several game titles that were previously released for Linux were also able to be expanded or updated because of the availability of game code, including ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Abuse'', ''Quake'', ''Quake II'', ''Quake III Arena'' and ''Jagged Alliance 2''. Some derivatives based on released source code have also been released for Linux, such as ''[[Aleph One]]'' and ''Micropolis'' for ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]'' and ''SimCity'' respectively.

Certain game titles were even able to be ported due to availability of shared engine code even though the game's code itself remains proprietary or otherwise unavailable, such as the video game ''[[Strife: Quest for the Sigil|Strife]]'' or the multiplayer component of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force]]''. Some games have even been ported entirely or partially by [[reverse engineering]] and [[game engine recreation]] such as ''[[WarCraft II]]'' through ''[[Wargus]]'' or ''[[Commander Keen]]''. Another trick is to attempt hacking the game to work as a [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] on another native title, such as with the original ''[[Unreal (1998 video game)|Unreal]]''. Additionally, some games can be run through the use of Linux specific runtime environments, such as the case of certain games made with [[Adventure Game Studio]] such as the ''[[Chzo Mythos]]'' or certain titles made with the [[RPG Maker]] tool. Games derived from released code, with both free and proprietary media, that are released for Linux include ''[[Urban Terror]]'', ''[[OpenArena]]'', ''[[FreeDoom]]'', ''[[World of Padman]]'', ''[[Nexuiz]]/[[Xonotic]]'', ''[[Warsow (video game)|War§ow]]'' and ''[[Excalibur: Morgana's Revenge]]''.

Aylwin Cotton, O.B.E., Hon. F.B.A. F.S.A 1902-1984. Papers of the British School at Rome 52: 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; was a British archaeologist, noted for her work in Iron Age Britain and Roman Italy.

== Biography ==
Cotton was one of the first students to take the postgraduate diploma in archaeology at the recently founded [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]], London. She became deputy director of excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]] in 1936 alongside [[Mortimer Wheeler]], following the death of [[Tessa Wheeler]].&lt;ref name="Potter1984"/&gt; She undertook excavations on the defences of [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]] from 1938-9.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, M. A. 1947. Excavations at Silchester 1938-9. Archaeologia 92: 121-167.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton worked at the Ministry of Economic Warfare during [[World War II]] and received the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Potter1984"/&gt; In 1949 she co-directed excavations at [[Verulamium]] alongside [[Mortimer Wheeler]] and excavated at [[Clausentum]] from 1951-54.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, M. and Gathercole, P. 1958. Excavations at Clausentum, Southampton, 1951-1954. London : H.M. Stationery Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s Cotton became closely involved in the work of the [[British School at Rome]]. She was the field director of the first 'scientific' excavations of a Republican villa in Italy, directed by [[John Bryan Ward-Perkins]] and [[Peter von Blanckenhagen]], "but essentially the project was hers".&lt;ref name="Potter1984"/&gt; The excavations at Posto and San Rocco (1962–65) were fully published.&lt;ref&gt;* Cotton, M. 1979. The Late Republican Villa at Posto Francolise. London: British School at Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Cotton, M. and Métraux, G. 1985. The San Rocco villa at Francolise. London: British School at Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965, Cotton was resident in Rome, and ran the archaeological work room of the [[British School at Rome]],&lt;ref name="Potter1984"/&gt; including work on the finds from the cemetery of Quattro Fontanili at [[Veii]], Monte Irsi, Basilicata (1970) and [[Tuscania]] (1972-73).

In her later years, Cotton continued to work on Latian archaeology, whilst continuing to attend conferences.&lt;ref name="Potter1984"/&gt; She received an honorary fellowship of the [[British Academy]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/dec.cfm?member=4344 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225051/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/dec.cfm?member=4344 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mummies Alive!''''' is a Canadian-American [[list of animated television series|animated series]] from [[DIC Entertainment]] and [[Ivan Reitman|Northern Lights Entertainment]]. It originally aired for one season in 1997.

In ancient Egypt, an evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] named Scarab kills the pharaoh's son, [[Prince]] [[Rapses]], to become [[Immortality|immortal]]. [[Premature burial|Entombed alive]] for his crime (Rapses' body was also never found), Scarab revives in the modern world and begins his search for Rapses' reincarnation, a [[San Francisco]]-dwelling boy named Presley Carnovan, to retrieve the spirit of Rapses so he can become immortal. Rapses' (Presley's) bodyguards, Ja-Kal, Rath, Armon, and Nefer-Tina, along with Rapses' cat, Kahti, awake from the dead to protect him from Scarab. They use the power of Ra to transform into powerful guardians.

Each of the mummies is aligned with the power of an Egyptian god. Ja-Kal uses the spirit of falcon, Rath uses the spirit of snake, Armon uses the spirit of ram, and Nefer-Tina uses the spirit of cat. They are able to call upon it for magical armor and powers to fight superhuman evildoers. Although, once their strength is exhausted, they must rest in their [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] to regain the ability. In order to access these powers, the mummies call out the phrase "With the Strength of Ra!", which triggers their transformation. The mummies also have the power to make a horrifying face, usually used to scare away nosy bystanders.

In addition to Scarab, the mummies often had to contend with gods and spirits from Egyptian myth summoned to the modern world, including [[Anubis]], [[Set (mythology)|Set]], [[Geb]], [[Apep]], [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]], [[Sekhmet]], [[Bes]], and many others, usually as part of one of Scarab's schemes that went out of his control.

==Production and airing==
Originally, ''Mummies Alive'' was geared towards an older audience, but during production it became predominately a children's show. The series ran for one season of 42 episodes; the last two episodes link together to end the show, as it appears episodes 38–40 were the finale of the first season. A second season was planned, but due to low ratings, it was canceled.

Eric and Julia Lewald, writers/producers for ''Mummies Alive!'', were also head writers for the third season of the ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' animated series, and programs share common plot elements, including a group of warriors from the past that awaken in the present to fight a wealthy, immortality-obsessed enemy; their initial difficulties in adapting to the modern world; the use of mythological figures in numerous episodes; and a recurring femme fatale antagonist. These similarities made ''Mummies Alive!'' vulnerable to criticism describing it as little more than a ''Gargoyles'' clone.

After its first and only season, repeats of ''Mummies Alive!'' continued to air on local stations across the country. The series previously aired every Sunday on [[Cookie Jar Toons]] on [[This TV]].

In [[India]], the show was dubbed into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]] and aired on [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]] and [[Amrita TV]] in the early 2000s, becoming popular in [[South India]].

==Characters==

===Main characters===

====Humans====
'''Presley Carnovan''' – voiced by [[Bill Switzer]]&lt;br /&gt;
A 12-year-old boy who has the spirit of Prince Rapses XII (an ancient [[pharaoh]]) who is based on Ramses. He soon discovers this when the Mummies introduce themselves as his guardians. He lives in San Francisco with his mother. He is reluctant to accept his role as Rapses, but on at least two occasions where he had the chance to be freed of his role, when Rapses's father apparently came through the Western Gate and when the original Rapses was drawn into the present, he expressed reluctance at losing his status as 'pharaoh' because it would have also meant him losing the mummies.

*'''Prince Rapses''' – was the heir to the Egyptian throne 3500 years ago. He was protected by the Mummies (before they were Mummies), but was killed when he was Presley's age by Scarab{{Clarify|reason=|date=February 2018}}. This story is told in ''Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian''. His spirit now lies within Presley, and is drawn out by Scarab in several episodes. Rapses himself comes to the present in ''The Prince and the Presley'', when Scarab steals a time travel scroll to draw him to the present in the hopes that he would be easier to capture than the present Presley. Rapses returns to the past at the end of the episode.

'''Amanda Carnovan''' – voiced by [[Stevie Vallance|Louise Vallance]]&lt;br /&gt;
Presley's mother. She works at the City Museum. In ''Ghouls' Gold'', Armon refers to her as "the wise Amanda" when recalling advice she gave Presley. She has insecure feelings that Presley misses being with his father, who is away on business, and tries to bond with her son often.

====Mummies====
'''Ja-Kal''' – voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]&lt;br /&gt;
The leader of the Mummies. In his transformed state, his armor resembles a falcon and also allows him to fly. His weapon is his razor sharp talons/claws and a bow that can shoot out flaming arrows. In ancient Egypt, Ja-Kal was a hunter who had a wife named Tia and a small baby son named Padjet; he died without knowing what happened to his family. He worries the most of Presley's safety, often acting as a father-figure to him. He commonly uses hunting terms to talk to others and explain situations. Ja-Kal commonly cares for other people's needs first and himself second. It was revealed in episode 39 that he had a brother, Arakh, who was a notorious bandit.

'''Rath''' – voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]&lt;br /&gt;
The most intelligent of the Mummies (but also the most arrogant), and also the only one able to cast spells. When he transforms, a green snake which turns into a golden cobra wraps around him and serves as his armor. His weapon of choice is a sword that can transform into a snake, but he is also able to perform magical incantations. He also designed and built the Mummies' vehicles. In the past, he served as the young Prince's tutor. He claims to know about science, but his definition is such things as turning a staff into a serpent, although he has learned to adapt some spells to the present (such as a spell that summoned underground snakes to bind his enemies in the past,  but now summons electric cables in the present). Though they are enemies, Scarab does respect him for his spellcasting skills.

'''Armon''' – voiced by Graeme Kingston&lt;br /&gt;
Armon is huge and eats very often. He is very strong even when he has not transformed. He is missing his right arm and when he transforms he obtains a golden arm that is used as his weapon. His armor resembles a [[Sheep|ram]]. In ''Ghouls' Gold'', it was explained that Armon lost his real arm fighting in the Pharaoh's army. The pharaoh then gave him his golden arm. While not fighting, Armon spends most of his time eating or watching 'the magic box' TV that Presley gave them. In the past, Armon was Rapses' teacher of combat.

'''Nefer-Tina''' – voiced by [[Cree Summer]]&lt;br /&gt;
She is the only female of the Mummies. She is an expert with her whip, has great agility, and is extremely proficient at driving the Hot-Ra — the Mummies' dragster-like vehicle. When she transforms, her armor is like a cat. Back in ancient Egypt, she had to hide the fact that she was a girl with a head piece or she would not have been allowed to drive chariots. She was known to everyone as Nefer. Only Prince Rapses knew her true identity during that period of time. Ja-Kal and the other members were shocked to find out about the revelation. Armon then comments "No wonder he never went swimming in the Nile with us". Out of the group, she is the only one who is absolutely willing to try anything modern, such as driving a car, and constantly learns under Presley. She also travels the modern world in disguise to try new things. Nefer-Tina's name was based on Queen [[Nefertiti]].

'''Scarab''' – voiced by Gerard Plunkett&lt;br /&gt;
The Pharaoh's adviser, who later sucked the life force from Prince Rapses for youth and immortality. However the effects were not permanent and started to wear off after a few centuries. Now with Prince Rapses reincarnated as Presley Carnovan, he will stop at nothing to steal the prince's life force again. When Scarab transforms, his body is covered in golden and purple armor, resembling that of a [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]] and possessing the power of flight. He also possesses a magical talking snake named Heka that acts as his magical staff from time to time, much to her dismay. His powers include shooting energy blasts from his hands, the creation of Shabti and extensive knowledge in summoning creatures from the afterlife in ancient Egypt. However, he has also shown a good grasp of modern technology, as shown most keenly in ''Sleight of Hand'', where he used technology while competing against the mummies in a mystical contest to try to become Presley's 'guardian' himself (Although Ja-Kal and Presley were able to expose the deception at the last minute).

*'''Harris Stone'''
The identity Scarab takes when he needs to be in public. Harris Stone is known as a wealthy individual. As a major benefactor for the Museum, he gives a speech in ''Who's Who'' that is one to remember. Even though he is trying to kill Rapses, Scarab feels responsible for the Egyptian artifacts of the museum and feels a degree of sadness when they are damaged. He is also quick to offer money to people who oppose his point of view. Scarab killed the real Harris Stone when he discovered his crypt and inadvertedly freed him, and took over his identity.

*'''[[Heka (god)|Heka]]''' – voiced by [[Pauline Newstone]]
The Snake Familiar, and sometimes Staff, of Scarab. She acts as his loyal companion and advisory, who often makes snide, sarcastic remarks and witty observations. She also has the ability to spit fire.

===Other characters===

====Ancient Egyptians====
*'''Amenhotep'''
Prince Rapses' father, the Pharaoh and ruler of all of Egypt. He was a good Pharaoh and was very respected by all his people. He appears in Scarab and Presley's dreams in ''Pack to the Future''. In ''Reunion'', Scarab makes the Mummies believe that Amenhotep has returned. In ''Family Feud I – Brother's Keeper'', Amenhotep appears in some of Ja-Kal's recollections.

*'''[[Ammit|Ammut]]''' (Devourer of Souls)
Scarab's dog-like pet. He has the head of a crocodile, the body of a lion and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus. Presley describes him in Pack to the Future as "That's the ugliest dog I've ever seen." Ammut was not summoned by Scarab but simply tagged along with the Pack, and then stuck around -he usually messes up anything Scarab tells him to do. Ammut has good parts in ''Pack to the Future'' and ''Who's Who''. In Egyptian Mythology, [[Ammut]] is female.

*'''[[Apep]]''' – voiced by [[Jason Gray-Stanford]]
Serpent of the Desert. An anthropomorph cobra-like creature with an ability to change shape into a young human man. Rapses' grandfather drove Apep out of Egypt and into the desert 3500 years ago. Apep is after revenge and wants Rapses to pay for what his grandfather did to him and when Scarab summons him and his gang, they take on the shapes of a motorbiker gang. However, upon meeting and fighting Nefer-Tina, he falls in love with her and decides to disobey Scarab. Apep appears in ''Desert Chic'' and ''Pepped With Good Intention''.

*'''Arakh'''
Arakh is Ja-Kal's evil brother and was known as the "Scorpion of the Desert". He can transform into his Scorpion armor. His story is told in the three "Family Feud" episodes.

*'''[[Bastet]]'''
Cat Goddess of ancient Egypt and the patron goddess of Nefer-Tina, brought to the present in ''Paws''. She demands to be worshiped by the people.

*'''[[Bes]]'''
Master of Chance and Trickery. He is a small mischievous green dwarf who enjoys playing games on people. He especially enjoys flipping a coin to decide on outcomes quite similar to Batman's Two-Face. Bes appears in ''Who's Who'' and ''Tree O'Clock Rock''.

*'''Enchantra'''
Rath's student of magic 3500 years ago. She was the best student he ever had, and she became more powerful than Rath. Rath was falling in love with her, but had to stop teaching Chontra when the pharaoh ordered him to teach Prince Rapses. For that, Chontra became vengeful and wants to make Rath pay. She gets her first chance in ''Good Bye Mr. Cheops''. She tries again in ''Tempting Offer'' and ''Eye of the Beholder''.

*'''The Eye Of Darkness'''
Horrific monster trapped in a mirror. No one knows his origin. Every 3500 years, when the planets align, he seeks the soul of a Pharaoh so he can exchange himself with the spirit to free himself from the mirror. The Pharaoh's soul would then be lost until the planets realign in 3500 more years (A fact that allowed the Mummies to deduce that Scarab was not involved in its release as Scarab would want Presley's soul for himself). Once unleashed, no power on earth would be able to stop him. Only the one who sets the spell in motion can stop him. The Eye of Darkness makes its appearance in ''The Face in the Mirror''.

*'''[[Geb]]'''
Spirit of the Earth – a huge rock giant that makes earthquakes when he walks. He is a rather unintelligent giant that attacks anyone who disturbs him. Geb is first featured in ''The Gift of Geb''. Geb also has a major part in ''Monster Truck Mania''. It is revealed that he is married to Net, goddess of the sky, in ''Married to the Geb''.

*'''Ka'''
A headless and bodiless guy with just two arms who is a spirit that lives inside Scarab and comes out of his mouth. For an example, see ''Body Slam''. In ancient Egyptian religion, the [[Egyptian soul#Ka (life force)|Ka]] is the spirit of a man's soul and is represented by the symbol of two upright arms.

*'''Kahti'''
The sacred cat, sometimes called the sacred kitty. Kahti can transform into a bigger, more-powerful, lynx-sized cat. She was Prince Rapses' pet 3500 years ago, and occasionally serves as Presley's more 'immediate' guardian by staying near him when he is not with the other Mummies, her small size allowing her to escape being noticed.

*'''Kenna'''
Friend of Nefer-Tina 3500 years ago. Enchantra appears as Kenna in ''Eye of the Beholder''.

*'''Kimas'''
Arakh's son and Ja-Kal's nephew. He might not truly be considered a bad guy, but does side with Scarab and cause the Mummies a lot of grief before he determines where his true allegiances lie. He also can transform into Scorpion armor like his father. Kimas appears in the second and third "Family Feud" episodes.

*'''[[Nut (goddess)|Net]]''' (Spirit of the Sky)
A cloudlike being who can produce rain and lightning and can turn into a tornado. Geb and Net might be called your typical married couple. They have a little spat in ''Married to the Geb''.  In mythology, Net is spelled as "Nut", however, she and Geb are spouses and siblings of each other.

*'''[[Nu (mythology)|Nuhn]]''' (Spirit of the Primeval Waters)
A powerful water-spirit occasionally summoned by Scarab for various schemes. He is self-important, irreverent, and has a morbid, yet slapstick sense of humor.  Nuhn appears in ''High Nuhn'' and ''Water, Water, Everywhere''.

*'''[[Sekhmet]]'''
Ancient goddess of sickness and health. She has destroyed whole civilizations with her evil temper. Unlike in actual Egyptian depiction where she is a lion-headed goddess, she has the head of a vulture in this version. Nobody was ever able to defeat her. Sekhmet appears in ''The Curse of the Sekhmet'' when Scarab summons her to cure his cold - enraged at being summoned for such a trifle, she sets out to destroy the city and Scarab and Rath have to team up to banish her.

*'''[[Set (mythology)|Set]] and [[Anubis]]''' – voiced by [[Scott McNeil]] (Set) and Blu Mankuma (Anubis)
Set is a bulldog-headed spirit who is leader of the "Trackers of Souls". He calls himself "Dog of the Desert, Master of Evil, Lord of Thunder". Anubis, the not-so-competent jackal (wild dog) spirit of the underworld, tags along with Set. Anubis has a scepter that causes "the sleep of forgetting". They appear in ''Pack to the Future'', ''The Face In The Mirror'', ''Dog Bites Mummy'', and ''Family Feud I – Brother's Keeper''. They are often summoned by Scarab, but occasionally did turn on him when they did not like to be ordered around. Unlike in real Egyptian mythology, where Anubis is a mostly neutral and clever god, he is one of the villains and is rather dim-witted, often being outsmarted by Presley. In Egyptian Mythology, Set doesn't have the head of a dog.

*'''[[Ushabti|Shabti]]'''
Golem-like armies of men made of clay controlled by Scarab. They are very easy to defeat as they break into pieced when toppled, however usually there are quite many of them. They also shatter easily when hit and dissolve in water. They most often look like Egyptians, but can be dressed up as anything, such as construction workers or policemen. Sometimes, if they are broken in half, both halves can still function independently.

*'''[[Talos]]''' (Man of Bronze)
Brought to life by Scarab. In natural form he is 100 feet tall, but can reduce his size. In ''Body Slam'', he reduces himself to about 10 feet tall and 500 pounds for the Tournament. Then in ''Miscast'', he is recreated by Rath. He comes back looking for a mate in ''Object of His Affections''. [[Talos]] is from Greek mythology. The human anklebone is called the "Talus".

*'''Tia'''
Ja-Kal's wife 3500 years ago. They had a small baby son named Padjet. In ''Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian'', we see the scene of the last time Ja-Kal sees Tia and Padjet. Tia gives Ja-Kal an imprint of his son's hand. This hand print is now a sad memory for Ja-Kal of the family he once had. At the end of ''Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian'', Presley asks Ja-Kal, "What happened to your family?" Ja-Kal responds sadly with, "I don't know." Presley then says, "It was Rapses fault – my fault! I don't know how, but some day I'll make it up to you. I promise!" Ja-Kal thinks about Tia and Padjet in ''Eye of the Beholder'' and Chontra appears as Tia.

====Modern humans====
* '''Agent Phillips'''
Works as a Regional Subdirector for the Department of Federal Investigation. He analyzes Rath in ''We've Got One''.

* '''Bix Bingsley'''
A clumsy, nerdy sales clerk who sells clothes but is allergic to wool. Nonetheless, he gets a kiss from Nefer-Tina in ''True Believer''.

* '''Bob'''
Rotund police officer, and Joe Pendleton's partner.

* '''Cynthia Lu'''
Walter's older sister. Presley has a crush on her, but she is a couple of years older than Presley and likes Benjamin who is in college. Cynthia usually cannot even remember Presley's name and calls him "Preston" or "Wesley".

* '''Charlie the Janitor'''
The janitor at the City Museum. Murdoch is his dog. Charlie is an old navy man. He is really proud of the times when he met Mike Conners (Mannix) in '62. "That was when me and Larry met Kojak." Charlie appears in ''Honey, I Shrunk the Mummies''.

* '''Elaine Setter'''
She is a student in Presley's grade. She likes Presley, but often has a tough time getting his attention.

* '''Joe Pendleton'''
Joe is a police officer, and the Regional Treasurer of the Third Annual Paranormal Alien Visitors Psychic Convention and Brat-Bust. He finally meets his first "space alien" in ''A Dark and Shrieky Night'' when Ja-Kal humors him by making it sound like he is from outer space. Joe and Bob both get deeply involved with the "aliens" in ''We've Got One''. They also appear briefly in many other episodes. Joe is featured in the final episode ''Show Me the Mummy!''.

* '''Milton Huxley'''
Presley's science teacher. Known as Mr. Huxley to his students, and considered to be a "science geek", he is someone who never has fun. He also believes there is an explanation for everything. He has starring roles in ''Good Bye Mr. Cheops'' and ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Huxley''. He also appears in ''Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian'', ''The Gift of Geb'', ''The Curse of the Sekhmet'', ''Missing Ja-Kal'', and ''Eye of the Beholder''.

* '''Mr. Hepplewhite'''
Amanda Carnovan's boss and the director of the Museum. He makes appearances in ''Ra, Ra, Ra, Ra'', ''Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian'', and ''Pack to the Future''.

* '''Mr. Ludie'''
Owns the Java Spot cafe. Presley's mother spends some time with him in ''Tempting Offer''.

* '''Paul Carnovan'''
Presley's father who lives in Memphis (presumably Presley's parents are divorced). His dad claims to be an archeologist, but his true activities are somewhat suspect. He visits Presley in ''My Dad the Hero''.

* '''Professor Henry Bogglesworth'''
An expert but extremely bad and boring lecturer who discovered the scroll that can open the gates of time. His lecture takes place at the beginning of ''The Prince and the Presley''.

* '''The General'''
Head of Federal Investigation and is Agent Phillips' boss.

* '''Theo, Rosey, Wilcox, and Max'''
Four homeless street people who befriend Rath when he loses his memory in ''Dead Man Walking''.

==Home video release and action figures==
In 1998, a [[VHS]] entitled ''Mummies Alive! – The Legend Begins'' was released. DVDs have also been released including ''Mummies Alive: The Beginning'' and two volume sets in 2007. In 2017, three volumes of double DVDs were released in Germany, with 14 episodes on each volume. The complete 42 episode series is available as of March 24, 2017, the release date of the third and final volume. The DVDs are region 2 with German, and English audio as well.

To coincide with the animated series, [[Hasbro]] produced a series of ''Mummies Alive!'' 5" tall [[action figures]] and vehicles in 1997. There were regular and "fright face" varieties of the main mummies. Nefer-Tina and Presley got toys as well, but they are later releases and harder to find. A final wave of toys would have contained a Night Hunter Ja-Kal and Armon, as well as Cobra Strike Pep but only a few of these figures were released in some parts of Europe.

{{wikisource}}
The '''Pact of Umar''' (also known as the '''Covenant of Umar''', '''Treaty of Umar''' or '''Laws of Umar'''; {{lang-ar|شروط عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عهد عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عقد عمر}}), is an [[apocryphal]] [[treaty]] between the [[Muslims]] and the [[Christians]] of either [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]],{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}} or [[Jerusalem]]{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} that later gained a canonical status in [[Islamic jurisprudence]]. It specifies rights and restrictions for non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]) living under Islamic rule. 

There are several versions of the pact, differing both in structure and stipulations.{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} While the pact is traditionally attributed to the second [[Rashidun]] [[Caliph]] [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]],{{sfn|Thomas|Roggema|2009|p=360}} other jurists and orientalists have doubted this attribution{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} with the treaty being attributed to 9th century [[Mujtahid]]s (Islamic scholars) or the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]]. This treaty should not be confused with [[Umar's Assurance| Umar's Assurance of safety to the people of Aelia]] (known as ''al-ʿUhda al-ʿUmariyya'', {{lang-ar|العهدة العمرية}}).

In general, the pact contains a list of rights and restrictions on non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]). By abiding to them, non-Muslims are granted security of their persons, their families, and their possessions. Other rights and stipulations may also apply. According to [[Ibn Taymiyya]], one of the jurists who accepted the authenticity of the pact, the dhimmis have the right "to free themselves from the Covenant of 'Umar and claim equal status with the Muslims if they enlisted in the army of the state and fought alongside the Muslims in battle."&lt;ref name=Ipgrave&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Georgetown University Press| isbn = 1589017226| last = Ipgrave| first = Michael| title = Justice and Rights: Christian and Muslim Perspectives| year = 2009| page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and authenticity==
According to Abu-Munshar, the historical origin of the document may lie in an agreement made between the Muslim conquerors and the Christians of [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] or [[Damascus]] which was later extended to [[Dhimmi]]s elsewhere.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}  He further writes that, "The humiliating conditions enumerated in the so-called “Pact of Umar” are utterly foreign to the mentality, thoughts and practices of this caliph...The deficiencies [in the textual integrity] support the contention that Umar was not the originator of the document."&lt;ref&gt;Maher Abu-Munshar, ''Islamic Jerusalem And Its Christians: A History of Tolerance And Tensions'', pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Western historians suggest that the document was based on [[Umar's Assurance]], a treaty concluded between [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|capture of Jerusalem]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (637),{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} while others believe the document was either the work of 9th century [[Ijtihad|Mujtahids]] or was forged during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]] (717-720),&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; with other clauses added later. Other scholars concluded that the document may have originated in immediate post-conquest milieu and was stylized by later historians.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}

Western scholars' opinions varied about the Pact's authenticity. According to Anver M. Emon, "There is intense discussion in the secondary literature" about the Pact's authenticity, With scholars disagreeing on whether it might have originated during the reign of Umar b. al-Khattab or was "a later invention retroactively associated with Umar -- the caliph who famously led the initial imperial expansion -- to endow the contract of dhimma with greater normative weight?"&lt;ref name=emon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emon|first1=Anver M.|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7MDyXu6bacC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KnODVZXSK8u1-QHvp4H4Bg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A.S. Tritton is one scholar who has "suggested that the Pact is a fabrication" because later Muslim conquerors did not apply its terms to their agreements with their non-Muslim subjects, which they would have if the pact had existed earlier. on the other hand Another scholar  Daniel C. Dennet  believes that the Pact was "no different from any other treaty negotiated in that period and that it is well within reason that the Pact we have today , as preserved in al-Tabari's chronicle is an authentic version of that early treaty."&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; Historian Abraham P. Bloch writes that, "Omar was a tolerant ruler, unlikely to impose humiliating conditions upon non-Muslims, or to infringe upon their religious and social freedoms.  His name has been erroneously associated…with the restrictive Covenant of Omar."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham P. Bloch, ''One a Day: An Anthology of Jewish Historical Anniversaries for Every Day of the Year'', p. 314. {{ISBN|0881251089}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], the pact "is in harmony" with Umar's "kindly consideration for his subjects of another faith,&lt;ref name="ArnoldPoI3"&gt;{{cite book

"A later generation attributed to ‘Umar a number of restrictive regulations which hampered the Christians in the free exercise of their religion, but De Goeje and Caetani have proved without doubt that they are the invention of a later age; as, however, Muslim theologians of less tolerant periods accepted these ordinaces as genuine ....

The book ''Classical Islam: a Sourcebook of Religious Literature'', quotes a version of the Pact from ''[[Kitab al-Umm]]'' of [[al-Shafi'i]] (d.204/820) that it says may be "a forerunner to the later document which gained something of a canonical status, making it applicable in many locations ..."&lt;ref name=CIS-138&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Calder|editor1-first=Norman|editor2-last=Mojaddedi,|editor2-first=Jawid|editor3-last=Rippin|editor3-first=Andrew|title=Classical Islam: A Sourcebook of Religious Literature|publisher=Routledge.|page=138|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgLslcH9U0IC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TIaDVb3ULOrLsAT1jJmICw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is falsely believed to be a [[manually coded language|manually coded language or languages]], however there is not substantive evidence establishing a connection between any spoken language and Plains Sign Talk.

The name 'Plains Sign Talk' is preferred in Canada, with 'Indian' being considered pejorative by many. Hence, publications and reports on the language vary in naming conventions according to origin.

==History==
Plains Sign Talk's antecedents, if any, are unknown, due to lack of written records. But, the earliest records of contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples of the Gulf Coast region in what is now Texas and northern Mexico note a fully formed sign language already in use by the time of the Europeans' arrival there.&lt;ref name="Wurtzburg and Campbell"&gt;Wurtzburg, Susan, and Campbell, Lyle. "North American Indian Sign Language: Evidence for its Existence before European Contact," ''International Journal of American Linguistics,'' Vol. 61, No. 2 (Apr., 1995), pp. 153-167.&lt;/ref&gt; These records include the accounts of [[Cabeza de Vaca]] in 1527 and [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Coronado]] in 1541.

As a result of several factors, including the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|massive depopulation]] and the [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|Americanization]] of Indigenous North Americans, the number of Plains Sign Talk speakers declined from European arrival onward. In 1885, it was estimated that there were over 110,000 "sign-talking Indians", including [[Blackfoot]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Sioux]], [[Kiowa]]  and [[Arapaho]].&lt;ref name="Tomkins"&gt;Tomkins, William. ''Indian sign language.'' [Republication of "Universal Indian Sign Language of the Plains Indians of North America" 5th ed. 1931]. New York : Dover Publications 1969. (p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, there remained a "very small percentage of this number".&lt;ref name="Tomkins"/&gt;  There are few Plains Sign Talk speakers today in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=psd|title=Plains Indian Sign Language|website=ethnologue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Philo Clark]], who served in the [[United States Army]] on the northern plains during the [[Indian Wars]], was the author of ''The Indian Sign Language'', first published in 1885. ''The Indian Sign Language with Brief Explanatory Notes of the Gestures Taught Deaf-Mutes in Our Institutions and a Description of Some of the Peculiar Laws, Customs, Myths, Superstitions, Ways of Living, Codes of Peace and War Signs'' is a comprehensive lexicon of signs, with accompanying insights into indigenous cultures and histories. It remains in print.

==Geography==
Sign language use has been documented across speakers of at least 37 spoken languages in twelve families,&lt;ref name="Davis 2006"&gt;Davis, Jeffrey. 2006. "A historical linguistic account of sign language among North American Indian groups." In Multilingualism and Sign Languages: From the Great Plains to Australia; Sociolinguistics of the Deaf community, [[Ceil Lucas|C. Lucas]] (ed.), Vol. 12, pp. 3–35. Washington, DC: Gallaudet University Press&lt;/ref&gt; spread across an area of over 2.6 million square kilometres (1 million square miles).&lt;ref name="McKay-Cody 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis,2010" /&gt; In recent history, it was highly developed among the [[Crow people|Crow]], [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho people|Arapaho]] and [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]], among others, and remains strong among the Crow, Cheyenne and Arapaho.

Signing may have started in the south, perhaps in northern Mexico or Texas, and only spread into the plains in recent times, though this suspicion may be an artifact of European observation.{{Cn|date=November 2015}} Plains Sign Talk spread to the Sauk, Fox, Potawatomi, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Caddo after their removal to Oklahoma. Via the Crow, it replaced the divergent [[Plateau Sign Language]]{{Cn|date=June 2016}} among the eastern nations that used it, the Coeur d'Alene, Sanpoil, Okanagan, Thompson, Lakes, Shuswap, and Coleville in British Columbia, with western nations shifting instead to [[Chinook Jargon]].

{{anchor|Navajo}}It is known that Navajo has a comparably sizeable population of individuals who can speak the Navajo dialect of Plains Sign Talk. There is also an unrelated sign language, [[Navajo Family Sign]], in a clan of [[Navajos]] that has several deaf members.&lt;ref name=Supalla&gt;{{cite book

There exists a variety of Plains Sign Talk within the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]]. Little is known about the language beyond that it is used by Deaf community members, as well as by the community at large, to pass on "oral" traditions and stories.&lt;ref name=Blackfoot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackfootcrossing.ca/language.html|title=Language|publisher=Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
There are four basic parameters of Plains Sign Talk: the location of the hand, its movement, shape, and orientation:&lt;ref name="Bergmann et al,2007, pp. 79-86"&gt;Bergmann et al,2007, pp. 79-86&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Location (sign language)|Location]]—this involves the spatial placement of a sign.&lt;ref name="Bergmann et al,2007"&gt;Bergmann et al,2007&lt;/ref&gt; Signs may change meaning when placed in a different location, for example, in front of the face as opposed to in front of the torso.&lt;ref name="Cody,1970"&gt;Cody, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Movement (sign language)|Movement]]—this involves, as implied, the way the hands move when forming the sign.&lt;ref name="Bergmann et al,2007"/&gt; For example, in Plains Sign Talk, the signs AFTERNOON and MID-DAY form minimal pairs as they are both formed exactly the same, the only difference being that MID-DAY is stationary and AFTERNOON moves from above the head to the side in an arching motion.&lt;ref name="Davis,2010"&gt;{{Citation

| first = Jeffrey E.
| date = 2010
| title = Hand talk: Sign language among American Indian nations

| isbn = 978-0-521-69030-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomkins,1969"&gt;Tomkins,1969&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Handshape]]—as implied, each sign takes on a certain shape in the hand, called a handshape. The handshapes of signs are a very key parameter. For example, the signs YES and I-KNOW are the same in all parameters except for the handshape; in YES the hand makes the Plains Sign Talk J shape, and in I-KNOW the hand takes the L shape.&lt;ref name="Davis,2010"/&gt;
*[[Orientation (sign language)|Orientation]]—this refers to the orientation of the palm.&lt;ref name="Bergmann et al,2007"/&gt; This is clearly seen in the Plains Sign Talk words ABOVE and ADD. Both involve having the left hand act as a base from which the right hand rises, and both have the same location, movement,  and handshapes; however, in ABOVE, the non-dominant hand is palm down, and in ADD the non-dominant hand is palm up.&lt;ref name="Tomkins,1969"/&gt;

There may be other parameters, such as facial features. However, these function like [[suprasegmental]]s, and the four parameters listed above are the crucial ones.&lt;ref name="Bergmann et al,2007"/&gt;

Although the parameters of sign are listed separately below, in actuality they co-occur with the other parameters to make a single sign.&lt;ref name="Bergmann et al,2007"/&gt; It is not clear how many of the differences were distinctive ([[phoneme|phonemic]]).

===Handshape===
The Bureau of American Ethnology published a glossary of Plains Sign Talk words that illustrates the handshapes involved.&lt;ref name="Bureau of American ethnology,1881"&gt;Bureau of American ethnology,1881&lt;/ref&gt; They assigned them alphabetic letters.{{why|date=April 2012}}

*Fingers clenched, thumb touching middle of index finger (D)
*Fingers hooked, thumb touching back tip of index finger (E)
*Fingers hooked, thumb at side of fingers (F)

==Writing==

As most Native American languages lacked an indigenous alphabetic tradition, and as Plains Indian Sign Language was widely understood among different tribes, a written, graphic transcription of these signs is known to have functioned as a medium of communication between Native Americans on and off reservations during the period of American colonization, removal, and forced schooling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/05/native-american-sign-language-us-mail/|title=Who put Native American sign language in the US mail? - OUPblog|date=9 May 2018|website=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter of a Kiowa student, Belo Cozad, in 1890 sent to [[Carlisle Indian School]] in Pennsylvania from his parents on a reservation in Oklahoma made use of such signs and becomes one of the only known indigenous written transcriptions of the [[Kiowa language]].

'''Political science''' is a [[social science]] which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of [[politics|political]] activities, political thoughts, and political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/political-science%20Oxford%20Dictionary:%20political%20science Oxford Dictionary: political science]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and resources. Political scientists "see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/political-science/ Political Science]. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (22 February 1999). Retrieved on 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science -- occasionally called politicology -- comprises numerous subfields, including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], [[international relations]], [[political theory]], [[public administration]], [[public policy]], and [[political methodology]].  Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of [[economics]], [[Legal education|law]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[psychology]]/[[psychiatry]], and [[anthropology]].

Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of [[constitutions]], political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. [[International relations]] deals with the interaction between [[nation-state]]s as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in [[social research]]. Approaches include [[positivism]], [[Verstehen|interpretivism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], and pluralism. Political science, as one of the [[social science]]s, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], experimental research, and model building.

==Overview==
Political scientists study matters concerning the allocation and transfer of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in [[decision making]], the roles and systems of governance including [[governments]] and [[international organizations]], political behaviour and [[public policies]]. They measure the success of [[governance]] and specific policies by examining many factors, including [[Economic stability|stability]], [[justice]], [[material wealth]],  [[peace]] and [[public health]]. Some political scientists seek to advance [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] (attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) theses by analysing politics. Others advance [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] theses, by making specific policy recommendations.

Political scientists provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the [[Constituency|electorate]] analyse issues. According to Chaturvedy,
{{quote|Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties or as civil servants. They may be involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to [[corporation]]s. Private enterprises such as [[think tank]]s, research institutes, polling and [[public relations]] firms often employ political scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaturvedy|first1=J. C.|title=Political Governance: Political theory|publisher=Isha Books|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzV4V59udu8C&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=28 October 2014|isbn=9788182053175|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, political scientists known as "[[American politics (political science)|Americanists]]" look at a variety of data including [[United States Constitution|constitutional development]], [[elections]], [[public opinion]], and [[public policy]] such as [[Social Security reform]], [[foreign policy]], [[US Congress]]ional committees, and the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]&amp;nbsp;— to name only a few issues.

Because political science is essentially a study of [[human behaviour]], in all aspects of [[politics]], observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though [[experiment]]al methods are increasingly common (see [[experimental political science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Druckman|editor1-first=James|editor2-first=Donald|editor2-last=Green|editor3-first=James|editor3-last=Kuklinski|editor4-first=Arthur|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Lupia|year=2011|title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-17455-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this difficulty, former [[American Political Science Association]] President [[Lawrence Lowell]] once said "We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. 1910. "The Physiology of Politics." ''American Political Science Review'' 4: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in [[biology]] or inanimate objects as in [[physics]]. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation "political scientist" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|title=How to Become a Political Scientist|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/political-scientists.htm#tab-4|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena.  To date, the &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/apsr|title=American Political Science Association &gt; PUBLICATIONS &gt; About APSA Journals &gt; American Political Science Review|website=www.apsanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;American Political Science Review is the leading journal in Political Science research. 

===Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism===

In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by [[Robert Dahl]], [[Philip Converse]], and in the collaboration between sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and public opinion scholar [[Bernard Berelson]].

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, [[game theory|game theoretic]] formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. [[William H. Riker]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of Rochester]] were the main proponents of this shift.

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Quaile Hill, "In Search of General Theory," Journal of Politics 74(October 2012), 917-931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anticipating of crises===

The theory of political transitions,&lt;ref&gt;Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677820 "A theory of political transitions."] American Economic Review. 2001 Sep 1:938-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises,&lt;ref&gt;McClelland C.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600146 "The Anticipation of International Crises: Prospects for Theory and Research."] International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1, Special Issue on International Crisis:Progress and Prospects for Applied Forecasting and Management (March 1977), pp. 15-38&lt;/ref&gt; form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M., Carpenter S.R., Lenton T.M., Bascompte J., Brock W., Dakos V., Van De Koppel J., Van De Leemput I.A., Levin S.A., Van Nes E.H., Pascual M. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/344 "Anticipating critical transitions."] Science. 2012 Oct 19;338(6105):344-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]] in large groups, was proposed for crises anticipation and successfully used in various areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T. A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuran T. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025019 "Sparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution."] Public Choice, Vol. 61, No. 1 (April 1989), pp. 41–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science in the Soviet Union===
In the [[Soviet Union]], political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like theory of state and [[law]], [[area studies]], [[international relations]], studies of labor movement, "critique of bourgeois theories", etc. Soviet scholars were represented at the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA) since 1955 (since 1960 by the Soviet Association of Political and State Studies).

In 1979, the 11th World Congress of IPSA took place in [[Moscow]]. Until the late years of the Soviet Union, political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was thus subjected to distrust. Anti-communists accused political scientists of being "false" scientists and of having served the old regime.&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;Political Science in Russia: Institutionalization of the Discipline and Development of the Professional Community&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Soviet Union, two of the major institutions dealing with political science, the Institute of Contemporary Social Theories and the Institute of International Affairs, were disbanded, and most of their members were left without jobs. These institutes were victims of the first wave of [[anticommunist]] opinion and ideological attacks. Today, the Russian Political Science Association unites professional political scientists from all around Russia.

===Recent developments===
In 2000, the [[Perestroika Movement]] in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veelUVVHg8MC|title=Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300130201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic [[cognitive bias]]es of current politics.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. "The evolutionary psychology of mass politics".

==Political science education==

Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, "as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name=Stoner&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoner |first=J. R. |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |title=Political Science and Political Education |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the APSA Teaching and Learning Conference ([[American Political Science Association|APSA]]), San Jose Marriott, [[San Jose, California]] |date=22 February 2008 |quote=... although one might allege the same for social science as a whole, political scientists receive funding from and play an active role in both the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [in the United States]. |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130234044/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 }} &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p245585_index.html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate [[College of Arts and Sciences|School
 or College of Arts and Sciences]] per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of Humanities or [[Liberal Arts]].&lt;ref name=Marist&gt;See, e.g., the department of [http://www.marist.edu/liberalarts/polsci/ Political Science] at [[Marist College]], part of a Division of Humanities before that division became the School of Liberal Arts (c. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas classical [[political philosophy]] is primarily defined by a concern for [[Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for "[[modernity]]" and the contemporary [[nation state]], along with the study of classical thought, and as such share a greater deal of terminology with [[sociologists]] (e.g. [[structure and agency]]).

Most [[United States]] [[Higher education in the United States|colleges and universities]] offer B.A. programs in political science. M.A. or M.A.T. and Ph.D. or Ed.D. programs are common at larger universities. The term ''political science'' is more popular in [[North America]] than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of ''political studies,'' ''politics,'' or ''government.'' While ''political science'' implies use of the [[scientific method]], ''political studies'' implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' is the term used to refer to this field by [[Brandeis University]]; [[Cornell College]]; [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; [[Hendrix College]]; [[Lake Forest College]]; [[Monash University]]; [[Mount Holyoke College]]; [[New York University]]; [[Occidental College]]; [[Princeton University]]; [[Ursinus College]]; [[Washington and Lee University]]; and [[Zeppelin University]]. ''Government'' is the term used for this field by [[Bowdoin College]]; [[Colby College]]; [[Cornell University]]; [[Dartmouth College]]; [[Georgetown University]]; [[Harvard University]]; [[Smith College]]; [[Wesleyan University]]; the [[College of William and Mary]]; the [[University of Sydney]]; the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; the [[University of Ulster]]; the [[University of Essex]]; [[Victoria University of Wellington]], which has both a "School of Government" and a separate "Political Science and International Relations Programme"; and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. ''Politics and government'' is the term used by the [[University of Puget Sound]]. ''Government and politics'' is used by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;/ref&gt; Separate degree granting programs in international relations and [[public policy]] are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Master's level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vernardakis |first=George |title=Graduate education in government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd3DDiQm3M8C&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-1171-8 |quote=...existing practices at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is [[Pi Sigma Alpha]].

===Cognate fields===
Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:
* [[Comparative politics]], including [[area studies]]
* [[International relations]]
* [[Political philosophy]] or political theory
* [[Public administration]]
* [[Public law]]

Some political science departments also classify [[methodology]] as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, [[American political science|American politics]] is often treated as a separate subfield.

In contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, [[Theories of political behavior|political behaviour]] (including [[public opinion]], [[collective action]], and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]), and political institutions (including [[legislature]]s and [[international organization]]s). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/content_4596.cfm APSA Organized Sections | APSA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Add sections here on each subfield --&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of political science}}

As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]] which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.

The [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] survey gives the site the identification code Hizma, site number 480 in Benjamin, coordinates 17580 and 13880.&lt;ref name="IAAsurvey"&gt;{{cite book |editors= Israel Finkelstein, Yitzhak Magen |title= Archaeological Survey of the Hill Country of Benjamin |location= Jerusalem |publisher= IAA Publications |page=63 |year=1993 |via=Strickert }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied during the Middle Bronze Age.&lt;ref name="IAAsurvey"/&gt; Excavation work was executed by Tzur Abeles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/abraham/licenses.pdf  Excavation Permits granted by the Staff Officer for Archaeology in the West Bank, 1968-2007]&lt;/ref&gt; who published the results in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-arch.org/he/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bibliography_sourcebook.pdf  Bibliography list]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Description==
There were originally five structures, but one was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the [[Ramallah]] bypass road.&lt;ref name="Etshalom"&gt;Etshalom, Yitzchak, [https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/41940229/kever-rachel-the-anorthern-theorya-by-torahorg  ''Kever Rachel: The "Northern Theory"''], see part VII (pg. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis-Hugues Vincent]] researched the site and found five very large stone structures, between 10-53 metres long and 2.8-6.62 metres high, each with a funerary room in its centre.&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt; The rough-hewn stone blocks form rectangular walled structures.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Vincent studied the building style and drew the conclusion that they were erected by [[Bronze Age]] nomadic shepherds, who would bring their dead back here and bury them inside the structures.&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt;

Vincent asked the local inhabitants for the name of the site, which he was told is ''Qubbur Bene Israin'', "Tombs of the Sons of Israel"; and of the largest structure, which they named as ''Qaber Um Bene Israin'', "Tomb of the Mother of the Sons of Israel".&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

==Possible biblical connections==
It can be hypothesised from the name ''Qaber Um Bene Israin'', "Tombs of the Mothers of the Sons of Israel", that this is the tomb of Rachel (see {{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 10}}), or that there is a connection to the death and burial of the nurse Deborah "below [[Bethel]]" from {{Bibleref2|Genesis 35:8}}, as well as to the passage about the oak of Tabor being near Rachel's tomb in 1 Samuel 10.&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt;

'''Religiocentrism''' or '''religio-centrism''' is defined ([[Raymond Corsini|Corsini]] 1999:827) as the "conviction that a person's own religion is more important or superior to other religions." In analogy to [[ethnocentrism]], religiocentrism is a [[value-neutral]] term for psychological [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]].

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''religiocentrism'' combines ''[[wikt:religio-|religio-]]'' (e.g., [[wikt:religiophobia|religiophobia]]) and ''[[wikt:-centrism|-centrism]]'' (e.g., [[Eurocentrism]]). [[Derivation (linguistics)|Derivations]] include ''religiocentric'' or ''religio-centric''.

Although the precise origins of ''religiocentrism'' and ''religiocentric'' remain unclear, the words have been used since the early 20th century. The American economist Adrian Augustus Holtz (1917:15) described how early German school reforms were "carried on in a way that allowed for a religio-centric educational system." [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920:307) said, "Maud Dyer was neurotic, religiocentric, faded; her emotions were moist, and her figure was unsystematic."

The related term ''[[Christocentric]]'' theologically means "forms of Christianity that concentrate on the teaching of [[Jesus Christ]]", but is sometimes used as a near [[synonym]] of ''religiocentric''. For instance (Hamilton 2002), "No matter where it appears, government-sponsored Christocentrism, or even religiocentrism, undermines this nation's ideals."

==Academic studies==
Religiocentrism is commonly discussed in contexts of [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[anthropology]].

The Australian social psychologists John J. Ray and Dianne Doratis defined religiocentrism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ethnocentrism" is the social scientist's value-neutral term for ethnic or racial prejudice. It refers to ethnically-based sentiments of exclusiveness without any implication of their moral worth or justifiability... By analogy, the term religiocentrism is derived here to mean ''religiously'' based sentiments of exclusiveness—beliefs that one should marry within one's own religion, work with members of one's own religion, and in general prefer members of one's own religion above others. This will also entail ''ipso facto'' devaluative judgments of other religions. (1971:170)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ray and Doratis designed a groundbreaking attitude scale to measure religiocentrism and ethnocentrism. Their religiocentrism scale comprises 33 items (for instance, "I think my religion is nearer to the truth than any other" and "Most Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus are very stupid and ignorant"), with five-point [[Likert scale]] psychometric response options from "Strongly agree" (Scored 5) to "Strongly disagree" (1). To verify [[internal consistency]] among respondents, 11 items were reverse scored ("It makes no difference to me what religion my friends are" is the converse of "I think that it's better if you stick to friends of the same religion as your own"), resulting in a [[Kuder–Richardson Formula 20|reliability coefficient]] of .88 among 154 first-year university students. The authors tested attitudes among Australian fifth-form students in two Catholic and two public schools, and discovered that neither ethnocentrism nor religiocentrism showed any correlation with religious background. Ray and Doratis concluded (1971:178), "Ethnocentrism, religiocentrism and religious conservatism were all shown to be separate and distinct factors of attitudes in their own right. They are not just three aspects of the one thing. Religiocentric people do however tend to be both religiously conservative and ethnocentric."

The Hungarian-Jewish historian and anthropologist [[Raphael Patai]] mentions religiocentrism as a variable in relationships between religion and culture, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each religion also has a definite outlook on its own value in relation to that of other religions. Its relationship to other religions may range from complete toleration to the complete lack of it, with a corresponding range of self-evaluation. This variable, best called religio-centrism (on the analogy of ethnocentrism), can serve as an additional avenue of approach to the study of our subject. (1954:234)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and Western cultures, Patai finds,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion in the Far East is characterized by the absence of religio-centrism: there is a marked toleration of other religions and a mutual borrowing and influencing; in the Middle East and in the West there is a high degree of religio-centrism, with intolerance and scorn of other religions: each religion is exclusive and regards itself as the "one and only" true faith. (1954:252)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later survey of the potentials for world peace, Patai differentiated the major modern religions between "theistic" and "nontheistic".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The three great monotheistic religions of the Middle East and the West, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, are the foremost theistic religions and the dominant faiths of about one half of mankind. Common to all theistic religions is a pronounced religiocentrism, expressed most poignantly in the conviction that one's own religion is the one and only true one, and that all the other faiths are erroneous and hence depreciable. In this conviction were rooted the great religious wars which pitted, not only Muslims against Christians, but also various Muslim sects against one another, and likewise made various Christian denominations bitter enemies... The situation is more hopeful in the great nontheistic religions of South, Southeast, and East Asia. These religions, notably Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, lack the element of self-assurance and certainty that each is the exclusive possessor of the only truth. (1987:24-25)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response, [[Andrew Wilson (academic)|Andrew Wilson]], Professor of Scriptural Studies of the [[Unification Theological Seminary]], criticized Patai's opinion as theologically plausible but historically erroneous, citing examples (1987:28) of "rampant communal violence between Hindus and Buddhists in Sri Lanka and between Sikhs and Hindus in India."

Religiocentrism has a specialized meaning for sociologists (Chalfant, Beckley, and Palmer 1994:51). "This term is related to a common word used in sociological literature, ''ethnocentrism''. Similarly, we might refer to feelings of rightness and superiority resulting from religious affiliation as ''religiocentrism''. Religiocentrism inhibits the ability of a society to achieve adaptation, integration and goal-attainment."

[[Mohammed Abu-Nimer]], the Director of the Peacebuilding and Development Institute at [[American University]], distinguishes between religiocentrism and "religiorelativism".
&lt;blockquote&gt;A religiorelative person is firm in his/her belief that other religions have the right to exist and be practiced, even if such norms and beliefs are contradictory to one's own set of religious beliefs. Such a person is prone not to engage in violence or discriminatory actions against the others. In contrast, a religiocentric person is a believer who denies other religions' "truth" and who holds an absolute truth that leaves no room for different religious practices. Such a person becomes more prone to dehumanize, exclude, and discriminate against other religious groups and individuals. Often, as a result of negative and destructive exposure and experience with conflict and war, religiocentric beliefs not only are exacerbated and easily translated into violence against the enemy (that is, the different other), but also actually grow and prohibit human and peaceful contact with the other. However, there are conflict resolution and peace-building activities and forums that can assist peace workers in such settings to transform a religiocentric into a religiorelative believer. (2004:497)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abu-Nimer (2004:479-501) analyzes three typical reactions of a religiocentric person to another religion: [[denial]] (e.g., Israel not allowing Arabs to purchase or use state land), [[defense mechanisms]] ("There is no salvation outside the Church"), and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] ("We are all the children of God").

[[File:RBPF crest.jpg|thumb|Crest of the Royal Bahamas Police Force]]
The '''Royal Bahamas Police Force''' is the national [[law enforcement agency]] of the [[Commonwealth of The Bahamas]]. It operates within the portfolio of the [[Ministry of National Security (Bahamas)|Ministry of National Security]]. The police force was established on 1 March 1840. The Force is headquartered on East Street Hill in Nassau, Bahamas.

==History==
[[Image:Central police station, Royal Bahamas Police Force.jpg|thumb|Central police station of the Royal Bahamas Police Force in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]
From the early eighteenth century to the later part of the nineteenth century, the development of policing generally followed the pattern of [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|policing]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During the first half of this period, men were appointed as [[constable]]s to assist in the enforcement of government rules and regulations, and the apprehension of offenders. A Night Guard was also assigned to protect the town of [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], capital of the [[British Crown Colony]] of the Bahamas, during the night.
As early as 1729, there was a constable in [[New Providence]]. However, his duties seem not to have been as broad and well defined as the police constable of today. This constable was attached to the local [[Magistrate]], [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]] and several other Government officials.

In 1799, an Act of the General Assembly, now called the [[Parliament of the Bahamas]], declared that all constables would have the same powers as their counterparts in Great Britain. They were then allowed to arrest on suspicion of crime as opposed to only after the crime had been committed. In 1827, the General Assembly stipulated their mode of appointment. During this period, only one constable was appointed to serve at a time in each district. These appointments were made by the serving magistrate with the assistance of two justices of the peace. 

As time passed and crime increased, a small number of constables were appointed to serve at the same time. However, they were never organised as a formal police force. Each was responsible to the Magistrate in a particular district. This system of constables has evolved into the currently used district and local constables.

During the early years of British colonial rule, [[Slavery in Britain and Ireland|slaves]] made up the majority of the population in the Bahamas. The little policing needed was done by the free population with the help of Constables, Magistrates, and Justices of the Peace. Any [[slave rebellion]] or potential slave rebellion was kept in check by the local detachment of British soldiers and the slave owners.

Prior to the abolition of slavery by [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[British Parliament]] in 1834, there was a system of night patrols in New Providence called the Night Guard. The men forming this guard were not constables, but were also supervised by the local Magistrate. Their duties were primarily to protect the homes and businesses of the free population at night. In addition, the [[West India Regiment]] was stationed in Nassau to take care of any serious breach of peace throughout The Bahamas. These men were trained soldiers recruited from different ethnic groups in Africa and the [[Caribbean]]. They lived in [[barracks]] in isolation from the populations to ensure their loyalty in the event of local slave rebellions. In addition, their duties also included the protection of the Islands from foreign invaders. At that time, the barracks was situated on the site where the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton British Colonial Hotel]] currently stands.

The majority of the Family Islands which make up The Bahamas were largely neglected as far as law enforcement was concerned, as crime in these areas was almost non-existent.

==Structure==
The Royal Bahamas Police Force is headed by Ellison E. Greenslade, Dr.h.c., MBA, QPM, the Commissioner of Police (2010–2017) who is supported in his role by a deputy commissioner and seven assistant commissioners. The headquarters of the police service is located in Nassau, New Providence.
The rank structure follows the United Kingdom's Scotland Yard usage: constable; corporal; sergeant; inspector; assistant superintendent; superintendent; chief superintendent; assistant commissioner; senior assistant commissioner; deputy commissioner; and commissioner. There are just over 3,000 members on the force.&lt;ref name="RBPFref7"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalbahamaspolice.org/history/orgainzation_of_RBPF.php | title=Organization of The Royal Bahamas Police Force | accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Cadet Corps'' is a program that allows aspiring local youth who are not of the proper age requirement to receive partial training and experience situations undertaken by officers. The program began in 1969 and to gain entrance to the program an eight-week training course must be taken at the headquarters in Nassau. Once the course is completed, a rank of ''police cadet'' is earned. These cadets wear casual (depot) dress, distinguished by a slimmer stripe along each side if the regulation pants with the letter "C" (for cadet) in front of their numerals.&lt;ref name="RBPFref4"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalbahamaspolice.org/recruitment/Cadets/cadet_history.php | title=History of the Cadet Corps programme | accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''National Crime Prevention Office'' is an initiative undertaken on 1 February 2010 as part of Commissioner Greenslade's plan to reduce crime in The Bahamas through the education of and collaboration with the public. The stated mission of the office is to:&lt;ref name="RBPFref3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalbahamaspolice.org/crime_prevention/aboutthencpo.php | title=National Crime Prevention Office – RBPF | accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disability activism ==
'''Unlocked Central posts for doctors with disability'''

The disabled fighter fought for not only his but other disabled doctor’s rights. He also brought into open the discrimination by UPSC which disallowed doctors with disability to apply for various Central Health Services (CHS) posts. He himself was rejected in 2014 but fought and was later allowed to appear for the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M.S.J.E. doesn’t consider disabled doctors fit for teaching jobs|url=http://www.dnis.org/news.php?issue_id=5&amp;volume_id=8&amp;news_id=1142&amp;i=6|newspaper=D.N.I.S|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPSC discriminating against me, alleges differently-abled doctor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/upsc-discriminating-against-me-alleges-differentlyabled-doctor/article5334572.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, his application was again rejected when he highlighted that the same discrimination was also present for the other posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rejected by UPSC twice, physically challenged doctor battles for justice|url=http://www.indiamedicaltimes.com/2013/11/08/rejected-by-upsc-twice-physically-challenged-doctor-battles-for-justice/|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed to apply in a quick intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Success for Dr Singh, but other physically challenged doctors still in lurch|url=http://www.indiamedicaltimes.com/2013/11/14/success-for-dr-singh-but-other-physically-challenged-doctors-still-in-lurch/|newspaper=India Medical Times|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His RTI revealed that doctors with disabilities are not considered eligible for specialist CHS posts in teaching, non-teaching as well as public health specialist cadres. Undeterred, he complained again and requested the health ministry to allow all eligible doctors with disability to apply for these posts. His single handed relentless fight for justice over four years ultimately forced Health Ministry to unlock 1,674 specialist central posts for disabled doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One man’s crusade opens up CHS jobs for disabled doctors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/One-mans-crusade-opens-up-CHS-jobs-for-disabled-doctors/articleshow/47661044.cms|publisher=The Times of India|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Challenged unfair guidelines of [[Medical Council of India]]'''

He filed writ petition in the [[Supreme Court of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Medical Council of India’s new guidelines on admission of persons with specified disabilities: Unfair, discriminatory and unlawful |journal=Indian Journal of Medical Ethics |date=25 Aug 2018 |doi=10.20529/IJME.2018.064 |url=http://ijme.in/articles/medical-council-of-indias-new-guidelines-on-admission-of-persons-with-specified-disabilities-unfair-discriminatory-and-unlawful/?galley=html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; lead successful advocacy of doctors with disabilities to the Central Government to bring amendments in the controversial MCI guidelines lifting the bar on admission of candidates with specified disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Medical Council of India’s guidelines for pupils with disabilities amended by Union Health Ministry |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-medical-council-of-india-s-guidelines-for-pupils-with-disabilities-amended-by-union-health-ministry-2653437 |agency=DNA |date=23 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Accessibility]] of all the medical institutions in India'''

On his petition the Court of the [[Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities]], under [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Government of India]] instructed [[Medical Council of India]] to issue directives to all the medical institutions in India to be disabled-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MCI asks all medical institutions to be 'accessible'|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mci-asks-all-medical-institutions-to-be-accessible/article4628862.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Demand for barrier-free buildings|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-26/delhi/37308686_1_access-audit-barrier-chief-commissioner|newspaper=The Times of India|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hope in India as Mandatory Access For People with Disability Takes Shape|url=http://www.indiaamericatoday.com/article/hope-india-mandatory-access-people-disability-takes-shape|newspaper=India America Today|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, most medical institutions have yet to comply with the directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospitals waking up to the disabled's needs, but slowly|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/340497/hospitals-waking-up-disabled039s-needs.html|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AIIMS plans access to disabled, others silent|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-08-12/delhi/41331636_1_medical-colleges-aiims-mci|newspaper=The Times of India|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most medical colleges ignore directive on facilities for disabled|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/most-medical-colleges-ignore-directive-on-facilities-for-disabled/article5014252.ece?textsize=large&amp;test=1|newspaper=The Hindu|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His black armband protest on the [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities]] in 2012 led authorities to construct ramps outside all the hostels at his medical college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black armband silent protest against GTB hospital|url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/NewsContent.aspx?NID=14990|newspaper=Millennium Post|date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disabled friendly polling booths'''

He played an integral role of whistleblower to raise the issue of problems faced by voters with disability before and during the [[Delhi legislative assembly elections, 2013]] through [[Right to Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Not a disabled friendly electoral system|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/not-a-disabled-friendly-electoral-system/article5424837.ece|newspaper=The Hindu.|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=मतदान केन्द्रो पर विकलांगो के लिए जरूरी सुविधाओ का अभाव|newspaper=हिंदुस्तान|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raw deal for physically challenged voters|newspaper=The Statesman, page 2.|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote to the election commission as well as the Chief Justice of India to allow disabled voters to vote again before declaration of final results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi election 2013: Disabled voters rip apart system on web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Delhi-assembly-polls-Disabled-voters-rip-apart-system-on-web/articleshow/26922114.cms|newspaper=The Times of India|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His RTI on fourth [[National Voters' Day]] revealed how [[Election Commission of India]] was caught unprepared to enfranchise electors with disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polls near, but no data of voters with disabilities|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-27/india/46683677_1_national-voters-disabilities-electoral-participation|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed violation of Supreme Court orders of 2004 to empower voters with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=विकलांगों के लिए गंभीर नहीं चुनाव आयोग|url=http://www.punjabkesari.in/news/article-210889|newspaper=Punjab Kesari|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the expose Chief Electoral Office, Delhi involved him in making elections in Delhi disabled-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call for inclusive elections|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/call-for-inclusive-elections/article5807757.ece|newspaper=Hindu|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did he sensitise the election officers on how to help electors with disability but he also helped in setting up a disability registration helpline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Voters with disability can register online|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/specials/lok-sabha-elections-2014/news/Voters-with-disability-can-register-online/articleshow/32751952.cms|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sustained efforts led to making election booths across the capital accessible to disabled and elderly voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lok Sabha Polls.

'''Filed first case under the new Disability Law against a cabinet Minister'''

He filed the first ever case under the new [[Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016]], which has strict punishment for contravention of provisions of Act, against [[Satyadev Pachauri]] for publicly ridiculing a disabled employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi University doctor stands up for UP government employee’s rights|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/new-disability-law-du-doc-stands-up-for-up-govt-employees-rights/articleshow/58321074.cms|publisher=Times of India|date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If convicted, Pachauri who is minister of khadi and village industries in the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]], will faces a six month to five-year prison term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UP Minister Could Become First to Be Tried Under New Disability Law|url=https://thewire.in/126598/satyadev-pachauri-persons-with-disabilities-act-uttar-pradesh/|publisher=The Wire|date=21 Apr 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Withdrawal of [[Union Public Service Commission]] and'''  '''[[Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination|Indian]] Institutes of Technology Joint Entrance Examinations ‘discriminatory proforma’'''

Dr Singh challenged [[Union Public Service Commission]]’s format whereby disabled applicants were asked to paste photographs showing their disability as a proof. The Court of [[Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities]] directed the UPSC to refrain from asking disabled candidates to submit photographs showing their disabilities and to consider the ‘permanent disability certificate’ issued from a government hospital as a valid proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPSC asked to withdraw proforma which demands photographs showing disability from applicants |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/upsc-asked-to-withdraw-proforma-which-demands-photographs-showing-disability-from-applicants/506055-3.html|newspaper=IBN Live.|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His advocacy led to the withdrawal of similar prOforma by IITJEE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iits-asked-to-stop-using-disability-photos-in-applications/story-ooKM1jGog3BJ8ZFNPvJ9oK.html|title = IITs asked to stop using disability photos in applications|last = |first = |date = 3 November 2015|work = |access-date = 17 February 2016|via = Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disabled-friendly websites of Delhi Government hospitals'''

His judicial activism led to the [[web accessibility]] of all the hospitals under [[Government of Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://deliver2030.org/?p=6648|title = What do the SDGs mean for India’s disabled citizens?|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policy change in duty concession for drivers with disability'''
Central Government provides excise duty concession to disabled customers however [[Maruti Suzuki]] denied him the concession on the pretext of right leg disability which was not only discriminatory but illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Only left is right: Why disabled drivers miss discount trip|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Only-left-is-right-Why-disabled-drivers-miss-discount-trip/articleshow/51675645.cms|publisher=Times of India|date=4 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His relentless fight led the [[Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises]] to amend the rules and quashing manufacturer's certificate and allowing RTO's certificate only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Centre amends duty concession for disabled|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Centre-amends-duty-concession-for-disabled/articleshow/52440917.cms|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dignified screening of people with disabilities at airports'''

After being harassed by security personnel at the Hyderabad airport because of his orthosis, Dr Singh approached [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]] (DGCA) and [[Bureau of Civil Aviation Security]] (BCAS) to amend rustic screening procedures and modify guidelines taking [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DU professor with disability harassed at Hyderabad airport|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DU-professor-with-disability-harassed-at-Hyderabad-airport/articleshow/30971043.cms|agency=Times of India|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disability watchdog has directed both DGCA and BCAS to make sure people with disabilities are not being harassed or humiliated at airports and that security personnel have been sensitized towards them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Civil Aviation Misses Court of CCPD Notice Deadline On Frisking|url=http://www.reducedmobility.eu/20141003506/The-News/india-civil-aviation-misses-court-of-ccpd-notice-deadline-on-frisking.html|publisher=Reduced Mobility|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DGCA given 30 days to prove disabled not harassed|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/DGCA-given-30-days-to-prove-disabled-not-harassed/articleshow/42479388.cms|publisher=Times of India|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corrected wrong celebration of Salk's birthday on World Polio Day'''

[[Rotary International]] established World Polio Day (24 October) to commemorate the birthday of virologist [[Jonas Salk]] who developed polio vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO World Polio Day|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2013/polioday/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This erroneous observance was first challenged by Dr Singh in his publication in the official journal of the Edward Jenner Society's [[Vaccine (journal)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=S|title=It's time to correct the literature.|journal=Vaccine|date=11 January 2013|volume=31|issue=4|pages=591|pmid=23219693|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Google dedicated a doodle on Salk's 100th birthday to confirm 28 October as his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google doodle celebrates 100th birthday of Jonas Salk, who developed polio vaccine|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Google-doodle-celebrates-100th-birthday-of-Jonas-Salk-who-developed-polio-vaccine/articleshow/44955622.cms|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotary still celebrates the day on 24 October despite media reporting on the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Observing polio day on the wrong date?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/observing-polio-day-on-the-wrong-date/article6543230.ece|publisher=Hindu|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}
In [[Inuit mythology]], '''Silap Inua''' ('possessor of spirit', ᓯᓚᑉ ᐃᓄᐊ) or '''Silla''' ('breath, spirit', ᓯᓪᓚ) is similar to [[mana]] or [[Aether (mythology)|ether]], the primary component of everything that exists; it is also the breath of life and the method of locomotion for any movement or change. Silla was believed to control everything that goes on in one's life.

==Description==

Silla is a spirit of the sky, the wind, and the weather. Though identified as male, he is never depicted, and thought to be formless. There are very few myths in which Silla is a character, because he is not thought to have many personality characteristics. He also represents a concept somewhat akin to the [[Hindu]] idea of [[Paramatman]], or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]’s idea of the great [[Ralph Waldo Emerson#Literary career|Over soul]]: Silla is also believed to be the substance which [[souls]] are made of. Contrary to the Christian missionaries who have identified [[Nanook]] the [[polar bear]] spirit as the supreme deity of the Inuit, Silla is much closer to this role. However Silla also has a somewhat malevolent aspect: he is known to lure children away from their play off into the tundra, never to be seen again.

Among the many various  [[Eskimo]] cultures, term ''silap inua'' / ''sila'', ''hillap inua'' / ''hilla'' (among [[Inuit]]), ''siḷam iñua'' (among [[Inupiaq]]), ''ellam yua'' / ''ella'' (among [[Yup'ik]]) is used with some diversity.&lt;ref name="Kleivan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleivan|first1=I.|last2=Sonne|first2=B.|title=Eskimos, Greenland and Canada|date=1985|publisher=E.J.

[[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|Shamanhood among Eskimo peoples]] was a diverse phenomenon, just like the various Eskimo cultures themselves. Among [[Copper Inuit]], shamans were believed to obtain their power from this “Wind Indweller”, thus even their helping spirits were termed as ''silap inue''.&lt;ref name="Merkur"/&gt;{{rp|230}}

==History==
According to the interpretations of [[anthropologists]], Silla is one of the oldest Inuit deities, but was recently (in the last thousand years) supplanted by [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]], (the goddess of [[sea mammals]]) and the [[Caribou Mother]] (the goddess  of [[caribou]]) when these became the major food sources of the Inuit. Anthropologists believe that the belief is extremely old because of the widespread nature of this deity.

'''St. Nicholas Church''' is a museum and an ancient Byzantine Church located in modern-day town of [[Demre]], [[Antalya Province]], Turkey. Its usage is dated between 5th-12th centuries. It is notable for being the [[burial place]] of [[St Nicholas|St. Nicholas of Myra]], a 4th-century [[Christian]] bishop of the ancient city of [[Myra]], an important religious figure for [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]]s and [[Roman Catholics]] and the historical inspiration for [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = St. Nicholas Center ::: Demre Statues|url = http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/demre-statues/|website = www.stnicholascenter.org|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church is on UNESCO's tentative list to become a World Heritage Site.&lt;ref name="UN-Nicholas"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Nicholas Church|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1399/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The church was built in AD 520{{dubious|No source indicated. If Theodosius (r. 379-395) indeed ordered its construction, it's plain wrong.|date=August 2018}} on the foundations of an older Christian church where Saint Nicholas served as a bishop. Over time the church was flooded, filled with silt, and buried. In 1862 it was restored by Russian Tzar Nicholas I, who added a tower and made other changes to its Byzantine architecture. The church is regarded as the 3rd most important Byzantine structure in Anatolia. It is noted for its remarkable wall frescos, and its architectural and religious significance. The northeast annex arcade contains the only example of St Nicholas's life cycle as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= St. Nicholas Center ::: Demre Statues |url= http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/demre-statues/ |website= www.stnicholascenter.org |access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological excavations==
[[Archaeological]] [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s in the Church started in 1988 directed by Prof. S. Yıldız Ötüken of [[Hacettepe University]], [[Ankara, Turkey]]. The work has revealed some of the northern section of the monastery complex, and also the small chapels around the nave, one of which notably contains vibrant [[fresco]]es detailing the life and miracles of the saint, and a desecrated [[sarcophagus]] which is thought to be the original burial place from which his remains were forcibly [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to [[Bari]] in 1087.&lt;ref&gt;For the story of the translation of the bones see: Charles W. Jones, "Saint Nikolaos of Myra, Bari, and Manhattan: Biography of a Legend" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) 1978, {{ISBN|978-0-226-40700-5}}, pp. 176-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgy==
The Orthodox Liturgy is occasionally celebrated in the church on 6 December.

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
'''''The God of the Machine''''' is a book written by [[Isabel Paterson]] and published in 1943 in the [[United States]]. At the time of its release, it was considered a cornerstone to the philosophy of [[individualism]]. Her biographer, [[Stephen D. Cox]], in 2004 described Paterson as the "earliest progenitor of [[libertarianism]] as we know it today".

==Background==
Isabel Paterson wrote a regular column for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', where she first articulated many of her beliefs, which reached their final form in ''The God of the Machine''. She also foreshadowed those ideas, especially free trade, in her historical novels during the 1920s and 1930s.

Paterson opposed most parts of the economic program, known as the [[New Deal]], which US president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[United States Congress|Congress]] put into effect during the 1930s, and she advocated less governmental involvement in social and [[finance|fiscal]] matters. She also led a group of younger friends (many of whom were other employees of the ''Herald Tribune'') who shared her views. One member of that group was the young [[Ayn Rand]].

Paterson and Rand promoted each other's books, and they conducted an extensive exchange of letters, touching on religion and philosophy. That correspondence ended with a personal quarrel in 1948. Rand, an [[atheist]], was critical of the attempts of Paterson, a [[Deism|deist]], to link [[capitalism]] with religion, things that Rand considered incompatible.

'''''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack''''', often referred to as simply '''''The Heroin Diaries''''', is the debut [[studio album]] by [[Sixx:A.M.]], a side project of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]]. The band also features lead vocalist [[James Michael]] and guitarist [[DJ Ashba]]. The [[concept album]]&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nikki Sixx - ARTISTdirect NEWS |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,4400841,00.html |publisher=[[artistdirect.com]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as the companion [[soundtrack]] to Sixx's autobiography, ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', and is about Sixx's severe [[heroin]] addiction in 1987. The first single, "[[Life Is Beautiful (Sixx:A.M. song)|Life Is Beautiful]]," debuted at #26 on the [[Billboard charts]].&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&amp;f=Hot+Mainstream+Rock+Tracks|title=Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|accessdate=2007-10-23 |format= |work=Billboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Designed to be an accompaniment to ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', the autobiography of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] co-written by Sixx and Ian Gittens that details his severe heroin addiction in 1987, ''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack'' is a [[concept album]] that captures Sixx's basic story of his life during that time, although the album can stand alone. The story begins with the reasons for Sixx starting his diary, followed by his first (albeit temporary) abstinence from heroin, his relapse and mental and physical decline, his near-fatal overdose and [[out-of-body experience]], and finally, his emotional recovery, which eventually led to long-term sobriety. The 13 tracks on the album each correspond to one month of his diary, which he kept from December 1986 to December 1987. Some of the tracks feature spoken word featuring Sixx himself reading some lines from the book.

==Release==
"[[Life Is Beautiful (Sixx:A.M. song)|Life Is Beautiful]]", the first [[single (music)|single]] off the album, was originally posted on Sixx's [[MySpace]] page; after "[picking] up momentum,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/nikkisixx_2.htm|title=Interview with Nikki Sixx|accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it debuted at #26 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] rock singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?reviewid=13214&amp;page=1|title=Heroin Diaries Soundtrack Review|accessdate=2007-10-23 |format= |work=Sputnikmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It peaked at #2 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt; The album was released on August 21, 2007. It has sold 344,000 copies to date in the U.S. as of May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Titus, Christa. [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471690/sixx-am-redefines-beauty-on-this-is-gonna-hurt "Sixx:A.M.

''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack'', noted by many for showcasing a more emotional sound than, and a musical departure from Sixx's other band, [[Mötley Crüe]], has been received very positively. Jim Kaz of [[IGN]], praising the emotional lyrics of the album, called it "not really an album but rather a musical book. It is almost impossible to recommend any specific songs over others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/817/817320p1.html |title=Sixx: A.M. - The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack Review |author=Jim Kaz |date=August 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628224150/http://music.ign.com/articles/817/817320p1.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem "[[The Raven]]" has been frequently referenced and [[parody|parodied]] in contemporary culture. Immediately popular after the poem's publication in 1845, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon.  Some consider it the best poem ever written.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; As such, modern references to the poem continue to appear in popular culture.

* Writer [[James Russell Lowell]], a contemporary of Poe's, references "The Raven" and its author in his poem, ''[[A Fable for Critics]]'': "Here comes Poe with his Raven, like Barnaby Rudge, / Three fifths of him genius, two fifths sheer fudge." This mention alludes to the belief that ''[[Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty]]'' inspired Poe to write "The Raven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RE: Cremains / Ravens |url=http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/exlibris/1999/07/msg00399.html |publisher=[[Pro Exlibris archives]] |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000902161519/http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/exlibris/1999/07/msg00399.html |archivedate=September 2, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]'s ''Trent's Own Case'' (1913), Trent, standing at an open [[French door]] and reciting the fifth stanza to himself, receives an unexpected reply:
:"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
:Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
:But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
:And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ..."

:"Guv'nor!"
[[File:Poe-Elder-Raven-Mad-1954.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Will Elder]]'s absurd illustrations of "The Raven", from ''Mad'' Magazine #9, March 1954.]]
* In the magazine ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' issue 9 (March 1954), "The Raven" is reprinted in full with absurd illustrations by [[Will Elder]]. Another parody appeared in a ''Mad'' collection, ''We're Still Using That Greasy MAD Stuff'' (1959). It was titled as "The [[Cocker Spaniel|Spaniel]]." Rather than "Nevermore," the author was bombarded with famous commercial [[taglines]]. A more recent parody in ''Mad'' by [[Frank Jacobs]], titled "The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]", appeared in issue 265 (September 1986). Even more recently, the poem was used to parody horror movies, and how successful ones often have sequels made that are of low quality. The recurring line is, "Quoth [[Wes Craven]], let's make more!"&lt;ref&gt;Original issue unknown, source: "Greasy Mad Stuff"; compilation of various pieces from ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', published by Signet, 1962. pp 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Donald Duck]] 10-pager "Raven Mad" by [[Carl Barks]], published in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #265 in 1962, [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] play with a raven who can only say "Nevermore." As in the poem, the raven often repeats the word throughout the story.
* Sections of "The Raven" are quoted in [[Hubert Selby Jr]]'s 1964 novel [[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]. In the story entitled "The Queen is Dead" the lead character, Georgette, reads the poem aloud to her acquaintances. 
* "The Raven" has been the subject of [[constrained writing]]. [[Georges Perec]]'s novel ''[[A Void]]'' (1969), written entirely without the letter 'E' in French and subsequently translated into English by [[Gilbert Adair]] under the same constraint, contains a full-length "translation" of "The Raven" entitled "Black Bird." It is attributed to "[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket|Arthur Gordon Pym]]."&lt;ref&gt;Perec, Georges. ''A Void''. Translated by Gilbert Adair. London: The Harvill Press, 1995. p.108. {{ISBN|1-86046-098-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mathematician [[Mike Keith (mathematician)|Mike Keith]] has also referenced the poem in three examples of [[constrained writing]]:
**"[[Near a Raven]]" is a reworking of Poe's poem in which the length of words correspond to the first 740 digits of [[pi]] (1995)
**''[[Cadaeic Cadenza]]'', a longer work under the same constraint, begins with the full text of "Near a Raven" (1996)
**"[[Raven-Two]]", a poetic [[anagram]] of the original (1999)
* In [[Joan Aiken]]'s novel ''[[Arabel's Raven]]'' (1972), as well as further books from the Arabel and Mortimer series, a young girl named Arabel has a pet raven named Mortimer who often says the word "Nevermore!" Aiken won an [[Edgar Award]] in 1972.
* The [[Calvin &amp; Hobbes]] collection "The Essential Calvin and Hobbes: A Calvin and Hobbes Treasury" (released September 1988) contains an original illustrated poem, "A Nauseous Nocturne," which is clearly patterned after "The Raven."
* In [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'' (1994), Ralph compares an omen to the raven of the poem. The novel ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]'' (2001), written by King and [[Peter Straub]], also features a talking crow reminiscent of the raven in Poe's poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back in 'Black' (2007) Stephen King and Peter Straub return to the shadows with the delightfully creepy Black House.|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254673,00.html|publisher=EW.com|accessdate=2007-04-01|date=2001-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part III of the novel is entitled "Night's Plutonian Shore."

* In the seventh book of [[Lemony Snicket]]'s ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', ''[[The Vile Village]]'' (2001), a tree in the center of the village covered with crows is called the "Nevermore Tree."
* [[Neil Gaiman]] references "The Raven" in two of his works:
**In the novel ''[[American Gods]]'' (2001), the protagonist, Shadow, asks one of [[Odin]]'s ravens, "Hey, [[Huginn and Muninn|Hugin]] or [[Huginn and Muninn|Munin]], or whoever you are. Say 'Nevermore.'" The raven responds, "Fuck you."&lt;ref&gt;Gaiman, Neil. ''American Gods''. Headline Review, 2005. p. 173 {{ISBN|0-7553-2281-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The comic book series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' features a raven named Matthew, who has been transformed into a raven as an alternative to death. At one point in the series, he flaps his wings and screams, "Nevermore!", only to explain that he was "being [[Peter Lorre]] in [[The Raven (1963 film)|that one Roger Corman movie]]".
* Level Ground Press and artist Bill Fountain published an illustrated re-imagining of "The Raven" in 2005. The book incorporates raven myths and legends from around the world into the visual interpretation of the story.
*[[Holly Black]] quotes the poem in her 2005 novel ''[[Valiant : A Modern Tale of Faerie]]'', alluding to it as the source for the name of the drug called 'Nevermore'. However, this is later contradicted, when one of the characters asserts that the name comes from the limitations of its use: "Never more than once a day, never more than a pinch at a time, and never more than two days in a row."
*The fantasy novel ''[[The Eyre Affair]]'' by [[Jasper Fforde]] features a villainous character named Jack Schitt who is ultimately trapped inside a copy of "The Raven".
*The first of the books based on the hit TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' is called ''Nevermore''. Poe is also very important for the rest of the book, as the murders that the main characters, [[Sam and Dean Winchester]] are investigating are reenactments of "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]", "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" and "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", respectively, and it all turns out to be part of a ritual to bring Poe back to life.
*Terry Pratchett's ''[[Discworld]]'' series contains a talking raven named Quoth, whose first injunction to new acquaintances is that he "won't say the N-word."
* James Patterson's and Chris Tebbet's ''[[Middle School: Get Me Out of Here!]]'' has a Raven on the cover atop a building screaming "Nevermore!"

==Television==
[[File:TheSimpsonsRaven.png|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Simpsons]]'' version of "The Raven" ([[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)#The Raven|3rd segment]] of the first [[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]] special): Homer cries out "Be that word our sign of parting."]]
*''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]" parodies the poem in its third segment as Lisa reads the story to Bart and Maggie. In the animated segment, Homer serves as the protagonist, Bart takes the raven's form, Marge appears in a painting as Lenore and Lisa and Maggie are angels. Bart complains that the poem is not scary, and at one point the raven says his catchphrase "Eat my shorts" instead of "Nevermore." Homer provides the spoken dialogue for the narrator, while [[James Earl Jones]] voices his thoughts. Much of the story is cut for time for this segment. The story culminates (after the last two lines of stanza 17 are repeated again) with Homer chasing the Bart-raven around the study before the last stanza (before said last stanza is told, the Bart-raven drops books of other stories by Poe onto Homer). Poe and "The Raven" are also referenced in the episode "[[Saturdays of Thunder]]", when Dr Nick Riviera appears in an infomercial spruiking a cleaning product that will clean dirty grave stones. [[Troy McClure]] responds to Riviera with: "Quoth the raven, 'What a shine'."
*''[[Night Gallery]]'', hosted by [[Rod Serling]], featured a brief, humorous story entitled "Quoth the Raven." It featured Poe, portrayed by [[Marty Allen (comedian)|Marty Allen]], being constantly maligned by a talking raven (voiced by uncredited [[Mel Blanc]]) on a bust of Pallas as Poe is trying to write the original "Raven" poem.
*''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' parodied the poem in the form of a ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' short titled "Stark Raven Mad", in which Orson narrates, to the tune of the poem, guarding the harvest against Roy's attempts to steal it.
*The ''[[Histeria!]]'' episode "Super Writers" featured a sketch in which a [[Peter Lorre]]-esque Poe attempts to pitch his poem to [[Sammy Melman]], who wants a brighter poem with a happy narrator and a bunny instead of a raven. This frustrates Poe to no end and eventually drives him to publish the poem independently. Later in the episode, in a sketch featuring Poe as a villain, the raven serves as his sidekick.
*''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' parodies the poem, with the character Sweetie Pie playing the role of the raven while [[Vincent Price]] does the voice-over for the narrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiny Toon Adventures - Season 1 Episode 60 "How Sweetie It Is.|url=http://www.tv.com/tiny-toon-adventures/how-sweetie-it-is/episode/54193/summary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain]]'' episode "The Ravin!" parodies the poem, with the Brain narrating and Elmyra using a phrase repetitively.
*In the TV show ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', Morticia uses "The Raven" as a bed-time story to her son Pugsley, reciting it as a nursery rhyme. (Episode 1.2 "Morticia and the Psychiatrist", original air date: 25 September 1964)
*The 1960s [[sitcom]] ''[[The Munsters]]'' featured a [[cuckoo clock]] with a wise-cracking raven (who had named himself "Charlie") instead of a cuckoo, which would emerge and say, "Nevermore, Nevermore" – usually as a comic foil for Herman Munster.
*The animated series ''[[Beetlejuice (TV series)|Beetlejuice]]'' 4th-season episode "Poe Pourri" featured Poe as one of the eccentric residents of the Neitherworld who comes to Beetlejuice's Roadhouse searching for his lost Lenore, and with him comes a talking raven who does his verse rapper-style.
*An episode of ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' entitled "Nevermore" follows two of the main characters, [[Beast Boy]] and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], as they use a magical mirror to enter the mind of their friend [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]].
*In the ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' episode, "A Tale of Poes and Fire," "The Raven" is recited by two men dressed like Edgar Allan Poe for a Poe convention.
*In episode 3 of season 4 of [[Alton Brown]]'s ''[[Good Eats]]'' ("Fry Hard II: The Chicken") on [[Food Network]], Brown's prologue to the episode shows him rummaging through his cookbooks ("forgotten lore") looking for chicken recipes accompanied by a voice-over of him reciting a parody of the first few stanzas of the poem, during which a plastic chicken, taking the raven's place, perched on the bust of [[Julia Child]] and repeatedly says "Fry some more".
*The ''[[DuckTales]]'' character [[Poe De Spell]] is a raven who often says "nevermore".
*The ''[[Muppet Babies]]'' episode "[[List of Muppet Babies episodes|Quoth the Weirdo]]" is featured around poetry. [[Gonzo the Great|Gonzo]] found much appeal in the spooky atmosphere of "The Raven".

* In one episode of "Bullwinkle's Corner" from ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|The Bullwinkle Show]]'', the poem parodied is "The Raven". The bird which comes into Bullwinkle's "chamber spooky" is a woodpecker instead of the expected raven. Bullwinkle pursues the imposter bird with a fireplace poker and ends up hitting himself on the head. The narration concludes "Now the room is round me wavin'/ feels like I've been in a cave-in/ When will next I read "The Raven"?/I can tell you...nevermore!"
* In the 11th episode (called "Nevermore") of television series ''[[Warehouse 13]]'', many Poe poems feature, including "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and, of course, "The Raven".
*In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Charlie X]]", a youth with strange powers forces [[Mr Spock]] to recite the first verse of "The Raven", after he had moments previously recited the first verse of [[William Blake]]'s poem "[[The Tyger]]".
*In ''[[The Following]]'' the message "Neverwhere" is found in multiple murder scenes and the murders are strongly connected to Poe's work. Additionally, Joe Carroll, the series' primary antagonist and an admirer of Poe, says "Quoth the raven... Nevermore." as his last words, just prior to his execution by lethal injection.
*In the show ''[[Mama's Family]]'', the local high school was named for Edgar Allan Poe (Edgar Allan Poe High School), with their team nickname being the Ravens. In an early episode, [[Vinton Harper|Vint]] and [[Naomi Harper|Naomi]] recall their days at EAPHS by singing the school fight song: "GO! GO! GO! EDGAR ALLAN POE! We will leave'em weak and weary, we will give'em midnight dreary, will they ever top our score? Quoth the raven, NEVERMORE!".
*In ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV Series)|Teen Wolf]]'', season 6 references it on multiple occasions. The first time shows ravens flying alongside the [[Wild Hunt]] in a painting, symbolizing the Wild Hunt's ability to steal souls and take them into the state between life and death. The poem is more obviously referenced in episode 6 ("Ghosted") with a character named Lenore who refuses to let go of her own past, hallucinating much like the narrator in the poem, bemoaning the loss of someone she loved.
*In ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]'', season 3 episode "Fallen", Raven Reyes recites stanza 85-90 in an attempt of sensory overload to block A.L.I.E. from her brain. Also in season 3 is an episode titled "Nevermore", in which Raven Reyes succeeds in removing A.L.I.E. from her brain.

A large theme of the game is the characters' slowly collapsing sanity.  It sets up the games "sanity meter" mechanic where things in the game itself make less and less sense as your sanity depletes: walls start to bleed, screams are heard. Sometimes the game will make the player think the game itself has reset and will show you the quote again appearing to show that the player lost all his or her progress only for the screen to flash and put you right back where he or she was were as if nothing happened.
*In the interactive fiction game by [[Infocom]], ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]'', Part II begins with a line from the poem: "Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, / Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before..."
*[[Lord Buckley]] recorded a "hipsemantic" version of "The Raven" in 1956 ("It was a real drugged midnight... dreary.").
*[[Computer science|Computer scientist]] [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]] wrote a parody entitled "The HACTRN" about a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] haunted by a phantom [[process (computing)|process]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00117.html Computer songs and poems: The HACTRN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Raven Society]], founded in 1904, is the [[University of Virginia]]'s most prestigious honor society, combining requirements of high-level scholarship, service, leadership, and "promise of further advancement in the intellectual field."  New members must supply a parody of the poem for initiation, which takes place in the room where Poe lived when studying at the University, now under the curatorship of the Society. The Society also maintains several other Poe sites, including the [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia#Tourism|grave marker of his mother]] [[Eliza Poe]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.student.virginia.edu/~ravens/ Raven Society]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Professional wrestling|Professional wrestler]] [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven (Scott Levy)]] takes his [[stage name]] from the title of the poem, and often quotes from the poem in interviews, ending with "...Quoth the Raven...Nevermore..."
*The comic strip ''[[Shoe (comic strip)|Shoe]]'' ran a strip in which a large, strange, black bird was sitting at Roz's bar, uttering random words starting with "never-" or ending in "-more" (e.g., "Livermore!"; "Nevertheless!"), when one of the regular characters announced that the raven was [[drunkenness|bombed.]]
*Poe lived in [[Baltimore]] for a time and is buried there. Residents of the city elected to honor Poe by naming their [[National Football League]] team the [[Baltimore Ravens]] after the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltimore Ravens History|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=3|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=2006-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the three mascots for the team are three ravens, appropriately named "Edgar", "Allan" and "Poe." For many years, pre-game introductions of the Ravens' starting lineup would be preceded by a stanza from the poem, usually one which ended with the word "Nevermore," referring to the opposing team's putative inability to score when facing the powerful Raven defense. In 2000, when the Ravens were on their way to [[Super Bowl XXXV|winning their first Super Bowl]] primarily on the strength of that record-setting defense, [[Chris Berman]] of [[ESPN]]'s ''[[NFL PrimeTime]]'' would often punctuate highlights of the team's results that day by saying, "Quoth the Ravens, Never score!". Another example is the all-haiku 2008 NFL season preview of [[ESPN.com]] columnist [[Gregg Easterbrook]] (who often calls the team the "Nevermores" in his [[Tuesday Morning Quarterback|column]]), which reads: "Awk! No offense. Awk! / Quoth the raven: "No offense." / Bal-a-mer Ravens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TMQ's all-haiku NFL preview|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=easterbrook/080902|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In another PC game, Nancy Drew: [[Ransom of the Seven Ships]], if you find pieces of paper in the bottles while sailing, they will be automatically pieced together to form a passage from "The Raven", the one just before the raven appears. Certain letters in red will tell you to go to and dive to one of the sunken ships where the sharks are, and, using the [[metal detector]] from Johnny Rolle, you will find an [[Easter egg]]. This is also a reference of the next game, [[Warnings at Waverly Academy]], as Corine mentions that she is a Poe fan, as well as Leela having the missing Poe book, "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]] and Other Stories", which includes "The Raven" and other works, as well as the pendulum challenge, a reference of "[[The Pit and the Pendulum|The Pit and The Pendulum]], which is also in Leela's book.
*[[RavenCon]], an annual science fiction convention in Richmond, Virginia, was named in honor of Poe, who grew up in Richmond.
*In the video game [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', a hero is named Nevermore, after the word the raven sequentially spoke. Nevermore the Shadow Fiend is a demon who collects and traps the souls of his enemies and his ultimate ability Requiem of Souls, releases the souls collected into an area to damage his enemies in a line. In the stand-alone sequel ''[[Dota 2]]'', his description is reminiscent of the poem; his background story says Nevermore has the soul of a poet, as well as warriors, criminals, slaves, and priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dota2.com/hero/nevermore/|title=Hero - Shadow Fiend|website=www.dota2.com|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the game ''[[League of Legends]]'', the champion Swain uses ravens for his attacks. He carries a raven on his shoulder that attacks his enemies. He can turn himself into a giant raven surrounded by smaller ones for a short time. He also has a spell called Nevermove which immobilizes his enemies.
*The original version of [[Epcot]]'s [[Journey Into Imagination]] included an open book with the shadow of the raven in the "Tales of Terror" sequence.
*Variations using the DOS error message "[[Abort, Retry, Fail?|Abort, Retry, Ignore?]]" were written in the 1980s and 90s and were quite popular, distributed by bulletin board and email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/midnight.dreary.html|title=Midnight Dreary - GNU Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original and best known version has been credited to Cleveland poet [[Marcus Bales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stokely.com/lighter.side/abort.retry.ignore.html|title=Abort, Retry, Ignore - Poe Puree}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silverberch.com/poe3.html|title=Three Parodies of The Raven}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been adapted numerous times, attributed to Anonymous, Lucy Blades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/167058/have-you-written-poem-abort-retry-ignore|title=Have you written a poem about abort retry ignore?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Collins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/al/10avs/pquery.html|title=The Raven's Nest - The Query}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.
*A ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' comic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quaint And Curious Volume|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/4/13/}}&lt;/ref&gt; parodies the poem by making the raven say "Jersey Shore" as a comment on the ad supported [[Amazon Kindle]].
* The webcomic [[xkcd]] parodies the poem by playing on the term "rapping", showing the first stanza followed by a picture of popular [[rapper]] [[Eminem]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=xkcd 133|url=http://xkcd.com/133/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A parody of the poem appears upon the poker forum operated by [[Two Plus Two Publishing]] in the Bing Bland Blaow thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2+2 Forums|url=http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/54/poker-beats-brags-variance/created-victory-song-when-i-beat-someone-headsup-491103/index15.html#post11851055}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parody was subsequently made into a [[YouTube]] video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The R4V3N|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzweAb6WRwo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*In the universe of Warhammer 40.000, Corvus Corax, the primarch of the Raven Guard legion of the Space Marines, says "Never more" as his last words before he goes into the Eye of Terror and never returns.
*A style of parody on messageboards involves mimicking the style of the poem to some degree, with the line "quoth the raven 'never more' replaced by "quoth the server, '404'", referencing a commonly seen [[HTTP 404|http error code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=404 variants|url=http://www.messybeast.com/dragonqueen/404server.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Chamber Door is a game on [[Newgrounds]] that is a clear reference to "The Raven". It involves waking someone named Lenore while passing through rooms with ravens that have been experimented on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chamber Door|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/627413}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[RWBY]], an American web-anime animated by Monty Oum and distributed by [[Rooster Teeth]] Productions LLC, one of the Grimm is identified as a Nevermore, a Grimm that bears a strong resemblance to a giant raven with four eyes.
*Peter Sellers of the website Deeko made a review of ''[[Dementium: The Ward]]'' in the form/parody of the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pete |last=Sellers |url=http://www.deeko.com/nintendo_ds/reviewDetail.asp?id=924 |title=Dementium: The Ward - Review |publisher=Deeko |date=November 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109163955/http://www.deeko.com/nintendo_ds/reviewDetail.asp?id=924 |archivedate=November 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2008 episode of ''[[The Now Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]] featured a parody of the poem called "The Gordon", about [[Gordon Brown]].
*An alternate world extension of the poem, titled "For Evermore", appears in the independent comic, "Raven Nevermore" by XEI &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Evermore, XEI|url=http://xeibooks.com/for-evermore-poem-inspired-by-edgar-allan-poes-the-raven//}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sexual Paradox''''' is a book by [[Susan Pinker]] published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in 2008. Pinker is a psychologist and columnist for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008&gt;
Bazelon (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sexual Paradox'' was 2009 winner of the [[American Psychological Association]]'s annual William James Book Award, a ''[[New York Times]]'' "Editor's Choice", and one of the "Best Books" reviewed by the ''[[Evening Standard]]''. &lt;!--- What is this book ABOUT?---&gt;

== Quotes ==

* "If you were to predict the future on the basis of school achievement alone ... the world would be a matriarchy." (Quoted in [[Emily Bazelon]]'s ''New York Times'' review. Bazelon goes on to note: "And yet, of course, it is not. Once they move from school to work, men on average earn more money and run more shows. They particularly dominate in national government, the corporate boardroom and the science laboratory.")&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;
* "The puzzle is why the idea of sex differences continues to be so controversial." (Quoted in Bazelon.)&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;

== Reviews ==

* "We shouldn't wish the role of sex differences away because they're at odds with feminist dogma. But that doesn't mean we should settle for the reductionist version of the relevant science, even if the complexity doesn't make for as neat a package between hard covers." — [[Emily Bazelon]], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;{{clarify|reason=What on earth is this quotation demonstrating?  Is it a positive or negative review?  Is it a summary in some way?|date=December 2015}}
* "Pinker throws out the question of why women may or may not be allowed to be equal to men and posits a different one: why on earth do men get to be the standard? Why should females have the goal of meeting the male standard? This in itself denigrates females.... Pinker dares to posit the idea that women don't have the same preferences as men and therefore, might actually  choose different paths, not be forced into them by the patriarchy."  — Rebecca L. Burch, ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]''.&lt;ref name=Burch2008&gt;Burch (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[Pinker] delivers a well-referenced summary of the most up-to-date psychological research and social statistics in a cheerful style. The publicity the book has received, however, derives less from its style than its message." — [[Anne Campbell (academic)|Anne Campbell]], ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref name=Campbell2008&gt;Campbell (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4854">The '''Thesaurus Linguae Graecae''' ('''TLG''') is a research center at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. The TLG was founded in 1972 by [[Marianne McDonald]] (a graduate student at the time and now a professor of theater and classics at the [[University of California, San Diego]]) with the goal to create a comprehensive digital collection of all surviving texts written in Greek from antiquity to the present era. Since 1972, the TLG has collected and digitized most surviving literary texts written in [[Greek language|Greek]] from [[Homer]] to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 CE, and beyond. [[Theodore Brunner]] (1934-2007) directed the project from 1972 until his retirement from the University of California in 1998. [[Maria Pantelia]], also a classics professor at UC Irvine, succeeded Theodore Brunner in 1998, and has been directing the TLG since. TLG's name is shared with its online database, the full title of which is ''Thesaurus Linguae Graecae: A Digital Library of Greek Literature'' (the ''TLG'', in italics, for short).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=TLG – Home |work=Thesaurus Linguae Graecae: A Digital Library of Greek Literature |publisher=Thesaurus Linguae Graecae |location=University of California, Irvine |date=2017 |access-date=December 10, 2017}} At &lt;samp&gt;stephanus.tlg.uci.edu&lt;/samp&gt; since 2015; previously at &lt;samp&gt;www.tlg.uci.edu&lt;/samp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge of this huge undertaking was originally met with the help of several classicists and technology experts but primarily thanks to the efforts of [[David Woodley Packard]] and his team who created the Ibycus system, namely the hardware and software originally used to proofread and search the corpus. David Packard also developed [[Beta code]], a character and formatting encoding convention used to encode [[Polytonic Greek]]. The collection was originally circulated on [[CD-ROM]]. The first CD-ROM was released in 1985, and was the first compact disc that did not contain music. Subsequent versions were released in 1988 and in 1992, thanks to technical support provided by David W. Packard.

By the late 1990s, it became obvious that the old Ibycus technology was outdated. Under the direction of Professor Maria Pantelia, a number of new projects were undertaken, including the massive migration out of the Ibycus, the development of a new state of the art system to digitize, proofread, and manage the textual collection, a new CD-ROM (TLG E), released in 1999, and eventually the move of the corpus to the web environment in 2001. At the same time, the TLG undertook the project of working with the [[Unicode|Unicode Technical Committee]] to include all characters needed to encode and display Greek in the Unicode standard. The corpus continues to be expanded significantly to include [[Byzantine]], [[medieval]], and eventually [[modern Greek]] texts. More recent projects include the [[Lemmatisation|lemmatization]] of the Greek corpus (2006) – a substantial undertaking, given the highly inflectional nature of the Greek language and the complexity of the corpus, covering more than two millennia of literary development – and the Online Liddell–Scott–Jones ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (commonly referred to as the LSJ), released in February 2011.

Since 2001, the TLG corpus has been searchable online by members of subscribing institutions, which number close to 1500 worldwide. All bibliographical information and a subset of the texts are available to the general public.

According to an undated document on the TLG's web site, the total number of Greek words amounts to 110 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=About |url= http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/tlg.php |work=Thesaurus Linguae Graecae: A Digital Library of Greek Literature |publisher=Thesaurus Linguae Graecae |location=University of California, Irvine |date=2017 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number of unique wordforms amount to 1.6 million and the number of unique lemmata to 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Statistics |url= http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/helppdf/stats.pdf |format=PDF |work=Thesaurus Linguae Graecae: A Digital Library of Greek Literature |publisher=Thesaurus Linguae Graecae |location=University of California, Irvine |date=2017 |access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retiarius vs secutor from Borghese mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Retiarius]] vs [[Secutor]], the two gladiators lying are dead, as signified by the ''theta nigrum'']]
The '''theta nigrum''' ("black [[theta]]") or '''theta infelix''' ("unlucky theta") is a [[Symbols of death|symbol of death]] in Greek and Latin [[epigraphy]].&lt;ref name="Mednik"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mednikarova  |first=Iveta |last2= |first2= |date= |title=The Use of Θ in Latin Funerary Inscriptions |url= |journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=136 |issue=|pages=267–276 |doi= |access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore of Seville]] notes the letter was appended after the name of a deceased soldier and finds of [[papyrus|papyri]] containing military records have confirmed this use.&lt;ref name="Mednik" /&gt; Additionally it can be seen in [[Gladiator Mosaic|The Gladiator Mosaic]]. 

The term ''theta nigrum'' was coined by [[Theodor Mommsen]], but 
It consists of a circle with a diagonal line. The ''Theta'' signified [[Thanatos]], the Greek deity of death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=Mt9FAQAAMAAJ&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=Theta&amp;f=false A Dictionary of Latin Phrases]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28649">'''[[Tin]]''' is an essential [[metal]] in the creation of tin [[bronzes]], and its acquisition was an important part of [[ancient history|ancient cultures]] from the [[Bronze Age]] onward. Its use began in the [[Middle East]] and the [[Balkans]] around 3000 BC. Tin is a relatively rare element in the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]], with about 2 [[parts per million]] (ppm), compared to [[iron]] with 50,000 ppm, [[copper]] with 70 ppm, [[lead]] with 16 ppm, [[arsenic]] with 5 ppm, [[silver]] with 0.1 ppm, and [[gold]] with 0.005 ppm {{harv|Valera|Valera|2003|p=10}}. Ancient sources of tin were therefore rare, and the metal usually had to be traded over very long distances to meet demand in areas which lacked tin deposits.

Known sources of tin in ancient times include the southeastern tin belt that runs from [[Yunnan]] in [[China]] to the [[Malay Peninsula]]; [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]]; [[Brittany]] in [[France]]; the border between [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]]; [[Spain]]; [[Portugal]]; [[Italy]]; and [[Central Africa|central]] and [[Southern Africa|South Africa]] ({{harvnb|Wertime|1979|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Muhly|1979}}).  [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] have been suggested as minor sources of tin, but the archaeological evidence is inconclusive.

== Early use ==
[[File:Cassiterite - Mt Bischoff mine, Waratah, Tasmania, Australia.jpg|thumb|200px|Cassiterite and quartz crystals]]
Tin extraction and use can be dated to the beginning of the Bronze Age around 3000 BC, during which [[copper]] objects formed from polymetallic [[ore]]s had different physical properties {{harv|Cierny|Weisgerber|2003|p=23}}. The earliest bronze objects had tin or arsenic content of less than 2% and are therefore believed to be the result of unintentional [[alloying]] due to trace metal content in copper ores such as [[tennantite]], which contains arsenic {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|p=4}}. The addition of a second metal to copper increases its hardness, lowers the melting temperature, and improves the [[casting]] process by producing a more fluid melt that cools to a denser, less spongy metal {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|pp=4–5}}. This was an important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast in closed [[Mold (manufacturing)|molds]] of the Bronze Age. [[Arsenical bronze]] objects appear first in the Middle East where arsenic is commonly found in association with copper ore, but the [[Arsenic poisoning|health risks]] were quickly realized and the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the Bronze Age {{harv|Charles|1979|p=30}}. This created the demand for rare tin metal and formed a [[trade]] network that linked the distant sources of tin to the markets of Bronze Age [[cultures]].

[[Cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), oxidized tin,  most likely was the original source of tin in ancient times. Other forms of tin ores are less abundant [[sulfides]] such as [[stannite]] that require a more involved [[smelting]] process. Cassiterite often accumulates in [[alluvial]] channels as [[placer deposits]] due to the fact that it is harder, heavier, and more chemically resistant than the [[granite]] in which it typically forms {{harv|Penhallurick|1986}}. These deposits can be easily seen in [[river banks]], because cassiterite is usually black or purple or otherwise dark, a feature exploited by early Bronze Age [[prospectors]]. It is likely that the earliest deposits were alluvial and perhaps exploited by the same methods used for panning [[gold]] in placer deposits.

== Archaeological importance ==
The importance of tin to the success of Bronze Age cultures and the scarcity of the [[resource]] offers a glimpse into that time period's trade and cultural interactions, and has therefore been the focus of intense [[archaeological]] studies. However, a number of problems have plagued the study of ancient tin such as the limited archaeological remains of [[placer mining]], the destruction of ancient mines by modern [[mining]] operations, and the poor preservation of pure tin objects due to ''tin disease'' or ''[[tin pest]]''. These problems are compounded by the difficulty in provenancing tin objects and ores to their geological deposits using isotopic or trace element analyses. Current archaeological [[debate]] is concerned with the origins of tin in the earliest Bronze Age cultures of the Near East ({{harvnb|Penhallurick|1986}}; {{harvnb|Cierny|Weisgerber|2003}}; {{harvnb|Dayton|1971}}; {{harvnb|Giumlia-Mair|2003}}; {{harvnb|Muhly|1979}}; {{harvnb|Muhly|1985}}).

== Ancient sources ==

=== Europe ===
[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|Giant, ceremonial dirk of the Plougrescant-Ommerschans type, Plougrescant, France, 1500–1300 BC.]]
[[File:Huntingdon wheelpit2.jpg|thumb|Wheelpit at a medieval tin mine in Dartmoor, United Kingdom]]
[[Europe]] has very few sources of tin. Therefore, throughout ancient times it was imported long distances from the known tin mining districts of antiquity. These were the [[Erzgebirge]] along the modern border between Germany and Czech Republic, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Brittany]] in modern France, and [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in southwestern Britain ({{harvnb|Benvenuti|Chiarantini|Norfini|Casini|2003|p=56}}; {{harvnb|Valera|Valera|2003|p=11}}). There are several smaller sources of tin in the [[Balkans]] {{harv|Mason|Powell|Bankoff|Mathur|2016|p=110|ref=MasonEtAl2016}} and another minor source of tin is known to exist at [[Monte Valerio]] in [[Tuscany]], Italy. The Tuscan source was exploited by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] miners around 800 BC, but it was not a significant source of tin for the rest of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] {{harv|Benvenuti|Chiarantini|Norfini|Casini|2003}}. Even at that time, the Etruscans themselves had to import additional tin from the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and later from Cornwall {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|p=80}}.

It has been claimed that tin was first mined in Europe around 2500 BC in the Erzgebirge, and knowledge of tin bronze and tin extraction techniques spread from there to Brittany and Cornwall around 2000 BC and from northwestern Europe to northwestern Spain and Portugal around the same time {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|p=93}}.  However, the only Bronze Age object from Central Europe whose tin has been scientifically provenanced is the [[Nebra sky disk]], and its tin (and gold, though not its copper), is shown by tin isotopes to have come from Cornwall {{harv|Haustein|Gillis|Pernicka|2010}}.  In addition, a rare find of a pure tin ingot in Scandinavia was provenanced to Cornwall {{harv|Ling|Stos-Gale|Grandin|Hjärthner-Holdar|2014}}.  Available evidence, though very limited, thus points to Cornwall as the sole early source of tin in Central and Northern Europe.

Brittany – adjacent to Cornwall on the [[Celtic Sea]] – has significant sources of tin which show evidence of being extensively exploited after the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of [[Gaul]] during the first century BC and onwards {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|pp=86–91}}. Brittany remained a significant source of tin throughout the [[medieval period]].

A group of 52 bronze artifacts from the late Bronze Age Balkans has been shown to have tin of multiple origins, based on the correlation of tin isotope differences with the different find locations of the artifacts. While the locations of these separate tin sources are uncertain, the larger Serbian group of artifacts is inferred to be derived from tin sources in western Serbia (e.g. [[Cer (mountain)|Mount Cer]]), while the smaller group, largely from western Romania, is inferred to have western Romanian origins {{harv|Mason|Powell|Bankoff|Mathur|2016|p=116|ref=MasonEtAl2016}}.

Iberian tin was widely traded across the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age, and extensively exploited during [[Hispania|Roman times]]. But Iberian tin deposits were largely forgotten throughout the medieval period, were not rediscovered till the 18th century, and only re-gained importance during the mid-19th century {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|pp=100–101}}.

[[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|Cornwall and Devon were important sources of tin]] for Europe and the Mediterranean throughout ancient times and may have been the earliest sources of tin in Western Europe. But within the historical period, they only dominated the European market from late [[Roman Britain|Roman times]] in the 3rd century AD, with the exhaustion of many Spanish tin mines {{harv|Gerrard|2000|p=21}}. Cornwall maintained its importance as a source of tin throughout medieval times and into the modern period {{harv|Gerrard|2000}}.

=== Asia ===
[[Western Asia]] has very little tin ore; the few sources that have recently been found are too insignificant to have played a major role during most of ancient history {{harv|Cierny|Weisgerber|2003|p=23}}. However, it is possible that they were exploited at the onset of the Bronze Age and are responsible for the development of early bronze manufacturing [[technology]] ({{harvnb|Muhly|1973}}; {{harvnb|Muhly|1979}}). Kestel, in Southern Turkey, is the site of an ancient Casserite mine that was used from 3250 to 1800 BC. It contains miles of tunnels, some only large enough for a child. A grave with children which were probably workers has been found. It was abandoned, with crucibiles and other tools left at the site. The next evidence of the production of pure tin in the Middle East is an ingot from the 1300 BC [[Uluburun]] shipwreck off the coast of Turkey ({{harvnb|Hauptmann| Maddin| Prange|2002}}).

While there are a few sources of cassiterite in [[Central Asia]], namely in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Afghanistan]] that show signs of having been exploited starting around 2000 BC {{harv|Cierny|Weisgerber|2003|p=28}}, archaeologists disagree about whether they were significant sources of tin for the earliest Bronze Age cultures of the Middle East ({{harvnb|Dayton|2003}}; {{harvnb|Muhly|1973}}; {{harvnb|Maddin|1998}}; {{harvnb|Stech|Pigott|1986}}).

In [[Northern Asia]] the only tin deposits considered exploitable by ancient peoples occur in the far eastern region of [[Siberia]] {{harv|Dayton|2003|p=165}}. This source of tin appears to have been exploited by the [[Eurasian Steppe]] people known as the [[Seima-Turbino Phenomenon|Turbino]] culture of the Middle Bronze Age (1000 BC) as well as northern [[History of China|Chinese]] cultures around the same time {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|p=35}}.

[[Eastern Asia]] has a number of small cassiterite deposits along the [[Yellow River]] which were exploited by the earliest Chinese Bronze Age culture of [[Erlitou]] and the [[Shang Dynasty]] (2500 to 1800 BC). However, the richest deposits for the region, and indeed the world, lie in [[Southeastern Asia]], stretching from Yunnan in China to the Malay Peninsula. The deposits in Yunnan were not mined until around 700 BC, but by the [[Han Dynasty]] had become the main source of tin in China according to historical texts of the Han, [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin]], [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties {{harv|Murowchick|1991|pp=76–77}}. Other cultures of Southeast Asia exploited the abundant cassiterite resources sometime between second and third millennia BC, but due to the lack of archaeological work in the region little else is known about tin exploitation during ancient times in that part of the world.

Tin was used in the [[Indian subcontinent]] starting between 1500 and 1000 BC ({{harvnb|Hedge|1979|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Chakrabarti|Lahiri|1996}}). While [[India]] does have some small scattered deposits of tin, they were not a major source of tin for Indian Bronze Age cultures as shown by their dependence on imported tin.

=== Africa ===
While rich veins of tin are known to exist in Central and South Africa, whether these were exploited during ancient times is still debated {{harv|Dayton|2003|p=165}}. However, the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] culture of [[Zimbabwe]] are known to have actively mined, smelted and traded tin between the 11th and 15th centuries AD {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|p=11}}.

=== Americas ===
Tin deposits exist in many parts of [[South America]], with minor deposits in southern [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], and northwestern [[Argentina]], and major deposits of exploitable cassiterite in northern [[Bolivia]]. These deposits were exploited as early as 1000 AD in the manufacture of tin bronze by [[Andes|Andean]] cultures, including the later [[Inca Empire]], which considered tin bronze the "imperial alloy". In [[North America]], the only known exploitable source of tin during ancient times is located in the [[Zacatecas]] tin province of north central [[Mexico]] which supplied west Mexican cultures with enough tin for bronze production {{harv|Lechtman|1996|p=478}}.

=== Australia ===
The tin belt of Southeast Asia extends all the way down to [[Tasmania]], but metals were not exploited in [[Australia]] until the arrival of [[Europe]]ans in the 18th century.

== Ancient trade ==
Due to the scattered nature of tin deposits around the world and its essential nature for the creation of tin bronze, tin trade played an important role in the development of cultures throughout ancient times. Archaeologists have reconstructed parts of the extensive trade networks of ancient cultures from the Bronze Age to modern times using historical texts, archaeological excavations, and [[trace element]] and [[Isotope analysis|lead isotope analysis]] to determine the origins of tin objects around the world ({{harvnb|Valera|Valera|2003}}; {{harvnb|Rovia|Montero|2003}}; {{harvnb|Maddin|1998}}).

=== Mediterranean ===
The earliest sources of tin in the Early Bronze Age in the Near East are still unknown and the subject of much debate in archaeology ({{harvnb|Dayton|1971}}; {{harvnb|Dayton|2003}}; {{harvnb|Maddin|1998}}; {{harvnb|Muhly|1973}}; {{harvnb|Penhallurick|1986}}; {{harvnb|Stech|Pigott|1986}}; {{harvnb|Kalyanaraman|2010}}). Possibilities include minor now-depleted sources in the Near East, trade from Central Asia {{harv|Muhly|1979}}, [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] {{harv|Dayton|2003}}, Europe, or elsewhere.

It is possible that as early as 2500 BC, the Erzgebirge had begun exporting tin, using the well established [[Amber Road|Baltic amber trade route]] to supply [[Scandinavia]] as well as the Mediterranean with tin {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|pp=75–77}}. By 2000 BC, the extraction of tin in Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal had begun and tin was traded to the Mediterranean sporadically from all these sources. Evidence of tin trade in the Mediterranean can be seen in a number of Bronze Age [[shipwrecks]] containing tin ingots such as the [[Uluburun]] off the coast of [[Turkey]] dated 1300 BC which carried over 300 copper bars weighing 10 tons, and approximately 40 tin bars weighing 1 ton {{harv|Pulak|2001}}. While [[Sardinia]] does not appear to have much in terms of significant sources of tin, it does have rich copper and other mineral wealth and served as a centre for metals trade during the Bronze Age and likely actively imported tin from the Iberian Peninsula for export to the rest of the Mediterranean {{harv|Lo Schiavo|2003}}.
 
[[File:Map of Europe according to Strabo.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Europe based on Strabo's geography, showing the '''Cassiterides''' just off the northwest tip of Iberia]]

By [[Ancient Greece|classical Greek]] times, the tin sources were well established. [[Greece]] and the Western Mediterranean appear to have traded their tin from European sources, while the Middle East acquired their tin from Central Asian sources through the [[Silk Road]] {{harv|Muhly|1979|p=45}}. For example, [[Iron Age]] Greece had access to tin from Iberia by way of the [[Phoenicians]] who traded extensively there, from the Erzgebirge by way of the Baltic Amber Road overland route, or from Brittany and Cornwall through overland routes from their colony at [[Marseille|Massalia]] (modern day [[Marseilles]]) established in the 6th century BC {{harv|Penhallurick|1986}}. In 450 BC, [[Herodotus]] described tin as coming from [[Northern European]] islands named the [[Cassiterides]] along the extreme borders of the world, suggesting very long distance trade, likely from Britain, northwestern Iberia, or Brittany, supplying tin to Greece and other Mediterranean cultures {{harv|Valera|Valera|2003|p=11}}. The idea that the Phoenicians went to Cornwall for its tin and supplied it to the whole of the Mediterranean has no archaeological basis and is largely considered a myth {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|p=123}}.

The early Roman world was mainly supplied with tin from its Iberian provinces of [[Gallaecia]] and [[Lusitania]] and to a lesser extent Tuscany. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions that in 80 BC, a senatorial decree halted all mining on the [[Italian Peninsula]], stopping any tin mining activity in Tuscany and increasing Roman dependence on tin from Brittany, Iberia, and Cornwall. After the Roman conquest of Gaul, Brittany’s tin deposits saw intensified exploitation after the first century BC {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|pp=86–91}}. With the exhaustion of the Iberian tin mines, Cornwall became a major supplier of tin for the Romans after the 3rd century AD {{harv|Gerrard|2000}}.

Throughout the medieval period, demand for tin increased as [[pewter]] gained popularity. Brittany and Cornwall remained the major producers and exporters of tin throughout the Mediterranean through to modern times {{harv|Gerrard|2000}}.

=== Asia ===
[[File:Gefuding Gui.jpg|thumb|right|A Shang Dynasty bronze ''gefuding gui'' vessel]]

Near Eastern development of bronze technology spread across Central Asia by way of the Eurasian Steppes, and with it came the knowledge and technology for tin prospection and extraction. By 2000 to 1500 BC Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan appear to have exploited their sources of tin, carrying the resources east and west along the Silk Road crossing Central Asia {{harv|Cierny|Weisgerber|2003|p=28}}. This trade link likely followed an existing trade route of [[lapis lazuli]], a highly prized semi-precious blue [[gemstone]], and chlorite vessels decorated with [[turquoise]] from Central Asia that have been found as far west as Egypt and that date to the same period {{harv|Giumlia-Mair|2003|p=93}}.

In China, early tin was extracted along the Yellow River in Erlitou and Shang times between 2500 and 1800 BC. By Han and later times, China imported its tin from what is today Yunnan province. This has remained China’s main source of tin throughout history and into modern times {{harv|Murowchick|1991}}.

It is unlikely that Southeast Asian tin from [[Indochina]] was widely traded around the world in ancient times as the area was only opened up to Indian, [[Muslim]], and European traders around 800 AD {{harv|Penhallurick|1986|p=51}}.

[[Indo–Roman trade relations]] are well known from historical texts such as [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny’s ''Natural History'']] (book VI, 26), and tin is mentioned as one of the resources being exported from Rome to [[South Arabia]], [[Somaliland]], and India ({{harvnb|Penhallurick|1986|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Dayton|2003|p=165}}).
