'''Abda of Dair-Koni''' {{lang-syc|ܡܪܝ ܥܒܕܐ}}, (also known as '''Rabban Mar Abda''') was a priest and abbot of the [[Church of the East]].

He was born at [[Kynai]] also known as ''Qani'' (where the apostle [[Saint Mari]] was buried) of an immoral women who exposed her child to the elements. He was subsequently educated by the Christian church and [[ordination|ordained]] a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]]. He founded a monastery and a school at Dair Qoni. In this capacity, he served as the teacher of [[Mar Abba]]. After a career in which he successfully converted several [[Marcion]]ites, he retired to Tella on the Serser River.

No [[feast day]] commemorating this saint has been found to have existed.

'''Abdullah ibn Suhayl''' is an early companion of [[Muhammad]] who emigrated to [[Medina]] using a clever tactic at the [[Battle of Badr]]. He is also the son of the famous [[Quraysh]]ite statesmen, [[Suhayl ibn Amr]]  and brother of [[Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl]].

== Life ==
Abdullah ibn Suhayl was born in approximately 594 and was the son of [[Suhayl ibn Amr]] from Banu Amir branch. His mother, Atika bint Awf was from Banu Amir also. 

== Biography ==
Abdullah had become a Muslim before the [[Battle of Badr]], but did not have a way to join the Muslims in Medina. Leaving Mecca and being openly Muslim was difficult for Abdullah because of the powerful influence of his father and his esteemed place in Quraysh. Abdullah concocted a plan to switch sides and join forces with the Muslims at Badr. He rode to Badr with the rest of the pagan Quraysh and his father and waited until the two forces camped close enough to each other that they were both within eyesight of each other. With the Muslim camp so close, Abdullah escaped to the side of Muhammad and fought alongside them the next day.

His relatively early conversion to Islam and his participation in the Battle of Badr as a Muslim places him in the esteemed position of the [[Sahabah]]. He is said to have emigrated to Ethiopia in the first migration. Abdullah ibn Suhayl also participated in the [[Battle of Uhud]], the [[Battle of the Trench]], and the [[Battle of Yamama]].

== Death ==
Abdullah was killed at the [[Battle of Yamama]] at 38 years old in 632 CE. His brother in law, [[Abu Hudhayfa ibn 'Utba]], adopted nephew, [[Salim Mawla Abu Hudhayfa]], and second cousin, [[Zayd ibn al-Khattab]] were killed seconds after him. After his death, [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] said that he had fulfilled his duty and that God's messenger was proud of him when he died. He was mourned deeply by his brother, [[Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl]] and his father, [[Suhayl ibn Amr]]. His father would sometimes pray to Allah to grant mercy and to bestow his grace to Abdullah.

'''Age &amp; Scarpelli''' ({{IPA-it|ˈaːɡe|lang}}) is the [[stage name]] used by the pair of [[Italy|Italian]] [[screenwriter]]s '''[[Agenore Incrocci]]''' (1914–2005) and '''[[Furio Scarpelli]]''' (1919–2010). Together, they wrote the script for about a hundred movies, mainly [[satire|satirical]] [[comedy|comedies]].

The duo started working together in ''[[Totò cerca casa]]'' of [[1949 in film|1949]], and ended their collaboration in the 1980s. They worked for many famous Italian [[film director|directors]], like [[Sergio Leone]] (''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]''), [[Mario Monicelli]] (including their major work, ''[[L'armata Brancaleone]]''), [[Dino Risi]], [[Luigi Comencini]], [[Pietro Germi]] and [[Ettore Scola]] and they wrote the dialogues of many [[Totò]] movies.

In [[1985 in film|1985]], they decided to part ways, and subsequently worked separately for movies such as ''[[Boom (film)|Boom]]'' for Age and ''[[Il Postino]]'' for Scarpelli.

Age &amp; Scarpelli are often considered the inventors of ''[[commedia all'italiana]]'' (Italian-style comedy).

'''Agilbert''' ([[floruit]] [[circa]] 650–680) was the second bishop of the [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] kingdom and later [[bishop of Paris]]. Son of a [[Neustria]]n noble named Betto, he was a first cousin of [[Audoin (bishop)|Audoin]] and related to the [[Faronids]] and [[Agilolfings]],&lt;ref&gt;Le Jan, pp. 382, notes 6, 388, &amp; 390–391, table 48. Le Jan shows that Agilbert's first cousins included Saints [[Audoin]] and [[Ouen|Dado]], the future Bishop [[Ebregisil of Meaux]], and Agilberta, the second abbess of Jouarre.&lt;/ref&gt; and less certainly to the [[Merovingians]].&lt;ref&gt;Fouracre.&lt;/ref&gt; His name, the [[Frankish language]] equivalent of Æthelberht, has been taken to suggest a link with the royal family of the [[Kingdom of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;Fouracre states: "[h]is very name was the Frankish form of Æthelberht...". Le Jan, however, takes his name to indicate kinship with the Agilolfings; Le Jan, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agilbert was consecrated as a bishop in [[Francia]] before he travelled to [[Great Britain|Britain]].  He arrived in the West Saxon kingdom after the return to power of King [[Cenwalh of Wessex]], who had been driven out by [[Penda of Mercia]], either in the late 640s or 650s. He was appointed to succeed [[Birinus]] as bishop of the West Saxons, or [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishop of Dorchester]]. Agilbert, according to [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', had "spent a long time in Ireland for the purpose of studying the Scriptures".&lt;ref name="HE_III_7"&gt;Bede, ''HE'', Book III, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment was due to Cenwalh.&lt;ref name=Kirby48&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Bede]], it appears that Agilbert did not speak Old English, and it is said that his see was divided in two, with [[Wine (bishop)|Wine]] being given half, because King Cenwalh "tired of his barbarous speech",&lt;ref name="HE_III_7"/&gt; although this may be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; This insult supposedly led to Agilbert's resignation. He then travelled north to [[Northumbria]], where he ordained [[Wilfrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Eddius, ''VW'',  chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was present at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, where he led the pro-Roman party, but he had the young Wilfrid speak on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''HE'', Book III, Chapter 25; Eddius, ''VW'',  chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charter of Clotilde.jpg|thumb|right|The charter of Clotilde, 10 March 673, endowing the monastery of Bruyères-le-Châtel; witnessed by Agilbert, this is his last appearance in the historical record]]
Returning to Francia, Agilbert later took part in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop at [[Compiègne]].&lt;ref&gt;Eddius, ''VW'', chapters 11 &amp; 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Agilbert became bishop of Paris between 666 and 668, and hosted [[Theodore of Tarsus]]. He was later invited to return by Cenwalh, to become [[bishop of Winchester]], but sent his nephew [[Leuthhere]] in his place.&lt;ref name="Fouracre; Riché."&gt;Fouracre; Riché.&lt;/ref&gt;

One modern historian, D. P. Kirby, is unsure if Agilbert actually went to Northumbria after being expelled from Dorchester, suggesting it is just as likely that he went directly to the continent.&lt;ref name=Kirby48/&gt;

Agilbert died at some time after 10 March 673, on which date he witnessed [[Clotilde (floruit 673)|Clotilde]]'s foundation charter for the Abbey of [[Bruyères-le-Châtel]], and probably between 679 and 690. He was buried at [[Jouarre Abbey]] where his sister Theodechildis was abbess. His fine sculpted [[sarcophagus]] can be seen there in the crypts, as can that of his sister.&lt;ref name="Fouracre; Riché."/&gt;

'''Aleksandrs Ābrams''' (born 1904, date of death unknown) was a [[Latvia]]n [[association football|football]] forward who used to play with [[Rīgas FK]], the most successful Latvian football club of the 1920s and 1930s.

==Club playing career==
The first club that Ābrams played with was [[Amatieris]] for which he played in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Reserves squad of Latvia national football team in 1932&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 along with two other notable Amatieris footballers – [[Arkādijs Pavlovs]] and [[Arnolds Tauriņš]] Ābrams joined [[Rīgas FK|RFK]] as it went on to its first Latvian league title. Ābrams went on to winning two more league titles with RFK in 1925 and 1926. At the end of the 1927 season Ābrams was one of several RFK main squad footballers (together with [[Arvīds Jurgens]], [[Voldemārs Plade]], [[Česlavs Stančiks]] and others) to leave the team for the newly founded [[Riga Vanderer]] club which became a strong rival for RFK in the following years (RFK was usually the stronger side on field, but there was always a high tension surrounding the derby between these two sides). In 1928 RV with Ābrams as one its key players won the [[Riga]] Class B tournament to progress to Class A which it won the following year.

In 1930 Ābrams returned together with Vanderer to the top tier of Latvian football, winning the bronze medals of Virslīga. He retired from top level football in 1931. In later years Ābrams played in football tournaments for clerks as a member of the squad of the Latvian [[customs]] office.

==National team playing career==
Ābrams played 8 international matches for [[Latvia national football team]] in the period from 1924 to 1927, scoring two goals – in friendly matches against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] in 1924. He played for Latvia for the last time on 29 May 1927 as Latvia suffered a devastating 0–12 loss against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].

'''Alexander III'''  ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Medieval Gaelic]]: ''Alaxandair mac Alaxandair''; Modern Gaelic: ''Alasdair mac Alasdair'') (4 September 1241 – 19 March 1286) was [[King of Scots]] from 1249 until his death in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander III (1241 - 1286)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/alexander_iii.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:There stepped from out the crowd an old, old man.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.88|"There stepped from out the crowd an old, old man": Alexander crowned as King of Scotland]]
Alexander was born at [[Roxburgh]], the only son of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] by his second wife [[Marie de Coucy]]. Alexander III was also the grandson of [[William the Lion]]. Alexander's father died on 8 July 1249 and he became king at the age of seven, inaugurated at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 13 July 1249.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by [[Walter Comyn]], [[Earl of Menteith]], the other by [[Alan Durward]], [[Justiciar of Scotia]]. The former dominated  the early years of Alexander's reign. At the marriage of Alexander to [[Margaret of England]] in 1251, [[Henry III of England]] seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_iii/ "Alexander III, King of Scots 1249 – 1286", Scotland's History, BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the [[Western Isles]] which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He laid a formal claim before the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon]].  Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the [[Isle of Arran]], and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific [[extreme weather|storm]] which greatly damaged his ships. The [[Battle of Largs]] (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]] by which he ceded the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Western Isles]] to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained only [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] in the area.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Succession==

Alexander had married [[Margaret of England|Margaret]] (his 4th cousin by [[Henry I of England]]), daughter of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]], on 25 December 1251.&lt;ref name="MacArthur2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret MacArthur|title=History of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5c8sDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25|date=12 July 2017|publisher=Merkaba Press via PublishDrive|pages=25–|id=PKEY:6610000020409}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1275, after they had had three children.{{fact|date=October 2018}}
:
# [[Margaret of Scotland (Queen of Norway)|Margaret]] (28 February 1261 – 9 April 1283), who married King [[Eric II of Norway]]&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
# [[Alexander, Prince of Scotland]] (21 January 1264 [[Jedburgh]] – 28 January 1284 [[Lindores Abbey]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]
# David (20 March 1272 – June 1281 [[Stirling Castle]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]

According to the [[Lanercost Chronicle]], Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: "he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=Herbert, ed.|title=Chronicle of Lanercost|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|date=1909|volume=6|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBNAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=he+used+never+to+forbear+on+account+of+season+nor+storm,+nor+for+perils+of+flood+or+rocky+cliffs,+but+would+visit+none+too+creditably+nuns+or+matrons,+virgins+or+widows+as+the+fancy+seized+him,+sometimes+in+disguise&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yEItYRMs7g&amp;sig=yz0Vs_BdYFi0hwh3YKOzFPyDQDM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9mPKzybLOAhWIRiYKHWgqAm4Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20used%20never%20to%20forbear%20on%20account%20of%20season%20nor%20storm%2C%20nor%20for%20perils%20of%20flood%20or%20rocky%20cliffs%2C%20but%20would%20visit%20none%20too%20creditably%20nuns%20or%20matrons%2C%20virgins%20or%20widows%20as%20the%20fancy%20seized%20him%2C%20sometimes%20in%20disguise&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1284 he induced the [[Parliament of Scotland|Estates]] to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Margaret, the "Maid of Norway"]]. The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to [[Yolande de Dreux (Scotland)|Yolande de Dreux]]&lt;ref name=alba&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/warsofindependence/deathofalexanderiii/index.asp |title="Death of Alexander III", Foghlam Alba |access-date=2015-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714225534/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/warsofindependence/deathofalexanderiii/index.asp |archive-date=2015-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 November 1285.

Alexander died in a fall from his horse while riding in the dark to visit the queen at [[Kinghorn]] in [[Fife]] on 18 March 1286 because it was her birthday the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Scottish Queens, 1034-1714 | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | page=27 | year=2003 | publisher=Tuckwell Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had spent the evening at Edinburgh Castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors. He was advised by them not to make the journey to Fife because of weather conditions, but he travelled anyway. Alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing. The 44-year-old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck. Some texts have said that he fell off a cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=James, ed.|title=The Nuttall Encyclopaedia|date=1920|publisher=Warne|location=London|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EcPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=alexander+iii+fell+off+a+cliff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEjZ3CzLLOAhWEQCYKHd1fDMYQ6AEISjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=alexander%20iii%20fell%20off%20a%20cliff&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found, there is a very steep rocky embankment, which "would have been fatal in the dark."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mount|first1=Toni|title=Dragon's Blood &amp; Willow Bark: The Mysteries of Medieval Medicine|date=2015|publisher=Amberley|location=Stroud, Glos.|isbn=978-1445643830|page=n.p.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlVpCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP23&amp;lpg=PP23&amp;dq=death+alexander+iii+no+cliff&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ldi7V7r9Bg&amp;sig=lfQp3NXzUEWnAaXKWvPnaoKUHzw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiApOLezbLOAhVC7CYKHTSRAd84ChDoAQhZMA8#v=onepage&amp;q=death%20alexander%20iii%20no%20cliff&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Alexander's death, his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with England. He was buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]].

As Alexander left no surviving children, the heir to the throne was his unborn child by Queen Yolande. When Yolande's pregnancy ended, probably with a miscarriage, Alexander's seven-year-old granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], became the heir. Margaret died, still uncrowned, on her way to Scotland in 1290. The inauguration of [[John Balliol]] as king on 30 November 1292 ended the six years of the [[Guardians of Scotland]] governing the land.

The death of Alexander and the subsequent period of instability in Scotland was lamented in an early [[Scots language|Scots]] poem recorded by [[Andrew of Wyntoun]] in his [[Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland]].

In 1886, a monument to Alexander III was erected at the approximate location of his death in [[Kinghorn]].&lt;ref name="nationalgalleries"/&gt;

==Fictional portrayals==

[[File:Alexander III statue, West door of St. Giles, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.88|Statue of Alexander on the west door of St. Giles, Edinburgh]]
Alexander III has been depicted in historical novels. They include:&lt;ref name="Nield"&gt;Nield (1968), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

*''The Thirsty Sword'' (1892) by Robert Leighton. The novel depicts the "Norse invasion of Scotland" (1262–1263, part of the [[Scottish–Norwegian War]]) and the [[Battle of Largs]]. It includes depictions of Alexander III and his opponent [[Haakon IV of Norway]].&lt;ref name="Nield"&gt;Nield (1968), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Alexander the Glorious'' (1965) by Jane Oliver. The novel covers the entire reign of Alexander III (1249–1286), "almost entirely from Alexander's viewpoint".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalnovels.info/Medieval-Celts.html "Historical Novel:Medieval Celts"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/ALEXANDER-GLORIOUS-Jane-Oliver/product-reviews/B00209JTBA/ref=sr_1_1_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1 "Alexander the Glorious", review]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Crown in Darkness'' (1988) by [[Paul C. Doherty]]. A [[crime fiction]] novel where Hugh Corbett investigates the "mysterious death" of Alexander III (1286). Alexander supposedly suffered a fatal fall from his horse. But there are suspicions of murder. The novel concludes that Alexander was indeed murdered "by a fanatical servant" of [[Edward I of England]]. The killer acting according to "Edward's secret desire to overwhelm and control Scotland". Doherty suggests that the personal relations of the two kings were strained by constant arguments, though this is not confirmed by historical sources.&lt;ref name="Detective"&gt;Browne, Kreiser (2000), p. 78, 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Quest For A Maid'' (1988) by [[Frances Mary Hendry]]. The novel depicts the life of Meg, her power-hungry older sister Inge, Lady [[Marjorie, Countess of Carrick]] and their part in securing the succession of Lady Marjorie's son [[Robert the Bruce]] to the Scottish throne.  It includes depictions of Alexander III's death as "falling off a cliff" with sorcery as the cause.
*''Insurrection'' (2010) by [[Robyn Young]]. This novel is the first of a series of novels primarily about the life and times of Robert the Bruce. However, it covers Alexander III and the circumstances surrounding his death in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Insurrection | author=http://historicalnovelsociety.org| work=historicalnovelsociety.org | url=http://historicalnovelsociety.org/reviews/insurrection/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Raphael Holinshed]], in his oft-fanciful history of England, stated that at Alexander III's wedding, a horrible monster, mostly skeleton but with raw flesh, appeared at the end of the procession and caused the wedding to be hurriedly concluded. This was, in tradition, an omen of death.
*''Crusader'' (1991) by [[Nigel Tranter]]. This novel follows the minority of Alexander III and his relationship with David de Lindsay. Tranter, who has written scores of historical novels spanning the range of Scotland's history, also wrote "Envoy Extraordinary" (1999) (about Patrick Earl of Dunbar) and "True Thomas" (1981) (about Thomas the Rhymer), both of which take place during the reign of Alexander III, and in which Alexander is a featured character.

'''Alexander Selkirk''' (1676{{spaced ndash}}13 December 1721) was a Scottish [[privateer]] and [[Royal Navy]] officer who spent four years and four months as a [[castaway]] (1704–1709) after being [[marooning|marooned]] by his [[captain (nautical)|captain]] on an uninhabited island in the [[South Pacific Ocean]]. He survived that ordeal, but succumbed to tropical illness a dozen years later while serving aboard {{HMS|Weymouth|1693|6}} off West Africa.

Selkirk was an unruly youth, and joined [[buccaneer]]ing voyages to the South Pacific during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. One such expedition was on ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'', captained by Thomas Stradling and under the overall command of [[William Dampier]]. Stradling's ship stopped to resupply at the uninhabited [[Juan Fernández Islands]], and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there.

When he was eventually rescued by English privateer [[Woodes Rogers]], in company with Dampier, Selkirk had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island. His story of survival was widely publicised after their return to England, becoming a source of inspiration for writer [[Daniel Defoe]]'s fictional character [[Robinson Crusoe]].

==Early life and privateering==
Alexander Selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in [[Lower Largo]], [[Fife]], Scotland, born in 1676.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=18–19}} In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition. He was summoned before the [[Kirk Session]] in August 1693{{sfnp|Takahashi|Caldwell|Cáceres|Calderón|2007|loc=n.&amp;nbsp;11|ps=, "Date of 1693, verified from the original Kirk Session Records (CH2/960/2, pp.&amp;nbsp;29, 30), is erroneously given in other printed sources as 1695."}} for his "indecent conduct in church", but he "did not appear, being gone to sea". He was back at Largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for assaulting his brothers.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=24–25}}

Early on, he was engaged in [[buccaneer]]ing. In 1703 he joined an expedition of English [[privateer]] and explorer William Dampier to the [[South Pacific Ocean]],{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=1–2}} setting sail from [[Kinsale]] in Ireland on 11 September.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|p=3}} They carried [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] from the [[Prince George of Denmark|Lord High Admiral]] authorising their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was then going on between England and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/journeys/voyage_html/transcripts/stgeorge.htm|title=Letters of Marque and Reprisal for the St George, Declaration of William Dampier|website=The National Archives|date=13 October 1702|access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dampier was [[captain (nautical)|captain]] of ''St George'' and Selkirk served on ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'', ''St George''{{'}}s companion ship, as [[sailing master]] under Captain Thomas Stradling.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=33, 37–38}} By this time, Selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=24–25}}

In February 1704, following a stormy passage around [[Cape Horn]],{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=14–15}} the privateers fought a long battle with a well-armed French vessel, ''St Joseph'', only to have it escape to warn its Spanish allies of their arrival in the Pacific.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|p=26}} A raid on the Panamanian gold mining town of [[Santa María, Herrera|Santa María]] failed when their landing party was [[ambush]]ed.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=44–45}} The easy capture of ''Asunción'', a heavily laden merchantman, revived the men's hopes of plunder, and Selkirk was put in charge of the [[prize ship]]. Dampier took off some much-needed provisions of wine, brandy, sugar and flour; then abruptly set the ship free, arguing that the gain was not worth the effort. In May 1704 Stradling decided to abandon Dampier and strike out on his own.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=45–47}}

==Castaway==
[[File:Rob-cru.png|thumb|left|alt=Shaded relief map of the Juan Fernández Islands with blue ocean he died on the island background|Map of the [[Juan Fernández Islands]], where Selkirk lived as a castaway]]
In September 1704, after parting ways with Dampier,{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=46–47}} Captain Stradling brought ''Cinque Ports'' to an island known to the Spanish as [[Más a Tierra]] located in the uninhabited [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández archipelago]] {{convert|670|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} off the coast of Chile for a mid-expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies.{{sfnp|Lee|1987|pp=394–395}}

Selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel, and wanted to make the necessary repairs before going any farther. He declared that he would rather stay on Juan Fernández than continue in a dangerously leaky ship.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=125}} Stradling took him up on the offer and landed Selkirk on the island with a [[musket]], a [[hatchet]], a knife, a cooking pot, a [[King James Bible|Bible]], bedding and some clothes.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=126}} Selkirk immediately regretted his rashness, but Stradling refused to let him back on board.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=125}}

''Cinque Ports'' did indeed later founder off the coast of what is now Colombia. Stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the Spanish. The survivors were taken to [[Lima, Peru]], where they endured a harsh imprisonment.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=145, 333}}

===Life on the island===
At first, Selkirk remained along the shoreline of Juan Fernández. During this time he ate [[spiny lobster]]s and scanned the ocean daily for rescue, suffering all the while from loneliness, misery and remorse. Hordes of raucous [[Mirounga leonina|sea lions]], gathered on the beach for the mating season, eventually drove him to the island's interior.{{sfnp|Steele|1713|p=169–171}} Once inland, his way of life took a turn for the better. More foods were available there: [[feral goat]]s—introduced by earlier sailors—provided him with meat and milk, while wild [[turnip]]s, [[Dendroseris litoralis|cabbage leaves]] and dried [[pink peppercorn|pepper berries]] offered him variety and spice. [[Rat]]s would attack him at night, but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near [[feral cat]]s.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=127–128}}

[[File:Selkirk reading his Bible.png|thumb|right|alt=Engraving of Selkirk sitting in the doorway of a hut reading a Bible|Selkirk reading his Bible in one of two huts he built on a mountainside]]
Selkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island: he forged a new knife out of [[barrel]] hoops left on the beach,{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=128}} he built two huts out of [[Schinus molle|pepper]] trees, one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping, and he employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses. As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying helpless and unable to move for about a day. His prey had cushioned his fall, probably sparing him a broken back.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=126–127}}

Childhood lessons learned from his father, a tanner, now served him well. For example, when his clothes wore out, he made new ones from hair-covered goatskins using a nail for sewing. As his shoes became unusable, he had no need to replace them, since his toughened, calloused feet made protection unnecessary.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=128}} He sang [[Psalms#The Psalms in Christian worship|psalms]] and read from the Bible, finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his English.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=126}}

During his sojourn on the island two vessels came to anchor. Unfortunately for Selkirk, both were Spanish. As a Scotsman and a privateer, he would have faced a grim fate if captured and therefore did his best to hide himself. Once he was spotted and chased by a group of Spanish sailors from one of the ships. His pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to notice him. The would-be captors then gave up and sailed away.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=125}}

===Rescue===
[[File:Serkirk being taken aboard the Duke.jpg|thumb|alt=Selkirk, seated in a ship's boat, being taken aboard ''Duke''.|The rescued Selkirk, seated at right, being taken aboard ''Duke''.]]
Selkirk's long-awaited deliverance came on 2 February 1709 by way of ''Duke'',{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=124–125}} a privateering ship [[maritime pilot|piloted]] by William Dampier, and its sailing companion ''Duchess''.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=6}} [[Thomas Dover]] led the landing party that met Selkirk.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=124}} After four years and four months without human company, Selkirk was almost incoherent with joy.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=129}} The ''Duke''{{'s}} captain and leader of the expedition was [[Woodes Rogers]], who mischievously referred to Selkirk as the governor of the island. The agile castaway caught two or three goats a day and helped restore the health of Rogers' men, who were suffering from [[scurvy]].{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=131–132}}

Captain Rogers was impressed by Selkirk's physical vigour, but also by the peace of mind that he had attained while living on the island, observing: "One may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine, especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably, as this man was."{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=130}} He made Selkirk ''Duke''{{'}}s [[second mate]], later giving him command of one of their prize ships, ''Increase'',{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=147}} before it was ransomed by the Spanish.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=220}}

Selkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance. At [[Guayaquil]] in present-day Ecuador, he led a boat crew up the [[Guayas River]] where a number of wealthy Spanish ladies had fled, and looted the gold and jewels they had hidden inside their clothing.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=178–179}} His part in the hunt for treasure [[Manila galleon|galleons]] along the coast of Mexico resulted in the capture of ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño|Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño]]'',{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=294}} renamed ''Bachelor'', on which he served as sailing master under Captain Dover to the [[Dutch East Indies]].{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=312}} Selkirk completed the around-the-world voyage by the [[Cape of Good Hope]] as the sailing master of ''Duke'',{{sfnp|Cooke|1712|p=61}} arriving at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]] off the English coast on 1 October 1711.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=427}} He had been away for eight years.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|p=3}}

==Later life and influence==
[[File:Robinson svensk1732.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|alt=Engraving of Robinson Crusoe standing on the shore of an island, dressed in hair-covered goatskin clothing|An illustration of [[Robinson Crusoe|Crusoe]] in goatskin clothing shows the influence of Selkirk]]
Selkirk's experience as a castaway aroused a great deal of attention in England. Fellow crewmember Edward Cooke mentioned Selkirk's ordeal in a book chronicling their privateering expedition, ''[[A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World|A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World]]'' (1712). A more detailed recounting was published by the expedition's leader, Rogers, within months.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=124–125}} The following year, prominent essayist [[Richard Steele]] wrote an article about him for ''The Englishman'' newspaper. Selkirk appeared set to enjoy a life of ease and celebrity, claiming his share of ''Duke'''s plundered wealth—about £800{{sfnp|Steele|1713|p=173}} (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|800|1713|r=-2|fmt=c}} today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Gregory|title=The Annual RPI and Average Earnings for Britain, 1209 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukearncpi/|website=MeasuringWorth|date=2016|access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, legal disputes made the amount of any payment uncertain.{{sfnp|Souhami|2001|pp=180–181}}

After a few months in London, he began to seem more like his former self again.{{sfnp|Steele|1713|p=173}} In September 1713 he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in [[Bristol]] and may have been kept in confinement for two years.{{sfnp|Lee|1987|p=399|ps=; cf. [[#CITEREFSouhami2001|Souhami (2001)]], p.&amp;nbsp;186, "He did not show up for the hearing. He moved to the obscurity of London for some months, then went home to Largo."}} He returned to Lower Largo, where he met Sophia Bruce, a young dairymaid. They eloped to London early in 1717 but apparently did not marry. He was soon off to sea again, having enlisted in the [[Royal Navy]].{{sfnp|Souhami|2001|pp=190–192}} While on a visit to [[Plymouth]] in 1720, he married a widowed innkeeper named Frances Candis.{{sfnp|Souhami|2001|pp=201–202}} He was serving as [[master's mate]] on board {{HMS|Weymouth|1693|6}}, engaged in an anti-[[Golden Age of Piracy#The post-Spanish-Succession period|piracy]] patrol off the west coast of Africa, when he died on 13 December 1721, succumbing to the [[yellow fever]] that plagued the voyage. He was buried at sea.{{sfnp|Souhami|2001|pp=203–205}}

When [[Daniel Defoe]] published ''[[Robinson Crusoe|The Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), few readers could have missed the resemblance to Selkirk. An illustration on the first page of the novel shows "a rather melancholy-looking man standing on the shore of an island, gazing inland", in the words of modern explorer [[Tim Severin]]. He is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins, his feet and shins bare.{{sfnp|Severin|2002|p=11}} Yet Crusoe's island is located not in the [[mid-latitudes]] of the South Pacific but {{convert|4300|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} away in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], where the furry attire would hardly be comfortable in the [[tropical climate|tropical]] heat. This incongruity supports the popular belief that Selkirk was a model for the fictional character,{{sfnp|Severin|2002|p=17}} though most literary scholars now accept that his was "just one of many survival narratives that Defoe knew about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/robinson-crusoe-alexander-selkirk-history/|title=Debunking the Myth of the 'Real' Robinson Crusoe|work=National Geographic|author=Little, Becky|date=28 September 2016|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other literary works==
[[File:Alexander Selkirk Title Page.jpg|thumb|300px|Title page from ''The Life and Adventures of Alexander Selkirk, the Real Robinson Crusoe'' (1835), by an unknown author]]
* [[William Cowper]]'s "The Solitude Of Alexander Selkirk" is about Selkirk's feelings as the castaway lived all alone on the island. This poem gave rise to the common phrase "monarch of all I survey" via the verse:
&lt;poem&gt;:::I am monarch of all I survey,
:::My right there is none to dispute;
:::From the centre all round to the sea,
:::I am lord of the fowl and the brute.{{sfnp|Ravitch|Ravitch|2006|p=134}}&lt;/poem&gt;

* [[Charles Dickens]] used Selkirk as a simile in Chapter Two of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1836): "Colonel Builder and Sir Thomas Clubber exchanged snuff-boxes, and looked very much like a pair of Alexander Selkirks—'Monarchs of all they surveyed.{{'"}}{{sfnp|Dickens|1836|p=15}} This is also a reference to William Cowper's poem.{{sfnp|Ravitch|Ravitch|2006|p=134}}
* Poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]] likens his loneliness on the road to that of Selkirk, in his poem "Inniskeen Road: July Evening":
&lt;poem&gt;:::Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight
:::Of being king and government and nation.
:::A road, a mile of kingdom, I am king
:::Of banks and stones and every blooming thing.{{sfnp|Regan|2004|pp=402–403}}&lt;/poem&gt;

* In "Etiquette", one of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Bab Ballads]]'', Selkirk is used as a model for the English castaways:
&lt;poem&gt;:::These passengers, by reason of their clinging to a mast,
:::Upon a desert island were eventually cast.
:::They hunted for their meals, as Alexander Selkirk used,
:::But they couldn’t chat together—they had not been introduced.{{sfnp|Gilbert|1970|p=274}}&lt;/poem&gt;

* [[Joshua Slocum]] mentions Selkirk in the book ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900). During his visit to the Juan Fernández Islands, Slocum runs across a marker commemorating Selkirk's stay.{{sfnp|Slocum|1900|p=141}}
* In [[Allan Cole]] and [[Chris Bunch]]'s Sten science fiction series, Book Two, ''[[The Wolf Worlds]]'', the Scottish character Alex bemoans their predicament after crash landing: {{"'}}A slackit way f'r a mon,' Alex mourned to himself. 'Ah didnae ken Ah'd ever be Alex Selkirk.{{'"}}{{sfnp|Bunch|Cole|1984|p=21}}

==In film==
''[[7 Sea Pirates|Selkirk, the Real Robinson Crusoe]]'' is a [[stop motion]] film by [[Walter Tournier]] based on Selkirk's life. It premièred simultaneously in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay on 2 February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cinenacional.com/pelicula/selkirk-el-verdadero-robinson-crusoe|title=Selkirk, el verdadero Robinson Crusoe|work=Cine Nacional|date=2011|access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributed by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It was the first full-length animated feature to be produced in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/120804/pespec-655726/novedades/-selkirk-llega-al-dvd-con-algunas-novedades/|title=Selkirk llega al DVD con algunas novedades|work=El País|date=8 April 2012|access-date=13 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805084032/http://www.elpais.com.uy/120804/pespec-655726/novedades/-selkirk-llega-al-dvd-con-algunas-novedades/|archivedate=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
[[File:Alexander Selkirk Plaque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|alt=Bronze plaque in memory of Selkirk affixed to a building|Plaque for Selkirk in [[Lower Largo]], Scotland, which reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In memory of Alexander Selkirk, mariner, the original of Robinson Crusoe who lived on the island of Juan Fernández in complete solitude for four years and four months. He died {{Sic|1723|expected=1721}}, [[Master's mate#Renaming and later use|lieutenant]] of HMS ''Weymouth'', {{Sic|nolink=y|aged 47 years|expected=aged 45 years}}. This statue is erected by David Gillies, net manufacturer, on the site of the cottage in which Selkirk was born."&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]
Selkirk has been memorialised in his Scottish birthplace. [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]] delivered a speech on 11 December 1885, after which his wife, [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]], unveiled a bronze statue and plaque in memory of Selkirk outside a house on the site of his original home on the Main Street of Lower Largo. David Gillies of Cardy House, Lower Largo, a descendant of the Selkirks, donated the statue created by [[Thomas Stuart Burnett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsindependent.org/dates1-f.htm |title=Notable Dates in History |work=Scots Independent |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205083554/http://www.scotsindependent.org/dates1-f.htm |archivedate=5 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scotsman is also remembered in his former island home. In 1869 the crew of {{HMS|Topaze|1858|6}} placed a bronze tablet at a spot called Selkirk's Lookout on a mountain of Más a Tierra, Juan Fernández Islands, to mark his stay.{{sfnp|Severin|2002|p=59}} On 1 January 1966 Chilean president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] renamed Más a Tierra [[Robinson Crusoe Island]] after Defoe's fictional character to attract tourists. The largest of the Juan Fernández Islands, known as [[Más Afuera]], became [[Alejandro Selkirk Island]], although Selkirk probably never saw that island since it is located {{convert|180|km|mi nmi|-1|abbr=off}} to the west.{{sfnp|Severin|2002|pp=23–24}}

==Archaeological findings==
An [[archaeological]] expedition to the Juan Fernández Islands in February 2005 found part of a nautical instrument that likely belonged to Selkirk. It was "a fragment of copper alloy identified as being from a pair of [[Caliper#Divider caliper|navigational dividers]]"{{sfnp|Takahashi|Caldwell|Cáceres|Calderón|2007|p=270}} dating from the early 18th (or late 17th) century. Selkirk is the only person known to have been on the island at that time who is likely to have had dividers, and was even said by Rogers to have had such instruments in his possession.{{sfnp|Takahashi|Caldwell|Cáceres|Calderón|2007|pp=294–295}} The artefact was discovered while excavating a site not far from Selkirk's Lookout where the famous castaway is believed to have lived.{{sfnp|Takahashi|Caldwell|Cáceres|Calderón|2007|pp=274–275}}

'''Amadeus William Grabau''' (January 9, 1870&amp;mdash;March 20, 1946), the father of Chinese geology, was an expatriate American geologist.

==Biography==
Grabau was a German-American [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]], born in [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin]] in the [[United States]] who died in [[Peking]], [[China]]. His grandfathers had led dissident Lutheran immigrants from Germany to [[Buffalo, New York]]. His education began in his father's parochial school in Cedarburg, and then the public high school there. After his father became head of the Martin Luther Seminary in 1885, he finished high school in Buffalo. He took classes in the evenings while apprenticed to a bookbinder. His interest in local fossils grew. In a correspondence course in mineralogy, he impressed geologist [[William Otis Crosby]] enough to hire him at the [[Boston Society of Natural History]] in 1890, and arrange his education at [[Boston Latin School|Boston Latin]], [[MIT]], and [[Harvard]].

He taught at [[MIT]] and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] early in his career. In 1901 he became a professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]. He married Barnard student [[Mary Antin]] on October 5, 1901. She would go on to become a prominent author. The pro-German attitudes during [[World War I]] led to an estrangement from his wife, and in 1919 he left Columbia for China. He was appointed professor at [[Peking University|Peking National University]] in 1919 or 1920. As part of his life's work, he conducted a geologic survey of China, and is now known as the father of Chinese geology. In 1936, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] awarded him the [[Mary Clark Thompson Medal]] from for most important service to geology and paleontology.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite web |title=Mary Clark Thompson Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/mary-clark-thompson-medal.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]] he remained in Peking. Around 1941 he was interned by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. His health declined precipitously, and he died of an [[internal hemorrhage]] after his release.

==Books==
Grabau was also a prolific author, publishing at least 10 books in the first half of the 20th century. Grabau developed various [[theory|theories]] during his lifetime, among them the theory of rhythms concerning the growth of the [[crust (geology)|earth's crust]] and a theory concerning [[orogeny|mountain building and creation]]. The [[Dorsum Grabau]], a [[wrinkle ridge]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} A list of books written by Grabau, and their publication dates includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037569?tocId=9037569|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Axël''''' is a drama by French writer [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]], published in 1890. It was influenced by his participation in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Gnostic]] philosophy of [[Georg Hegel]] as well as the works of [[Goethe]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. It begins in an occult castle. The [[Byronic hero]] Axël meets a Germanic princess. After an initial conflict they fall in love. They speak of the amazing journeys they plan to have. But they realize that life will never measure up to their dreams. They then commit suicide.

== History ==

''Axël'' was the work Villiers considered his masterpiece{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, although critical opinion has often been reluctant to agree with him, placing far higher value on his fiction. Villiers began work on the piece around 1869 and had still not put the finishing touches to it when he died. It was first published posthumously in 1890. The play is heavily influenced by the [[romanticism|Romantic]] theatre of [[Victor Hugo]], as well as [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' and the music dramas of [[Richard Wagner]]. The last time it was staged was during the year 2006 in Québec and Montréal, directed by [[Christian Lapointe]].

== Summary ==

The scene is set in Germany in 1828 and opens on Christmas Eve in the convent of Saint Apollodora, where the rich heiress Sara de Maupers is just about to take the veil. But when the archdeacon asks Sara whether she is ready to accept "light, hope and life", she replies "no". The religious authorities attempt to imprison Sara, but she manages to flee. The rest of the drama takes place in the castle of Axël d'Auersperg, a young nobleman distantly related to Sara. Axël's cousin Kaspar has learnt that a vast treasure is buried near the castle. He tries to persuade Axël to help him look for it but Axël refuses, the two quarrel and Axël kills Kaspar in a duel. In the third act, Axël's [[Rosicrucian]] tutor, Master Janus, prepares to initiate Axël into the occult mysteries. He asks his pupil whether he is ready to accept "light, hope and life", and Axël replies "no". In Act Four, Axël decides to leave the castle forever and goes down to the crypt to say farewell to the tombs of his ancestors. Here he surprises Sara, who has been led to the castle by an old manuscript which tells of the location of the buried treasure. A door opens and the treasure pours out. Axël and Sara fight, then fall in love. They dream of the glorious future the treasure will bring them then declare their dreams are far too magnificent to be fulfilled in everyday, unimaginative reality. They decide to kill themselves and die as the sun rises. The play's most famous line is Axël's ''"Vivre? les serviteurs feront cela pour nous"'' ("Living? Our servants will do that for us"). [[Edmund Wilson]] used the title ''[[Axel's Castle]]'' for his study of early Modernist literature.

'''''Chowder''''' is an American [[animated television series]] created by [[C. H. Greenblatt]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. The series follows an aspiring young chef apprentice named Chowder and his day-to-day adventures in Chef Mung Daal's [[catering]] company. Although he means well, Chowder often finds himself in predicaments due to his [[Gourmand|perpetual appetite]] and his nature as a [[wikt:scatterbrain|scatterbrain]]. It is animated with both [[traditional animation]] as well as short [[stop motion]] and puppet sequences that are inter-cut into the episodes, and that run over the end credits. Stop motion sequences are produced by [[Screen Novelties]]. It is also the first Cartoon Network original series to premiere during Stuart Snyder's tenure, as [[Jim Samples]] had resigned months before the series premiere.

''Chowder'' premiered on November 2, 2007, and ran for three seasons with 49 total episodes. It garnered one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] win, six [[Annie Award]] nominations, and two additional Emmy Award nominations during its run. The series finale, "Chowder Grows Up," aired on August 7, 2010.

==Characters==
Each character is named after a type of food or dish. 
===Main===
* Chowder (voiced by [[Nicky Jones (actor)|Nicky Jones]]): A 10-year-old chubby purple {{not a typo|[[cat]]—[[bear]]—[[rabbit]]}}&lt;ref name=CNUKfacts&gt;{{cite web|title=Character Facts of the Week: Chowder|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/blogs/character-facts-of-the-week-chowder|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910053503/http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/blogs/character-facts-of-the-week-chowder|archivedate=September 10, 2014|date=March 20, 2012|quote=Chowder is a mix between a cat, bear, and rabbit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; hybrid who serves as an apprentice under the chef [[Mung Daal]], Chowder lives with Mung Daal and his wife, Truffles, in a room at the top of the catering business. Chowder wants to become a great chef, but he is very impulsive and scatterbrained and often gives in to his urges. He is always hungry and eats anything, even a customer's order. Chowder can also regurgitate objects, and he is used as a storage container by the other characters. According to Greenblatt, he is a composite of a cat, a bear and a rabbit, and his species was verified in at least one episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Puckerberry Overlords|series=Chowder|airdate=January 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. H. Greenblatt voiced his adult self in the last episode.
* Mung Daal (voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]): The elderly chef who runs the catering company at which Chowder works.&lt;ref name="cn-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/chowder/index.html|title=Chowder|publisher=Cartoon Network|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his exact age has not been stated, he has mentioned that he has cooked for at least 386 years,&lt;ref name="certifrycation"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Certifrycation Class|series=Chowder|airdate=November 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he celebrated 450 years of marriage to Truffles (see below).&lt;ref name="mung"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Mung on the Rocks|series=Chowder|airdate=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a light blue-colored humanoid and is named after the [[Indian cuisine|Indian dish]] [[Mung bean|mung]] [[dal|daal]], that Greenblatt had originally planned to give Mung an [[Indian accent]], but later decided against it.&lt;ref name="food"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/10/real-world-food-counterparts.html|title=Real World Food Counterparts|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=October 12, 2008|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shnitzel (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in "The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin", and [[John DiMaggio]] afterward): A 38-year-old taupe rock monster and professional chef who works at Mung Daal's Catering Company. His vocabulary consists almost entirely of "radda", while it's translated as "okay", although he sometimes says other simple words.&lt;ref name="radda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/01/shnitzel-faq.html|title=Shnitzel FAQ|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=January 1, 2008|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He talks in the episode "The Trouble with Truffles" because he finally gets calm enough. Shnitzel is the "[[straight man]]" to the other more excitable characters and is frequently agitated. He gets stuck with menial labor or cleanup duty, as well as the heavy lifting because he is extremely strong. Although usually angered by Chowder's antics, Shnitzel really has a soft spot for Chowder, as he cries when it was thought that Chowder has vanished forever.&lt;ref name="radda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chowder-prem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/10/just-two-weeks-until-chowder-premiere.html|title=Just Two Weeks Until Chowder Premiere|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=July 18, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Michael Richardson voiced Shnitzel for the debut episode "The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin" and was replaced at the last moment by DiMaggio due to Richardson being busy with other projects at the time.&lt;ref name="radda"/&gt;
* Truffles (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]): A [[mushroom]] [[pixie]]/[[fairy]] and Mung Daal's wife who handles the business side of Mung's catering business. She is an extreme [[Four_Temperaments#choleric|choleric]]. Greenblatt said that he based Truffles on his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/11/mahjongg-night.html|title=Mahjongg Night|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|work=Nerd Armada|date=November 28, 2007|accessdate=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenblatt said that he initially found difficulty in working on any story with Truffles since the character could be "so abrasive" that the ''Chowder'' staff had to be "a little more sensitive about finding her softer side." Greenblatt said that the staff eventually decided that "a little Truffles goes a long way." Therefore, she would appear occasionally in ''Chowder'' in a manner similar to how [[Oscar the Grouch]] appears on ''[[Sesame Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bakertoons.blogspot.com/2009/08/exit-interview-with-ch-greenblatt.html|title=Exit interview with C.H. Greenblatt|first=Charles|last=Brubaker|date=August 31, 2009|work=Baking the Baker|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/08/were-off.html|title=We're Off!|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=August 31, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Link 1 is the interview, link 2 is to confirm that he did the interview--&gt;
* Kimchi (voiced by C. H. Greenblatt): Chowder's pet, who lives in a cage next to his bed. Kimchi is an anthropomorphic flatus (due to the unpleasant odor of [[kimchi]]). He likes things with odors unpleasant for the other characters, and he "talks" by making flatulent sounds. Kimchi was first seen in the episode "The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin". Kimchi is usually shown with a blank personality but in "Stinky Love" it is shown that he has an opinion.&lt;ref name="toonzone"/&gt;
* Gazpacho (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]): A [[woolly mammoth]] storekeeper who sells strange [[produce]] and ingredients at the farmer's market. He does his best to offer advice to Chowder when needed. He lives with his overbearing mother, who never appears on screen, but is present at the end of episode "Gazpacho!". In "The Spookiest House in Marzipan" it is hinted at that Gazpacho has no mother, and that he actually suffers with [[dissociative identity disorder]], but creator Greenblatt says this was merely to "pay homage to [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]". Gazpacho shows no interest in moving out and improving his own life. Gazpacho's worst enemies are [[ninja]]s. Greenblatt named him after the cold soup [[gazpacho]]; Greenblatt said that he did not know why, but the name suited the character immediately.&lt;ref name="food"/&gt;
* Panini (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]): A 10-year-old pink [[cabbit]] who has a crush on Chowder and reminds him at every opportunity. Chowder does not return the feelings and responds with "I'm not your boyfriend!" whenever she greets him. Panini is an apprentice to Ms. Endive, and is also possessive of Chowder. Panini gets jealous when she sees Chowder with another girl, in which Chowder really does to avoid her. Her original character concept had her [[bullying|bully]] Chowder in a manner described by Greenblatt as similar to [[Angelica Pickles]] from ''[[Rugrats]]''.&lt;ref name="OldPanEn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|title=Early Endive &amp; Panini Designs|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=June 15, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenblatt removed the pointy ears since he felt this did not fit in with the rounded shapes in ''Chowder''. Greenblatt did not like characters similar to Angelica and believed that he needed to make Panini "cuter and sweeter".&lt;ref name="OldPanEn"/&gt; Greenblatt said that the details of Panini formed when the creator decided that Panini had a crush on Chowder; since Chowder is not old enough to fall in love with females, according to Greenblatt this aspect would frustrate Chowder "in a more fun way".&lt;ref name="OldPanEn"/&gt; In the last episode, it is shown that Chowder finally returned Panini's feelings and accepted her because he realizes that he made Panini's life miserable and they are married with many kids and was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. Panini's name literally means "sandwiches" in Italian, while her former name, Borlotti, is a type of beans.
* Ms. Endive (voiced by [[Mindy Sterling]]): An [[obesity|obese]], intelligent, and somewhat snobbish 46-year-old female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She's also occasionally portrayed as the show's main [[antagonist]] or [[villain]]. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This is shown in the episode "The Apprentice Games" where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on Endive's posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode "Chowder's Girlfriend", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fiancé did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. Endive is first seen in the second episode with Panini, "Chowder's Girlfriend". The creator describes her as [[Martha Stewart]] with [[Oompa-Loompa]] colors.&lt;ref name="endive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|title=Ms. Endive|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=April 19, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenblatt chose to name her after the [[endive]] since endive is bitter and Belgian endive is fancy; hence the character is bitter and fancy.&lt;ref name="food"/&gt; Endive's character stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how Endive looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. Endive is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving Endive.&lt;ref name="OldPanEn"/&gt;

===Recurring===
* Kiwi (voiced by C. H. Greenblatt) is a [[photorealistic]] pink creature who always gives advice to Chowder and his friends and occasionally provides interstitial narrations, especially at times where particularly corny humor is displayed. His name is revealed (for the first and last time ever in the show's run) in the episode "Brain Grub", where it is known that after Chowder alters the animated universe, Kiwi is reduced to selling used cars.
* Gorgonzola (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green [[rat]] apprentice candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder having a better job than him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|title=Gorgonzola|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=July 18, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since [[blue cheese]] was one of the few foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name "[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]]" for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green [[opossum]] or a green [[rat]]. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode ''Sniffleball''. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.&lt;ref name="food"/&gt;
* Ceviche (voiced by Elan Garfias): A young yellow (and somewhat androgynous) [[goat]] apprentice to Paté and Panini's best friend, Ceviche was introduced in the episode "The Apprentice Games". He practices aerobic-style dancing and is very charitable and kind to others. Because of his admirable attitude and amazing talents (as well as good looks, as it was shown on one episode that he has a well-sculpted body) he is well-liked.  He is good friends with Panini and will make unwanted advances upon her, which are either refused or unnoticed. Ceviche is also a close friend to Chowder. He has a crush on Panini.  He speaks in a [[wikt:monotone|monotonous]] voice and serves as [[deadpan]] humor for the show.
* Paté (voiced by John DiMaggio): A tall, well-sculpted [[humanoid]] ballet dance master and operatic singer with a deep voice, grass-green hair, a small black hat, and exaggerated lips who is the mentor of Ceviche. Paté was introduced briefly on the second episode of the first show ''Chowder's Girlfriend'' (Episode #1b), where he sings "I'm Not Your Boyfriend" on stage to Panini (on behalf of Chowder) in front of an audience. His name, however, was revealed for the first time on ''The Apprentice Games'' (Episode 20), where he appeared as a judge for the Marzipan City Apprentice Games. In that same episode, it was also revealed that he lives in another dimension, as was shown by the portal through which he and Ceviche made their entrance and exit.
* Chestnut (originally voiced by [[Tone Lōc]], then [[John DiMaggio]]): Like the food, Chestnut is small and tough. He is a tiny, [[blue]] horned [[devil]]-like creature with a deep, gravelly voice and, to many character's surprise, is physically very strong.  Because of his size, he uses everyday objects as other things (e.g. using a briefcase for a hydrofoil, or a hat as a vacation home). He sings small songs to himself, usually consisting of his catchphrase of "Dinka-loo, dinka-lee." He is teacher of the BLTs, a parody of the [[SAT]]s. He always refers to himself in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] when speaking.
* Reuben (voiced by [[Paul Reubens]]): A pig who is a [[confidence trick|conman]] and steals from others. 
* Mr. Fugu (voiced by [[Bob Joles]]): A floating balloon who is said to be Mung's most frequent customer. He is proven to be more greedy than Chowder and never shares any food with him. He is often seen with his valet, Foie Gras, a [[Maneki-neko]] (meows provided by [[George Takei]]) holding Mr. Fugu's string as he cannot control his flotation.
* Sgt. Hoagie (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]): He is a dog who is a police officer in Marzipan City. In ''The Hot Date'' he was going out on a date after several years and asked the other cops for advice.

{{:List of Chowder episodes}}
A total of 49 episodes were aired in the series. Season 1, which consists of 20 episodes, started on November 2, 2007, with the series premiere, entitled "The Froggy Apple Crumble Thumpkin/Chowder's Girlfriend". Season 1 ended on July 24, 2008, with the special "The Apprentice Games". Season 2 also contains 20 episodes, debuting on October 1, 2008, with "The Arborians/The Garage Sale", and ending with "A Faire to Remember/Tofu-Town Showdown", broadcasting on September 29, 2009, and October 6, 2009, respectively. Season 3 consists of only 9 episodes, premiering October 12, 2009, with "The Blast Raz", and ending with the series finale, entitled "Chowder Grows Up", which aired on August 7, 2010.

==Development==
[[File:ChowderPuppets.jpg|thumb|The puppet versions of the characters Chowder (a Hand-Rod puppet) and Mung Daal]]
During his time working on [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept.&lt;ref name="toonzone"/&gt; Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy.&lt;ref name="kitty-interview"/&gt; Some of the inspiration comes from [[Dr. Seuss]], with other inspiration from [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.&lt;ref name="kitty-interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="armada"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139420 |title=Meet the Master Chef&amp;nbsp;– C.H. Greenblatt |date=December 12, 2007 |first=Steve |last=Fritz |publisher=Animated Shorts |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122105026/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139420 |archivedate=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenblatt pitched the concept to Cartoon Network, and two years later the series was approved with another year for production before the pilot episode aired. Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on ''Chowder'' before the show made it to air in 2007.&lt;ref name="toonzone"/&gt;

==Production and format==
Episodes are produced in seasons which consist of twenty 24-minute episodes. Each episode is produced with a 30-second puppet sequence that is meant to run over the ending credits.&lt;ref name="season2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/06/let-new-chowders-begin.html|title=Let the New Chowders Begin!!|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=June 3, 2008|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes can be purchased from the [[iTunes Store]] in the United States which are delivered with the sequences as are episodes which are available on Cartoon Network's VOD website also within the United States.&lt;ref name="kitty-interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puppets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-puppets.html|title=More Puppets|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=February 7, 2008|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=March 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the unusual design features of the show is the patterns used on the clothing or players. The patterns are developed as a full-screen image and then sent to the production house, where the characters are modified to fill the patterns in over the character clothing.&lt;ref name="toonzone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2007/10/toon-zone-interviews-c-h-greenblatt-on-crafting-chowder/|title=Toon Zone Interviews C.H.

A similar technique was used in the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' video game series (particularly for the Stan), the Nickelodeon series [[The Off-Beats]], and the [[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|''Mr. Bean'' animated series]].&lt;ref name="armada"/&gt;

The show is also known for the very wide variety of media used in various episodes. These include animation using watercolors and ink-and-paint in addition to the cartoon's classic pattern style. It also uses stop motion animation with real food, action figures and clay; live-action scenes with the voice actors of the show and puppets; both marionette and hand-controlled. This was also sometimes used in ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''. It boasts one of the most diverse varieties of mediums used in any single series.

==Cancellation==
''Chowder'' was cancelled by Cartoon Network in August 2010, as the network felt the show did not fit its new demographic of older boys, favoring shows such as the live-action ''[[Destroy, Build, Destroy]]'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, C.H. Greenblatt expressed relief about having his schedule freed up by the cancellation, saying: "I didn't really think there'd be this many upsides to having a show officially cancelled by a network, but I'm feeling happier than I've been in a long time. Since we've only got post-production, my schedule finally eases up. I haven't had a break like this in a long, long time... ''Chowder'' has opened up a lot of awesome possibilities for me, and creatively I'm feeling more inspired than ever."&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/08/hot-girl.html|title=The Hot Girl|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=August 13, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.H. Greenblatt also noted that many of the staff signed on to a new project at [[Disney]], which would end up being the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Fish Hooks]]'', which Greenblatt worked on as an episode director. The cancellation of ''Chowder'' also led to Greenblatt developing a new project for [[Nickelodeon]], ''Bad Seeds'' (later retitled ''[[Harvey Beaks]]'').

==Reception==

===Critics===
Barry Garron of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' thought that the show would appeal to children and adults alike, using exotic artwork, unusual settings, and a zany cast of characters.&lt;ref name="hollywood"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://208.115.47.50/cartoonnetwork/article_images/NXE913120_1_H.pdf |title=Chowder |first=Barry |last=Garron |date=November 2, 2007 |page=47 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oDZGw1pO?url=http://208.115.47.50/cartoonnetwork/article_images/NXE913120_1_H.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Toon Zone, Ed Liu expands on the animation and crazy antics of the characters, pointing that "the humor is kid-friendly without being juvenile" and praising it for getting laughs, "without resorting to an excess of toilet humor, even if Chowder's pet happens to be a sentient fart cloud."&lt;ref name="toonzone-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2007/11/chowder-is-satisfying-comfort-food/|title="Chowder" is Satisfying Comfort Food|first=Ed|last=Liu|date=November 2, 2007|publisher=Toon Zone|accessdate=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron H.

Historically the term '''psychopannychism''' was also used, despite problems with the etymology{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | '''Pannychis''' (παννυχὶς) in Greek means an all night party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Parker | title = Polytheism and Society at Athens | year = 2007 | page = 166 | quote = The mood of a pannychis was often one of gaiety, but this was also a form of religious action...

The difference is difficult to identify in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Milton Studies | volume = 45 | first = Albert C | last = Labriola | publisher = Univ of Pittsburgh Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8229-4267-2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Crzuxp0q6IMC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=psychopannychism+thnetopsychism&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=psychopannychism%20thnetopsychism&amp;f=false | page = 17 | quote = Milton tends to espouse the variation of vital introspection known as Thnetopsychism, which holds that the body and soul die, though certain passages in ''De Doctrina Christiana'' seem to support the alternative type, Psychopannychism, which states that soul and body merely sleep until the Last Day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related and contrasting viewpoints of life after death include [[universal reconciliation]], where all souls are immortal (or are mortal, but universally given continuance) and eventually are reconciled, and [[special salvation]], where a positive afterlife is exclusively held by just some souls. Christian mortalism has been taught by several theologians and church organizations throughout history while also facing opposition from aspects of Christian [[organized religion]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] condemned such thinking in the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] as "erroneous assertions". Supporters include the sixteenth-century religious figure [[Martin Luther]] and the eighteenth-century religious figure [[Henry Layton]] among many others.

==Etymology and terminology==
Since the phrases "soul sleep" or "soul death" do not occur either in the [[Bible]] or in early [[Anabaptist]] materials, an explanation is required for the origin of the term.  Additionally several other terms have been introduced relating to the view.  Modern theologians have used the term "Christian mortalism" and related wordings from the 21st century onwards.

===Soul sleep===
The phrase ''soul sleep'' appears to have been popularised by [[John Calvin]] in the subtitle to his Latin tract ''Psychopannychia'' ({{Citation | title = Psychopannychia | type = manuscript | place = [[Orléans]] | year = 1534}}, {{Citation | type = print | title = Psychopannychia | language = Latin | place = [[Strasbourg]] | year = 1542}}, {{Citation | title = Psychopannychia | edition = 2nd | origyear = 1545 | language = French | place = [[Geneva]] | year = 1558}}, {{Citation | title = Psychopannychia | year = 1581}}). The title of the booklet comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''psyche'' (soul, mind) with ''pan-nychis'' (παν-νυχίς, all-night vigil, all-night banquet),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=pannuxi%2Fs&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=pannu/xios#lexicon | first = Liddle | last = Scott | title = Lexicon | type = entry | contribution = Night-festival, vigil}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Barth | first = K | title = The theology of John Calvin | year = 1995 | page = 161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so ''Psychopannychia'', originally, represents Calvin's view; that the soul was conscious, active.

The title and subtitle of the 1542 [[Strasbourg]] 1st edition read: {{Citation |trans-title=That the holy souls of those who die in the faith of Christ live with Christ and do not sleep. An Assertion. | language = Latin | title = Vivere apud Christum non dormire animas sanctas qui in fide Christi decedunt. Assertio.}}.{{Sfn | de Greef | 2008 | p = 152-2}}

The title and subtitle of the 1545 2nd Latin edition read: {{Citation |trans-title=Psychopannychia – Or a refutation of the error entertained by some unskillful persons, who ignorantly imagine that in the interval between death and the judgment the soul sleeps. | language = Latin | title = Psychopannychia – qua repellitur quorundam imperitorum error qui animas post mortem usque ad ultimum iudicium dormire putant.}}.

The 1558 French edition was a translation of that of the 1545 2nd edition: {{Citation | title = Psychopannychie – traitté par lequel est prouvé que les âmes veillent et vivent après qu'elles sont sorties des corps ; contre l'erreur de quelques ignorans qui pensent qu'elles dorment jusque au dernier jugement.}}

===Other terms===
* "Psychopannychism" - In the Latin it is clearer that ''Psychopannychia'' is actually the refutation of, the opposite of, the idea of soul sleep.  The version {{Citation | language = French | title = Psychopannychie – La nuit ou le sommeil de l'âme |trans-title=Psychopannychia – the night or the sleep of the soul | place = [[Geneva]] | year = 1558}} may have caused the confusion that by ''-pannychis'' Calvin meant sleep (in Greek ''-hypnos'' not ''-pannychis'', vigil).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Jean Henri Merle | last = d'Aubigné | language = French | title = Histoire de la réformation en Europe au temps de Calvin |trans-title=History of the Reformation in Europe at the time of Calvin}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subtitle {{Citation | language = French | title = le sommeil de l'âme}} was taken up as {{Citation | language = German | title = Seelenschlaf |trans-title=Soul-sleep}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = Ernst | editor-last = Staehelin | language = German | title = Johannes Calvin: Leben und ausgewählte Schriften | volume = 1 | year = 1863 | page = 36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tract first appeared in English as {{Citation | title = An excellent treatise of the Immortalytie of the Soule | first = John | last = Calvin | place = London | year = 1581 | others = Stocker, T transl.}}.

Luther's use of similar language (but this time defending the view) appears in print only a few years after Calvin:
{{Quote | …so the soul after death enters its chamber and peace, and sleeping does not feel its sleep | {{Citation |trans-title=Commentary on Genesis | title = Enarrationes in Genesis | year = 1535–45 | language = Latin}}.{{Sfn | Luther | 1830 | loc = v. 5, 6 p. 120 | ps =: ‘…sic anima post mortem intrat suum cubiculum et pacem et dormiens non sentit suum somnum’}}}}

* "Hypnopsychism" - from ''hypno-'' + ''psyche'' ("sleep of soul") was a more correct coinage from Greek than that of Calvin's editor. [[Eustratios of Constantinople]] (after 582) denounced mortalism as a heresy using this term.
* "Thnetopsychism" - A possibly contrasting phrase is {{visible anchor|thnetopsychism}} (from Greek ''thnetos'' [mortal] + ''psyche'' [soul, mind]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Donald K | last = McKim | title = Westminster dictionary of theological terms | place = Westminster | publisher = John Knox Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-66425511-4}}, 320 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has its origin in the descriptions of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] and [[John of Damascus]] of mortalist views among Arab Christians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society | year = 1920 | title = St John Damascene (676–760) in liber de Haer | number = 90 | author-link = Jacques Paul Migne| last = Migne | first = Jacques Paul | at = p. 94, col. 759}} says that the Thnetopsychists hold that the human soul is like that of the beasts, for it is destroyed with the body.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Ludwig | last = Ott | others = Lynch, Patrick, transl. from the German | title = Fundamentals of Catholic dogma | year = 1964 | page = 98 | quote = The doctrine of the death of the soul (Thnetopsychism)...  Origen defends it against Thnetopsychism which was widely current in Arabia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1600s also this phrase was applied also to the views of Tyndale, Luther and other mortalists, from awareness that Calvin's term ''Psychopannychia'' originally described his own belief, not the belief he was calling error.{{Sfn | Williams | 1962 | p = 582 | ps =: ‘to designate both the doctrine of the death of the soul (thnetopsychism, mortalism) and the unconscious sleep of the soul’}}  The term is also used of the view of the Anabaptists. Their view is that the soul dies, with the body to be recalled to life at the [[resurrection of the dead]], or that the soul is not separate from the body and so there is no "spiritual" self to survive bodily death. In both cases, the deceased does not begin to enjoy a reward or suffer a punishment until [[Judgment Day]].

==Mortalist arguments==
Historically, Christian mortalists have advanced theological, lexical, and scientific arguments in support of their position.{{Sfn | Blackburne | 1765 | p = 70 | ps =: ‘In the year 1702, Dr. William Coward a Physician, under the fictitious name of Estibius Psychalethes, published a book entitled, Second Thoughts concerning human soul, demonstrating the notion of human soul, as believed to be a spiritual, immortal substance united to human body, to be a plain heathenish invention, and not consonant to the principles of philosophy, reason, or religion.’}}

===Theological arguments===
Some early eastern Christians argued for mortalism on the basis of the identity of blood with life in Leviticus 17:11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Till the end of the sixth century and beyond, Christians in Nisibis and Constantinople, Syria and Arabia adduced Leviticus 17:11 which states that ‘The soul of the whole flesh is the blood” to argue that the soul after death sank into non-existence, that it lost its sensibility and stayed inert in the grave together with the body.’ | last = Samellas | title = Death in the eastern Mediterranean (50–600 [[Anno Domini|AD]]): the Christianization of the East: An Interpretation | series = Studien Und Text Zu Antike Und Christentum | pages = 55–56 | year = 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Theological arguments which contended that the continued existence of the soul was not taught in the Bible were made by mortalists such as [[Francis Blackburne (priest)|Francis Blackburne]],{{Sfn | Blackburne | 1765 | p = 68–69 | ps =: ‘The doctrine of the New Testament is, that men shall become immortal by the way of a resurrection of the dead, a restoration of the whole man to life; and the [[New Testament|NT]] is so far from acknowledging any intermediate consciousness in man, between death and the resurrection, that' if always speaks of that interval as a sleep which implies a suspension of the thinking faculty, a rest from those labours, which require thought, memory, consciousness, &amp;c. during which those faculties are useless.’}} [[Joseph Priestley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The notion of the soul of man being a substance distinct from the body, has been shown, and I hope to satisfaction, not to have been known to the writers of the scriptures, and especially those of the Old Testament. According to the uniform system of revelation, all our hopes of a future life are built upon another, and I may say an opposite foundation, viz. that of the resurrection of something belonging to us that dies, and is buried, that is, the body, which is always considered as the man.  This doctrine is manifestly superfluous on the idea of the soul being a substance so distinct from the body as to be unaffected by its death, and able to subsist, and even to be more free and happy, without the body.

The condition is observed to cease with death; and I know of no facts of modern science which make it otherwise than difficult to believe in the persistence of that condition, that is, 'the immortality of the personal existence.’  Science has learned no more than is expressed in Eccl. 3: 19: 'For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast.'

It is a universal induction of science that modification of brain is accompanied by modification of consciousness, and that the destruction of brain results in destruction of consciousness.  No exception to this law has ever been observed.’  Thomas Hill, DD, ex-President of Harvard College, says ‘Many facts in the possession of modern science make it difficult to believe in immortality.’  Says Alexander G Bell: ‘The possibility of thought without a brain whereby to think is opposed to experience, but this persistence of 'personal consciousness' after the death of the body involves this assumption.’  Says the distinguished FKCL Buchner: ‘Unprejudiced philosophy is compelled to reject the idea of an individual immortality, and of a personal continuance after death.’  It is certain that the voice of science is emphatically opposed to the doctrine of the immortality of the personal consciousness.”}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = May 2013}}

Traditional rabbinic Judaism, however, has always been of the opinion that belief in immortality of at least most souls, and punishment and reward after death, was a consistent belief back through the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai.  Traditional Judaism reads the Torah accordingly.  As an example, the punishment of [[kareth]] (excision) is understood to mean that soul is cut off from God in the [[Afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Sanhedrin | at = 64b, 90b to Numbers 15:31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Maimonides | title = Hilkhoth Teshuvah | at = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian views===

====Second to eighth centuries====
The earliest unambiguous instance of Christian mortalism is found in [[Tatian]]'s Address to the Greeks from the second half of the second century. Tatian writes: "The soul is not in itself immortal... If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tatian-address.html |title=Tatian's Address to the Greeks}} CHAP. XIII., retrieved July 7 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Tatian's contemporary [[Athenagoras of Athens]] came close to mortalism by teaching that souls sleep dreamlessly between death and resurrection: "[T]hose who are dead and those who sleep are subject to similar states, as regards at least the stillness and the absence of all sense of the present or the past, or rather of existence itself and their own life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Christian_Library/Treatise_on_the_Resurrection_of_the_Dead_(Athenagoras)|title=Athenagoras, On the Resurrection}}CHAP. XVI., retrieved July 7 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best-known case of mortalism in the early church is that recorded by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]:
{{Quote | '''The Dissension of the Arabians'''.  About the same time others arose in Arabia, putting forward a doctrine foreign to the truth.  They said that during the present time the human soul dies and perishes with the body, but that at the time of the resurrection they will be renewed together.  And at that time also a synod of considerable size assembled, and Origen, being again invited there, spoke publicly on the question with such effect that the opinions of those who had formerly fallen were changed. | Ecclesiastical History VI,37}}

This synod in Arabia would have been during the reign of [[Emperor Philip the Arab]] (244–249).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John Anthony | last = McGuckin | title = The Westminster handbook to Origen | page = 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Redepenning (1841)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Redepenning | first = Ernst Rudolf | title = Origenes; Leben und Lehre | place = Bonn | year = 1841 | volume = 2 | page = 105 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was of the opinion that Eusebius' terminology here, "the human soul dies" was probably that of their critics rather than the Arabian Christians' own expression and they were more likely simply "psychopannychists", believers in "soul sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James Craigie | last = Robertson | authorlink = James Craigie Robertson | title = History of the Christian church: AD 64–1517 | volume = 1 | page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Syriac writers such as [[Aphrahat]], [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] and [[Narsai]] believed in the ''dormition'', or "sleep", of the soul, in which "...souls of the dead...are largely inert, having lapsed into a state of sleep, in which they can only dream of their future reward or punishments."{{Sfn | Constas | 2001 | p = 94}} [[John of Damascus]] denounced the ideas of some Arab Christians as ''thnetopsychism'' ("soul death"). [[Eustratios of Constantinople]] (after 582) denounced this and what he called ''hypnopsychism'' ("soul sleep").{{Sfn | Constas | 2011 | p = 111}}  The issue was connected to that of the [[Intercession of saints]]. The writings of Christian ascetic [[Isaac of Nineveh]] (d. 700), reflect several perspectives which include mortalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = 'Isaac,' too, is convinced that the final reward and punishment for human deeds awaits the resurrection (e.g., Bedjan 724.4 from bottom). Then those who died in 'peace and quiet' with the lord will find eternal peace (Bedjan 276.15), while sinners will be banished to a darkness far away from God (Bedjan 117f.)  Gehenna, the kingdom of the demons (Bedjan 203.4 from bottom), is a place of fire, and on the day of judgment this fire will burst forth from the bodies of the damned (Bedjan 73.4; 118.3–7). Until the resurrection, the dead must wait in Sheol, which the author seems to imagine as a collective grave (Bedjan 366.3 from bottom; 368.5; 369.4).  Some passages in the corpus suggest that the dead continue to act, in Sheol, as they have during life (e.g., Bedjan 90.13; 366.10–18).  Others declare that action for good or ill is no longer possible after death (e.g., Bedjan 392.4 from bottom), and even envisage Sheol, before the judgment, as a place of fire ruled over by Satan (Bedjan 93.4f.) | last = Daley | title = The hope of the early church: a handbook of patristic eschatology | pages = 174–75 | year = 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ninth to fifteenth centuries====
Mortalism evidently persisted since various Byzantine writers had to defend the doctrine of the veneration of saints against those who said the saints sleep.{{Sfn | Constas | 2011}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = May 2013}} [[John the Deacon (Byzantine writer)|John the Deacon]] (eleventh century) attacked those who "dare to say that praying to the saints is like shouting in the ears of the deaf, as if they had drunk from the mythical waters of Oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = John the Deacon | contribution = On the Veneration of the Saints.

[[Pope John XXII]] inadvertently caused the [[Beatific Vision|beatific vision controversy]] (1331–34) by suggesting that the saved do not attain the [[Beatific Vision]], or "see God" until Judgment Day (in Italian: ''Visione beatifica differita'', "deferred beatific vision"), which was a view possibly consistent with soul sleep. The Sacred College of Cardinals held a consistory on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John conceded to the more orthodox understanding. His successor, in that same year, Pope Benedict XII, declared that the righteous do see Heaven prior to the final judgement. In 1536, Pope [[Benedict XII]] issued the papal bull [[Benedictus_Deus_(Benedict_XII)|Benedictus Deus]].  This document defined the Church's belief that the souls of the departed go to their eternal reward immediately after death, as opposed to remaining in a state of unconscious existence until the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/ben12/b12bdeus.htm ''Benedictus Deus'' on papalencyclicals.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Reformation====
Mortalism re-emerged in Christianity when it was promoted by some [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] leaders, and it survives today mostly among [[Restorationist]] sects, such as [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].{{Sfn | Brandon | 2007 | p = 65 -2| ps =: ‘Mortalism, in some form or other, had been around quite a while before the seventeenth century.’}}{{Sfn | Marshall | 2002 | p = 47 | ps =: ‘The status of the dead was among the most divisive issues of the early Reformation; it was also arguably the theological terrain over which in the reign of Henry VIII official reform travelled furthest and fastest.’}}  Conti has argued that during the Reformation both psychosomnolence (the belief that the soul sleeps until the resurrection) and thnetopsychism (the belief that the body and soul both die and then both rise again) were quite common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Conti | contribution = Religio Medici's Profession of Faith | editor1-last = Barbour | editor2-last = Preston | title = Sir Thomas Browne: the world proposed | page = 157 | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Tyndale]] (1494–1536) argued against [[Thomas More]] in favour of soul sleep:
{{Quote | And ye, in putting them [the departed souls] in heaven, hell and purgatory, destroy the arguments wherewith [[Christ]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] prove the resurrection... And again, if the souls be in heaven, tell me why they be not in as good a case as the angels be?

However, the best known advocate of soul sleep was [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546).{{Sfn | Froom | 1966 | p = 74-2}}  In writing on Ecclesiastes, Luther says
{{Quote | Salomon judgeth that the dead are a sleepe, and feele nothing at all.

Elsewhere Luther states that
{{Quote | As soon as thy eyes have closed shalt thou be woken, a thousand years shall be as if thou hadst slept but a little half hour.

Opponents of [[wikt:psychopannychism|psychopannychism]] (soul sleeping) and [[wikt:thnetopsychism|thnetopsychism]] (the temporary death of the soul) include the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] (that also teach about [[Intercession of saints]], connected to this subject), most [[mainline Protestant]] denominations, and most conservative Protestants, [[Evangelicals]], and [[Fundamentalists]].

Believers in the opposing concept of [[universal reconciliation]], arguing that salvation will eventually be received by all of humanity, have also referred to various books of the [[New Testament]] that seem to describe [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] given to immortal souls such as the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]. The sections of 1 Corinthians 15:22, "As all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ", and 1 Corinthians 15:28, "God will be all in all", are cited.&lt;ref name=stmaron&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stmaron.org/The_Maronite_Voice_for_December_2011.pdf|accessdate=July 2, 2014|title=The Question of Universal Salvation: Will All Be Saved?|first=David A.|last=Fisher|publisher=''The Maronite Voice'', Volume VII, Issue No. XI.|date=December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508152506/http://www.stmaron.org/The_Maronite_Voice_for_December_2011.pdf|archivedate=8 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verses that seem to contradict the tradition of complete damnation and come up in arguments also include [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations 3:31-33]] (NIV), "For no one is cast off by the Lord forever.

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church has called "soul mortality" a serious [[heresy]]:
{{Quote | Whereas some have dared to assert concerning the nature of the reasonable soul that it is mortal, we, with the approbation of the sacred council do condemn and reprobate all those who assert that the intellectual soul is mortal, seeing, according to the canon of [[Pope Clement V]], that the soul is [...] immortal [...] and we decree that all who adhere to like erroneous assertions shall be shunned and punished as heretics. | [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] (1513)}}

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
{{main article|Spirit body|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon cosmology}}
The idea that the spirit continues as a conscious, active, and independent agent after mortal death is an important teaching of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. 
Concerning the post-death, pre-judgment place of human spirits, LDS scripture states that "the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life" (Alma 40:11). They are then assigned to a state of paradise or hell (called Spirit Prison) in the [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]] depending on their faith in Christ and the manner of their mortal life (Alma 40:12-14). The Spirits remain in these states until the final judgment, when they are either received into a state of glory in the Kingdom of God, or they are cast off into [[Outer darkness#Usage in the Latter Day Saint movement|Outer Darkness]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_World&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/06195_eng.pdf?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

Latter-Day Saint doctrine differs from Eastern Orthodox doctrine in that LDS doctrine teaches that the souls in Prison who ended up there due to ignorance or inability to accept Christ may be preached to while in Prison so that they may accept Christ.&lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison&lt;/ref&gt; This is derived from the LDS interpretation of 1 Peter 3:18-20 where Christ is described as preaching to the "dead who were in prison" and 1 Peter 4:5-6, which states:
{{quote|5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. 
6 For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.}}

Like many Eastern Orthodox and Catholics, the LDS Church teaches that the prayers of the righteous living may be of help to the dead, but the LDS Church takes this one step further with vicarious sacraments (called "[[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]]" but with a sacramental theological meaning).&lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Ordinances&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church preaches the necessity of baptism by water and the Holy Ghost ([[Baptism in Mormonism|Baptism]] and [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|Confirmation]]) for salvation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/06195_eng.pdf?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt; They teach that previously ignorant spirits who accept Christ in Spirit Prison may receive saving ordinances through vicarious Baptism and Confirmation of the living.&lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Baptism_for_the_Dead&lt;/ref&gt; This is drawn from 1st Corinthians 15, wherein the Apostle Paul is arguing against a group of Christians who are mistakenly denying the physical resurrection of the dead. Paul asks them in 1st Corinthians 15:29:
:29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? 

The LDS Church believes that this is a reference to vicarious work for the dead which was practiced by the ancient Christian Church and considered orthodox in Early Christianity, including by the Apostle Paul, hence his use of it as an example of the correct doctrine of the resurrection. This is the origin of the LDS practice of [[baptism for the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Baptism_for_the_Dead&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a great deal of LDS doctrine and practice is tied to the idea of the continued existence and activity of the human spirit after death and before judgment.

==Modern scholarship==
As early as 1917 [[Harvey W.

While the Hebrew thought world distinguished soul from body (as material basis of life), there was no question of two separate, independent entities.  A person did not have a body but was an animated body, a unit of life manifesting itself in fleshly form—a psychophysical organism (Buttrick, 1962). Although Greek concepts of the soul varied widely according to the particular era and philosophical school, Greek thought often presented a view of the soul as a separate entity from body. Until recent decades Christian theology of the soul has been more reflective of Greek (compartmentalized) than Hebrew (unitive) ideas. | last = Moon | chapter = Soul | editor1-last = Benner | editor2-last = Hill | publisher = Baker | title = Encyclopedia of psychology &amp; counseling | page = 1148 | edition = 2nd | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = A broad consensus emerged among biblical and theological scholars that soul-body dualism is a Platonic, Hellenistic idea that is not found anywhere in the Bible.

According to Donelley, "Twentieth century [[Biblical criticism|biblical scholarship]] largely agrees that the ancient Jews had little explicit notion of a personal afterlife until very late in the Old Testament period," and "only the latest stratum of the Old Testament asserts even the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection of the body]]."{{Sfn | Donelley | 1976 | p = 99-2}}  Scholars have noted that the notion of the "disembodied existence of a soul in bliss" is not in accordance with a Hebrew world view:&lt;ref name="Indeed p. 518" /&gt; "While Hebrew thought world distinguished soul from body (as material basis of life), there was no question of two separate, independent entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Buttick | title = The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible | year = 1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillman argues that

Regardless of the character of the soul's existence in the intermediate state, biblical scholarship affirms that a disembodied soul is unnatural and at best transitional. Bromiley argues that "the soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man. Disembodied existence in [[Sheol]] is unreal.

Such dualism might imply that soul is superior to body. In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20). ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23). Although the Greek idea of an immortal soul different in kind from the mortal body is not evident, ‘soul’ denotes the existence of a person after death (see Luke 9:25; 12:4; 21:19); yet Greek influence may be found in 1 Peter’s remark about ‘the salvation of souls’ (1:9).

It should rather be understood in its own context within the OT as indicative of men and women as living beings or persons in relationship to God and other people. The lxx translates this Heb. word nep̄eš with the Gk. word psychē, which explains the habit of interpreting this OT concept in the light of Gk. use of psychē. Yet it is surely more appropriate to understand the use of psychē (in both the lxx and the NT) in the light of the OT’s use of nep̄eš.

Porteous (in IDB, 4:428) states it well when he says, “The Hebrew could not conceive of a disembodied nepeš, though he could use nepeš with or without the adjective ‘dead,’ for corpse (e.g., Lev. 19:28; Num. 6:6).” Or as R. B. Laurin has suggested, “To the Hebrew, man was not a ‘body’ and a ‘soul,’ but rather a ‘body-soul,’ a unit of vital power” (BDT, 492).

Job 33:18–30; Ps. 16:10; 30:3; 116:8; Isa. 38:15–17). What is essential to understanding the Hebrew mind is the recognition that the human being is a unit: body-soul! The soul is not, therefore, unaffected by the experience of death. OT eschatology does indeed contain seminal elements of hope implying the more positive teaching of the NT, as can be seen in the OT phrase, “rested with his fathers” (1 Ki. 2:10 et al.), in David’s confident attitude toward the death of his child (2 Sam. 12:12–23), and in Job’s hope for a resurrection (Job 19:20–29). It is this essential soul-body oneness that provides the uniqueness of the biblical concept of the resurrection of the body as distinguished from the Greek idea of the immortality of the soul.’}}

'''Color [[moment (mathematics)|moments]]''' are measures that characterise color distribution in an image in the same way that [[central moment]]s uniquely describe a [[probability distribution]]. Color moments are mainly used for color indexing purposes as features in [[image retrieval]] applications in order to compare how similar two images are based on color. Usually one image is compared to a [[database]] of [[digital images]] with pre-computed features in order to find and retrieve a similar Image. Each comparison between images results in a similarity score, and the lower this score is the more identical the two images are supposed to be.

== Overview ==

Color moments are [[scale invariance|scaling]] and [[rotational invariance|rotation]] invariant. It is usually the case that only the first three color moments are used as features in image retrieval applications as most of the color distribution information is contained in the low-order moments.&lt;ref&gt;Hui Yu, Mingjing Li, Hong-Jiang Zhang, Jufu Feng. "Color Texture Moments for Content-Based Image Retrieval". Proc. IEEE Intl Conf. on Image Processing, pp. 929-932, Sep. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Since color moments encode both shape and color information they are a good feature to use under changing lighting conditions, but they cannot handle occlusion very successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoyin Duanmu. "Image Retrieval Using Color Moment Invariant". Seventh International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 200-203, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Color moments can be computed for any [[color model]]. Three color moments are computed per channel (e.g. 9 moments if the color model is [[RGB]] and 12 moments if the color model is [[CMYK]]). Computing color moments is done in the same way as computing moments of a probability distribution.

=== Mean ===
{{Main|Mean}}
The first color moment can be interpreted as the average color in the image, and it can be calculated by using the following formula

:&lt;math&gt;E_i=\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{N}p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of pixels in the image and &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the j-th pixel of the image at the i-th color channel.

=== Standard Deviation ===
{{Main|Standard_deviation}}
The second color moment is the [[standard deviation]], which is obtained by taking the square root of the [[variance]] of the color distribution.

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i=\sqrt{(\frac{1}{N}\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^{N}(p_{ij}-E_i)^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean]] value, or first color moment, for the i-th color channel of the image.

=== Skewness ===
{{Main|Skewness}}
The third color moment is the [[skewness]]. It measures how asymmetric the color distribution is, and thus it gives information about the shape of the color distribution. Skewness can be computed with the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;s_i=\sqrt[3]{(\frac{1}{N}\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^{N}(p_{ij}-E_i)^3)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Kurtosis ===
{{Main|Kurtosis}}
Kurtosis is the fourth color moment, and, similarly to skewness, it provides information about the shape of the color distribution. More specifically, kurtosis is a measure of how flat or tall the distribution is in comparison to normal distribution.

=== Higher-order color moments ===
{{Main|Moment_(mathematics)#Higher_moments}}
Higher-order color moments are usually not part of the color moments feature set in image retrieval tasks as they require more data in order to obtain a good estimate of their value, and also the lower-order moments generally provide enough information.

== Applications ==

Color moments have significant applications in [[image retrieval]]. They can be used in order to compare how similar two images are. This is a relatively new approach to color indexing. The greatest advantage of using color moments comes from the fact that there is no need to store the complete color distribution.&lt;ref name="Similarity of Color Images"&gt;M. Stricker and M. Orengo. "Similarity of Color Images". In SPIE Conference on Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases III, volume 2420, pp. 381-392, Feb. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly speeds up image retrieval since there are less features to compare. In addition, the first three color moments have the same units, which allows for comparison between them.&lt;ref&gt;V. Chitkara, M.A. Nascimento, and C. Mastaller. "Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Binary Signatures". In Technical Report TR-00-18, Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color indexing ===

Color indexing is the main application of color moments. Images can be indexed, and the index will contain the computed color moments. Then, if someone has a particular image and wants to find similar images in the database, the color moments of the image of interest will also be computed. After that the following function will be used in order to compute a similarity score between the image of interest and all the images in the database:
:&lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)=\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{r}w_{i1}|E_i^1-E_i^2|+w_{i2}|\sigma_i^1-\sigma_i^2|+w_{i3}|s_i^1-s_i^2|&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:*H and I are the color distributions of the two images that are being compared
:*i is the channel index and r is the total number of channels
:*&lt;math&gt;E_i^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_i^2&lt;/math&gt; are the first order moments computed for the image distributions.
:*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt; are the second order moments computed for the image distributions.
:*s_i^1 and s_i^2 are the third order moments computed for the image distributions.
:*&lt;math&gt;w_{i1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w_{i2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;w_{i3}&lt;/math&gt; are weights, specified by the user, for each of the three color moments used.
Finally, the images in the database will be ranked according to the computed similarity score with the image of interest, and the database images with the lowest &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; value should be retrieved. "A retrieval based on &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; may produce false positives because the index contains no information about the correlation between the color channels".&lt;ref name="Similarity of Color Images"/&gt;

== Example ==

A simple and concise example of the use of color moments for image retrieval tasks is illustrated in.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Keen. "Color Moments". Feb. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider having several test images in a database and a "New Image". The goal is to retrieve images from the database that are similar to the "New Image". The first three color moments are used as features. There are several steps in this computation.

#'''Image preprocessing (Optional)''' - The image preprocessing step of the computation process is optional. For example, in this step all images could be modified to be the same size (in terms of pixels). However, since color moments are invariant to scaling, it is not necessary to make all images the same width and height.
#'''Computing the features''' - Use the color moments formulae in order to compute the first three moments for each of the color channels in the image. For example, if the HSV color space is used, this means that for each of the images, 9 features in total will be computed (the first three order moments for the Hue, Saturation, and Value channels).
#'''Calculating the similarity score''' - After computing the color moments the weights for each of the moments in the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; function should be determined by the user. The weights have to be adjusted each time in accordance with the application or condition and quality of the images. Following that the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; function is used to calculate a similarity score for the "New Image" and each of the images in the database.
#'''Ranking and image retrieval''' - From the previous step the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; values were obtained. Now a comparison of these values can be made in order to decide which of the images in the database are more similar to the "New Image", and thus rank the database images accordingly. The smaller the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; value is the more similar the two color distributions are supposed to be. Finally, some of the top ranked images (the ones with the smallest &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; value) from the database are retrieved.

The '''Combine''' is a [[multiverse|multidimensional]] empire which serves as the primary [[antagonist]]ic force in the 2004 [[video game]] ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', developed by [[Valve Corporation]]. The Combine consist of alien, synthetic, and human elements, and dominate Earth. They are encountered throughout ''Half-Life 2'' and its [[Episodic game|episodic]] expansions as hostile [[non-player character]]s as the player progresses through the games in an effort to overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth.

The Combine are frequently shown as harsh rulers over the citizens of Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using invasive surgery to transform humans into either soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that are the product of Combine technology. The atmosphere generated by the [[dystopia]]n Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the [[game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] of the [[transhuman]] Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in ''Half-Life 2''. In addition to their role within the ''Half-Life'' series, the Combine have been adapted for [[machinima]] productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.

Some elements of the Combine's appearance, such as that of the Advisor, are inspired by the works of [[Frank Herbert]].&lt;ref name="raising the bar"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|first=David|last=Hodgson|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7615-4364-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towering Striders seen throughout Half Life 2 and its subsequent episodes are based directly on the Martian [[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]] of the [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]] novel [[The War of the Worlds]], where said Martians invade [[Victorian era|Victorian Era England]], using the tripods as their main "weapon". The name "Combine" itself is a tribute to [[Ken Kesey|Ken Kesey's]] novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', which features a collection of authorities which mechanistically manipulate and process individuals.&lt;ref name="raising the bar"/&gt;

During ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s development, various concepts for Combine non-player characters were cut. Female Combine assassins, similar to [[black operations]] assassins featured in the first game, were planned but later abandoned, although they appear in the ''[[Half-Life 2: Survivor]]'' arcade game.&lt;ref name="raising the bar"/&gt; Another non-player character, the cremator, was conceptualized as a Combine laborer who cleaned the streets of bodies after a battle with an acid gun and although removed from the game, its head was featured in [[Eli Vance]]'s laboratory. Other cuts included a variety of alien Combine soldiers that would have complemented the transhuman soldiers in the game and a number of synthetic combat machines.&lt;ref name="raising the bar"/&gt; Many of ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s Combine characters went through multiple redesigns; the Combine Overwatch soldier was subjected to at least twelve redesigns before the final appearance was settled on.&lt;ref name="lithograph"/&gt;

==Attributes==
===Society===
Little is revealed of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by a range of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Dark Energy| quote='''Wallace Breen''': Carbon stars with ancient satellites, colonized by sentient fungi; gas giants, inhabited by vast meteorological intelligences; worlds stretched thin across the membranes where the dimensions intersect...impossible to describe with our limited vocabulary!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is shown to be a brutal [[police state]]. In [[City 17]], an [[Eastern Europe]]an city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random [[police brutality]]. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Point Insertion| quote='''Citizen''': No matter how many times I get relocated, I...never get used to it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vortigaunt]]s, alien creatures from the original ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to ''[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]'', the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds;&lt;ref name="raising the bar"/&gt; both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visualwalkthroughs.com/halflife2/highway17/highway17.htm Highway 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the heart of the Combine's command structure in ''Half-Life 2'' is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geekosystem.com/half-life-2-citadel-height/ Half-Life 2 Citadel Height]&lt;/ref&gt; and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, [[Wallace Breen]]. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads [[propaganda]]. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2006| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Urban Flight| quote='''Isaac Kleiner''': I feel obliged to point out that a more fortunate side effect of the reactor's destruction is the complete removal of the Combine's reproductive suppression field. Previously, certain protein chains important to the process of embryonic development were selectively prevented from forming; this is no longer the case. For those so inclined, now would be an excellent time for procreation, which is to say, in layman's terms, you should give serious consideration to doing your part for the revival of the species.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2006| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Lowlife| quote='''Alyx Vance''': Antlions here? The Combine's defense field must have collapsed. Makes sense if it was powered by the Citadel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Dark Energy| quote='''Alyx Vance''': This is the Citadel's dark fusion reactor. It powers their tunneling entanglement device.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.

===Depiction===
The Combine is composed of various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout ''Half-Life 2'' and its expansions are the [[transhuman]] Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. A variety of combat machines also encountered, ranging from [[Armored personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[helicopter gunship]]s to a giant 'Smart wall' which encloses occupied cities and gradually destroys anything in its path. A number of weaponised alien 'synths' are also encountered by Freeman.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=3&amp;game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022155450/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=3&amp;game=3|archivedate=October 22, 2006 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Enemies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advisors====
[[Image:Advisor (Half-Life).jpg|thumb|right|The Advisor's grub-like appearance was inspired by the works of science fiction author [[Frank Herbert]].]]
Advisors are large larvae-like creatures which are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, though they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms.&lt;ref name="EP1enemies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=17&amp;game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426045206/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=17&amp;game=3|archivedate=April 26, 2013 |title=''Half-Life 2: Episode One'' Enemies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible [[proboscis]]. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them.&lt;ref name="EP1enemies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Half-Life 2]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation]]|date= 2004 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] | level= Dark Energy| quote='''Dr. Wallace Breen''': (to an Advisor) It's me you should be worried about! I can still deliver Earth, but not without your help! [..] The portal destination is untenable, surely you can set the relay else where. There's no way I can survive in that environment! A host body?! You must be joking, I can't possibly—oh, all right, dammit, if that's what it takes. Just hurry, he's right behind me!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess [[telekinesis|telekinetic powers]] with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference.&lt;ref name="EP1enemies"/&gt; Their appearance was based on the [[Guild Navigator]]s from the film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil Protection====
Civil Protection is the Combine's [[Police|law enforcement]] agency on Earth, consisting of humans who have agreed to work on behalf of the Combine. Also referred to as metrocops, Civil Protection units wear light armor and gas masks, which heavily resemble a somewhat modified [[PMK gas mask|Soviet PMG mask]]. They are usually armed with [[Electroshock weapon|electroshock batons]] and [[pistol]]s, and are occasionally seen using [[submachine gun]]s. Metrocops are brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and physical force. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of extreme [[police brutality]] are all used as a means of policing their respective jurisdictions; their methods are justified by their role as "protectors of the civilians{{'}} well-being". On the outskirts of [[City 17]], Civil Protection units are observed patrolling for escapees from the city. Civil Protection officers are in constant contact with Combine Overwatch headquarters, which gives them objectives and situation updates. On the death of an officer, that officer's armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs headquarters of the fatality and advises nearby units as to the place of death.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt;

====Overwatch====
The Combine Overwatch is the primary [[military]] force of the Combine on Earth. It consists of [[Biomechanical engineering|biomechanically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] humans, who wear heavily padded long-sleeve body armor and gas masks. The markings on the suit change depending on each individual unit's assignment and rank. Elite Combine soldiers wear bright white armor with one red eye, while the majority of soldiers wear blue armor. Shotgun units wear similar armour to the standard Combine Soldier, but coloured brown with orange eyes. They are armed with a variety of firearms, including [[shotgun]]s, submachine guns, [[sniper rifle]]s and [[pulse rifle]]s. Overwatch soldiers usually operate in small groups, using squad tactics and [[grenade]]s to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of [[Dropship (science fiction)|dropships]]. They use radios to communicate with each other and with Overwatch headquarters. Combine Overwatch soldiers are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city after "The Uprising" near the end of ''Half-Life 2''.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt;

====Combine technology====
The Combine use a large array of [[science fiction]] technology. They have access to [[teleportation]] technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by [[Eli Vance]], [[Isaac Kleiner]] and [[Judith Mossman (Half Life)|Judith Mossman]] in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Black Mesa East| quote='''Judith Mossman''': We're closing in on a reliable local teleport technology, something the Combine still hasn't mastered. Eli thinks their models are string-based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they fail to factor in the dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from their universe, but once they're here, they're dependent on local transportation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt; Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause [[laceration]] injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of [[land mine]]s; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt; Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.&lt;ref name="EP1enemies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation]]| date=2006|level=Direct Intervention|quote='''Alyx Vance''': Goddamn the Combine! This is what happens to you if you resist... or if you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [..] God, I hope you don't remember who you are...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Militarily, the Combine make use of both synthetic machines—machines powered by organic components—and traditional mechanical machines such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s and [[attack helicopter]]s.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt; The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like [[gunship]]s; and Striders, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} armored creatures that walk upon three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt; In ''Episode Two'', a smaller equivalent to the Strider, the Hunter, is introduced. These 2.5&amp;nbsp;m (8&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the ''Half-Life 2'', although their roles are not elaborated on. [[Sentry gun|Sentry turrets]] are also used by the Combine.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt; The Combine also use [[headcrab]]s as a [[biological weapon]] against dissidents, firing artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest the vicinity.&lt;ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/&gt;

==Appearances==
===''Half-Life'' series===
According to the backstory presented during ''Half-Life 2'', the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the [[Nihilanth]], the [[Boss (video games)|boss character]] at the end of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] and the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in "portal storms" which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When it is sufficiently wide, the Combine invade in force, and in the subsequent Seven Hour War quickly defeat the forces of Earth and destroy the [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] in [[New York City]]. Earth's surrender is negotiated by [[Wallace Breen]], who is then made the Combine puppet administrator of Earth, and uses [[City 17]] as his base of operations.&lt;ref name="BME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=16&amp;game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113112249/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=16&amp;game=3|archivedate=November 13, 2012 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough—Chapter 5: Black Mesa East|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Combine soldiers.png|thumb|left|Two Overwatch soldiers in ''Episode Two'', with a Hunter in the background.]]

The Combine's first appearance is in ''Half-Life 2''. Through the early stages of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in ''Half-Life'', Breen sees Freeman as a major threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Wallace Breen''': We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who has acquired an almost messianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens. His figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct, ignorance and decay; some of the worst excesses of the Black Mesa incident have been laid directly at his feet. And yet unsophisticated minds continue to embue him with romantic power, giving him such dangerous poetic labels as the "One Free Man", the "Opener of the Way".}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of [[Black Mesa East]] and capture resistance leader [[Eli Vance]], who is transferred to holding facilities at [[Nova Prospekt]].&lt;ref name="BME"/&gt; Freeman and Vance's daughter [[Alyx Vance|Alyx]] break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent [[Judith Mossman (Half Life)|Judith Mossman]]. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=33&amp;game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113112216/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=33&amp;game=3|archivedate=November 13, 2012 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough—Chapter 10: Entanglement|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.

In ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]'', the destruction of the teleporter at the top of the Citadel has isolated the Combine forces on Earth, but also caused its primary reactor to begin to melt down. This forces Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance to journey back into the critically damaged Citadel to temporarily stabilize its reactor while the city's inhabitants are evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=1&amp;game=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010201128/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=1&amp;game=3 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 |title=''Half-Life 2: Episode One'' Walkthrough—Chapter 1: Undue Alarm |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Combine forces, however, instead attempt to accelerate the meltdown in order to send a message to their native universe for reinforcements. After Alyx acquires an encrypted copy of the message to be sent, Overwatch forces desperately attempt to stop the pair from escaping the city, spurred on by Combine Advisors. As the pair escape on a train at the end of the game, the Citadel detonates, sending the message and destroying City 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=5&amp;game=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010201318/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=5&amp;game=3 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 |title=''Half-Life 2: Episode One'' Walkthrough—Chapter 5: Exit 17| work=Planet Half-Life| publisher=[[IGN]]| accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]]'' opens with Alyx and Freeman discovering that the Citadel's destruction has resulted in the formation of a [[Portal (fiction)|super portal]] to the Combine dimension, which is slowly progressing to a stage where the Combine can send overwhelming reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2007| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = To The White Forest| quote='''Isaac Kleiner''': What you're seeing is the infancy of a superportal. If it retains full strength— / '''Eli Vance''': It will be the Seven Hour War, all over again! Except this time we won't last seven minutes!}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also discover that the data packet in the message they retrieved from the Citadel contains codes that can be used to close the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to the resistance headquarters at [[White Forest]]. As they progress, it becomes evident that the Combine Advisors escaped the Citadel's destruction, and that remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under occasional attacks by [[Vortigaunt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2007| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Freeman Pontifex| quote='''Vortigaunt''': They carry ''Shu'ulathoi'': Advisors still in incubation pods. They gather and unite the scattered Combine forces.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of the resistance's plans to close the super portal, the Combine attack White Forest in force, but are repelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2007| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Our Mutual Fiend| quote='''Resistance fighter''': We've counted a dozen Striders just north of us. Our job is to keep them from reaching the base to the south. If they get close enough for one good shot at the silo, the whole launch is a bust.

However, in the game's closing scenes, two Advisors attack Freeman, Alyx and Eli Vance, and kill Eli before being driven off by Dog.

===Appearances in other media===
The use of sandbox applications like ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' have allowed for Combine [[non-player character]]s to be used in a variety of [[webcomic]]s and [[machinima]] productions. The combine are also referenced in the [[Portal (video game series)]]. In one webcomic, ''[[Concerned]]'', the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon &lt;!-- This is not a typo, don't change it --&gt;Frohman&lt;!-- This is not a typo, don't change it --&gt;, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512010607/http://hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-07|archivedate=May 12, 2012 |title=Issue #62|work=[[Concerned|Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Freeman]]|first=Christopher|last=Livingston|date=2005-10-07|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, the machinima series ''Combine Nation'' follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to [[police procedural]] documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with [[adhesive bandage]]s and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing [[flashbang]]s, which often backfire on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litfusefilms.com/movies/combinenationepisode1/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011014206/http://litfusefilms.com/movies/combinenationepisode1/|archivedate=October 11, 2007 |title=''Combine Nation: Episode One''|publisher=Lit Fuse Films|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another web series, called ''The Combine'', parodies the TV show ''[[The Office]]''. This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass a [[webfilter]] so they can watch videos online instead of working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDwNK5JPl34&amp;context=C3115975ADOEgsToPDskL5EZg4HBvKAuZ7ueAJI8Pc|title=''The Combine Episode 2: Workfilter''|publisher=Currentpie Productions|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the [[live-action]] video ''The Combine Interview'', which parodies an interview with [[Tom Cruise]] discussing [[Scientology]]. The video, described by ActionTrip as "eerie, to say the least"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/rei/comments_news.phtml?id=090308_5 |title=Tom Cruise Scientology Interview, Combine Style |publisher=ActionTrip |first=Ure |last=Paul |date=2008-09-03 |accessdate=2008-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913130612/http://www.actiontrip.com/rei/comments_news.phtml?id=090308_5 |archivedate=2008-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by both [[Joystiq]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/03/the-combine-interview-puts-tom-cruise-in-new-light/|title=The Combine Interview puts Tom Cruise in new light|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|first=Justin|last=McElroy|date=2008-09-03|accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kotaku]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5044676/creepy-tom-cruise-interview-redone-as-creepy-half-life-2-interview|title=Creepy Tom Cruise Interview Redone As Creepy ''Half-Life 2'' Interview|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=2008-09-02|accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "creepy", instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine's rule of Earth, adapting Cruise's words to fit the Combine theme.

===Merchandise===
The Combine have inspired the creation of several items of merchandise for the ''Half-Life'' series. A [[plush]] toy was created by Valve, based on the synthetic tripod Hunters introduced in ''Episode Two''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_HunterPlush.html|title=Hunter Plush Toy|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-09-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080319113143/http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_HunterPlush.html |archivedate = March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sold and distributed via Valve's online store, the toy was released in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/357473/hunter-plushies-now-available|title=Hunter Plushies Now Available|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=2008-02-18|accessdate=2008-09-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302082752/http://kotaku.com/357473/hunter-plushies-now-available|archivedate=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Valve has produced [[t-shirt]]s depicting the Combine's idea of humanity's [[evolution]], from ape to Combine Overwatch soldier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.valvesoftware.com/productpages/apparel/product_HL2EvoShirt.html|title=''Half-Life 2'' "Evolution" Shirt|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-09-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313192443/http://store.valvesoftware.com/productpages/apparel/product_HL2EvoShirt.html |archivedate = March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[lithograph]] displaying twelve pieces of [[concept art]] for the Combine soldier.&lt;ref name="lithograph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_HL2ComSldrLitho01.html|title=''Half-Life 2'' Combine Soldier Lithograph|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-09-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313192448/http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_HL2ComSldrLitho01.html |archivedate = March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Combine have received a positive reaction from critics. [[1UP.com]] praised the "epic feel" built up by the Combine and their harsh rule of City 17 in ''Half-Life 2'', stating that this created "a world governed by [[newspeak]], decorated with urban decay, and lacking any hope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3138493&amp;p=1&amp;sec=REVIEWS|title=''Half-Life 2'' Review|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|first=Andrew|last=Pfister|date=2005-01-17|accessdate=2008-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68AXJKhvx?url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/half-life-2_4|archivedate=2012-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] echoed this praise, saying that the "vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective". ''[[PC Zone]]'' described the appearance of the Combine's soldiers as "[[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtrooper]]-like", but although stating that overall the [[game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] for the game was "extremely competent", the Combine non-player characters "could have used better survival instincts", citing their reluctance to take cover and tendency to charge at the player and into a shotgun blast.&lt;ref name="PCZoneHL2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=111902|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208035503/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=111902|archivedate=December 8, 2006 |title=PC Review: ''Half-Life 2''|publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]''|work=[[PC Zone]]|date=2004-11-16|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reviews of ''Episode One'' were disappointed by the lack of new characters for the Combine,&lt;ref name="IGNEP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/710/710967p1.html|title=''Half-Life 2: Episode One'' Review|first=Tom|last=McNamara|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-06-01|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although GameSpot praised the improved AI for Combine soldiers and the addition of new abilities, such as rappelling down buildings.

Cop-Tur first appeared in America as one of the main villains in the ''Challenge of the Gobots'' animated series.

Like most of the Renegades, Cop-Tur isn't especially smart. He has something of a sick sense of humor, and often lets off a vicious chuckle when he comes across a weaker foe.&lt;ref&gt;Going, Going, Gobots by Matt Carara, Toyfare Magazine #123, November 2007, page 80-82&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered cold-blooded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = | title = News | journal = Computer &amp; Video Games| volume = 1 | issue = 61 | page = 8 | date = |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue061/Pages/CVG06100008.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He can fire energy blasts from his hands or eyes. Cop-Tur can use his rotor blades in either mode to create localised [[hurricane]]s, or (in robot mode) a sword or spinning hand-held blade weapon. In vehicle mode used a tractor beam which he uses to haul cargo as large as himself while flying.

The sound effect used for Cop-Tur's blades when flying were later used for the Autobot Sandstorm's blades in the Transformers series.

===Animated series===
Crasher and Cop-Tur aided Cy-Kill when he stole the astrobeam and escaped Gobotron to Earth. Cop-Tur was, along with [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]], [[Cy-Kill]]'s regular muscle on the Renegades' frequent forays to [[Earth]], beginning with the Renegades' first attempt to conquer the planet. Due to the nature of his vehicle mode, he would often be pitched into aerial combat with Guardian commander [[Leader-1]], invariably coming off second best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

In "It's the Thought that Counts" Cy-Kill, Cop-Tur, [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]], [[Geeper-Creeper]], [[Pincher (Gobots)|Pincher]], and [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]] attack a lab, but it is defended by Leader-1, Baron Von Joy, Blaster, Dozer, [[Dumper (Gobots)|Dumper]], [[Road Ranger (Gobots)|Road Ranger]], Scooter, [[Scratch (Gobots)|Scratch]] and [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]]. Although the Guardians win the battle, an accidental backfire from Baron Von Joy's weapon allows the Renegades to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= It's The Thought That Counts|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= |season= 1|number= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Doppelganger" episode #23 [[Cy-Kill]], Cop-Tur, [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]] and [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]] attacked [[Leader-1]], [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]], [[Scooter (Gobots)|Scooter]] and [[Small Foot (Gobots)|Small Foot]]. Crasher wounded Small Foot. After attaining recordings of the Guardians the Renegades retreated. Using the recordings Cy-Kill had [[Herr Fiend]] program robot duplicates of the Guardians. When demonstrating [[Space Bender]] weapon to Unicom Leader-1 learned that the Renegades were attacking Washington. The Renegades ambushed Leader-1 and replaced him with his duplicate. Leading the [[Command Center (Gobots)|Command Center]] back to Gobotron and getting rid of Scooter and Small Foot the Renegades then released duplicates of [[Path Finder (Gobots)|Path Finder]], [[Rest-Q]], [[Van Guard]] and Turbo. Small Foot and Scooter were able to capture the Turbo duplicate and learn where their friends were being held. Cy-Kill then replaced [[Good Night (Gobots)|Good Night]]. Using the duplicate Turbo the Guardians infiltrated the Renegade base, freed the captured Guardians and escape from [[Spoons (Gobots)|Spoons]] and [[Fitor]]. Although blocked by the Renegades, Scooter used a hologram of [[Zod (Gobots)|Zod]] to make the Renegades flee. Making it back to Gobotron the Guardians were attacked by the Guardian duplicates. The real Guardians were able to defeat their duplicates with the aid of the real [[Zeemon]], [[Hans-Cuff]] and Rest-Q. Cy-Kill then arrived in [[Thrustor]] with more duplicates, but Small Foot was able to stop with robots using the Space Bender, which would fuse their robot brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Doppelganger|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= |season= 1|number= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode #27, "Tarnished Image" Doctor Go creates a device that allows the Renegades to appear like Guardians. Cy-Kill, Crasher and Cop-Tur disguise themselves as Leader-1, Scooter and Turbo and go on a rampage on Earth while the real Guardians are sent on a fake rescue mission. When the Guardians return they are banished from Earth by the humans. The Guardians are eventually able to prove the Renegades staged the attacks, chase them off and capture Doctor Go.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Tarnished Image|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits=Written by Jeff Segal, Kelly Ward and David Schwartz |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate=November 25, 1985 |season= 1|number= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scooter and [[Small Foot (Gobots)|Small Foot]] joined Nick and A.J. to watch a car stunt show which was attacked by [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]], [[BuggyMan]] and [[Fly Trap]]. Small Foot fought Buggyman and defeated him, but the Renegades regained the upper hand until the Guardians were rescued by [[Leader-1]] and [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]] who arrived in [[Power Suit (Gobots)|Power Suit]]s. Cy-Kill vowed to gain Power Suits for the Renegades. Scooter decided he needed more firepower, so he had [[Baron Von Joy]] remove his damaged holo projector in favor of a blaster unit. [[Screw Head]], [[Bad Boy (Gobots)|Bad Boy]] and Cop-Tur were sent to attack Unicom bases and distract the Guardians while Cy-Kill, Crasher and Scorp attempted to take the suits from the Guardian Command Center. Small Foot and Scooter were able to delay the Renegades until Leader-1 and Turbo returned to chase away the Renegades. Realizing he was a better Guardian with his holo projector, Scooter had it reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Scooter Enhanced|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Jeff Segal, Kelly Ward and Mark Young |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= November 24, 1985|season= 1|number= 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robo Machines===
In the [[Eagle (comic)|''Eagle'' comic]] storyline, Cop-Tur was built on Earth by [[Zod (Gobots)|Stron-Domez]], and first saw action taking control of a factory in [[Birmingham]]. He only had a short life, as soon afterwards the factory was rushed by the Robotron Security Forces, and Cop-Tur was captured. He was deactivated, and his body most likely remained on board the SF Command Centre at the end of the series.

===Other media===
The character's prosaic name was also lampooned in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Book of Corrine".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11965">{{Redirect|Critical Chain|the novel|Critical Chain (novel)}}
'''Critical chain project management''' ('''CCPM''') is a method of planning and [[Project management|managing projects]] that emphasizes the [[Resource (project management)|resources]] (people, equipment, physical space) required to execute project [[Task (project management)|tasks]].  It was developed by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]]. It differs from more traditional methods that derive from [[Critical path method|critical path]] and [[PERT]] algorithms, which emphasize task order and rigid scheduling.  A critical chain project network strives to keep resources levelled, and requires that they be flexible in start times.

== Origins ==
{{POV check|section|date=November 2013}}
Critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from [[Theory of Constraints]].  The idea of CCPM was introduced in 1997 in Eliyahu M. Goldratt's book, [[Critical Chain (novel)|''Critical Chain'']].  Application of CCPM has been credited with achieving projects 10% to 50% faster and/or cheaper than the traditional methods (i.e., CPM, PERT, Gantt, etc.) developed from 1910 to 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/critical-chain-pm-improves-performance-5305|title=Critical Chain Project Management Improves Project Performance|website=www.pmi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to studies of traditional project management methods by [[Standish Group]] and others as of 1998, only 44% of projects typically finish on time. Projects typically complete at 222% of the [[Duration (project management)|duration]] originally planned, 189% of the original budgeted cost, 70% of projects fall short of their planned [[Scope (project management)|scope]] (technical content delivered), and 30% are cancelled before completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf|title=The Standish Group Report Chaos|website=www.projectsmart.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCPM tries to improve performance relative to these traditional statistics.

== Details ==
With traditional project management methods, 30% of lost time and resources are typically consumed by wasteful techniques such as bad multitasking (in particular [[Task switching (psychology)|task switching]]), [[student syndrome]], [[Parkinson's law]], in-box delays, and lack of prioritization.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Maylor, Project Management&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[project plan]], the '''critical chain''' is the sequence of both [[:wikt:precedence|precedence]]- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a [[project]] from being completed in a shorter time, given finite resources. If resources are always available in unlimited quantities, then a project's critical chain is identical to its [[critical path method]].

Critical chain is an alternative to [[critical path analysis]]. Main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are: 
# ''Use of (often implicit) resource [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]]''. Implicit means that they are not included in the project network, but must be identified by looking at the resource requirements.
# ''Lack of search for an optimum solution''—a "good enough" solution is enough because:
## As far as is known, there is no analytical method for finding an absolute optimum (i.e., having the overall shortest critical chain).
## The inherent uncertainty in [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] is much greater than the difference between the optimum and near-optimum ("good enough" solutions).
# ''Identification and insertion of buffers'':
#* Project buffer
#* Feeding buffers
#* Resource buffers (companies are usually reluctant to give more resources)
# Monitoring project progress and health by monitoring the consumption rate of the buffers rather than individual task performance to [[Schedule (project management)|schedule]].

CCPM planning aggregates the large amounts of safety time added to tasks within a project into the buffers—to protect due-date performance and avoid wasting this safety time through [[bad multitasking]], [[student syndrome]], [[Parkinson's Law]], and poorly synchronized integration.

Critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of [[earned value management]] to assess the performance of a project. Some [[project manager]]s feel that the earned value management technique is misleading, because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint (i.e., on the critical chain) from progress on non-constraints (''i.e., on other paths). [[Event chain methodology]] can determine a size of project, feeding, and resource buffers.

=== Planning ===
A project plan or [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path. The plan is worked backward from a completion date with each task starting as late as possible.

A duration is assigned to each task.  Some software implementations add a second duration: one a "best guess," or 50% probability duration, and a second "safe" duration, which should have higher probability of completion (perhaps 90% or 95%, depending on the amount of risk that the organization can accept).  Other software implementations go through the duration estimate of every task and remove a fixed percentage to be aggregated into the buffers.

Resources are assigned to each task, and the plan is [[resource leveling|resource leveled]], using the aggressive durations. The longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain. The justification for using the 50% estimates is that half of the tasks will finish early and half will finish late, so that the variance over the course of the project should be zero.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2014}}

Recognizing that tasks are more likely to take more time than less time due to [[Parkinson's law]], [[Student syndrome]], or other reasons, CCPM uses "buffers" to monitor project schedule and financial performance. The "extra" duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the "safe" durations and the 50% durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project. In the same way, buffers are gathered at the end of each sequence of tasks that feed into the critical chain. The date at the end of the project buffer is given to external [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]] as the delivery date. Finally, a baseline is established, which enables financial monitoring of the project.

An alternate duration-estimation methodology uses probability-based quantification of duration using [[Monte Carlo simulation]]. In 1999, a researcher{{Who|date=April 2010}} applied simulation to assess the impact of risks associated with each component of project work breakdown structure on project duration, cost and performance.  Using Monte Carlo simulation, the project manager can apply different probabilities for various risk factors that affect a project component.  The probability of occurrence can vary from 0% to 100% chance of occurrence.  The impact of risk is entered into the simulation model along with the probability of occurrence.  The number of iterations of Monte Carlo simulation depend on the tolerance level of error and provide a density graph illustrating the overall probability of risk impact on project outcome.

=== Execution ===

When the plan is complete and the project is ready to start, the project network is fixed and the buffers' sizes are "locked" (i.e., their planned duration may not be altered during the project), because they are used to monitor project schedule and financial performance.

With no slack in the duration of individual tasks, resources are encouraged to focus on the task at hand to complete it and hand it off to the next person or group. The objective here is to eliminate bad multitasking.  This is done by providing priority information to all resources. The literature draws an analogy with a relay race. Each element on the project is encouraged to move as quickly as they can: when they are running their "leg" of the project, they should be focused on completing the assigned task as quickly as possible, with minimization of distractions and multitasking. In some case studies, actual batons are reportedly hung by the desks of people when they are working on critical chain tasks so that others know not to interrupt. The goal, here, is to overcome the tendency to delay [[Work (project management)|work]] or to do extra work when there seems to be time.  The CCPM literature contrasts this with "traditional" project management that monitors task start and completion dates. CCPM encourages people to move as quickly as possible, regardless of dates.

Because task duration has been planned at the 50% probability duration, there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible, overcoming student's syndrome and Parkinson's Law.

=== Monitoring ===

According to proponents, monitoring is, in some ways, the greatest advantage of the Critical Chain method. Because individual tasks vary in duration from the 50% estimate, there is no point in trying to force every task to complete "on time;" estimates can never be perfect. Instead, we monitor the buffers created during the planning stage. A fever chart or similar graph can be created and posted to show the consumption of buffer as a function of project completion. If the rate of buffer consumption is low, the project is on target. If the rate of consumption is such that there is likely to be little or no buffer at the end of the project, then corrective actions or recovery plans must be developed to recover the loss. When the buffer consumption rate exceeds some critical value (roughly: the rate where all of the buffer may be expected to be consumed ''before'' the end of the project, resulting in late completion), then those alternative plans need to be implemented.

'''Brittanie Nichole Cecil''' (March 20, 1988 – March 18, 2002) was a [[ice hockey|hockey]] fan who died from injuries suffered when a [[hockey puck|puck]] was deflected into the stands and struck her in the left temple at [[Nationwide Arena]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], on March 16, 2002. It was the first and currently only fan fatality in the [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] 100-year history.&lt;ref name=fan&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of a fan|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1025415/index.htm|accessdate=March 25, 2009|date=April 1, 2002|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609101754/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1025415/1/index.htm |archive-date=June 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Cecil's death, the league implemented mandatory netting at both ends of the rink in every arena at the beginning of the next NHL season in [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03]] to protect spectators from errant pucks.

==Personal life==
A native of [[West Alexandria, Ohio]], a rural community near [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Cecil was an avid sports fan and soccer player, competing in a state tournament with her team, the Orange Crush, at eleven years old. After the team qualified for the state tournament, mayor Carol Lunsford declared the day Orange Crush Day.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; Cecil attended Twin Valley South Middle School as a cheerleader, student council member and an honor student.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; She attended Thompson Secondary School.

==Death==
Cecil had been watching the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] play the [[Calgary Flames]] on March 16, 2002, on tickets received as an early gift from her father for her 14th birthday. With 12:10 remaining in the second period and the Blue Jackets up 1–0, a shot by the Blue Jackets' [[Espen Knutsen]] was deflected by the Flames' [[Derek Morris (ice hockey)|Derek Morris]] and went over the glass behind the net, striking her in the left temple. Play carried on as the players were unaware of having accidentally caused any serious injury.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; The Blue Jackets, who were already eliminated from playoff contention, would go on to win the game 3–1. In fact, although Cecil had suffered a skull fracture, she walked to a first-aid station before being taken to [[Nationwide Children's Hospital|Columbus Children's Hospital]] in an ambulance with her only visible injury being a gash on her forehead. At the hospital, she suffered an initial seizure and was admitted,&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; but appeared to be recovering the next day, both communicative and ambulatory, and without complaints of pain or dizziness. A [[CT-scan]], however, had failed to catch a torn [[vertebral artery]], resulting in severe clotting and swelling of the brain. On March 18, she developed a high fever and lost consciousness.&lt;ref name="bcrip"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url= http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1025413/index.htm| title = How she died| work = | publisher = Sports Illustrated| accessdate = March 29, 2009 | date=April 1, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830114710/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1025413/index.htm |archive-date=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died nearly 48 hours after being struck, at 5:15 p.m. on March 18, 2002, two days before her 14th birthday.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt;

Cecil's funeral was held at Preble Memory Gardens Chapel near West Alexandria, after which a procession of more than 150 cars followed the hearse to Fairview Cemetery, where she was buried.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt;  Attending the funeral was Blue Jackets general manager [[Doug MacLean]], who spoke on behalf of the team.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Thursday after the incident, a moment of silence was observed for Cecil at the next Blue Jackets home game, played against the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Her initials "BNC" were worn by the team's players on their helmets for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt;

Knutsen and Morris, the two players who combined for the fatal slapshot, expressed remorse following Cecil's death. Morris, who deflected the puck, explained, "You try to say, 'It happens all the time,' but you can't. I don't know how many times pucks get deflected over the glass, but it doesn't make it any better. You can always say, 'It's not my fault,' but you always feel like it is, a little."&lt;ref name=fan/&gt;  Knutsen, who was given the option of sitting out the next game by Blue Jackets coach [[Dave King (ice hockey)|Dave King]] but chose to play, told reporters, "I think about it all the time. It was a terrible accident, and I cannot get it off my mind."&lt;ref name=fan/&gt;

In December 2010, Knutsen met with Cecil's family, bringing some closure to both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink =Mike Wagner | coauthors = | url= http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/12/18/a-day-for-easing-old-hurts.html?sid=101| title = A day for easing old hurts| work = | publisher = The Columbus Dispatch| accessdate = December 18, 2010 | date=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL implemented mandatory safety netting above the glass behind and to the sides of both ends of the rink in all arenas. The netting has also been implemented by other hockey leagues and organizing bodies globally. A lawsuit brought by Cecil's family against the NHL and the arena was settled out of court for $1.2 million in April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2004-04-14-cecil-settlement_x.htm |title=Parents of girl killed by puck receive $1.2 million |date=April 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Score |author=The Associated Press |url=https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/777400 |title=Manfred: MLB to re-evaluate fan safety after Fenway accident |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brittanie Nichole Cecil Memorial Scholarship Fund has since been created, which collects donations at every Blue Jackets home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bncmemorial.org |title=The Brittanie Nichole Cecil Memorial Scholarship Fund |publisher=The Brittanie Nichole Cecil Memorial Scholarship Fund |accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duchess Sophie Charlotte Augustine in Bavaria''' (23 February 1847 &amp;ndash; 4 May 1897) was a granddaughter-in-law of [[Louis Philippe I of France|King Louis Philippe of France]], the favourite sister of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and fiancée of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|King Ludwig II of Bavaria]].

==Biography==

Sophie Charlotte was born at the [[Possenhofen Castle]], the residence of her paternal family, [[Duke in Bavaria|Dukes in Bavaria]]. She was a daughter of [[Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria]] (1808–1888) and [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria]]. The ninth of ten children born to her parents, she was known as ''Sopherl'' within the family. 

She was also a sister of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and [[Maria Sophie of Bavaria|Queen Maria Sophie of the Two Sicilies]]. After the marriage of her older sister, [[Duchess Mathilde Ludovika in Bavaria]] to 1861 to the Neapolitan [[Prince Louis, Count of Trani|Prince Luis of the Two Sicilies]], her parents then looked for a suitable husband for Sophie Charlotte. 

She was engaged to her cousin [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|King Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. Their engagement was publicised on 22 January 1867, but after having repeatedly postponed the wedding date, Ludwig finally cancelled it in October, as it seemed she’d fallen in love with the court photographer, [[Edgar_Hanfstaengl#Origins_and_young_life|Edgar Hanfstaengl]]. 

Other proposed husbands included the renowned homosexual [[Archduke Ludwig Viktor of Austria]], brother of both [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], as well as the future [[Luís I of Portugal]]. Another candidate was [[Duke Philipp of Württemberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Son of [[Princess Marie of Orléans (1813–1839)|Princess Marie of Orléans]], daughter of Louis Philippe I&lt;/ref&gt; the first cousin of her eventual husband.

She refused all the candidates. She was sent to stay with her aunt, [[Amalie Auguste of Bavaria|Amalie Auguste]], then the Queen of Saxony as wife of [[John of Saxony|King John of Saxony]]. It was in Saxony Sophie Charlotte met [[Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Alençon|Prince Ferdinand of Orléans]] (12 July 1844 &amp;ndash; 29 June 1910), ''Duke of Alençon'', the son of [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours]] and grandson of the late [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]] (died 1850). Soon after, on 28 September 1868, she married him at [[Possenhofen Castle]], near [[Starnberg]].

She had a good relationship with her husband as well as with her sister-in-law [[Princess Marguerite Adélaïde of Orléans]], wife of [[Władysław Czartoryski|Prince Władysław Czartoryski]]. Her mother in law, [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], cousin of [[Queen Victoria]], had died in 1857. Sophie Charlotte did not have an overly good relationship with her father-in-law, the widowed [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|Duke of Nemours]]. 

The year after their marriage, the ducal couple moved into [[Bushy House]] in the [[Teddington]] area of [[Southwest London]], where Sophie Charlotte gave birth to her first child, [[Princess Louise of Orléans (1862–1952)|Princess Louise of Orléans]]. 

Sophie died in a fire at the [[Bazar de la Charité]] in [[Paris]] on 4 May 1897. She had refused rescue attempts, insisting that the girls working with her at the bazaar be saved first. Attempts to have her body identified by her personal maid having failed, her dentist, M. Lavanport, was called in. After two hours examining various bodies he identified hers on the basis of her gold fillings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bn-r.fr/presse/pdf/PRA_AVE/PDF/1897/PRA_AVE_18970507_001.pdf ''L'Avenir'', May 7, 1897].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue==

* [[Princess Louise of Orléans (1869–1952)|Louise Victoire Marie Amélie Sophie d'Orléans]] (19 July 1869 &amp;ndash; 4 February 1952) married [[Prince Alfons of Bavaria]] (1862–1933) and had issue; (the line ended in dynastical sense in 1990 in male line, with [[cognatic]] descendants still present).
* [[Prince Emmanuel, Duke of Vendôme|Philippe Emmanuel Maximilien Marie Eudes d'Orléans]], ''Duke of Vendôme'' (18 January 1872 &amp;ndash; 1 February 1931) married [[Princess Henriette of Belgium]]&lt;ref&gt;Sister of [[Albert I of Belgium]] and daughter of [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]] who in turn was a grandson of [[Louis-Philippe of France]]&lt;/ref&gt; and had issue (the line ended dynastically in 1970 in male line, with [[cognatic]] descendants still present).

Discussions of the [[far future]] are of major importance both in theology and [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|page=112|journal=Spiritual Information: 100 Perspectives on Science and Religion|editors=Charles L. Harper Jr., John Templeton|author=Gregory A.

In [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]], the creator god, will live for 100 years, with each day of these years made up of two [[kalpa (aeon)|''kalpas'']], and each ''kalpa'' lasting  4.32 billion human years. The lifetime of Brahma, and thus the universe, is therefore predicted to last 315.36 trillion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Time|author=Dan Falk|year=2009|publisher=National Maritime Museum|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayan religion]] often cites incredibly long time periods. Stela 1 at [[Coba]] marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}} in the [[Mesoamerican Long Count]].

'''Francis Xavier Bushman''' (January 10, 1883 – August 23, 1966) was an American film actor and director.  His career as a [[matinee idol]] started in 1911 in the [[silent film]] ''[[His Friend's Wife]].''&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; He gained a large female following and was one of the biggest stars of the 1910s and early 1920s.

Bushman, like many of his contemporaries, broke into the moving picture business via the stage. He was performing at [[Broncho Billy Anderson]]'s [[Essanay Studios]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he was first noticed for his muscular, sculpted frame. He appeared in nearly 200 feature [[film]] roles—more than 175 films before 1920, and 17 in his screen debut year of 1911 alone. He also worked for the [[Vitagraph]] studio before signing with [[Metro Pictures|Metro]] in 1915.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. As a young man Bushman joined the Maryland Athletic Club and began a [[Bodybuilding|body building]] [[regimen]] that would give him his famous film physique. He cited [[Eugen Sandow]] as one of his body building influences. In [[New York City|New York]], he worked as a [[Model (art)|sculptor's model]], often posing in the nude in sessions. In 1902, he married [[Dressmaker|seamstress]] Josephine Fladine Duval. By the launch of his film career, the couple had five children. In 1918, he was the subject of a national [[scandal]] as his affair with longtime costar [[Beverly Bayne]] became public. Three days after his divorce with Josephine was final, Bushman and Bayne were married; they would eventually have a son. Bushman and his studios had kept his marriage secret for fear of losing popularity. He was married four times.

Bushman eventually retained the talented services of [[Harry Reichenbach]] as his agent.  When Bushman noted that he would be well suited to starring in the upcoming 1925 film, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', Reichenbach had a plan to increase his client's marketability. He took Bushman to see studio executives from the railway station and dropped pennies to the street from his pocket. Lots of people followed them, picking up the coins and following them. The crowd gave the studio executives an impression that Bushman was very popular and cast him as [[Messala (Ben-Hur)|Messala]]. Bushman was concerned that playing a [[villain]] would affect his career, so he asked the advice of [[William S. Hart]] who had played the part on stage for years. "Take it", Hart advised—"It's the best part in the play!" Unlike [[Ramon Novarro]], the star of the picture, Bushman knew how to properly drive a team of [[horse]]s and a [[chariot]] without getting severely injured or killed in the process. When ''Ben Hur'' was [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|remade in 1959]], [[Charlton Heston]] had to learn the technique and quipped "The only man in [[Hollywood]] who can drive a chariot is Francis X. Bushman—and he's too old!"

At the peak of his career, he was advertised as "The Handsomest Man in the World". Bushman was also known as "the King of Photoplay" or "the King of Movies" before those titles were more popularly attached to [[Clark Gable]].

Bushman was paid large salaries during his screen career, and donated the land upon which [[Sid Grauman]] erected his famous [[Grauman's Chinese Theater|Chinese Theater]]. But his fortune was wiped out in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|great crash of 1929]], and his career as a movie star had had its run. After his film career had waned, Bushman made his broadcasting mark on the [[CBS Radio]] network's long-running [[Radio drama|dramatic]] [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] entitled ''Those We Love''. In the [[soap opera]], which ran from 1938 to 1945, he played the role of John Marshall, a father of the twins (played by [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]] and [[Nan Grey]]). [[Robert Cummings]] rounded out the cast. He took small roles in pictures and attempted to run a few small businesses, all of which lost money. On viewing one of his early films, Bushman is said to have remarked, "My God, look at that! I'm putting all my emotion into my ''chin''!"

In later years, Bushman made assorted guest appearances on American television in the 1950s and 1960s.  On February 6, 1958, he and his wife Iva Millicient Richardson appeared on the quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' with [[Groucho Marx]] and won $1,000 by successfully answering questions in a geography quiz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=APRqbl24jqM "You Bet Your Life #57-20 Francis X. Bushman ..."], episode 20 of 1957-1958 season of ''You Bet Your Life'', originally broadcast February 6, 1958.   Digital copy of full episode on [[YouTube]], a streaming service owned by Alphabet, Inc., Mountain View, California.  Retrieved 2017-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also performed on weekly [[sitcom]]s and television dramas, including ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'', ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', and ''[[Dr. Kildare]]''.  Bushman guest-starred as well in 1966 on a two-part episode of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.&lt;ref name="batfan"&gt;{{cite web | last=Sutton | first=David | url=http://www.1966batfan.com/gueststar20.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021102514/http://1966batfan.com/gueststar20.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-10-21 | title=Guests – Francis X Bushman | publisher=The 1966 Batman TV Trivia Site | accessdate=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bushman and [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]], his co-star in ''[[The Grip of the Yukon]]'', appeared in the ''Batman'' episode—their first reunion acting together in 38 years.&lt;ref name="batfan" /&gt;  Bushman's role as a wealthy collector of silent pictures and promoter of a silent film festival was his last appearance on camera.&lt;ref&gt;The Silent film festival has [[Keystone Cops]] comedy and [[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]] scenes-neither of which Bushman appeared in during his silent movie acting career&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis X. Bushman is mentioned numerous times by the character "[[Pearl Bodine]]" in the [[The Beverly Hillbillies (season 1)|first season]] of the [[Beverly Hillbillies]]. In the episode entitled, "No Place Like Home," Pearl Bodine has written a song which she plays when the silent version of "[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]" is shown in the Clampett's hometown. In a later episode, when Pearl visits the Clampetts in Los Angeles, she speaks about hoping to meet Francis X. Bushman. In the episode "Jed's Dilemma," "Jed" takes the family on a sightseeing tour of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. When passing a fancy home, Pearl wonders if it could be the home of a movie star, possibly Francis X. Bushman. Jed tells her no, because he got a good look in the yard and didn't see room for horses or a chariot.

Francis X. Bushman suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died at his home in [[Pacific Palisades, California]], on August 23, 1966. He was interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Francis X.

==Legacy==
His son [[Ralph Bushman|Ralph Everly Bushman]] (1903–1978) had a film career from the 1920s through the 1940s. Tall (6'4") and good-looking, he was in over 40 films, often playing stuffy upper-class types or menacing gangsters.  In ''Brown of Harvard'' (1926) he was cast against [[William Haines]] and [[Jack Pickford]]. He was often billed as "Francis X. Bushman Jr."

Francis Bushman's granddaughter, Barbara Bushman Quine, married actor [[Harry Morgan]]. A grandson, [[Pat Conway]] (1931–1981), the son of [[film director]] Jack Conway and Bushman's daughter, Virginia, starred on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] ''[[Tombstone Territory]]''.

For his contributions to the [[film industry]], Bushman was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960 with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 1651 [[Vine Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/francis-x-bushman|title=Francis X.

'''Future-proofing''' is the process of anticipating the future and developing methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rich, Brian.  “The Principles of Future-Proofing: A Broader Understanding of Resiliency in the Historic Built Environment.” Journal of Preservation Education and Research, vol. 7 (2014): 31-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Future-proofing is used in industries such as electronics, medical industry, industrial design, and, more recently, in design for climate change. The principles of future-proofing are extracted from other industries and codified as a system for approaching an intervention in an historic building.

==Concept==
In general, the term "future-proof" refers to the ability of something to continue to be of value into the distant future—that the item does not become obsolete.

The concept of future-proofing is the process of anticipating the future and developing methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rich |first1=Brian |date=2014 |title=The Principles of Future-Proofing: A Broader Understanding of Resiliency in the Historic Built Environment |journal=Journal of Preservation Education and Research |volume=7 |pages=31-49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is commonly found in electronics, data storage, and communications systems. It is also found in industrial design, computers, software, health care/medical, strategic sustainable development, strategic management consultancy and product design.

Study of the principles behind “future-proofing” both within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry and among outside industries can give vital information about the basis of future-proofing. This information can be distilled into several Principles which can be applied to a variety of areas.

==Principles of future-proofing==

Based on the sources reviewed above, there are several principles of future-proofing that can be determined. Originally published in 2014&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and updated in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/36402/Rich_washington_0250O_16038.pdf%3Fsequence%3D1%26isAllowed%3Dy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;scisig=AAGBfm09iFYwL_IfWGlsCL9KjoWXtENdxA&amp;nossl=1&amp;oi=scholaralrt 2016] by Brian Rich, Principal of Richaven Architecture &amp; Preservation, the Principles of Future-Proofing include:

'''1. Prevent decay.''' 

Promote durable building materials and methods of construction that prevent premature deterioration of the built environment rather than accelerate deterioration.  Interventions should use building materials of equal or greater durability than existing building fabric or design for disassembly and replacement. 

'''2. Stimulate flexibility and adaptability.''' 

Flexibility and adaptability of the environment and the attitudes towards it are essential its retention in a [[Throw-away society|disposable society]].

'''3. Extend service life.''' 

Extend the service life of the built environment through regular inspections and maintenance so it may continue to contribute to economy, culture, and sustainable society.

'''4. Fortify'''

Build engineered resilience by fortifying the built environment against climate change, extreme weather and natural hazards, and shortages of materials and energy.

'''5. Increase redundancy.'''

Redundant systems provide backup in the event that a primary system fails and allow a building to continue to function.

'''6. Reduce obsolescence.'''

[[Planned obsolescence]] wouldn't be accepted.  A proactive approach to preventing physical, functional, aesthetic, and sustainable obsolescence should be taken.

'''7. Planning Ahead.'''

The demolition of existing building fabric by using optimum materials, construction phasing, and scalability through long range planning should be planned.

'''8. Diversify.'''

Allow for multiple stable states, like ecologically resilient systems.  Include different sources, uses, capabilities, and economic models rather than one dominant trait.

'''9. Be local and healthy.'''

Incorporate non-toxic, renewable, local materials, parts, and labor into our built environment to ensure materials and manufacturing capabilities will be readily available in the future for efficient repairs.

'''10.  Consider life cycle benefits.'''

Consider the long-term life cycle benefits of interventions in our built environment as opposed to demolition and disposal of existing historic building fabric.

'''11.  Take advantage of cultural heritage policy documents.'''

Typically applied during the design phases of a project, cultural heritage policy documents provide excellent guidance for the long-term retention of an historic building.

'''12.  Promote understanding.''' 

Renovation, rehabilitation and other types of alterations to existing buildings should allow for understanding of the built environment and its place in our built heritage through minimal interventions that remain distinguishable from the original structure.  Construction should respect historic fabric and seek to protect it.

==Electronics and communications==

In future-proof electrical systems buildings should have “flexible distribution systems to allow communication technologies to expand.”&lt;ref&gt;Coley, David, Tristan Kershaw, and Matt Eames. “A Comparison of Structural and Behavioural Adaptations to Future Proofing Buildings against Higher Temperatures.” Building and Environment 55 (2012): 159-66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Image-related processing software should be flexible, adaptable, and programmable to be able to work with several different potential media in the future as well as to handle increasing file sizes. Image-related processing software should also be scalable and embeddable – in other words, the use or place where the software is employed is variable and the software needs to accommodate the variable environment. Higher processing integration is required to support future computational requirements in image processing as well.&lt;ref&gt;Barreneche, Raul A. “Wiring Buildings for the Future.” Architecture 84.4 (1995): 123-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In wireless phone networks, future-proofing of the network hardware and software systems deployed become critical because they are so costly to deploy that it is not economically viable to replace each system when changes in the network operations occur. Telecommunications system designers focus heavily on the ability of a system to be reused and to be flexible in order to continue competing in the marketplace.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1998, teleradiology (the ability to send radiology images such as x-rays and CAT scans over the internet to a reviewing radiologist) was in its infancy. Doctors developed their own systems, aware that technology would change over time. They consciously included future-proof as one of the characteristics that their investment would need to have. To these doctors, future-proof meant open modular architecture and interoperability so that as technology advanced it would be possible to update the hardware and software modules within the system without disrupting the remaining modules. This draws out two characteristics of future-proofing that are important to the built environment:  interoperability and the ability to be adapted to future technologies as they were developed.&lt;ref&gt;Roberson, G. H., and Y. Y. Shieh. "Radiology Information Systems, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems, Teleradiology - Overview and Design Criteria." Journal of Digital Imaging 11.4 (1998): 2-7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial design==

In industrial design, future-proofing designs seek to prevent obsolescence by analyzing the decrease in desirability of products. Desirability is measured in categories such as function, appearance, and emotional value. The products with more functional design, better appearance, and which accumulate emotional value faster tend to be retained longer and are considered future-proof. Industrial design ultimately strives to encourage people to buy less by creating objects with higher levels of desirability. Some of the characteristics of future-proof products that come out of this study include a timeless nature, high durability, aesthetic appearances that capture and hold the interest of buyers. Ideally, as an object ages, its desirability is maintained or increases with increased emotional attachment. Products that fit into society’s current paradigm of progress, while simultaneously making progress, also tend to have increased desirability.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Joseph Robert. "Future-Proof Design: Must All Good Things Come to an End?" M.E.Des. University of Calgary (Canada), 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Industrial design teaches that future-proof products are timeless, have high durability, and develop ongoing aesthetic and emotional attraction.

==Utility systems==

In one region of New Zealand, Hawke’s Bay, a study was conducted to determine what would be required to future-proof the regional economy with specific reference to the water system. The study specifically sought to understand the existing and potential water demand in the region as well as how this potential demand might change with climate change and more intense land use. This information was used to develop demand estimates that would inform the improvements to the regional water system. Future-proofing thus includes forward planning for future development and increased demands on resources. However, the study focuses on future demands almost exclusively and does not address other components of future-proofing such as contingency plans to handle disastrous damage to the system or durability of the materials in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer, Dan, and Phillipa Page. Hawke's Bay Water Demand 2050:  a Report for Hawke's Bay Regional Council: Page Bloomer Associates Ltd., 28 February 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change and energy conservation==

The term “future-proofing” in relation to sustainable design began to be used in 2007. It has been used more often in sustainable design in relation to energy conservation to minimize the effects of future global temperature rise and/or rising energy costs. By far, the most common use of the term “future-proofing” is found in relation to sustainable design and energy conservation in particular. In this context, the term is usually referring to the ability of a structure to withstand impacts from future shortages in energy and resources, increasing world population, and environmental issues, by reducing the amount of energy consumption in the building. Understanding the use of “future-proofing” in this field assists in development of the concept of future-proofing as applied to existing structures.

In the realm of sustainable environmental issues, future-proof is used generally to describe the ability of a design to resist the impact of potential climate change due to global warming. Two characteristics describe this impact. First, “dependency on fossil fuels will be more or less completely eliminated and replaced by renewable energy sources.”  Second, “Society, infrastructure and the economy will be well adapted to the residual impacts of climate change.”&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, Patrick, Jitendra Agarwal, and Priyan Dias. "Systems 2030–Emergent Themes."  (2010). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the design of low energy consuming dwellings, “buildings of the future should be sustainable, low-energy and able to accommodate social, technological, economic and regulatory changes, thus maximizing life cycle value.”   The goal is to “reduce the likelihood of a prematurely obsolete building design.”&lt;ref&gt;Georgiadou, M. C., T. Hacking, and P. Guthrie. "A Conceptual Framework for Future-Proofing the Energy Performance of Buildings." Energy Policy 47 (2012): 145-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, research commissioned by the Health Infrastructure New South Wales explored “practical, cost-effective, design-related strategies for “future-proofing” the buildings of a major Australian health department.”  This study concluded that “a focus on a whole life-cycle approach to the design and operation of health facilities clearly would have benefits.”  By designing in flexibility and adaptability of structures, one may “defer the obsolescence and consequent need for demolition and replacement of many health facilities, thereby reducing overall demand for building materials and energy.”&lt;ref&gt;Carthey, Jane, et al. "Flexibility:  Beyond the Buzzword - Practical Findings from a Systematic Literature Review." Health Environments Research and Design Journal 4.4 (Summer 2011): 89-108. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a building’s structural system to accommodate projected climate changes and whether “non-structural [behavioral] adaptations might have a great enough effect to offset any errors from… …an erroneous choice of climate change projection.”  The essence of the discussion is whether adjustments in the occupant’s behavior can future-proof the building against errors in judgment in estimates of the impacts of global climate change. There are clearly many factors involved and the paper does not go into them in exhaustive detail. However, it is clear that “soft adaptations” such as changes in behavior (such as turning lights off, opening windows for cooling) can have a significant impact on the ability of a building to continue to function as the environment around it changes. Thus adaptability is an important criterion in the concept of future-proofing” buildings. Adaptability is a theme that begins to come through in many of the other studies on future-proofing.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, David, Tristan Kershaw, and Matt Eames. "A Comparison of Structural and Behavioural Adaptations to Future Proofing Buildings against Higher Temperatures." Building and Environment 55 (2012): 159-66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of sustainable technologies that can be used in existing buildings to take “advantage of up-to-date technologies in the enhancement of the energetic performance of buildings.”  The intent is to understand how to follow the new European Energy Standards to attain the best in energy savings. The subject speaks to historic buildings and specifically of façade renewal, focusing on energy conservation. These technologies include “improvement of thermal and acoustic performance, solar shadings, passive solar energy systems, and active solar energy systems.”  The main value of this study to future-proofing is not the specific technologies, but rather the concept of working with an existing façade by overlapping it rather than modifying the existing one. The employment of ventilated facades, double skin glass facades, and solar shadings take advantage of the thermal mass of existing buildings commonly found in Italy. These techniques not only work with thermal mass walls, but also protect damaged and deteriorating historic facades to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Brunoro, Silvia. "An Assessment of Energetic Efficiency Improvement of Existing Building Envelopes in Italy." Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal 19.6 (2008): 718-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture, engineering and construction==

Use of the term “future-proofing” has been uncommon in the AEC industry, especially with relation to historic buildings until recently. In 1997, the MAFF laboratories at York, England were described in an article as “future-proof” by being flexible enough to adapt to developing rather than static scientific research. The standard building envelope and MEP services provided could be tailored for each type of research to be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Bryan. "Future Proof: The Maff Laboratories at York." Architecture today.82 (1997): 26-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, “future-proof” was used in reference to “megatrends” that were driving education of planners in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Meng, Lee Lik. "Megatrends Driving Planning Education: How Do We Future-Proof Planners?" Australian planner 46.1 (2009): 48-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar term, “fatigue proofing,” was used in 2007 to describe steel cover plates in bridge construction that would not fail due to fatigue cracking.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Albrecht, P., and A. Lenwari. "Fatigue-Proofing Cover Plates." Journal of Bridge Engineering 12.3 (2007): 275-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, a New Zealand-based organization outlined 8 principles of future-proof buildings:  smart energy use, increased health and safety, increased life cycle duration, increased quality of materials and installation, increased security, increased sound control for noise pollution, adaptable spatial design, and reduced carbon footprint.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;CMS. "What Is Future-Proof Building?" Construction Marketing Services Limited 2012. Web. 18 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to future-proofing suggests that only in more extensive refurbishments to a building should future-proofing be considered. Even then, the proposed time horizon for future-proofing events is 15 to 25 years. The explanation for this particular time horizon for future-proof improvements is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sunil. Sustainable Refurbishment. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This author believes that time horizons for future-proofing are much more dependent on the potential service life of the structure, the nature of the intervention, and several other factors. The result is that time horizons for future-proof interventions could vary from 15 years (rapidly changing technology interventions) to hundreds of years (major structural interventions).

In the valuation of real estate, there are three traditional forms of obsolescence which affect property values:  physical, functional, and aesthetic. Physical obsolescence occurs when the physical material of the property deteriorates to the point where it needs to be replaced or renovated. Functional obsolescence occurs when the property is no longer capable of serving the intended use or function. Aesthetic obsolescence occurs when fashions change, when something is no longer in style. A potential fourth form has emerged as well:  sustainable obsolescence. Sustainable obsolescence proposes to be a combination of the above forms in many ways. Sustainable obsolescence occurs when a property no longer meets one or more sustainable design goals.&lt;ref&gt;Is Sustainability the 4th Form of Obsolescence? PRRES 2010: Proceedings of the Pacific Rim Real Estate Society 16th Annual Conference. 2012. Pacific Rim Real Estate Society (PPRES). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Obsolescence is an important characteristic of future-proofing a property because it emphasizes the need for the property to continue to be viable. Though not explicitly stated, the shocks and stresses to a property in the future are one potential way in which a property may become not future-proof. It is also important to note that each form of obsolescence can be either curable or incurable. The separation of curable and incurable obsolescence is ill defined because the amount of effort one is willing to put into correcting it varies depending on several factors:  people, time, budget, availability, etc.

However, the most informative realm within the AEC industry is the concept of resiliency. A new buzzword among preservationists and sustainable designers, resiliency has several clearly identified principles. In its common usage, “resilience” describes the ability to recoil or spring back into shape after bending, stretching, or being compressed. In ecology, the term “resilience” the capacity of an ecosystem to tolerate disturbance without collapsing into a qualitatively different state.&lt;ref&gt;Applegath, Craig, et al. "Resilient Design Principles and Building Design Principles." ResilientCity.org 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The principles of a resilient built environment include:

* Local materials, parts and labor
* Low energy input
* High capacity for future flexibility and adaptability of use
* High durability and redundancy of building systems
* Environmentally responsive design
* Sensitivity and responsiveness to changes in constituent parts and environment
* High level of diversity in component systems and features

One reasonable approach to future-proof sustainable cities is an integrated multi-disciplinary combination of mitigation and adaptation to raise the level of resilience of the city. In the context of urban environments, resilience is less dependent on an exact understanding of the future than on tolerance of uncertainty and broad programs to absorb the stresses that this environment might face. The scale of the context is important in this view:  events are viewed as regional stresses rather than local. The intent for a resilient urban environment is to keep many options open, emphasize diversity in the environment, and perform long-range planning that accounts for external systemic shocks.&lt;ref&gt;Thornbush, M., O. Golubchikov, and S. Bouzarovski. "Sustainable Cities Targeted by Combined Mitigation-Adaptation Efforts for Future-Proofing." Sustainable Cities and Society 9 (2013): 1-9. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Options and diversity are strategies similar to ecological resilience discussed above. This approach again points out the importance of flexibility, adaptability, and diversity to future-proofing urban environments.

==Historic buildings==

The design of interventions in existing buildings which are not detrimental to the future of the building may be called “future-proofing.”  Future-proofing includes the careful consideration of how “sustainable” alterations to historic structures affect the original historic material of the structure. This effect is significant for long service life structures in order to prevent them from deteriorating and being demolished. This effect is especially significant in designated structures where the intent is to do no harm to the historic fabric of the structure.

Historic buildings are particularly good candidates for future-proofing because they have already survived for 50 to 100 years or more. Given their performance to date and appropriate interventions, historic building structures are likely to be able to last for centuries. This durability is evident in the buildings of Europe and Asia which have survived centuries and millennia. Extension of the service life of our existing building stock through sensitive interventions reduces energy consumption, decreases material waste, retains [[embodied energy]], and promotes a long-term relationship with our built environment that is critical to the future survival of the human species on this planet.

Future-proofing of designated historic structures adds a level of complexity to the concepts of future-proofing in other industries as described above. All interventions on historic structures must comply with the Secretary’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. The degree of compliance and the Standard selected may vary depending on jurisdiction, type of intervention, significance of the structure, and the nature of the intended interventions. The underlying principle is that no harm is done to the structure in the course of the intervention which would damage the structure or make it unavailable to future generations. In addition, it is important that the historic portions of the structure be able to be understood and comprehended apart from the newer interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, Kay D. "The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties : With Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring &amp; Reconstructing Historic Buildings." Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Cultural Resource Stewardship and Partnerships, Heritage Preservation Services, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure Projects ==
Future-proofing is also a new methodology to address vulnerabilities of infrastructure systems.  For example, analysis of domestic water infrastructure in the Southern California and Tijuana area completed by Rich and Gattuso in 2016&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rich, Brian D. and Gattuso, Meghan. 2016. “Future-Proofing Critical Water Infrastructure from an Economic and Hazard Resilience Perspective.” Originally published in the Association of Collegiate Schools or Architecture, 104th Annual Meeting Proceeding, Shaping New Knowledges., Seattle, WA. Corser, Robert and Haar, Sharon, Co-chairs. Pp. 636-643.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that potential vulnerabilities include levee failures, material deterioration, and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). 2009. “Delta Risk Management Strategy: Executive Summary.” &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.water.ca.gov/&lt;/nowiki&gt; floodmgmt/dsmo/sab/drmsp/docs/drms_execsum_ ph1_final_low.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  With changes in the hydrologic conditions due to climate change, there will be increased emphasis on ensuring that the water infrastructure systems continue to function after a natural hazard event where specific components or facilities in the system are compromised.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;San Diego Regional Water Management Group (RWMG). 2013 San Diego Integrated Regional Water Management Plan: An Update of the 2007 IRWM Plan. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://sdirwmp.org/pdf/SDIRWM_Highlights_Sept2013.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;http://sdirwmp.org/pdf/SDIRWM_03_Region_Description_Sep2013.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the aqueducts and pipelines, local or regional infrastructure such as reservoirs, dams, local pipeline systems, pump stations, water treatment, and desalination facilities could be impacted by any of several potential natural hazards.  Imported water via aqueducts and pipelines stands as the most significant vulnerability due to the high volumes required, the length of travel, and the nature of the delivery system.  Conventional piping infrastructure is at risk for damage in a seismic event as the materials do not generally react well to the shear stresses brought upon by earthquakes.

Many new potable water technologies, such as desalination, physical treatment, chemical treatment, and biological treatment systems, can help to address these vulnerabilities.  However, development of a future-proof infrastructure system con have longer lasting benefits.  The San Diego Regional Water System has been implementing a program of infrastructure improvements to ensure plentiful water sources in the future.  These include developed an emergency storage program aimed at providing a 75% service level and includes several key elements of the regional water system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The regional water authority is also in the middle of a multi-decade long project to reline the existing pipeline system to increase their service life (Water-technology.net, 2012).  the region also seeks to supplement the water supply through diversification of sources of water which will support continued growth of the regional population.  Priorities for development of new water sources (in order of preference) are seawater desalination, indirect potable reuse (wastewater recycling), and additional water from the Colorado River.&lt;ref&gt;CDM. 2010. “Section 3: Assessment of Current Conditions.” “Section 5: Population, Growth and Land use Projections.” Section 6: Water Demand Projections.” “Section 9: Development of Water and Wastewater Alternatives.” Comisión Estatal de Servicios Públicos de Tijuana. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/Mexico/TijuanaWaterSupply.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  These projects and improvements are examples of ways in which a water infrastructure systems may be developed in a future-proof way while also addressing hazard mitigation concerns, long term adaptive cycles.

The strategies being employed in San Diego and Tijuana are future-proofing their potable water infrastructure systems by including seismic loops and flexible over-sized systems to prevent damage in seismic events accommodate future changes in use and population growth.  The San Diego Regional Water System is pursuing strategies that diversify and increase redundancy of water supplies by including metropolitan water district sources, irrigation water transfer, canal lining to prevent leakage, conservation or reduced consumption, recycled wastewater, desalination, groundwater sources, and surface water sources.  Development of new water tunnels and relining water mains, branches, and canals extends the service life, and fortifies the system while reducing physical and functional obsolescence and preventing further deterioration of the system.  Ongoing maintenance, diversification efforts, capacity development, and planning for future requirements will ensure an ongoing future-proof supply of water for the region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Life Cycle Analysis &amp; Life Cycle Assessment ==
Life Cycle Assessment/Analysis (LCA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment|title=Life Cycle Assessment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} can be used as an indicator of long term impacts to the environment, and an important aspect of future-proofing our built environment, quantifying the impacts of initial construction, periodic renovation, and regular maintenance of a building over an extended time span.  A study completed published in 2015 by Rich&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Rich, Brian D. Future-Proof Building Materials: A Life Cycle Analysis. Intersections and Adjacencies. Proceedings of the 2015 Building Educators’ Society Conference, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. Gines, Jacob, Carraher, Erin, and Galarze, Jose, editors. Pp. 123-130.&lt;/ref&gt; compares the impacts of gymnasiums constructed of different building materials over a 200 year period using the Athena Impact Estimator.  Rich developed the phrase "First Impacts" to describe the environmental impacts of new construction from raw material extraction to occupancy of the building.  When the environmental impacts of maintenance and replacement are considered with first impacts for a building, a complete picture of the environmental impacts are formed.

While choice of materials is important to initial impacts of a building or product, less durable materials lead to more frequent maintenance, operating expenses and replacement.  By contrast, more durable materials may have more significant initial impacts, but those impacts will pay off in the long run by reducing maintenance, repairs, and operations expenses.  Durability of all components of a building system should have equivalent service lives or allow for disassembly in order to maintain the shorter service life materials. This allows retention of materials that have longer service lives rather than disposing of them when removed to perform maintenance.  Proper maintenance of a building is critical to long term service life because it prevents deterioration of less durable materials that can expose additional materials to deterioration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Government Accountability Office''' ('''GAO''') is a [[legislative branch]]  government agency that provides [[audit]]ing, [[evaluation]], and investigative services for the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/about/workforce/ocg.html|title=Office of the Comptroller General|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[supreme audit institution]] of the [[federal government of the United States]].

Mission of GAO is to:
* investigate how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars
* support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities
* help improve the performance
* ensure the accountability of the federal government for people
* provide Congress with timely information

==Core values==
{{advert section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Gao core values chart.gif|thumb|GAO’s Core Values encompass mission values (Accountability, Integrity, Reliability) and people values (Valued, Respected, Treated Fairly)]]
* Accountability:  GAO helps the Congress oversee federal programs and operations to ensure accountability to the American people. GAO's analysts, auditors, lawyers, economists, information technology specialists, investigators, and other multidisciplinary professionals seek to enhance the economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and credibility of the federal government both in fact and in the eyes of the American people. GAO accomplishes its mission through a variety of activities, including financial audits, program reviews, investigations, legal support, and policy analyses.
* Integrity:  GAO takes a professional, objective, fact-based, nonpartisan, nonideological, fair, and balanced approach to all of its activities and sets high standards for itself and its work. Integrity is the foundation of reputation, and GAO's approach to its work assures both.
* Reliability:  GAO produces high quality reports, testimony, briefings, legal opinions, and other products and services that are timely, accurate, useful, clear, and candid.
* Valued:  GAO seeks out and appreciates each person’s perspectives by seeing everyone as an individual and tapping into everyone’s skills, talents, and life experiences.
* Respected:  GAO strives to treat everyone with dignity by listening, hearing, and acknowledging everyone’s viewpoints, keeping an open mind, and embracing differences.
* Treated Fairly:  GAO fosters a work environment that provides opportunities for all staff to excel by acting with honesty and integrity, treating all equitably, checking for bias, supporting equal access to opportunities, and trusting others to do their part.

==Powers of GAO==
Work of GAO is done at the request of congressional committees or subcommittees or is mandated by public laws or committee reports. It also undertakes research under the authority of the Comptroller General. It supports congressional oversight by:
* auditing agency operations to determine whether federal funds are being spent efficiently and effectively;
* investigating allegations of illegal and improper activities;
* reporting on how well government programs and policies are meeting their objectives;
* performing policy analyses and outlining options for congressional consideration;
* issuing legal decisions and opinions;
* advising Congress and the heads of executive agencies about ways to make government more efficient and effective.

==Products of GAO==
[[File:LocalGao.png|thumb|GAO local offices]]

Products of GAO includes the following:
* reports and written correspondence;
* testimonies and statements for the record, where the former are delivered orally by one or more of GAO senior executives at a congressional hearing and the latter are provided for inclusion in the congressional record;
* briefings, which are usually given directly to congressional staff members;
* legal decisions and opinions resolving bid protests and addressing issues of appropriations law as well as opinions on the scope and excrcise of authority of federal officers.
GAO also produce special publications on specific issues of general interest to many Americans, such as its report on the fiscal future of the United States, GAO’s role in the federal bid protest process, and critical issues for congressional consideration related to improving the nation's image abroad.

==History==
The GAO was established as the '''General Accounting Office''' by the [[Budget and Accounting Act]] of 1921. The act required the head of the GAO to "investigate, at the seat of government or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds, and shall make to the President ... and to Congress ... reports [and] recommendations looking to greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures".&lt;ref&gt;[[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]], Sec. 312(a), {{USStat|42|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the GAO's current mission statement, the agency exists to support the Congress in meeting its [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] responsibilities and to help improve the [[performance]] and ensure the [[accountability]] of the federal government for the benefit of the American people.

The name was changed in 2004 to Government Accountability Office by the [[GAO Human Capital Reform Act]] to better reflect the mission of the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GAO Answers the Question: What’s in a Name?|last=Walker|first=David M.|authorlink=David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|date=July 19, 2004|work=[[Roll Call]]|url=http://www.gao.gov/about/rollcall07192004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 8, GAO Human Capital Reform Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-271, 118 Stat. 811, 814 (July 7, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; While most other countries have government entities similar to the GAO, their focus (with the exceptions of the [[Taiwan]]ese [[Control Yuan]] and the [[Israel]]i [[State Comptroller of Israel|State Comptroller]]) is primarily on conducting financial audits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The GAO's auditors conduct not only financial audits, but also engage in a wide assortment of performance audits.

Over the years, the GAO has been referred to as "The Congressional Watchdog" and "The Taxpayers' Best Friend" for its frequent audits and investigative reports that have uncovered waste and inefficiency in government. News media often draw attention to the GAO's work by publishing stories on the findings, conclusions and recommendations of its reports. Members of Congress also frequently cite the GAO's work in statements to the press, congressional hearings, and floor debates on proposed legislation.  In 2007 the Partnership for Public Service ranked the GAO second on its list of the best places to work in the federal government and [[Washingtonian (magazine)|''Washingtonian'']] magazine included the GAO on its 2007 list of great places to work in Washington, a list that encompasses the public, private, and non-profit sectors.

The GAO is headed by the [[Comptroller General of the United States|comptroller general of the U.S.]], a professional and non-partisan position in the U.S. government.  The comptroller general is appointed by the [[President of the United States|president]], by and with the [[advice and consent#United States|advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], for a 15-year, non-renewable term.  The president selects a nominee from a list of at least three individuals recommended by an eight-member bipartisan, bicameral commission of congressional leaders. During such term, the comptroller general has standing to pursue litigation to compel access to federal agency information. The comptroller general may not be removed by the president, but only by Congress through impeachment or joint resolution for specific reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Bowsher v. Synar]]'', 478 U.S. 714 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1921, there have been only seven comptrollers general, and no formal attempt has ever been made to remove a comptroller general.

Labor-management relations became fractious during the 9-year tenure of the 7th comptroller general, [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David M. Walker]].  On September 19, 2007, GAO analysts voted by a margin of two to one (897–445), in a 75% turnout, to establish the first union in the GAO's 86-year history.  The analysts voted to affiliate with the [[International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers]] (IFPTE), a member union of the [[AFL-CIO]]. There are more than 1,800 analysts in the GAO analysts bargaining unit; the local voted to name itself IFPTE Local 1921, in honor of the date of the GAO's establishment. On February 14, 2008, the GAO analysts' union approved its first-ever negotiated pay contract with management; of just over 1,200 votes, 98 percent were in favor of the contract.

The GAO also establishes standards for audits of government organizations, programs, activities, and functions, and of government assistance received by contractors, nonprofit organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations. These standards, often referred to as [[Government Auditing Standards (Yellow Book)|Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards]] (GAGAS), are to be followed by auditors and audit organizations when required by law, regulation, agreement, contract, or policy. These standards pertain to auditors' professional qualifications, the quality of audit effort, and the characteristics of professional and meaningful audit reports.

In 1992 the GAO hosted XIV [[International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions|INCOSAI]], the fourteenth triennial convention of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]] (INTOSAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

GAO is a United States government electronic data provider, as all of its reports are available on its [http://www.gao.gov/browse/date/week website], except for certain reports whose distribution is limited to official use in order to protect national and homeland security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The variety of topics reported on range from Federal Budget and Fiscal Issues to Financial Management, Education, Retirement Issues, Defense, Homeland Security, Administration of Justice, Health Care, Information Management and Technology, Natural Resources, Environment, International Affairs, Trade, Financial Markets, Housing, Government Management and Human Capital. GAO often produces highlights of its reports that serve as a [[Congressional Record#Overview|statement for the record]] for various subcommittees of the United States Congress.

Most GAO studies and reports are initiated by requests from members of Congress, including requests mandated in statute, and so reflect concerns of current political import, for example to study the impact of a government-wide hiring freeze.&lt;ref name="GAO_1982"&gt;{{cite report |author=[[Comptroller General of the United States]] |accessdate=January 24, 2017 |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/140/137055.pdf |format=PDF |title=Recent Government-Wide Hiring Freeze Prove Ineffective In Managing Federal Employment  |number=FPCD-82-21 |date=March 10, 1982 |publisher=Government Accountability Office (GOA)}} requested sent to  [[Charles A.

The GAO prepares some 900 reports annually. GAO publishes reports and information relating to, [[Inter alia#inter alia|''inter alia'']]:

===Financial Statements of the U.S. government===
Each year the GAO issues an audit report on the financial statements of the United States Government. The '''2010 Financial Report of the United States Government''' was released on December 21, 2010.&lt;ref name="GaO 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/press/financial_report_2010dec21.html |title=Press Release |publisher=US Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying press release states that the GAO 'cannot render an [[audit opinion|opinion]] on the [[2010 United States federal budget|2010 consolidated financial statements of the federal government]], because of widespread [[materiality (auditing)|material]] internal control weaknesses, significant uncertainties, and other limitations'.&lt;ref name="GaO 2010"/&gt;

===U.S. Public Debt===
As part of its initiative to advocate [[sustainability]], the GAO publishes a Federal Fiscal Outlook Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/fed/recent.html |title=Most Recent Federal Fiscal Outlook Report |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as data relating to the [[US public debt|deficit]].&lt;ref name="deficit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/deficit/ |title=Measuring the Deficit: Cash vs. Accrual |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US deficit is presented on a [[Comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting|cash]] rather than [[accruals]] basis, although the GAO notes that the accrual deficit 'provides more information on the longer-term implications of the government's annual operations'.&lt;ref name="deficit"/&gt;
In [[Fiscal year|FY]] 2010, the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] had a net operating cost of $2,080 billion, although since this includes accounting [[Provision (accounting)|provisions]] (estimates of future liabilities), the cash deficit is $1,294 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/financial/fy2010/10frusg.pdf |title=2010 Financial Report of the United States Government (''vid.'' pp.v, 43) |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quinquennial Strategic Plan===
The most recent GAO plan, for 2010-2015, sets out four goals, namely to address: (1) Current and Emerging Challenges to the Well-being and Financial Security of the American People; (2) Changing Security Threats and the Challenges of Global Interdependence; (3) Transformation of the Federal Government to Address National Challenges; (4) Maximization of the Value of the GAO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10559sp.pdf |title=Strategic Plan: Serving the Congress and the Nation, 2010 –2015 |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS)

The Forensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS) team provides Congress with high-quality forensic audits and investigations of fraud, waste, and abuse; other special investigations; and security and vulnerability assessments. Its work cuts across a diverse array of government programs administered by IRS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Homeland Security, among others.

==GAO and Technology Assessment==

After the closing of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1995, Congress directed GAO to conduct a [[technology assessment]] (TA) pilot program. Between 2002 and 2006, four reports were completed– use of biometrics for border security, cyber security for [[critical infrastructure protection]], technologies for protecting structures in wildland fires, and cargo container security technologies. In the first report, GAO found that while biometrics technologies could be used to secure the border, they had limitations in fingerprinting and facial recognition systems. An immediate impact of the report was a congressional testimony on the use of biometrics which, in turn, helped to inform U.S. national security reform efforts. GAO reports, which are made available to the public, have become essential vehicles for understanding science and technology (S&amp;T) implications of policies considered by the Congress.

Since 2007, Congress has established a permanent TA function within GAO. This new operational role augments GAO’s performance audits related to S&amp;T issues, including effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. federal programs. In 2010, GAO joined [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) as an associate member. In the last three years, GAO has completed TA reports on three topics, the most recent one being released in 2011 – rail security, climate engineering, and alternate neutron detectors. In the climate engineering report, Congress requested GAO to examine three areas: the current S&amp;T state of climate engineering, views of experts on the future of climate engineering research, and potential public responses to climate engineering. When the GAO receives a request to conduct TA, it follows five phases: Acceptance, Planning, Data Gathering and Analysis, Product development and Distribution and Results. Phases one and two include selecting the topic and initiating the TA plan while the other ones are respectively: conducting TA, followed by developing the report and ensuring its accuracy and integrity, and finally receiving feedback from Congress and developing lessons learned to enhance the TA process.

The GAO describes the TA as providing "thorough and balanced analysis of critical technological innovations that affect our society, the environment, and the economy" explaining "the consequences that each featured technology will have on federal agencies and departments, and their wider impacts on American society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/technology_assessment U.S. GAO - Technology Assessment]. Gao.gov. Retrieved on July 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This broad working definition enables GAO analysts to utilize TA as a tool for policy analysis. Technology assessments at GAO are conducted in accordance with GAO’s quality assurance framework.  GAO initiates technology assessments through congressional mandates, requests from congressional leaders, and through the authority of U.S. Comptroller General.

The Technology Assessment section of GAO's website &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/technology_assessment GAO-TA]&lt;/ref&gt; offers the latest TA reports and videos.

==Protocols==
* USDA Should Take Further Action to Reduce Pathogens in Meat and Poultry Products. Why GAO Did This StudyThe U.S. food supply is generally considered safe, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that Salmonella and Campylobacter in food cause about 2 million human illnesses per year in the United States. GAO was asked to review USDA’s approach to reducing pathogens in meat and poultry products. This report examines (1) the extent to which USDA has developed standards for meat and poultry products and (2) any additional steps USDA has taken to address challenges GAO identified in 2014. GAO reviewed relevant regulations, documents, and data and interviewed officials from USDA and CDC, as well as 17 stakeholders representing industry, consumer groups, and researchers selected based on their knowledge of USDA’s meat and poultry slaughter inspections and food safety.What GAO RecommendsGAO is making three recommendations, including that USDA document its process for deciding which products to consider for new standards and that it include information on the effectiveness of on-farm practices in its guidelines for Salmonella control in hogs. USDA agreed with GAO's recommendations and described actions it will take to implement them.
* CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION Additional Actions Are Essential for Assessing Cybersecurity Framework Adoption. Why GAO Did This Study Our nation’s critical infrastructure includes the public and private systems and assets vital to national security, economic stability, and public health and safety. Federal policy identifies 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the financial services, energy, transportation, and communications sectors. To better address cyber- related risks to critical infrastructure, in 2014, NIST developed, as called for by federal law and policy, the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, a voluntary framework of cybersecurity standards and procedures for industry to adopt.The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 included provisions for GAO to review aspects of the cybersecurity standards and procedures in the framework developed by NIST. GAO’s objective was to assess what is known about the extent to which critical infrastructure sectors have adopted the framework. To do so, GAO analyzed documentation, such as sector-specific guidance and tools to facilitate implementation, and interviewed relevant federal and nonfederal officials from the 16 critical infrastructure sectors.What GAO RecommendsGAO is making nine recommendations that methods be developed for determining framework adoption by the sector-specific agencies across their respective sectors, in consultation with their respective sector partner(s), such as the sector coordinating councils, the Department of Homeland Security, and NIST, as appropriate. Five agencies agreed with the recommendations, while four others neither agreed nor disagreed.
* Homeland defenceurgent Need for DOD and FAA to Address Risks and Improve Planning for Technology That Tracks Military Aircraft. Why GAO Did This StudyDOD has until January 1, 2020, to equip its aircraft with ADS-B Out technology that would provide DOD, FAA, and private citizens the ability to track their flights in real-time and track flight patterns over time. This technology is a component of NextGen, a broader FAA initiative that seeks to modernize the current radar- driven, ground-based air transportation system into a satellite-driven space- based system.What GAO RecommendsGAO is recommending that DOD and FAA approve one or more solutions to address ADS-B -related security risks; and that DOD implement key tasks to facilitate consistent, long-term planning and implementation of NextGen. DOD and the Department of Transportation generally concurred and described planned actions to implement the recommendations.

'''Horatio Thomas Whittell''' MD., MRCS. (1826 – 21 August 1899), generally referred to as H. T. Whittell or H. Thomas Whittell, was a medical doctor in South Australia and [[Adelaide]]'s City Coroner.

==Biography==
Whittell was born in [[Warwick]], England, and had a happy childhood. He was educated at one of the private schools in [[Leamington Spa]]. At age nineteen he entered [[Queen's College, Birmingham]], to study medicine and in his spare time read books about legal cases. He received his diploma as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and served some time as house surgeon at Queen's Hospital. He spent ten years practising in Birmingham, then obtained his M.D. degree at Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

He arrived in Adelaide in May 1858 and was soon an active member of the Total Abstinence Society.He had a very busy practice, first operating from his home on [[Grenfell Street, Adelaide|Grenfell Street]], near the Sturt Hotel, then ten years later on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]].
Adelaide experienced an outbreak of [[diphtheria]] around July to September 1859, and Whittell, who had had some experience of an epidemic in England shortly before he left, was kept busy. By a remarkable piece of timing, his booklet on the disease appeared in the bookshops in August that year. He initially had a solo practice, then after the death of Dr. Anton Bayer in 1866, joined his erstwhile partner Dr. [[William Gosse (surgeon)|William Gosse]] (c. 1813–1883) in partnership for about six years then returned to a solo practice.
In 1879, suffering perhaps from overwork, he took on Dr. [[John Davies Thomas|J. Davies Thomas]] (c. 1845–1893) as a partner. At the end of that year he sold the practice to Dr. Thomas, and sought recuperation in an extended trip to Europe. He remained in Europe for two and a half years, and became vitally interested in the recent microbial discoveries and developed a passion for microscopy. He associated with the leading microscopical men at the time when bacteriology was beginning to have a marked effect upon the views of the pathologists in London. He met [[Robert Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur]], the great scientists whose discoveries were attracting worldwide attention, and made a lasting impression on Whittell.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

Whittell succeeded Gosse as President of the Central Board of Health on 20 August 1883, and applied microscopy to the solution of many problems of public sanitation.
In January 1886, as part of a series of retrenchments, he was appointed Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths to replace [[J. F. Cleland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article160749384 |title=Registrar-General Births and Deaths |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |volume=XLIII, |issue=2313 |location=South Australia |date=30 January 1886 |accessdate=28 February 2017 |page=39 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in addition to his Board of Health duties without any addition to his salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197809439 |title=Latest News. |newspaper=[[Evening Journal (Adelaide)|Evening Journal]] |volume=XVIII, |issue=5194 |location=South Australia |date=28 January 1886 |accessdate=5 October 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the (perhaps forced)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108346004 |title=Scratchings in the City |newspaper=[[Kapunda Herald]] |volume=XXIV, |issue=2,112 |location=South Australia |date=9 October 1888 |accessdate=5 October 2017 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; resignation of Thomas Ward (1815 – 28 December 1888) in October 1888, Whittell was appointed City Coroner on top of his duties at the Central Board of Health, and in addition was made Vaccination Officer and Inspector of Anatomy. 
Despite his multiple roles, Whittell was being seriously discussed by Parliament for retrenchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article204463054 |title=House of Assembly |newspaper=[[Evening Journal (Adelaide)|Evening Journal]] |volume=XX, |issue=5938 |location=South Australia |date=24 October 1888 |accessdate=5 October 2017 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages by George Hamilton Ayliffe, son of [[Thomas Hamilton Ayliffe]], in January 1889.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

It was perhaps as City Coroner that Dr. Whittell rendered the greatest official service to the colony. This is a job which on top of medical knowledge is required a great deal of tact and sensitivity, qualities which the obituarist declares, Whittell had in abundance, together with a working knowledge of the law. He was also considerate of witnesses, never allowing an inquest to extend into a second day if it could be dealt with in one.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

He died peacefully after a few months' illness; his remains were buried at the [[West Terrace Cemetery]].
His wife died of [[pneumonia]] a few months later, and his son may have been written out of his will, as the bulk of his estate was inherited by his daughter Anna.

'''''Heaven Can Wait''''' is a 1978 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]]-[[comedy film]] co-directed by [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Buck Henry]] which opens with the central story line of Joe Pendleton (played by [[Warren Beatty]]) being mistakenly taken to heaven by his guardian angel, and the resulting complications of how this mistake can be un-done (given that Joe Pendleton's body is no longer available) providing the basis of the film's plot.  It was the second [[film adaptation]] of [[Harry Segall]]'s play of the same name, being preceded by ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' (1941).

The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]]. The cast reunites Beatty with [[Julie Christie]] and [[Jack Warden]], who also starred together in ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), respectively.

In 2001, a third film adaptation of the play was done, titled ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'', sharing its name with the sequel to 1941's &lt;i&gt;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&lt;/i&gt;.

==Plot==
Joe Pendleton, a backup quarterback for the [[American football]] team [[Los Angeles Rams]], is looking forward to leading his team to the [[Super Bowl]]. While riding his bicycle through the older west side of tunnel one on Kanan-Dume road in Malibu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kanan-Dume road, Malibu, Santa Monica Mountains|url = http://socalregion.com/highways/scenic_drives/scenic-drives-kanan-dume-road/|website = Southern California Regional Rocks and Roads - Celebrating 20 years online!|accessdate = 2016-01-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; an over-anxious guardian angel (known only as The Escort) on his first assignment sees Joe heading into the tunnel, and a large truck heading into the other end of the tunnel towards Joe and his bicycle. The Escort plucks Joe out of his body early, in the mistaken belief that Joe was about to be killed. Pendleton immediately arrives in the afterlife.

Once there, he refuses to believe that his time was up and, upon investigation, the mysterious Mr. Jordan discovers that he is right: he was not destined to die until much later (10:17 am on March 20, 2025, to be exact). Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so a new body must be found. After rejecting several possibilities of men who are about to die, Joe is finally persuaded to accept the body of a millionaire industrialist. Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating gold digger wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover, Farnsworth's personal secretary, Tony Abbott.

Julia and Tony are naturally confused when Leo reappears, alive and well. Leo buys the Los Angeles Rams to lead them to the [[Super Bowl]] as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince, and then secure the aid of, long-time friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with an environmental activist, Betty Logan, who disapproves of the original Farnsworth's policies and actions.

With the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, the characters all face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Farnsworth that he must give up this body as well. Farnsworth resists, but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else and should think of him. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott shoots Farnsworth dead. The Rams are forced to start another quarterback, Tom Jarrett, in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Corkle, he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate each other.

After a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is himself killed. With Mr. Jordan's help, Joe then occupies his final body. He is shown snapping to life in Jarrett's body, then leading the Rams to victory. During the team's post-game celebration, Mr. Jordan seemingly removes Joe's memory of his past life and departs. Joe becomes Tom Jarrett and the cosmic balance is restored. The one left crestfallen is Corkle, who realizes that Jarrett living without any memory of being "Joe", is really the death of Joe in a way. Jarrett bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and Betty appears to recognize something of Joe in this stranger Jarrett.  This is just as earlier in the film Joe had asked Betty to watch for and recognize in a stranger she might meet one day, implying something of Joe still exists even without his memory.

{{Div col end}}
A number of former Los Angeles Rams players have cameo roles in the film, including [[Deacon Jones]], [[Les Josephson]], [[Jack Snow (American football)|Jack Snow]], [[Jim Boeke]] and [[Charley Cowan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CowaCh00.htm |title=Charley Cowan NFL &amp; AFL Football Statistics |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date=1938-06-19 |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the former players, some well-known sportscasters also appear, playing familiar roles. [[Bryant Gumbel]] is seen in the background of one scene on TV, delivering a sportscast. [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Al DeRogatis]] can be heard doing the Super Bowl play-by-play commentary. [[Dick Enberg]] conducts an abortive post-game interview of Joe Pendleton/Tom Jarrett.

Beatty lobbied hard for [[Cary Grant]] to accept the role of Mr. Jordan, going so far as to have Grant's ex-wife, Dyan Cannon, who stars as Julia Farnsworth, urge him to take the part. Although Grant was tempted, he ultimately decided not to end his retirement from filmmaking.

Future game-show host [[Peter Tomarken]] appears as a reporter in the film.

==Production==
Beatty initially wanted [[Muhammad Ali]] to play the central character, but because of Ali's continued commitment to boxing, Beatty changed the character from a boxer to an American football player and played it himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD9ZvZkdYs |title=YouTube |website=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712044054/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD9ZvZkdYs |archivedate=July 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of instrument he played was also changed; in ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'', Pendelton essays "[[The Last Rose of Summer]]" on the alto saxophone, while in the 1978 film he plays "[[Ciribiribin]]" on a soprano sax. The music during the comic training scene with Joe and the servants at the Farnsworth mansion as well as the later training session with the Rams is Handel's Sonata No. 3 in F Major, performed by Paul Brodie (sopranino saxophone) and Antonin Kubalek (piano). The main theme is the song "Heaven Can Wait" performed by [[Dave Grusin]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. [[Neil Diamond]] composed a song entitled "Heaven Can Wait" specifically for the film that he thought would be a good theme song, but Beatty declined to use it. The [[Paul McCartney and Wings]] song "Did We Meet Somewhere Before?" was also considered for as a theme song for the film, but was eventually ruled out. It later appeared in the [[Ramones]] film ''Rock and Roll High School'' (1979).

The Super Bowl game (Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Rams) was filmed during halftime of the San Diego Chargers vs Los Angeles Rams  preseason game at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] on September 1, 1977. (About a year and a half after the film's release, in January 1980, the Rams and Steelers would meet in real life in [[Super Bowl XIV]].)

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site’s critical consensus reads, "A throwback to the high-gloss screwball comedies of the 1940s, ''Heaven Can Wait'' beguiles with seamless production values and great comic relief from Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1009427-heaven_can_wait/#contentReviews|title=Heaven Can Wait (1978)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/heaven-can-wait|title=Heaven Can Wait reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5691">Hertwig's rule or 'long axis rule' states that a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] divides along its long axis. It was introduced by german zoologist [[Oscar Hertwig]] in 1884. The rule emphasizes the cell shape to be a default mechanism of [[spindle apparatus]] orientation. Hertwig's rule predicts [[cell division orientation]], that is important for tissue architecture, cell fate and [[morphogenesis]].

==Discovery==

In Hertwig's experiments the orientation of divisions of the frog egg was studied. Frog egg has a round shape and the first division occur in the random orientation. Hertwig compressed the egg between two parallel plates. The compression forced egg to change its shape from round to elongated. Hertwig noticed that elongated egg divides not randomly, but orthogonal to its long axis. The new daughter cells were formed along the longest axis of the cell. That observation got name of  'Hertwig's rule' or 'long axis rule'.&lt;ref name = "Hertwig1884"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hertwig O | title=Das Problem der Befruchtung und der Isotropie des Eies. Eine Theorie der Vererbung. | journal=Jenaische Zeitschrift fur Naturwissenschaft | volume=18 | pages=274 | year=1884  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confirmation and Mechanism==
[[File:TCJ orients spindle apparatus during cell division.png|thumb|Cartoon of the dividing epithelium cell surrounded by epithelium tissue. Spindle apparatus rotates inside the cell. The rotation is a result of astral microtubules pulling towards tri-cellular-junctions (TCJ), signaling centers localized at the regions where three cells meet.]]
Recent studies in animal and plant systems support the 'long axis rule'. The studied systems include the mouse embryo,&lt;ref name = "Grey2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Gray D, Plusa B, Piotrowska K, Ha J, Glower D, Zernicka-Goetz M | title=First cleavage of the mouse embryo responds to change in egg shape at fertilization | journal=Current Biology | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=397–405 | year=2004 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.031| pmid=15028215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drosophila epithelium,&lt;ref name = "Bosveld2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bosveld F, Markova O, Guirao B, Martin C, Wang Z, Pierre A, Balakireva M, Gaugue I, Ainslie A, Christophorou N, Lubensky DK, Minc N, Bellaïche Y | title=Epithelial tricellular junctions act as interphase cell shape sensors to orient mitosis | journal=Nature | volume=530 | issue=7591 | pages=496–8 | year=2016 | pmid=26886796 | pmc=5450930 | doi=10.1038/nature16970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenopus blastomeres (Strauss 2006), MCDK cell monolayers &lt;ref name = "Wyatt2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Wyatt T, Harris A, Lam M, Cheng Q, Bellis J, Dimitracopoulos A, Kabla A, Charras G, Baumm B| title=Emergence of homeostatic epithelial packing and stress dissipation through divisions oriented along the long cell axis | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=112 | issue=18 | pages=5726–5731  | year=2015 |  doi= 10.1073/pnas.1420585112 | pmid=25908119 | pmc=4426437}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plants (Gibson et al., 2011).
The mechanism of the 'long axis rule' relies on interphase cell long axis sensing. However, during division many animal cell types undergo cell rounding, causing the long axis to disappear as the cell becomes round. It is at this rounding stage that the decision on the orientation of the cell division is made by the spindle apparatus. The spindle apparatus then rotates in the round cell and after several minutes the spindle position is stabilised preferentially along the interphase cell long axis. The cell then divides along the spindle apparatus orientation. The first insights into how cells could remember their long axis came from studies on the Drosophila epithelium. The study indicates [[Cell junction#Tricellular junctions (TCJ)]] participation in determining the spindle orientation. TCJ localized at the regions where three or more cells meet. As cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks. The orientation of TCJ remains stable, independent of the shape changes associated with cell rounding. The position of TCJ encode information about interphase cell shape anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell.&lt;ref name="Bosveld2016"/&gt; However this study is limited to only one type of epithelia in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and has not been shown to be true in other epithelial types.

==Mechanobiology==
It has been shown that mechanical force can cause cells to divide against their long axis and instead with the direction of mechanical stretch in MDCK monolayers. &lt;ref name = "Hart2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Kevin C.|last2=Tan|first2=Jiongyi|last3=Siemers|first3=Kathleen A.|last4=Sim|first4=Joo Yong|last5=Pruitt|first5=Beth L.|last6=Nelson|first6=W. James|last7=Gloerich|first7=Martijn|title=E-cadherin and LGN align epithelial cell divisions with tissue tension independently of cell shape|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=18 July 2017|volume=114|issue=29|pages=E5845–E5853|doi=10.1073/pnas.1701703114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==

Cell divisions along 'long axis' are proposed to be implicated in the morphogenesis, tissue response to stresses and tissue architecture.
Division along the long cell axis reduces global tissue stress more rapidly than random divisions or divisions along the axis of mechanical stress. Long-axis division contributes to the formation of isotropic cell shapes within the monolayer.

The '''Hosay massacre''' (also known as the '''Hosay riots'''  or the '''Jahaji massacre''') took place on Thursday 30 October 1884 in [[San Fernando, Trinidad]] when the British colonial authorities fired on participants in the annual [[Hosay]] procession (the local name for the [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] [[Remembrance of Muharram|Festival of Muharram]]) who had been banned from entering the town.

==Background==
After the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|emancipation of slaves in the British Empire]], the plantation owners of Trinidad were desperate for new sources of labour. In 1839 the British government began a programme of recruiting Indian labourers in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to be sent to [[Trinidad]]. They bound themselves to work as indentured labourers for a set number of years on the plantations. The mostly Hindu and Muslim labourers were required to work seven and a half hours a day, six days a week for three years, receiving about 13 cents{{clarify|date=March 2014|cents of which currency?}} a day for their work. At first, half of the recruits were women but, in 1840, the proportion was reduced to a third of the number of men. In 1844, the period of indenture was extended to five years with a guarantee that, if they wished, they would get a free passage home at the end of their service. In 1853 the law was again amended to allow the indentured labourers to re-indenture themselves for a second five-year term or, if they wished, to commute any portion of their contract by repayment of a proportionate part of their indenture fee.

Industrial unrest on the plantations was gaining momentum to be followed by a deepening depression in the sugar industry in 1884. This atmosphere was also fuelled by frequent strikes. In the previous year, met with restrictions on the use of torches the African community celebrating ‘[[Canboulay]]’ reacted and this resulted in violence.

The decision by the authorities to prohibit the Indians from entering the towns with their processions, which began, on the estates ‘were regarded by the Indians as an arbitrary and unjust measure’. The Indians protested with a petition led by the Hindu Sookhoo and 31 others.

On 26 October Administrator John Bushe consulted the Executive Council on ‘the final arrangements to be made for preserving order during the Hosea’. Acting Colonial Secretary, Mr. Pyne informed the Inspector Commandant of Police, Captain Baker instructing him on the 'deployment of police, marines, from the HMS Dido, and a volunteer force'. 27 October – Capt Baker personally monitors the situation. The next day Baker reports that the Indians would make no attempt to enter San Fernando. In a series of telegrams Baker attempts to avoid an armed confrontation with the Indians, however Mr. Pyne appeared bent on such a confrontation to show the Indians who was in charge. (Shantal Ramnarine)

==Events of 30 October 1884==
At midday the first procession of 6,000 was sighted approaching San Fernando reaching Cross Crossing about 2:30 pm and proceeded along to the entrance of Cipero Street. There the Indians met by British troops under Major Bowles of the [[First North Staffordshire Regiment]]. The local magistrate, a Mr. Child, read the [[Riot Act]] and when the crowd failed to disperse, Child ordered the police to fire upon the unarmed Indians. Two volleys were fired into the crowd.

At the Mon Repos Junction of the Princes Town and Circular roads a similar fate was to meet the Indians there.{{clarify|date=March 2014|same procession?}} The procession was in sight about 3:30 pm. Captain Baker gave the order to fire a single volley of bullets after the Riot Act was read.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">'''Hyman Schorenstein''' (died February 3, 1953) was a Brooklyn Democratic leader who dominated Brooklyn politics for three decades beginning in the late 1910s. He influenced [[Meade Esposito]], a Democratic party fixer.&lt;ref name="nyti_‘Hi,"&gt;{{Cite web| title = ‘Hi, boss,’ said the judge to Meade Esposito| last = Hertzberg | first = Hendrik| work = The New York Times| date = 10 December 1972| accessdate = 2018-03-10| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/10/archives/-hi-boss-said-the-judge-to-meade-esposito-the-powerful-kings-county.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schorenstein immigrated from Poland in the late 1800s. He took control of politics in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]] and was voted into office representing the Democratic Party. He led the effort to oppose socialists who were against United States involvement in [[World War I]]. Schorenstein became the first Jewish Democratic District leader. He was able to impress the Irish [[political machine]] and was appointed an election district captain at the age of 20. He offered local residents favors for their votes. One story alleged he gave 10 boots to a family of fisherman promising they would arrive after the election.&lt;ref name="Pritchett2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendell E.

In 1928, Schorenstein was credited with stopping an eleventh-hour revolt in the Ohio delegation. He guaranteed Governor [[Al Smith]] of New York the nomination for president.&lt;ref name="Pritchett2003"/&gt;

Schorenstein's illiteracy was well known. Schorenstein political rival’s challenge him to his literacy in 1933 when Schorenstein was Brooklyn's commissioner of records. The rival asked "can you read or write English?" to which Schorenstein replied "that’s my own personal business". Milton S. Gould, Schorenstein's friend who was a lawyer said, "there was one tragic flaw in the effulgent personality of this municipal monarch: He was illiterate."&lt;ref name="nyti_AnOl"/&gt;

After dominating local politics for three decades, Schorenstein was voted out of office largely due to the Italian mafia sending hundreds of associates to illegally vote against him in his district.&lt;ref name="Summer2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Graham Summer|title=East Side-West Side: Organizing Crime in New York, 1930-50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJcuDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT287|date=28 July 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-31258-5|pages=287–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Killer Croc''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Killer Croc belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]].

The character has a rare genetic condition giving him a [[crocodilia]]n appearance. Killer Croc's real name is '''Waylon Jones''', a [[sideshow]] wrestler who developed into a dangerous and animalistic criminal in [[Gotham City]]. Killer Croc appears in the fifth volume of the ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' comic series, in which he is a recurring member of the team and a romantic interest of [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]].&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #20. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

The character has been adapted into various media featuring Batman, including animated TV series, film, video games, and novels. [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] portrayed Killer Croc in the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

==Publication history==
Killer Croc was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gene Colan]]. The character made cameo appearances in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #523 (February 1983) and ''[[Batman]]'' #357 (March 1983), with his full first appearance in Detective Comics #524 (March 1983).

==Fictional character biography==
The character's real name is '''Waylon Jones''', born with a form of [[atavism]] that imparted him with reptilian traits. He was raised by his aunt, an abusive alcoholic who called him names like "lizardboy" and "reptilian freak".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulpinterest.com/entertainment/movies/5-batman-villains-yet-see-movies/ |title=5 Batman Villains We Have Yet To See In The Movies |publisher=Pulpinterest.com |date=2014-02-05 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croc eventually killed his aunt and became a criminal in [[Gotham City]]. After committing several murders, he faced off against Batman and the new Robin, [[Jason Todd]], who defeated him.

In these original, [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] appearances, Killer Croc resembled a powerfully built man covered entirely in green scales, but was still basically human in his facial proportions and build. He was also originally depicted as killing Jason Todd's parents (this was later [[retcon]]ned to make [[Two-Face]] their murderer). His appearance and personality have become increasingly bestial, explained in the comics that his disease has slowly robbed him of all identifiable human traits. In his most recent appearances, he has an elongated snout and tail.

===Post-Crisis===
Killer Croc escaped custody and began living with a group of homeless people and committed thefts in Gotham City to support his new family. Batman tracked him down and Croc went into a homicidal rage. When new water tunnels were built, which would flood Killer Croc's new home, Croc seemingly sacrificed himself to hold the water back when they finally were open.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #471&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, Croc was buried under rubble and was freed from his prison by storm drains. Killer Croc survived on rats and was isolated for months, driving him further into madness. Croc went on a rampage after a confrontation with a vagrant and Croc wound up in a shopping mall. After delivering several blows to Croc, Batman is distracted by a glimpse of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. Croc then grabs Batman and tries to break his back. He fails, and Bane pits himself against Croc, breaking his arms. He is then put back into [[Arkham Asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #489&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bane breaks the inmates out of Arkham Asylum in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' saga, Croc attempts to get revenge on Bane. While in the sewers, he smells Bane and goes after him and the two fight each other atop a ledge. Bane casually breaks one of Croc's arms again, but Croc keeps fighting until the ledge they are standing on breaks and the two fall into the sewers. The fight ends up as a draw. Croc later returns, attacking the docks to try and lure Robin out, but is defeated by [[Dick Grayson]] (now acting as Batman after Bruce defeated [[Azrael (comics)#Jean-Paul Valley|Valley]] before taking time off for self-analysis) without realizing that he is facing a new Batman. Killer Croc is left for the police in a fishing net.

In a storyline that ran in ''Batman'' #521 and #522, Croc is summoned by a [[paranormal]] force to break out of Arkham and make his way to the [[Louisiana]] swamps. Batman follows him there, only to find that the mysterious force is actually [[Swamp Thing]], who offers Croc a place in the swampland where he can finally give in to his animal side and live free from human persecution.

Killer Croc has appeared in both the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline and its chronological follow up, ''[[Broken City (comics)|Broken City]]''. In the former, he is infected with a [[virus]] that greatly increases the rate of his devolution, 'overseeing' a kidnapping for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] before Batman defeats him; this provides Batman's first clue that someone else is orchestrating events, as he knows that Croc is too stupid to attempt a complex scheme like a kidnapping. Though Killer Croc was briefly restored to his original form [[The Mad Hatter]], under [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s orders, implanted Killer Croc with a device that made him loyal to Black Mask and caused the virus to return. Batman freed Croc from Black Mask's control. Croc attempted to take revenge on the Mad Hatter but was stopped by Batman and Croc escaped.

In 2005's ''Detective Comics'' #810, Killer Croc attempts to cure his condition. When the doctor fails, Croc devours her and retreats to the sewers, vowing vengeance on Batman and Black Mask.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Croc becomes a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

[[One Year Later]] during the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline, Killer Croc is shown to have been feeding on the dead body of [[Orca (comics)|Orca]].&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #819&lt;/ref&gt; He next shows up in ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' where he breaks free from his shackles in Arkham Asylum and attempts to kill [[Jimmy Olsen]], who uses elastic powers to escape. Killer Croc is then subdued.&lt;ref&gt;''Countdown'' #50&lt;/ref&gt;

He is later seen among the exiled supervillains in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. After the [[Martian Manhunter]] is defeated and imprisoned in a fiery cage, Croc suggests that he eats him. [[Lex Luthor]] forbids it however.

During the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, Killer Croc can be seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Universe'' #0&lt;/ref&gt; Killer Croc is later turned into a [[Justifiers|Justifier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]'' storyline, Killer Croc is recruited by a new [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to be a part of a group of villains aiming to take over Gotham.

During the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', Killer Croc is accidentally released from his cell by a guard whom Osiris kills when [[Deathstroke]] and his band of Titans infiltrate Arkham. While attempting to flee from the facility, he is attacked by [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]] who mistakes Killer Croc for his old enemy [[Sobek (comics)|Sobek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' (vol. 2) #28&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In the continuity of DC's 2011 reboot [[The New 52]], Killer Croc is established to have fought [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] in Hell's Kitchen in a flashback seen in ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' #3. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He is then passingly referenced by Roy as he is Roy's current sponsor for his [[alcoholism]] at the time when Roy was in a bar with [[Jason Todd]]. Roy is only drinking water, but knows Waylon would disapprove.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #4. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2013–2014 "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline Croc began ruling over Gotham's lower class. He murders a corrupt S.W.A.T. team that murdered one of the few people who were nice to him. When the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicated]] invades Earth, Croc takes over Wayne Tower. He is confronted by the villain Bane, who injects Croc with Venom, turning Croc into a hulking giant, whom Bane then defeats.{{issue|date=September 2016}}

While institutionalized in Arkham, Killer Croc meets Sybil Silverlock, a woman with [[dual-personality disorder]]. He bonds with her softer personality, and she shows him a picture of her daughter, Olive. Sybil has him promise to look after Olive if he ever gets out.&lt;ref name=GothamAcademy6&gt;''Gotham Academy'' #6. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After the destruction of Arkham Asylum,&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Eternal'' #29. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Killer Croc escapes and travels to Gotham Academy, where he watches over Olive, and tells her about her mother, who was rendered comatose by the Asylum's destruction. Batman confronts them, Olive and Killer Croc escape to a swamp. Before parting, he tells her that if she is like her mother, to come and find him one day.&lt;ref name=GothamAcademy6/&gt;

He recently helped Harley Quinn and her friends fight a gang of other Batman villains in Coney Island.

===DC Rebirth===
In DC's 2016 relaunch of its books, [[DC Rebirth]], Killer Croc appears as one of the many villains attempting to kill Batman to stop Two-Face from leaking secret information. He attacks Batman on a train alongside Amygdala and King Shark.&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Batman'' #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pages of Suicide Squad, Killer Croc and the Squad go on a mission to retrieve a "cosmic item" from a Russian undersea prison, revealed to be a portal to the Phantom Zone, and come face-to-face with General Zod. He attacks the Squad and, when spotting Zod about to kill June Moone/Enchantress, Croc saves her just in time. After the mission, back in their cells, June Moone and Croc have a heartfelt conversation and embrace each other. Killer Croc and June Moone enjoy New York City exploit their romance in the future.  Croc encourages her to try, but later expresses fear and shed tears that he will lose her if she is able to achieve her dream. Enchantress rampage in New York City until  It is revealed that it is an editor from a magazine company who rejected June. After being convinced by Croc to reevaluate her, he decided to give her some freelance work. Moved by Waylon's actions, June reigns in the Enchantress and thanks her love for helping her.

In Harley Quinn's series Killer Croc joined the Penguin's plans to take over New York, but went off on his own to take Coney Island, revealing that he was on display there in a freak show as a kid driving out the other villains. After it was all torn down Harley convinced him to join her side and help take it all back from Penguin.

==Powers and abilities==
Killer Croc's backstory explains that he was born with a condition resembling [[epidermolytic hyperkeratosis]], a disfiguring skin disorder. However, it is actually a form of regressive [[atavism]], meaning that he has inherited traits of ancestral species of the human race such as [[reptile]]s. This condition has been augmented by the presence of a [[metahuman|metagene]]. Consequently, he has several extraordinary physical abilities relating to his endurance, speed, and strength, making him able to lift up to two tons.

His skin is hardened to the degree that it is nearly impenetrable to ordinary forms of [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]] including high caliber weapons fired from a distance. He also possesses an extraordinary super strength; for example, he was able to tear a bank vault door off of its hinges with minimal effort. He has demonstrated regenerative powers allowing him to heal and restore lost limbs and teeth. He possesses superhuman reflexes and speed, especially while he is moving underwater. Killer Croc also has an enhanced sense of smell. Once he has become familiar with a person's scent he can track them from miles away. As his appearance and personality has grown more and more bestial, his misanthropy has increased dramatically. He is jealous and hateful of "normal" people and often lashes out violently without provocation. As a result of these feelings of jealousy, Croc will often entertain himself by grabbing hold of small, pointy objects as a source of comfort.

Croc's main weakness is consistently portrayed in most adaptations, aside from ''The Batman'' series, as being his low intellect. He typically resorts to brute force to solve most problems, allowing Batman to outmaneuver him in combat by thinking his way through the problems he faces in defeating the powerful Croc. Batman regularly describes his foe as an animal rather than a man. He acts almost solely on instinct and hardly ever takes the time to plan or rationalize his actions.

==Character redesign==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
In recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. An [[action figure]] made by [[Kenner]] in 1998 featured a tail and [[dinosaur]]-like feet. When [[Mattel]] got the license to make DC products in the early 2000s, they released their own version of Killer Croc, sculpted by [[Four Horsemen Studios]]. This version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet. In late 2005, a re-release of this figure was modified so that the tail, along with his shirt, was removed. This version also sports a more "human" head.

The 2002-2003 ''Batman'' storyline ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' featured a more bestial Croc who had been [[mutation|mutated]] against his will to appear more reptilian. This version of the character was drawn by artist [[Jim Lee]].

In The New 52, he is shown to have a crocodile-like head, though how this came to be has not yet been revealed. Such a design had previously appeared in ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' drawn by [[Kenneth Rocafort]].

==Other versions==
===Joker===
In the non-canon graphic novel, ''[[Joker (graphic novel)|Joker]]'', written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and artist [[Lee Bermejo]], Croc is portrayed as a large, muscular black man with a scaly skin condition. Of all his previous designs, this is the most human, without a snout, tail, or claws. The book hints that Croc enjoys [[cannibalism|feeding on human flesh]], with the story's narrator remarking that Croc "has a certain... eccentric way with evidence". Croc is shown leading a gang of [[wikt:thug|thug]]s, and later becomes a high-level member of Joker's newly formed gang. This vision of the character is not unlike the one from Azzarello's previous work on Batman, ''[[Broken City (comics)|Broken City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Joker''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batman Beyond===
In the ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' comic, Killer Croc is mentioned as being a prisoner in a [[Cadmus Labs]] facility; his cell is briefly attacked by the new [[Hush (comics)#Batman Beyond|Hush]], a clone of Dick Grayson, when Hush escapes the facility before he decides to simply leave. Another Cadmus official later contemplates releasing Croc to lure Hush out, but [[Amanda Waller]] dismisses the idea due to the potential for collateral damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Beyond'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batman/Aliens===
In the crossover ''[[Batman/Aliens#Book Two|Batman/Aliens 2]]'', Killer Croc is part of an experiment by the twisted black ops officer Doctor Fortune to create hybrid soldiers using DNA from the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|aliens]] and the DNA of some of Batman's villains, hoping to harness the villains' genetic traits for survival without their psychological trauma. However, her use of Croc proves to be her undoing as Batman notes that Croc turned to villainy because he was naturally ruthless rather than being subject to any sort of trauma, resulting in the Croc/Alien hybrid tearing Fortune's head off before Batman manages to drown it after destroying her offshore base.

===Batman: Crimson Mist===
In ''Batman: Crimson Mist'', Killer Croc begins as a rumoured serial killer stalking Gotham's sewers, later joining [[Two-Face]]'s gang as the muscle. Faced with the threat of the vampire Batman stalking and killing his opponents, Killer Croc and Two-Face form an alliance with [[James Gordon (comics)#Vampire Batman|Commissioner Gordon]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth#Other continuities|Alfred Pennyworth]] to trap Batman in the [[Batcave]] and expose him to the sunlight (although Croc briefly contemplated just physically tearing Batman apart himself before the others pointed out that he was too fast for Croc, the vampire Batman proving more than a match for him physically when they did engage in close-quarter combat despite his withered physical condition). Although Croc and Two-Face attempt to kill Gordon and Alfred when Batman is believed dead, Alfred is able to help his old master recover by sacrificing his life and blood to give Batman the strength to stop Gotham's last criminals. With Alfred's sacrifice, Batman impales Croc with a stalactite, commenting that Croc can keep his cold blood thanks to Alfred's sacrifice having sated his appetite for the moment.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Crimson Mist''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the 2011 "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, Killer Croc kidnapped the people of Gotham and imprisoned them in the sewer. Batman then arrived and attacked Killer Croc. Killer Croc was about to strike back at Batman, but Batman stabbed him in the head with his own machete. Batman rescued the people that Killer Croc had imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Batman - Knight of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batman: Earth One===
In the second volume of ''[[Batman: Earth One]]'' series, in contrast with the mainstream continuity's version, Waylon Jones appears benign and is not a cannibal, and is dubbed "Killer Croc" by the media due to his ichthyosis condition. His mother sold him to the [[Haly's Circus]] when he was a child, and forced to perform there until he escapes. Jones hides in Gotham’s sewer system out of fear of the society’s discriminations over his genetic disorder. He helps Batman locate the Riddler’s underground hideout, and later aids his fight against the villain. Batman offers Jones a place in Wayne Manor in addition to help him find a cure for his condition, and asking his help in finding a location to establish his [[Batcave|own hideout]] after his experience at the Riddler’s.

===Injustice: Gods Among Us===
Killer Croc appears in the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' prequel comic, he observes the argument between the heroes in silence until [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] angrily attacks Batman after discovering the virus he had uploaded into him during their first meeting, with Croc commenting that as "pretty evil". When [[Harley Quinn]] releases all the inmates to attack the heroes, Croc goes straight for Batman, preventing the Dark Knight from coming to his son Robin's aid as he's dragged underground by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Croc is next seen holding Batman down while the [[Riddler]] prepares to crush his skull with a large rock. Riddler is knocked out by [[Green Arrow]] and Croc is dispatched with a headbutt from Batman. In the prequel to ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Croc is now a member of the Suicide Squad. When the Squad is taken over by Ra's, he and [[Orca (comics)|Orca]] are used as his heavy hitters for his global conquest. He later marries Orca after she becomes pregnant with his child.

===Batman '66===
''[[Batman '66]]'' features a version of Killer Croc in the reality of the [[Batman (TV series)|1966 television series]]. This version of Waylon Jones was a henchman of King Tut and drank an elixir that transformed him into the reptilian monster Killer Croc. He uses his newfound strength to commit various crimes in Gotham. Batman and Robin interrogate his girlfriend Eva and find out she's in on his plan to become Gotham's biggest crime lord. They chase him down into the sewer where they defeat Croc and hand him over to the police.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman '66'' #28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiny Titans===
Killer Croc was a recurring character in the children's series ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' renamed "Kroc." He was often depicted causing trouble showing up, and his rude and messy actions were often compared to the cleanliness and tidiness of Alfred.

===DC Bombshells===
In the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity, Killer Croc resides in the Belle Reeve Manor House in the bayous of Louisiana with the Coven ([[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], and [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]]), all of which he used to date at one point. The four occasionally helps others in nearby towns using potions and poisons for those who have been harmed by men. When Francine Charles comes with an offer from Amanda Waller, he agrees to help her convince the Coven to take Waller up on her offer. The four and Francine eventually form Waller's Suicide Squad. This version was formerly a handsome young man who was transformed into a crocodile monster from the Enchantress' magic.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Bombshells Annual #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles===
Killer Croc appears trying to steal the Batmobile to make a profit, but goes through the sewers where the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] attack and defeat him after he unknowingly invades their lair.

===Batman: White Knight===
Killer Croc appears in the 2017 series [[Batman: White Knight]] (which, though unconfirmed, appears to be heavily inspired by [[Batman: The Animated Series]]). Croc, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a [[Joker (character)|Joker]] who had been force fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from [[Clayface|Clayface’s]] body. This was done so that Napier, who was using [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter’s]] technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Croc and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of [[Gotham City|Gotham’s]] poorer districts.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:KillerCrocBatmanTAS.jpg|thumb|Killer Croc in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Killer Croc appears in several television series in the DCAU:
** The character first appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]]. '''"Killer Croc" Morgan''' is a former [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]] who turned to crime. In this series, he is given lumpy gray skin, as opposed to the normal green. He first appears in "Vendetta", where he tries to exact his revenge on the ones responsible for his imprisonment, including Detective Harvey Bullock. However, he is ultimately stopped by Batman. Croc later appears in "Sideshow", where he escapes a train prison transport and ventures into the mountains. There, he stumbles upon a group of former sideshow attractions, who take him in due to Croc being a "freak show" as well. But Batman follows his trail and tracks him down, eventually apprehending him once again. In "[[Almost Got 'Im]]", Killer Croc is revealed to be a member of the villains' poker game, consisting of Poison Ivy, Penguin, Two-Face and Joker. He tells a story of throwing a rock at Batman as his closest scheme to killing Batman, defending the scheme with "it was a big rock". This Croc is revealed ultimately to be Batman in disguise. In "Trial", the villains at Arkham Asylum arrange their own trial for Batman's "crimes" against them, and Killer Croc was assigned to guard Batman, although the latter still managed to escape. In "Bane", Croc and his gang pull a heist, but are confronted by Batman and Robin. As Croc makes his getaway in the sewers however, he is ambushed and subdued by the supervillain Bane, before being brought back to prison. 
** Killer Croc returns in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', now voiced by Brooks Gardner. He, along with the other characters, has been revamped, now featuring a bulkier build with green scales and skin, making him look even more reptilian. In the episode "Love is a Croc", he breaks out of a Gotham courthouse after his trial for first-degree murder, and attempts to escape, until he is confronted and subdued by Batman. The criminal Baby Doll later breaks him out of a prison escort, and the two subsequently form an alliance and retreat to Croc's hideout in the sewers. They then start committing crimes together, coming to be known as Gotham's "Bonnie and Clyde". But even though Baby Doll falls in love with him, she overhears Croc boasting about manipulating her to achieve his own ends. Enraged, she tricks him into thinking that they planned to hold the city ransom by threatening to blow up a nuclear power plant. In reality, Baby Doll's goal was to overload the reactor and kill herself, Croc, and all of Gotham. However, Batman and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] arrive, and they manage to prevent the reactor from reaching critical mass. Croc then pursues Baby Doll and prepares to kill her, only to be stopped by the Dark Knight. As Croc and Batman fight, the villain is injured and knocked out when he reached for hot water pipes. He makes his final appearance in the episode "Judgment Day" where he is seen trying to get [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] to fence stolen jewels. A villain known as the [[Two-Face|Judge]] attacks and defeats him by throwing him off the top of the bridge. Batman manages to rescue Killer Croc.
** In the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' episode "Terry's Friend Dates a Robot", an android replica of Killer Croc battles the new [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] in a simulation. Writer San Berkowitz originally had plans to bring back Croc for the show as reptiles have long-life spans, implying that Croc could still be active after 50 years, but the idea was dropped due some reason.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/beyond/backstage/interviews/berkowitz.php&lt;/ref&gt; Albeit the character doesn't physically appeared in the series, when asked about Croc's fate, show's creator [[Paul Dini]] stated that Croc was stuffed and mounted on exhibition in the reptile wing of the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;''ToyFare'' issue, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]. In this version, Croc is even more reptilian and crocodile-like than past versions and has a tail, although he also demonstrates a greater intellect and is much more sane and non-cannibalistic than traditional interpretations of the character due to his plan to steal money by flooding downtown Gotham by reversing pumps designed to drain Gotham canals in times of flooding. He appears to be much stronger than Batman, and much like a crocodile, he's able to stay underwater for long periods of time. His origins are mostly unknown, with Croc providing little evidence about his past beyond his [[Cajun]] accent, although one of his henchmen tells Batman that there are different rumors: That he is a [[gene]]tic experiment gone awry who then turned mercenary, that he deals with the wrong kind of voodoo magic in the swamps, or that he is simply a circus freak (it is never explained which, if any, story is true). He recruits three criminals (two of whom are referred to in the credits as Vic and Freddy) as henchmen to help him flood Gotham City. He has two pet crocodiles that he can command. Batman later deprived him of his air supply enough to be taken down and left for the police to arrest him and his henchman (remarking that "''Crocs may like water but they're no fish''"). In "Team Penguin", Killer Croc returns as part of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s Team Penguin (which also consisted of Firefly, Killer Moth, and Ragdoll). Killer Croc is defeated when Batman freezes the water he was in. In "Rumors", Killer Croc and his henchmen later appear as one of the captive victims of Rumor after he ambushed him and his henchmen in their hideout. In "The End of the Batman", Killer Croc, Penguin, [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], and [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] team up to commit a crime spree now that they are under the protection of the vigilante [[Wrath (comics)|Wrath]].
* Killer Croc appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Night of the Batmen" voiced by [[Stephen Root]]. He, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] try to steal a gigantic gold statue only to be stopped by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] dressed as Batman.
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[Beware The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Wade Williams]] in a Cajun accent. In "Animal", Killer Croc is depicted as the kingpin inside [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]. When he hears that [[Key (comics)|Key]] is imprisoned with the data of a powerful computer code worth billions and Batman himself is imprisoned alongside him, he orders his men to create a riot inside Blackgate to deal with the two himself. Killer Croc challenges Batman to a fight in an underground arena, brutally beating him in the process. Batman snaps and attacks the softer skin underneath Killer Croc, nearly beating him to death before [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] stops him. Batman, Katana, and Key escape when the police break up the riot. Killer Croc is shown escaping Blackgate into the sewers, declaring them as his new home. In "Choices", Killer Croc lays a trap for Batman and Katana, trapping them in concrete in the middle of a subway track, and patrolling the area to prevent any rescue. [[Barbara Gordon]] arrives at the subway station to help them hack into the computers as Oracle and re-direct the train routes to stall them until [[Alfred Pennyworth]] could rescue them. Killer Croc catches Barbara and nearly eats her before Batman and Katana break free. Batman defeats Killer Croc by pushing him near an oncoming train, which launches Croc near a wall and knocks him out.
* Killer Croc appeared on ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].

===Film===
* Killer Croc appears in the ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' segment "In Darkness Dwells". Unlike the comics, Croc doesn't speak but instead growls with stock sound effects by [[Frank Welker]]. During the segment, it is mentioned by James Gordon that this version is [[Fear of bats|afraid of bats]]. In this version, Waylon Jones is a [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]]. The [[urban legend]] in the segment goes that he was an infant born with the disfiguring skin disorder [[epidermolytic hyperkeratosis]] and that his mother abandoned him in the sewers of [[Gotham City]]. As an adult, he files his front teeth into points to compliment the reptilian appearance of his skin and becomes a circus [[sideshow]] performer. Later, now called Killer Croc, he goes on a killing spree that eventually lands him in Arkham Asylum. There, his homicidal impulses intensify during treatment by [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]] as he experimented on Killer Croc in his fear aversion therapy program. Croc escapes from Arkham and flees to the sewers along with Crane (now known as The Scarecrow) and a handful of escaped Arkham inmates. There, Scarecrow performed another experiment on Croc by injecting his fear toxin into parts of his body. When Scarecrow orchestrates the [[kidnapping]] of Cardinal O'Fallon, Croc infiltrates the church and carries him down into the sewers. Batman comes to investigate, but Croc ambushes him, biting and infecting Batman with the fear toxin that is coursing through Croc's own body. After a lengthy battle, Batman fends off Croc by shoving a [[grenade]] into his mouth. Croc is not seen since.
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[Son of Batman]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. In this version, he was using a genetic mutagen, that he referred to as steroids, to increase his already fearsome abilities which included extra muscle mass and a crocodile-like tail. He gains the upper hand at one point, but is subdued thanks to [[Talia al Ghul]] and is taken to Arkham Asylum where withdrawal from the Mutagen is causing his body to slowly fall apart. Regardless, Arkham's staff refuse to treat him because of the personal risk to their health. Batman agrees to save Killer Croc if he gives up the location of his Mutagen supplier [[Man-Bat|Kirk Langstrom]]. Killer Croc at first refuses to talk, but changes his mind when Batman singlehandedly forces him to talk by ripping off his damaged tail.
* Killer Croc appears in the animated film ''[[Batman Unlimited: Animal Instincts]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. He appears as a member of [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin's]] Animalitia where he is sporting a metal lower jaw.
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants]]'' with DiMaggio reprising his role. Sometime prior to the film, Killer Croc ratted Bane out to the GPD causing the two to develop a rivalry. Killer Croc, [[Clayface]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], and [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] are freed from Arkham Asylum by [[Mr. Freeze]] and [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]. Killer Croc winds up the test subject to a serum which turns him into a [[Godzilla]]-esque kaiju. Killer Croc is eventually defeated by Batman and Croc returned to his original size.
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', voiced by the film's editor [[Matt Villa]] who was uncredited for the role. He is among the villains that assist Joker in attacking Gotham City. Killer Croc starts Joker's bomb and jokingly states that "he did something" (this comment was due to doing nothing relative to the plot in ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'').
[[File:Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).jpg|thumb|upright|Killer Croc makes his live action debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]], portrayed by [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]].]]
* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] portrayed Killer Croc in the 2016 feature film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', making it Killer Croc's first live-action appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/adewale-akinnuoye-agbaje-to-play-killer-croc-in-wbs-suicide-squad-exclusive/ |title=Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje to Play Killer Croc in WB’s ‘Suicide Squad’ (Exclusive) |publisher=[[TheWrap]] |date=March 31, 2015 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned that he once lived in Gotham and fought against Batman until he departed to find somewhere to belong, eventually being driven to cannibalism by the abuse he suffered at the hands of Gotham's citizens. When he is recruited to Task Force X, he is initially as reluctant as the others, but eventually decides to work with Colonel [[Rick Flag]] even after Flag gives them a chance to leave, accompanying a SEAL scuba team to recover a bomb that was lost in a flooded underground tunnel to destroy [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]]. At the film's conclusion, Croc remains in jail, but has ten years shaved off his sentence and is provided with drinks and a television set with [[BET]] as he requested, in his cell.
* Killer Croc appears in the film ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]]. He's shown to have captured [[Jimmy Olsen]] with a machine for taking his picture of his "bad side" until [[Superman]] and [[Plastic Man]] show up to save him. Plastic Man turns into a buzz saw to stop Croc, but Superman gets his cape caught on the saw sending him flying into the machine &amp; get stuck in it. But then, [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]] comes to defeat Croc—trapping him in his own machine and rescuing Olsen making Croc the second of the many villains that Reverse-Flash captures to win the hearts of the citizens. Croc later appears toward the end of the film when Reverse-Flash is taken to jail where he walks up behind Reverse-Flash and threatens him. He looks nothing like his [[Lego Batman]] design.

===Video games===
====Lego Batman====
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'' as a playable character with vocal effects provided by [[Steven Blum]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Game Informer]]'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; This incarnation of the character is in the employ of [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and possesses super strength, an immunity to toxins and is able to dive underwater. He is the third [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of Chapter 2 "Power-Crazed Penguin." In the villain story, he and Penguin ride around Gotham Docks and the 2 head into the sewers to rescue [[Catwoman]]. [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]] encounter him and the fight begins. He has 14 hit points, the most out of all the bosses. However, this is one the easier boss fights since the player just has to attack him until his hit points run out. On the 5th, 7th, and 11th hits, he walks into the toxins to throw heavy things at Batman and Robin. When he's defeated, he drops a brochure of Gotham Zoo providing the clue that Batman and Robin need and then cell bars move over him locking him in. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] chewing on his cell bars.
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as a cameo in the level "Asylum Assignment" where he's seen in a cage. If the player activates a machine that drops roast turkey into his cage, he'll eat it. Nothing really happens when player attacks him in free-play mode. He also appears as a boss fight at the water works and unlockable character. Here he's shown to speak in the third person, as before his boss fight he says, "Croc hungry."
* Killer Croc appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', with Fred Tatasciore reprising his role now in a Cajun accent, and he no longer speaks in the third person. He appears as the first boss where he steals a map of the sewers in order for the [[Legion of Doom]] to get into the watchtower. He's the fourth member of the Legion of Doom that fought in the watchtower. When the [[Justice League]] comes to stop them, he goes with [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] to battle [[Robin (character)|Robin]] and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], but Cyborg latter activates his giant suit to defeat them both. When [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] appears, he helps them grapple on to his ship. He then stays behind with [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]]. In the ending, he serves as [[Lex Luthor]]'s security when he becomes President, but he and the rest of the villains are taken to [[Arkham Asylum]]. In comparison to the previous two games where he was a mini-figure, Croc is redesigned as one the big figures of the game (which is comically noted by Robin, who notes he is bigger than before).
* Killer Croc is set to appear in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Fred Tatasciore reprising his role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc18-lego-dc-super-villains-cast-and-devs-dish-on-funever-evil/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Batman Arkham''====
Killer Croc appears in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' series where he has been voiced by [[Steven Blum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/blumspew/status/252082717276114945 |title=Twitter / blumspew: @pmagill536 I was all over |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2012-09-29 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Arkham Asylum'', ''Arkham City'', and ''Arkham Knight'' and ''VR'', and by [[Khary Payton]] in ''Arkham Origins''.

* In the continuity of ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Croc is portrayed as physically larger than most of his comic book counterparts, standing at a colossal eleven feet. He is interred at Arkham Asylum as a cannibalistic murderer, although his many other crimes include racketeering and the smuggling of illegal drugs. The asylum staff, who hate and fear the aptly dubbed "monster", only feed Killer Croc with animal carcasses once a week and confine him to an unused sewer, with an electrifying shock collar to discourage troublemaking. This solitary confinement has only succeeded in magnifying Croc's intense hatred of humanity; a psychiatrist believes he now views people as nothing more than potential food. In addition to hating Batman, Croc holds a grudge with Aaron Cash, having tried to eat the guard during a break out attempt, but only managing to devour Cash's left hand. This resulted in a constant craving to eat the rest of Cash. He appears early on in the game when he is taken to the sewers and passes Batman escorting a recently captured Joker. He vows to kill and devour Batman before he receives a shock and is taken away. Later in the story, Batman infiltrates Arkham's old sewer network in search of rare [[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]] roots for an antidote for the Titan drug that Joker has created, only to find [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]] threatening to unleash his fear gas into Gotham's water supply by dumping it into the sewers. Killer Croc emerges from the water and attacks Scarecrow, then falls back when Batman activates his shock collar via Batarang, taking Scarecrow with him. While searching Croc's lair for the roots, Killer Croc ambushes the player repeatedly, only to be easily stunned into retreat each time by hitting his shock collar with batarangs. He is defeated for the final time while charging over an unstable floor, which Batman destroys with explosives, sending Croc plunging down. After Batman leaves his lair Croc shouts up saying that he will find him. Killer Croc's hand is one of those that will appear at the end of the game (sometimes it is his hand or Bane's hand or Scarecrow's hand) grabbing the Titan box out in the bay.
* In a cameo appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', after surviving the incidents of ''Batman: Arkham Asylum'', he is now imprisoned in the new walled-off incarceration districts known as Arkham City. It is revealed in his profile that guards tried to lure him back to the sewers of Arkham Asylum by using pieces of dead inmates. However he managed to escape the Asylum sewers during this and his whereabouts were unknown after. During the game, Killer Croc has taken refuge in Gotham's maze-like sewer network, killing other inmates who wander into his domain. He is presented as notably slimmer here than his previous incarnation, likely due to an inconsistent food supply. The player can encounter Killer Croc in a time-sensitive Easter egg after Batman has encountered [[Ra's al Ghul]] in 'Wonder City' for the first time but before Batman leaves the sewers. Upon using the remote-controlled Batarang to hit a button, Killer Croc bursts through the wall telling Batman that he is not welcome. Killer Croc then smells "death" on Batman (as a result of Joker infecting Batman with his own life-threatening illness) and decides not to bother trying to kill him. Killer Croc then retreats into the water promising to come after his corpse later. Killer Croc can also be spotted in the Iceberg Lounge combat challenge map, through the use of a remote-controlled Batarang. He sits at a table with Penguin, smoking a cigar and having a drink, but he does not speak or join in the fighting.
* In the prequel ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', he appears as one of the assassins hired by The Joker (posing as [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]). He first appears at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], helping the crime lord break out his imprisoned men and murder Commissioner [[Gillian B. Loeb]]. While escaping, he is confronted by Batman and the two fight on the rooftops of the prison. Batman defeats Killer Croc and interrogates him, learning about the other assassins sent to kill him. He later runs into Batman during the second attack on the prison, only to flee at the arrival of the GCPD and be taken back into custody. This younger Croc is significantly smaller than his portrayal in the other games, and more or less resembles a human (an uncertain Batman even refers to him as a "human-shaped crocodile"). His desire for the fame and fortune of being Batman's killer imply his mutation has not yet spread to the point where he is more monster than man.
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. In his cameo, his design was also updated with a larger body, spikes, and a tail. Killer Croc appears while Batman is under the effects of Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinating that he is Joker. Killer Croc is shown standing in the midst of Penguin, Riddler, and Two-Face. Killer Croc is knocked out by a speeding Joker-Batmobile. It is also mentioned in recorded dialogue for random thugs that Scarecrow's new hideous physical appearance is because his face was severely damaged by his encounter with Killer Croc in Arkham Asylum. Killer Croc also appears in the December "Season of Infamy" DLC pack in the side misson "Beneath the Surface". After the events of Arkham City, he is captured by staff working for [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]] and experimented on in the Penitentiary's airship above Gotham Bay by Warden Ranken. It is discovered that he has regenerative capabilities thanks to his mutation, even being able to regrow lost limbs, but at the cost of further mutation. During the events of the game, he breaks out of his cell and destroys the airship, causing it to crash near the memorial bridge. Killer Croc then breaks out the prisoners and kidnaps Warden Ranken, demanding that he reverse the mutation that has occurred. He is defeated by Batman and Nightwing, and is taken to the GCPD Headquarters, along with the surviving members of Iron Heights' staff and the fellow prisoners aboard the airship. Ranken is imprisoned in an adjacent cell, with Batman vowing to have Warden Ranken face justice. Killer Croc's severed arm is later placed in the GCPD's Evidence Room with Cash remarking that while he pities Killer Croc for the torture he endured aboard the airship, he still cannot forgive him for eating his own hand.
* Killer Croc appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld'' in his Arkham Asylum incarnation (but voiced by Khary Payton in the same style as his Arkham Origins incarnation, strangely). The tank-like Croc is unlocked after the player defeats him in response to him encroaching on their turf, after which he becomes playable, using his incredible strength and armor-like hide to dominate the battlefield.
* Killer Croc makes a brief appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham VR]]''. He kills [[Tim Drake|Robin]] after the Boy Wonder is imprisoned in the sewers.

====Other games====
* Killer Croc makes an appearance in the negatively received video game ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]''. He is apparently being manipulated by the Joker, attacking Batman when the Caped Crusader attempts to rescue police Commissioner Gordon from the Joker.
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' on several occasions, one of the first being as an illusion conjured by the Scarecrow. The actual character also appears at the Cape Carmine Lighthouse, where at one point heroic players may best him and Deathstroke before being permitted to proceed. Croc may also forge alliances with villainous players, revealing that he has been hired by [[Carmine Falcone]] to assassinate Bane.
* Killer Croc makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. In the Arkham Asylum level, if one of the characters is thrown through the cell door on the right side of the second tier, they will be attacked by Croc, Penguin, Two-Face, and Riddler before being punched by Croc into the next tier of the Arkham arena. He is also in Batman's S.T.A.R. Labs, where Batman must fight prisoners escaping from Stryker's Island before the player fights the villain. He also makes a playable appearance in the mobile version, with his Arkham Asylum attire.
* Killer Croc makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice 2]]''. In the Batcave stage, if one of the characters is tossed through a wall on the left side, they are thrown into the sewer and start struggling through the water until they are grabbed by Croc, who smashes them against the two brick walls before tossing them into the Batcave.

===Books===
In the novel ''Batman: Knightfall and Beyond'', based largely on the comics storyline, Killer Croc is said to have suffered from "a raging [[skin cancer]]" that turned the outer layers of his flesh into a hardened covering when he was younger. He escapes from Arkham Asylum when Bane and his men destroy it, freeing most of Batman's major foes in the process as part of a plan by Bane to wear him down before Bane himself "breaks" him. Batman later defeats Croc in a one-on-one fight in the sewers, crushing a cylinder of knock-out gas against the underside of his nose to disable him. Croc is then arrested and held in Blackgate Prison with the other Arkham escapees until the asylum can be rebuilt.

'''Mark Kellogg''' (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a [[newspaper]] [[reporter]] killed at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]. Kellogg rode with [[George Armstrong Custer]] during the battle and was evidently one of the first men killed by the [[Sioux]] and [[Cheyenne]].&lt;ref name="NYHerald"&gt;[http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/mark_kellogg_big_horn.html "Mark Kellogg's Prequil to the Battle: A reporter's account of riding with Custer into the Battle of the Little Bighorn,"] ''The New York Herald'', July 11, 1876. Accessed February 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His dispatches were the only press coverage of Custer and his men in the days leading up to the battle. As a newspaper [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first [[Associated Press]] [[correspondent]] to die in the line of duty.&lt;ref name="Associated Press history archives"&gt;[http://www.ap.org/pages/about/history/history_first.html Associated Press history archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729010041/http://ap.org/pages/about/history/history_first.html |date=2011-07-29 }}, accessed Feb. 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born '''Marcus Henry Kellogg''' on March 31, 1831, in [[Brighton, Ontario]], Canada, Kellogg was the third of ten children. Kellogg's family moved a number of times in his youth before they eventually settled in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="CusterCompanion"&gt;''The Custer Companion: A Comprehensive Guide to the Life of George Armstrong Custer and the Plains'' by Thom Hatch, Stackpole Books, 2002, pages 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt; While there Kellogg learned to operate a [[telegraph]] and went to work for both the Northwestern Telegraph Company and the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company.

He married Martha J. Robinson in 1861 and they had two daughters. During the years of the [[American Civil War]], Kellogg became the assistant editor for the ''La Crosse Democrat'' newspaper. He also unsuccessfully ran for the office of city clerk in 1867 and played shortstop on one of the town's [[baseball]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;''I Go With Custer: The Life &amp; Death of Reporter Mark Kellogg'' by Mark Kellogg, AST Press, 1996, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 Kellogg's wife died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakgrovecemetery.com/about/walkingtour.asp The Mark Kellogg Historical Plaque], Oak Grove Cemetery, La Crosse, Wisconsin, walking tour of Oak Grove Cemetery, accessed Nov. 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving his daughters to be raised by an aunt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wlhba/articleView.asp?pg=1&amp;id=2036&amp;key=kellogg&amp;cy= 'La Crosse scribe victim of Custer's Last Charge'], Milwaukee Sentinel, August 21, 1921, The Wisconsin State Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; Kellogg began drifting around the upper Midwest, working as a reporter and editorial assistant in places such as [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]], and [[Brainerd, Minnesota]]. While living in Brainerd he ran for election to the [[Minnesota Legislature]], but was defeated.  He also worked as a string correspondent for the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press|St. Paul Dispatch]]'', with his articles often published under the [[pen name]] of "Frontier."&lt;ref&gt;''I Go With Custer: The Life &amp; Death of Reporter Mark Kellogg'' by Mark Kellogg, AST Press, 1996, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1870s, he moved to [[Bismarck, North Dakota]], where in 1873 he helped editor Clement A. Lounsberry found ''[[The Bismarck Tribune]]''. Even though Kellogg was only an editorial assistant for the paper, he substituted for Lounsberry as editor of the ''Tribune'''s second, third and fourth issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/calounsberry.htm Clement A. Lounsberry Colonel], United States Army, Arlington National Cemetery website, accessed Feb. 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of the Little Bighorn==
{{further|Battle of the Little Bighorn}}
When Lounsberry learned that a military column (including the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment]] commanded by Lt. Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]]) would soon leave [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] for the [[Montana Territory]], he agreed to accompany Custer and provide news coverage. However, at the last minute Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg to take his place.&lt;ref name="CusterCompanion"/&gt; Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than a sensational military victory.&lt;ref name="With Custer 1996"&gt;''I Go With Custer: The Life &amp; Death of Reporter Mark Kellogg'' by Mark Kellogg, AST Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellogg sent three dispatches back to Lounsberry, the last one four days before the battle when they were near the mouth of the Rosebud River. His last dispatch read, "By the time this reaches you we would have met and fought the red devils, with what result remains to be seen. I go with Custer and will be at the death."&lt;ref&gt;Marlane A. Liddell. "[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-ap-looks-back-152468639/ The AP Looks Back: 150 Years of Capturing the Moment]". ''Smithsonian Magazine'', May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Connolly.

Accessed February 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Kellogg was not predicting his own death or Custer's defeat;&lt;ref name="With Custer 1996"/&gt; instead, "at the death" is a phrase borrowed from fox hunting meaning "present at the kill" (''viz''., of the pursued).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/in+at+the+death | title = Entry for ''death'', sense 15 | year = 2009 | work = Dictionary.com Unabridged Based on the Random House Dictionary | publisher = [[Reference.com|dictionary.com]] | accessdate = 2010-01-12 | quote = ''Fox Hunting''. present at the kill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days after that dispatch, the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] was fought, resulting in the deaths of Custer and the 208 soldiers, scouts, and civilians riding with him, including Kellogg.

==Aftermath==
Colonel [[John Gibbon]], whose men arrived at the battle on Tuesday, June 27, and also helped bury the dead, said he found Kellogg's body in a ravine where a number of men from Company E died.&lt;ref name="CusterCompanion"/&gt; Kellogg's body was [[Scalping|scalped]] and missing an ear; he was identified by the boots he wore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/custer4a.html Little Bighorn: Custer and the Battle of the Little Bighorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720154018/http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/custer4a.html |date=2008-07-20 }}, From Wyoming Tales and Trails, The Aftermath, Tom Custer, Rain-in-the-Face, accessed Nov. 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Clement Lounsberry learned of the defeat of Custer's force and Kellogg's death, he "worked tirelessly throughout the night" to produce a special edition of ''The Bismarck Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/calounsberry.htm Clement A. Lounsberry Colonel, United States Army, Arlington National Cemetery website, accessed Feb. 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Published on July 6, 1876, the article was the battle's first full account. Lounsberry also [[telegraph]]ed the news, including Kellogg's correspondence, to a number of eastern newspapers, including the ''[[New York Herald]]''. Two letters written by Kellogg were published posthumously by the ''Herald'' on July 11, 1876.&lt;ref name="NYHerald"/&gt;

As a newspaper [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first [[Associated Press]] correspondent to die in the line of duty.&lt;ref name="Associated Press history archives"/&gt;

Some of Kellogg's diary and notes survived the battle and these, along with his news accounts, are one of the primary historical sources for information on the days preceding the battle. His notes are now in the possession of the [[State Historical Society of North Dakota]].&lt;ref name="CusterCompanion"/&gt; His satchel, pencil, and eyeglasses are on display in the [[Newseum]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2183936/ | title=Down With the Newseum!

[[Image:Wifes grave kizhi.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Myrrhbearing Women at the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]] ([[Kizhi]], Russia, 18th century).]]
[[Image:Maria Magdalene icon.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Mary Magdalene]] as a Myrrhbearer.]]
[[File:Saint Salome.jpg|thumb|180px|Hagiography, fresco, of Saint Salome the Myrrhbearer in Greek Orthodox Church.]]

In [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] tradition the '''Myrrhbearers''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Μυροφόροι, [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Myrophorae''; [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: Жены́-мѷроно́сицы; {{lang-ro|mironosiţe}}) are the individuals mentioned in the [[New Testament]] who were directly involved in the burial or who discovered the [[empty tomb]] following the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. The term traditionally refers to the women with [[myrrh]] who came to the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb of Christ]] early in the morning to find it empty. In [[Western Christianity]], the '''two women at the tomb''', [[Three Marys]] or other variants are the terms normally used. Also included are [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Nicodemus]], who took the body of Jesus down from the cross, embalmed it with [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], wrapped it in clean [[linen]], and placed it in a new tomb. ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:55–61|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|28:1–10|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|15:40–16:11|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:50–24:10|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||John|19:38–20:18|KJV}}).

The women followed Jesus during his earthly ministry in [[Galilee]], providing for him and his followers out of their own means ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:41|KJV}}). They remained faithful to him even during the most dangerous time of his arrest and execution, and not only stood by the cross, but accompanied him to his burial, noticing where the tomb was located. Because of the impending [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], it was necessary for the burial preparations to be brief. Jewish custom at the time dictated that mourners return to the tomb every day for three days.  Once the Sabbath had passed, the women returned at the earliest possible moment, bringing myrrh to anoint the body. It was at this point that the Resurrection was revealed to them, and they were commissioned to go and tell the [[Apostles]]. They were, in effect, the apostles to the Apostles. For this reason, the myrrhbearing women, especially [[Mary Magdalene]], are sometimes referred to as "Equal to the Apostles."

Joseph of Arimathea was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly ({{bibleverse||John|19:38|KJV}}). He went to [[Pontius Pilate]] and asked for the body of Jesus and, together with Nicodemus, hurriedly prepared the body for burial. He donated his own new [[sepulchre|tomb]] for the burial. A native of [[Arimathea]], he was apparently a man of wealth, and probably a member of the [[Sanhedrin]] (which is the way the [[biblical Greek]], ''bouleutēs''—literally, "counselor"—is often interpreted in {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:57|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|23:50|KJV}}). Joseph was an "honourable counselor, who waited (or "was searching") for the [[kingdom of God]]" ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:43|KJV}}). Luke describes him as "a good man, and just" ({{bibleverse||Luke|23:50|KJV}}).

Nicodemus (Greek: Νικόδημος) was a [[Pharisee]] and also a member of the Sanhedrin, who is first mentioned early in the [[Gospel of John]], when he visits Jesus to listen to his teachings, but he comes by night out of fear ({{bibleverse||John|3:1–21|KJV}}).  He is mentioned again when he states the teaching of the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]] concerning the arrest of Jesus during the [[Feast of Tabernacles]] ({{bibleverse||John|7:45–51|KJV}}).  He is last mentioned following the Crucifixion, when he and Joseph of Arimathea prepare the body of Jesus for burial ({{bibleverse||John|19:39–42|KJV}}).  There is an [[apocryphal]] ''[[Gospel of Nicodemus]]'' that purports to be written by him.

==Names of the Myrrhbearers==

The Myrrhbearers are traditionally listed as:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goarch.org/special/listen_learn_share/sunday_of_myrrhbearers&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Magdalene]] 
*[[Mary (mother of James the Less)|Mary, the mother of James and Joses]]
*[[Mary, the wife of Cleopas]]
*[[Martha]] of Bethany, Sister of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]
*[[Mary of Bethany]], Sister of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]
*[[Saint Joanna|Joanna]], the wife of Chuza the [[Steward (office)|steward]] of [[Herod Antipas]]
*[[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], the mother of [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], the sons of [[Zebedee]]
*[[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]]
*[[Joseph of Arimathea]]
*[[Nicodemus]]

There are also generally accepted to be other Myrrhbearers, whose names are not known.

==Liturgical references==
[[Image:Zheny mironosicy u Groba Gospodnja.jpg|thumb|Icon used on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers. The two Marys are in the center with the two angels at either side, in the foreground is the [[Holy Sepulchre]] with the [[winding sheet]] and napkin.]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] churches, the ''Third Sunday of [[Easter|Pascha]]'' (i.e. the second Sunday after Easter) is called the 'Sunday of the Myrrhbearers'.  The Scripture readings appointed for the services on this day emphasize the role of these individuals in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: [[Matins Gospel]]—{{bibleverse||Mark|16:9-20|KJV}}, [[Divine Liturgy]] [[Epistle]]—{{bibleverse||Acts|6:1–7|KJV}} and Gospel—{{bibleverse||Mark|15:43–16:8|KJV}}.

Since this day commemorates events surrounding not only the Resurrection, but also the entombment of Christ, some of the hymns from [[Holy Saturday]] are repeated.  These include the [[Troparion]] of the Day: "The noble Joseph..." (but with a new line added at the end, commemorating the Resurrection), and the [[sticheron|Doxastikhon]] at the [[Vespers]] [[Aposticha]]: "Joseph together with Nicodemus..."

The week that follows is called the '''Week of the Myrrhbearers''' and the Troparion mentioned above is used every day at the [[Canonical Hours]] and the Divine Liturgy. The Doxastikhon is repeated again at [[Vespers]] on Wednesday and Friday evenings.

Many of the Myrrhbearers also have separate feast days on which they are commemorated individually in the [[Menaion]].

There are numerous liturgical hymns which speak of the Myrrhbearers, especially in the Sunday [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] and in the [[Pentecostarion]]. Every Sunday, there is a special hymn that is chanted at [[Matins]] and the [[Midnight Office]], called the ''[[Hypakoë]]'', (Greek: Ύπακοί, [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: Ўпаκои), which means, "sent", and refers to the Myrrhbearing women being sent to announce the Resurrection to the Apostles.

There are several prominent Orthodox [[cathedral]]s and churches named after the Myrrhbearers.  They celebrate their [[patron saint|patronal]] feast day on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers.

==Role of the Myrrhbearers==
In the Gospels, especially the [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptics]], women play a central role as eyewitness at Jesus' death, entombment, and in the discovery of the empty tomb. All three synoptics repeatedly make women the subject of verbs of seeing,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; clearly presenting them as eyewitnesses.&lt;ref&gt;B. Gerhardsson, 'Mark and the Female Witnesses', in H. Behrens, D. Loding, and M. T. Roth, eds., ''Dumu-E2-Dub-Ba-A'' (A. W. Sjöberg FS; Occasional Papers of the Samuel Noah Kramer Fund 11; Philadelphia: The University Museum, 1989), pp. 219–20, 222–23; S. Byrskog, ''Story as History – History as Story'' (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament Jerusalem Talmud 123; Tübingen: Mohr, 2000; remprinted Leiden: Brill, 2002), pp. 75–78; Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of women as the key witnesses who discover the empty tomb has been seen as increasing the credibility of the testimony, since, in the contemporary culture (Jewish and Greco-Roman), one might expect a fabrication to place men, and especially numerous and important men, at this critical place, rather than just "some grieving women."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, ''What have they done with Jesus'' (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 2006), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. H. Dodd]] considered the narrative in John to be "self-authenticating", arguing that no one would make up the notion that Jesus had appeared to the "little known woman" [[Mary Magdalene]].&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Dodd, ''The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; However, some passages in the [[Mishnah]] ([[Nashim#Yevamot .28.22Brothers-in-law.22.29|Yebamoth]] 16:7; [[Nashim#Ketubot .28.22Prenuptial agreements.22.29|Ketubot]] 2:5; [[Eduyot]] 3:6) indicate that women could give testimony if there was no male witness available. Also, Josephus&lt;ref&gt;Jewish War, 7.389 and 4.81&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pliny the Younger]]&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, Epistles, X.96.&lt;/ref&gt; have used women as witnesses to their claims. In addition, Paul does not mention the women. [[Bart D. Ehrman]] argues:
"One of Mark's overarching themes is that virtually no one during the ministry of Jesus could understand who he was. His family didn't understand. His townspeople didn't understand. The leaders of his own people didn't understand. Not even the disciples understood in Mark—especially not the disciples! For Mark, only outsiders have an inkling of who Jesus was: the unnamed woman who anointed him, the centurion at the cross. Who understands at the end? Not the family of Jesus! Not the disciples! It's a group of previously unknown women…the women at the tomb…."
&lt;ref&gt;Bart Erhmann http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p96.htm#EhrmanFirst&lt;/ref&gt;

All three Synoptics name two or three women on each occasion in the passion-resurrection narratives where they are cited as eyewitnesses: the [[Torah]]'s required two or three witnesses{{bibleref2c|Deuteronomy|19:15}} in a statute that had exerted influence beyond legal courts and into situations in everyday life where accurate evidence was needed.&lt;ref&gt;B. Gerhardsson, “Mark and the Female Witnesses,” in H. Behrens, D. Loding, and M. T. Roth, eds., ''Dumu-E2-Dub-Ba-A'' (A. W. Sjöberg FS; Occasional Papers of the Samuel Noah Kramer Fund 11; Philadelphia: The University Museum, 1989), p. 218; Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the named women (and some are left anonymous), Mary Magdalene is present in all four Gospel accounts, and Mary the mother of James is present in all three synoptics; however, variations exist in the lists of each Gospel concerning the women present at the death, entombment, and discovery. For example, Mark names three women at the cross and the same three who go to the tomb, but only two are observed to be witnesses at the burial. Based on this, and similar examples in Matthew and Luke, [[Richard Bauckham]] argued that the [[Four Evangelists|evangelists]] showed "scrupulous care" and "were careful to name precisely the women who were known to them as witnesses to these crucial events" since there would be no other reason, besides interest in historical accuracy, not to simply use the same set of characters from one scene to another.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark's account (which in the earliest extant manuscripts) ends abruptly and claims that the women told no one. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark do not present any further involvement at the tomb. Luke describes Peter as running to the tomb to check for himself, and John adds that the [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|Beloved Disciple]] did so too, the beloved disciple outrunning Peter.&lt;ref&gt;To answer the question of running speed: It is never explained why the disciple(s) move(s) from merely traveling to running, and it has often been speculated that running only occurred on the last stretch once the tomb had come within sight. [[John Calvin]] instead speculated that the rush was due to religious zeal. In particular, John describes the Beloved Disciple as outracing Peter, though waiting for Peter to arrive before entering the tomb, with some scholars seeing the out-racing as a metaphoric elevation of the Beloved Disciple above Peter. However, many Christian scholars object to this interpretation, instead arguing that since the ''Beloved Disciple'' is usually interpreted as a reference to the author of John, it would be necessary for him to be considerably younger than Peter, and hence his speed could be due simply to youthful vigour. Another question is why John the Beloved Disciple pauses outside the tomb. While many view it as being due to his not wanting to violate [[death]] [[ritual]] by entering a [[tomb]], in contrast to Peter who has no such qualm and instead enters immediately, most scholars believe John is simply [[deference|deferring]] to Peter, particularly since the Beloved Disciple enters the tomb once Peter is inside. There is some scriptural variation as to whom the women told and in what order.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What happens once Mary (and Mary) has seen the occupier(s)/empty tomb is again one of the more variant parts of this narrative. According to Mark, even though the man in the tomb instructs Mary and Mary to inform the disciples ‘‘and’‘ Peter, they flee in fear and do ‘‘not’‘ tell ''anything to any man''. Like Mark, Matthew presents Mary and Mary as being instructed by the tomb's occupant to inform the disciples, but unlike Mark's account they happily do so, and Peter has no special status amongst the others. Luke, again, merely presents Mary and Mary as telling ''the eleven'' and ''the rest'', but presents them as doing so apparently without being instructed. John's account is quite different: John only describes Mary as informing two people—Peter and the [[Beloved Disciple]], an individual that is usually considered to be a self-reference by the author of the gospel John.&lt;/ref&gt;

My outline was based on 40 years of successful experience as a cartoonist and newspaper feature syndicate."&lt;/ref&gt; He created the [[hardboiled|hardboiled detective]] character [[Dan Dunn]] in the proto-comic book ''Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48'' (May 12, 1933).&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48'' was copyrighted on May 12, 1933. {{cite book|url= https://books.google.be/books?id=SVxbAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA351#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Catalog of Copyright Entries.

Comics historian [[Don Markstein]] notes that this periodical and the only two others from this publisher were pioneering in that they contained "non-reprinted comics in 1933", though these periodicals were not "in modern comic book format. Theirs were done as tabloids"&lt;ref name=toon&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/dandunn.htm Dan Dunn] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/66tYCwfD4?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dandunn.htm |date=2012-04-13 }} from the original on April 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48'' measuring either 9 1/2 x 12-inches&lt;ref name=detectivedan-gcd /&gt; or 10 x 13-inches&lt;ref name=coville&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thecomicbooks.com/nsp1-01.html | first=James|last=Coville | title=Newsstand Period 1922 - 1955| publisher=TheComicBooks.com| accessdate= October 6, 2016| archivedate= June 3, 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160603180923/http://www.thecomicbooks.com/nsp1-01.html | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sources differ), with black-and-white newsprint pages and a three-color cardboard cover.&lt;ref name=detectivedan-gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/640366/ ''Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The character appeared primarily in the newspaper comic strip ''Dan Dunn'', syndicated by [[Publishers Syndicate]] beginning Monday, September 25, 1933, with a Sunday page added soon afterward. The strip, which ran through Sunday, October 3, 1943, eventually would appear in approximately 135 papers.&lt;ref name=toon /&gt; ''Dan Dunn'' strips were reprinted in comic books, through publisher [[Eastern Color]]'s ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', [[Dell Comics]]' ''[[The Funnies]]'' and ''[[Red Ryder]] Comics'', and [[Western Publishing]]'s ''Crackajack Funnies'' from 1935 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/credit/name/Norman%20Marsh/sort/chrono/ Norman Marsh] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of ''Dan Dunn'', Marsh created another hardboiled-detective strip, ''Hunter Keene'', for [[King Features Syndicate]], which ran daily and not Sunday from April 15, 1946, to April 12, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2009/07/obscurity-of-day-hunter-keene.html|title=Obscurity of the Day: Hunter Keene|authorlink=Allan Holtz|first=Allan|last=Holtz|publisher=Stripper's Guide|date=July 14, 2009|accessdate= May 20, 2018|archivedate=October 12, 2015 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151012044225/https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2009/07/obscurity-of-day-hunter-keene.html |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this was ''Danny Hale'', about "a kid frontiersman who found himself tagging along with revolutionary war heroes, accompanying the [[Lewis and Clark]] expedition, and generally being in the right place at the right time (even if those times were widely separated)", according to comics historian [[Allan Holtz]].&lt;ref name=dannyhale&gt;{{cite web|url=https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2008/08/onscurity-of-day-danny-hale.html| title=Obscurity of the Day: Danny Hale|first=Allan|last=Holtz|publisher=Stripper's Guide|date=August 13, 2008|accessdate= May 20, 2018|archivedate=September 29, 2015 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150929073648/http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2008/08/onscurity-of-day-danny-hale.html|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Features syndicated it beginning October 27, 1947, and after three years, with the syndicate prepared to end it, Marsh began self-syndicating the strip starting January 15, 1951 episode. A year later, he changed the title to ''Dan'l Hale'' and aged the character to a young man. The strip ended on October 13, 1962.&lt;ref name=dannyhale /&gt;

The '''Parents of Murdered Children Memorial''', sometimes abbreviated as the '''POMC Memorial''', is a memorial to [[child murder]] victims, located at [[Mountain View Cemetery (Oregon City, Oregon)|Mountain View Cemetery]] in [[Oregon City, Oregon]], in the United States.&lt;ref name=Oregonian&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/index.ssf/2013/09/oregon_city_memorial_honors_ch.html|title=Oregon City memorial honors child murder victims|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013|work=[[The Oregonian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial was dedicated in September 2013, becoming the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest and the eighth in the United States.

==Description==
The memorial, located in the northwest corner of Mountain View Cemetery in Oregon City, has been described as a "beautiful place for anyone who has lost a loved one or child due to homicide".&lt;ref name=Oregonian/&gt; It features an Oregon/Washington Memorial Wall, a lighted curved wall that encompasses benches, freestanding basalt columns, a spiral-shaped stone walkway and a waterfall over more stonework. It cost $400,000 in cash and in-kind contributions. The memorial was the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest and the eighth in the United States at the time of its September 2013 dedication.&lt;ref name=Oregonian/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Oregon City, Oregon (2018) - 175.jpg|thumb|right|The memorial in 2018]]

Efforts to construct the memorial were led by Mary Elledge, leader of the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] area chapter of Parents of Murdered Children (POMC), whose son Rob was murdered.&lt;ref name=Oregonian/&gt;

The science of '''pattern formation''' deals with the visible, ([[statistically]]) orderly outcomes of [[self-organization]] and the common principles behind similar [[patterns in nature]].

In [[developmental biology]], pattern formation refers to the generation of complex organizations of [[cell fate determination|cell fates]] in space and time. Pattern formation is controlled by [[gene]]s. The role of genes in pattern formation is an aspect of [[morphogenesis]], the creation of diverse [[anatomy|anatomies]] from similar genes, now being explored in the science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] or evo-devo. The mechanisms involved are well seen in the anterior-posterior patterning of [[embryo]]s from the [[model organism]] ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (a fruit fly), one of the first organisms to have its morphogenesis studied, and in the [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] of butterflies, whose development is a variant of the standard (fruit fly) mechanism.

==Examples==
{{further|Patterns in nature}}
Examples of pattern formation can be found in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and can readily be simulated with Computer graphics, as described in turn below.

===Biology===

Biological patterns such as [[animal markings]], the segmentation of animals, and [[phyllotaxis]] are formed in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. ''Shapes'', pp. 231–252.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[developmental biology]], pattern formation describes the mechanism by which initially equivalent cells in a developing tissue in an [[embryo]] assume complex forms and functions.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. Shapes, pp. 261–290.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Embryogenesis]], such as [[Drosophila embryogenesis|of the fruit fly ''Drosophila'']], involves coordinated [[cell fate determination|control of cell fates]].&lt;ref name=Lai&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eric C.

Possible mechanisms of pattern formation in biological systems include the classical [[reaction-diffusion]] model proposed by [[Alan Turing]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Kondo, T. Miura, "Reaction-Diffusion Model as a Framework for Understanding Biological Pattern Formation", Science 24 Sep 2010: Vol. 329, Issue 5999, pp. 1616-1620 DOI: 10.1126/science.1179047&lt;/ref&gt; and the more recently found [[elastic instability]] mechanism which is thought to be responsible for the fold patterns on the [[cerebral cortex]] of higher animals, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Mercker et al.

====Growth of colonies====
Bacterial colonies show a large [[Bacterial patterns|variety of patterns]] formed during colony growth. The resulting shapes depend on the growth conditions. In particular, stresses (hardness of the culture medium, lack of nutrients, etc.) enhance the complexity of the resulting patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. ''Branches'', pp. 52–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms such as [[slime mould]]s display remarkable patterns caused by the dynamics of chemical signalling.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 2009. ''Shapes'', pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vegetation patterns====

[[patterned vegetation|Vegetation patterns]] such as [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J., Valentin, C. &amp; Seghieri, J. | year=2001 | location=New York|isbn=978-1461265597}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; form for different reasons. Tiger bush consists of stripes of bushes on arid slopes in countries such as [[Niger]] where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation absorbs rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; In contrast, fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt;

Some types of [[Finite state machine|automata]] have been used to generate organic-looking [[Texture (computer graphics)|textures]] for more realistic [[Shader|shading]] of [[3D modeling|3d objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Greg Turk, [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/reaction_diffusion/reaction_diffusion.html Reaction-Diffusion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaction-Diffusion Textures|author1=Andrew Witkin |author2=Michael Kassy |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aw/pdf/texture.pdf|doi=10.1145/122718.122750|journal=Proceedings of the 18th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques|year=1991|pages=299–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular Photoshop plugin, [[Kai's Power Tools|KPT 6]], included a filter called 'KPT reaction'. Reaction produced [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction-diffusion]] style patterns based on the supplied seed image.

A similar effect to the 'KPT reaction' can be achieved with [[convolution]] functions in [[digital image processing]], with a little patience, by repeatedly [[Unsharp masking|sharpening]] and [[Box blur|blurring]] an image in a graphics editor. If other filters are used, such as [[Image embossing|emboss]] or [[edge detection]], different types of effects can be achieved.

Computers are often used to [[Computer simulation|simulate]] the biological, physical or chemical processes that lead to pattern formation, and they can display the results in a realistic way. Calculations using models like [[Reaction-diffusion]] or [[MClone]] are based on the actual mathematical equations designed by the scientists to model the studied phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10565">A '''peace walk''' or '''peace march''', sometimes referred to as a '''peace pilgrimage''',  is a form of [[nonviolent]] action where a person or groups of people march a set distance to raise awareness of particular issues important to the walkers.

==Europe==
Europe is launching its first permanent Peace Walk Route, that will run along the former division between East and West Europe and end in Trieste, N-E Italy. A pan European network is currently working on its Design, and it is set to open in 2014, to mark the 100th anniversary of World War I.

==India==
One famous example was that of [[Vinoba Bhave]], who undertook a peace walk with many of his followers throughout India for land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fifties Spiritual Marketplace: American Religion in a Decade of Conflict|first=Robert S. |last=Ellwood|publisher=Rutgers University Press|ISBN=0-8135-2346-X|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent peace walk campaign named ''[[Freedom Walk]]'' was organized by the Free Software Community in [[Kerala]] in 2008. 4 volunteers walked 750 miles (1,200 km) from one end of the state to the other to promote [[Free Software]].&lt;ref name="fw-fsf"&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/freedom-walk Freedom Walk], covered under community events in FSF Blogs.&lt;/ref&gt;

A peace walk was undertaken in 1962 by [[Satish Kumar]] and his companion who walked without money from India via the [[Soviet Union]], France and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to the United States (using [[ship]]s to cross the channel and Atlantic). Vinoba gave 2 gifts to Satish and his companion: pennilessness, i.e. [[voluntary poverty]], and [[vegetarianism]].

==UK==
Early in 1984, [[peace camp]]ers walked 26 miles from [[Daws hill]] to [[Naphill]] through country roads and countryside to raise money for ''[[The Angry Pacifist]]'' magazine.

==US==
[[File:San Diego Peace March 2003.jpg|thumb|About 7,000 San Diego Peace Marchers in Balboa Park Protest the Iraq War, March 15, 2003]]The ''[[King-Carter Freedom Peace Walk]]'' is a 1.5-mile walkway in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s (USA) Freedom Park. It commemorates the only two Georgia winners of the [[Nobel Prize]] for Peace: [[Martin Luther King Jr]]. and [[Jimmy Carter]].

Various peace organizations throughout the United States have organized marches and vigils to protest the [[Iraq War]], since before the war started in 2003, and then annually ever since.  Sometimes these marches are coordinated to take place on the same day across the nation. In San Diego, the greatest number of anti-war protesters, an estimated 7,000, turned out for a demonstration on March 15, just five days before the beginning of the Iraq War.

===The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life===
"The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life" started in Auschwitz, Poland on December 8, 1994, and ended in Nagasaki on the fiftieth anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing, 9 August 1995. It was led by [[Nipponzan-Myōhōji]] Japanese Buddhist monks. The monks, however, were dwarfed in number by American, European, South American and Japanese lay people.

The trip was organized to both commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II as well as to be witness to the suffering in contemporary war zones. The group walked from Auschwitz to Vienna, then travelled through Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. They crossed the front lines of the Bosnian war in Mostar and held a day of vigil, fasting and prayer there. The next leg took them through Israel, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan and Iraq.

The group travelled across the front lines in Cambodia, where they joined the [[Dhammayietra]], an annual Cambodian peace walk led by "the Gandhi of Cambodia" [[Maha Ghosananda]]. They then visited war sites in Vietnam and the Philippines before going to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

This walk was one of many peace pilgrimages organized by the Nipponzan Myōhōji monks, but it was the largest in scale, number of participants, time, and distance travelled.

Over 1000 people participated in at least part of the pilgrimage, including Buddhists, [[Quaker]]s, [[Catholic]]s, [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s. The pilgrimage received media attention and books were written about it.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===A Walk to Moscow===
[[File:Donna,_(Spirit),_Bradley_and_her_son_on_A_Walk_for_Survival,_Oregon_Coast,_April_22,_1980.jpeg|thumb|right|Donna Bradley and her son on A Walk For Survival, Oregon Coast, April 22, 1980]]
"A Walk to Moscow" was a peace walk, one of many walks for peace in the 20th century. These were specially organized by groups of [[pacifists]] and [[List_of_peace_activists|peace activists]] who wanted to make some protest against the politics of war and the use of chemical, biological and [[nuclear weapons]]. In the early 1960s, there was a walk across the United States, [[Europe]] and the [[USSR]] (its history is told in a book ''You Come with Naked Hands'' by [[Bradford Lyttle]].

In the 1980s, a group organized to walk across America and through Europe to [[Moscow]] to show solidarity with all people and to demonstrate in a grass roots way that all people are linked by their right to live on the earth in peace and safety. This walk was conceived by organizers while on another peace walk "A Walk for Survival" (from Santa Cruz, California to Washington State) in 1980. While at a requested meeting with the Russian Consulate in San Francisco one organizer, Jack Chalmers asked if we continued our walk across America, and Europe would we be allowed to walk to Moscow? The Consulate answered "of course". "A Walk for Survival" ended at Bangor, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State at the site of a Trident nuclear submarine base, and the organizers immediately started planning "A Walk to Moscow". The walk started in Bangor on March 1, 1981 and reached the East Coast in time to winter it out in [[Boston]], before flying to Europe in March 1982. The summer of 1982 was spent walking across the UK (with a side-tip to Ireland), France, Belgium, and [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (with a trip to [[West Berlin]] by bus which returned to its starting point in order for the walking route to continue uninterrupted.) The Walk operated by sending advance teams a few weeks ahead to cities and towns along a prospective path to set up press, speaking engagements and accommodations for the group. Decisions were made only by complete consensus, which often led to long and stormy meetings.

The [[German Democratic Republic]] had refused entry to the group, so they walked south to [[Bavaria]] and stayed there for the winter, while negotiating visas for [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]] and the USSR.  A Walk to Moscow (the indefinite article rather than the definite "The Walk" was important to many of the original walkers, as it implied that it was only one initiative, and others would hopefully follow.  The distinction was, however, lost on people in the Eastern countries of the route,as Slavonic languages do not have words for either an or the!) spent nearly a year in Europe working from an Old Mill in [[Regnitzlosau]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany. It was difficult to get the governments then in the [[Communist]] Bloc to allow the group to walk through their territory. While the group negotiated with the government of Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia the walkers visited many places on foot in Germany and gave talks to local Peace groups. Some members of the group got involved in [[passive resistance]] chaining themselves to railings over conscription in Germany or others fasted for peace in the world. Members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk.

In 1983 visas were obtained for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and a continuous walking route was planned and successfully carried out as far as the border between Poland and the USSR.

Relations with official "peace" groups in those countries were tricky, and the Czech government tried to incorporate the initiative into their showpiece pro-[[Warsaw Pact]] 1983 conference in [[Prague]] - however the group did not partake, although a few members lobbied delegates outside, and were invited in for one discussion).  Walking across the USSR was not permitted however.  The group entered and transited to [[Minsk]], then [[Smolensk]], hoping for some compromise in negotiations, but this did not happen.  At this point many of the members chose to return, and not go to Moscow; the others tried to walk to Moscow anyway, but were immediately apprehended and sent to rejoin the others in Minsk.  Some members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk. When the walk finished some people from the group talked at a [[CND]] rally about their work and the passive resistance movement. The group membership was international, people came from all over the world to join in and make a difference.

Some Walk to Moscow participants later met with other walks that crossed the U.S. and Europe, including [[Walk of the People - A Pilgrimage for Life]], which occurred from 1984 to 1985.

===Women Cross DMZ===
The [[Women Cross DMZ]] ([[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean demilitarized zone]]) group, which includes noted American feminist and activist [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Nobel Peace]] Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, and organizer [[Christine Ahn]] with other activist women members, have conducted a peace symposium in [[Pyongyang]] on May 20, 2015 and this women group walked across the DMZ, separating North and South Korea for peace on May 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3890280/gloria-steinem-north-korea-south-womencrossdmz/ | work=Time | first=Sabrina | last=Toppa | title=Gloria Steinem in North Korea for DMZ Peace March | date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/women-activists-defend-north-korea-trip-on-capitol-hill#.sx3Ll3DK&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pocong''', also known as '''wrapped ghost''', is an [[Indonesia]]n/[[Malaysia]]n [[ghost]] that is said to be the soul of a dead person trapped in its [[shroud]]. Known in Indonesia/Malaysia as ''kain kafan'', the shroud is the prescribed length of cloth used in [[Muslim]] burials to wrap the body of the dead person. The dead body is covered in white fabric tied over the [[head]], under the feet, and on the [[neck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bane|first1=Theresa|title=Encyclopedia of Spirits and Ghosts in World Mythology|date=2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476663555|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional beliefs, the soul of a dead person will stay on the [[Earth]] for 40 days after the death. If the ties over the shroud are not released after 40 days, the body is said to jump out from the grave to warn people that the soul needs to be released. After the ties are released, the soul will leave the Earth forever. Because of the tie under the feet, the ghost can't walk. This causes the pocong to hop like a rabbit. They also have the ability to fly and teleport.

==Popular culture==
Pocongs often appear in religion-based movies or TV serials. In the early 2000s (decade), TV stations in Indonesia purported to capture ghost appearances with their cameras and put the records on a specific show of their own. In these shows, the Pocong appearances could be seen very often, along with the [[kuntilanak]]. There was also a movie ''Pocong'' (2006) directed by [[Rudy Soedjarwo]], which was banned and censored in French and German DVD versions due to the disturbing, scary, and terrifying, scenes. Not long after it was banned, the director created a sequel less horrible but about the same story, ''Pocong 2'' (2006). Other titles ''Pocong 3'' (2007), ''The Real Pocong'' (2009), ''40 Hari Bangkitnya Pocong'' (2008) were introduced in the movie series in theaters in Indonesia.

Movie ''Pocong Jumat Kliwon'', directed by successful director Nayato Fio Nuala, began a trend of [[Horror comedy (genre)|horror comedy]] Pocong movies. 
In 2011 ''Pocong is also Pocong'', a new horror-comedy featuring Pocong, was made by female director Chiska Doppert, Nayato's former partner.

Other recent movies featuring Pocong are ''Sumpah, (Ini) Pocong!'' (2009), ''Pocong Setan Jompo'' (2009) and ''Kepergok Pocong'' (2011).

[[Image:PopielBis1581.jpg|thumb|Prince Popiel]]
[[Image:PL Kruszwica Mysia Wieza.JPG|thumb|The ''Mouse Tower'' in Kruszwica, constructed in 1350, incorrectly associated with Popiel]]

'''Prince Popiel ІІ''' (or Duke Popiel) was a legendary 9th century ruler of the West Slavic ("proto-[[Poland|Polish]]") tribe of [[Goplanie|Goplans]] and [[Polanie|Polans]] and the last member of the pre-[[Piast dynasty]], the [[Popielids]]. According to the chroniclers [[Gallus Anonymus]], [[Jan Długosz]], and [[Marcin Kromer]], as a consequence of his bad rule he was deposed, besieged by his subjects, and eaten alive by [[mice]] in a tower in [[Kruszwica]].

As the legend goes, Prince Popiel was a cruel and corrupt ruler who cared only for wine, women, and song. He was greatly influenced by his wife, a beautiful but power-hungry German princess.&lt;ref&gt;Popiel's wife is sometimes called Ryksa (''Hilderyka'', or ''Brunhilda''); however, her name was never specified by medieval chroniclers (see: [https://books.google.com/books?id=o_cKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=zona+Popiela&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MzR4-YInD6&amp;sig=f0P5FTYVX6f4nUERvEWDqPajNaM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5cpHS4LWKYfYsQPWlc31Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=zona%20Popiela&amp;f=false ''Historya narodu polskiego''], Volumes 3-4. By [[Adam Naruszewicz]], 1836. Chapter "Podług rękopisma Puławskiego")&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Popiel's misrule and his failure to defend the land from marauding [[Vikings]], his twelve uncles conspired to depose him; however, at his wife's instigation, he had them all poisoned during a feast (some believe that she committed the act herself). Instead of cremating their bodies as was the custom, he had the corpses cast into [[Gopło|Lake Gopło]].

When the commoners saw what Popiel and his wife had done, they rebelled. The couple took refuge in a tower near the lake. As the story goes, a throng of mice and rats (which had been feeding on the unburnt bodies of Popiel's uncles) rushed into the tower, chewed through the walls, and devoured Popiel and his wife alive. Prince Popiel was succeeded by [[Piast Kołodziej]] and [[Siemowit]].

On the shore of [[Gopło|Lake Gopło]] stands a medieval tower, nicknamed the ''Mouse Tower''; however, it bears no relation to the site of the events described in the legend as it was erected some 500 years thereafter.

'''Φ6''' ([[Phi (letter)|Phi]] 6) is the best-studied [[bacteriophage]] of the [[virus]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cystoviridae]].  It infects ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' bacteria (typically [[Plant pathology|plant-pathogenic]] ''[[Pseudomonas syringae|P. syringae]]'').  It has a three-part, segmented, [[RNA#Double-stranded RNA|double-stranded]] [[RNA]] [[genome]], totalling ~13.5 [[Base pair#Length unit|kb]] in length.  Φ6 and its relatives have a [[lipid membrane]] around their nucleo[[capsid]], a rare trait among bacteriophages.  It is a [[lytic]] [[phage]], though under certain circumstances has been observed to display a delay in lysis which may be described as a "carrier state".

== Life cycle of Φ6 ==

Φ6 typically attaches to the Type IV [[pilus]] of ''[[Pseudomonas|P. syringae]]'' with its attachment protein, P3. It is thought that the cell then retracts its pilus, pulling the phage toward the bacterium. Fusion of the [[viral envelope]] with the [[bacteria]]l [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] is facilitated by the phage [[protein]], P6. The muralytic ([[peptidoglycan]]-digesting) enzyme, P5, then digests a portion of the [[cell wall]], and the nucleocapsid enters the cell coated with the bacterial outer membrane.

A copy of the [[sense strand]] of the large genome segment (6374 [[base pair|bases]]) is then synthesized ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]) on the vertices of the [[capsid]], with the RNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]], P2, and released into the host cell [[cytosol]].  The four proteins [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] from the large segment spontaneously assemble into [[procapsids]], which then package a large segment sense strand, polymerizing its [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complement]] during entry through the P2 [[polymerase]]-containing vertices.
While the large segment is being translated (expressed) and synthesized (replicated), the parental phage releases copies of the sense strands of the medium segment (4061 bases) and small segment (2948 bases) into the [[cytosol]].  They are translated, and packaged into the procapsids in order: medium then small.  The filled capsids are then coated with the nucleocapsid protein P8, and then outer membrane proteins somehow attract bacterial [[Inner nuclear membrane|inner membrane]], which then envelopes the nucleocapsid.

The lytic protein, P5, is contained between the P8 nucleocapsid shell and the viral envelope.  The completed phage progeny remain in the cytosol until sufficient levels of the lytic protein P5 degrade the host cell wall. The cytosol then bursts forth, disrupting the outer membrane, releasing the phage. The bacterium is killed by this [[Lysis#Viral lysis|lysis]].

== RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Φ6 ==
RNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]]s (RdRPs) are critical components in the life cycle of [[Double-stranded RNA viruses|double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses]]. However, it is not fully understood how these important [[enzyme]]s function during viral replication. Expression and characterization of the purified recombinant RdRP of Φ6 is the first direct demonstration of RdRP activity catalyzed by a single [[protein]] from a [[Double-stranded RNA viruses|dsRNA virus]]. The recombinant Φ6 RdRP is highly active ''in vitro'', possesses RNA replication and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] activities, and is capable of using both [[Homologous recombination|homologous]] and [[heterologous]] [[RNA]] [[molecule]]s as templates. The crystal structure of the Φ6 polymerase, solved in complex with a number of ligands, provides insights towards understanding the mechanism of primer-independent initiation of RNA-dependent [[RNA polymerization]]. This RNA polymerase appears to operate without a sigma factor/subunit. The purified Φ6 RdRP displays processive elongation ''in vitro'' and self-assembles along with polymerase complex proteins into subviral particles that are fully functional.&lt;ref name=Koivunen&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnav|author=Koivunen|year=2008|chapter=Structure-Function Insights Into the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of the dsRNA Bacteriophage &amp;Phi;6|title=Segmented Double-stranded RNA Viruses: Structure and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press| ISBN =978-1-904455-21-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Φ6 research ==
Φ6 has been studied as a model to understand how segmented [[Double-stranded RNA viruses|RNA viruses]] package their genomes, its structure has been studied by scientists interested in [[lipid]]-containing bacteriophages, and it has been used as a model organism to test [[evolutionary]] theory such as [[Muller's ratchet]]. Phage Φ6 has been used extensively in additional [[phage experimental evolution]] studies.

'''Research in Computational Molecular Biology''' ('''RECOMB''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. The conference has been held every year since 1997 and is a major international conference in computational biology, alongside the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|ISMB]] and [[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] conferences.&lt;ref name=eccb-2010-editorial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreau|first1=Y|last2=Heringa|first2=J|title=Yves Moreau and Jaap Heringa, on behalf of the ECCB10 organizing and steering committees.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Sep 15, 2010|volume=26|issue=18|pages=i412–3|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq482|pmid=20823300|pmc=2935438}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference is affiliated with the [[International Society for Computational Biology]]. Since the first conference, authors of accepted proceedings papers have been invited to submit a revised version to a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Computational Biology]]''.&lt;ref name=jcb-partnership&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnerships|url=http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/partnership.html|accessdate=8 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809091409/http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/partnership.html|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RECOMB was established in 1997 by Sorin Istrail, [[Pavel Pevzner]] and [[Michael Waterman]]. The first conference was held at the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=recomb2014-proceedings /&gt;

A series of RECOMB Satellite meetings was established by [[Pavel Pevzner]] in 2001. These meetings cover specialist aspects of bioinformatics, including [[massively parallel sequencing]], [[comparative genomics]], [[Regulation of gene expression|regulatory genomics]] and bioinformatics education.&lt;ref name=satellites&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMB - Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology - History - RECOMB Satellite Workshops|url=http://www.recomb.org/22481/RECOMB-Satellite-Workshops|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of RECOMB 2010, the conference has included a highlights track, modelled on the success of a similar track at the ISMB conference. The highlights track contains presentations for computational biology papers published in the previous 18 months.&lt;ref name=recomb2014-proceedings /&gt;&lt;ref name=recomb-2010-highlights&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMB 2010 - Highlights Track|url=http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/highlights.html|accessdate=11 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323003759/http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/highlights.html|archivedate=23 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 RECOMB and ''[[PLOS Computational Biology]]'' coordinated to let authors submit papers in parallel to both conference and journal. Papers not selected for publication in ''PLOS Computational Biology'' were published in edited form in the ''Journal of Computational Biology'' as usual.&lt;ref name=recomb2014-proceedings /&gt;&lt;ref name=plos-biologue&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pick of RECOMB 2014 - PLOS Biologue|url=http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2014/03/27/pick-recomb-2014/|website=http://blogs.plos.org|publisher=PLOS|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roman Postl''' (born 1969 in [[Proboštov]] - died September 8, 2008 in [[Chomutov]]) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[mass murderer]] and drug addict who killed five people. The first murder was committed in 1998, for which he was sentenced for murder and stayed in prison for 13 years. In April 2008 he was prematurely released for good behaviour. At a gas station in [[Předlice]] in [[Ústí nad Labem]], he murdered Jiří Šťovíček. He shot him in the head and stole 15,000 [[CZK|crowns]] and a notebook.

Postl died in a Chomutov hospital where he was taken with gunfire wounds suffered from a firefight with the police after the murder of Van Tinh. During the shootout, intervening police officer Roman Jedlička was also injured, also dying in a hospital from his wounds. Roman Postl was 39 years old at the time of his death.

'''Shanti Devi''' (11 December 1926 – 27 December 1987) was born in [[Delhi]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=rawat&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.prebirthexperience.com/The%20Life%20Beyond.htm|title=The Life Beyond: Through the eyes of Children who Claim to Remember Previous Lives|author=K. S. Rawat, T. Rivas|journal=The Journal of Religion and Psychical Research|volume=28|number=3|pages=126–136|date=July 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525000209/http://www.prebirthexperience.com/The%20Life%20Beyond.htm|archivedate=2012-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a little girl in the 1930s she began to claim to remember details of a past life. The case was brought to the attention of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] who set up a commission to investigate; a report was published in 1936.&lt;ref name=report&gt;L. D. Gupta, N. R. Sharma, T. C. Mathur, ''An Inquiry into the Case of Shanti Devi'', International Aryan League, Delhi, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Two further reports were written at the time. The report by Bal Chand Nahata was published as a Hindi booklet by the name ''Punarjanma Ki Paryalochana''. In this, he stated that "'Whatever material that has come before us, does not warrant us to conclude that Shanti Devi has 'former life recollections or that this case proves reincarnation".&lt;ref&gt;Nahata, Bal Chand. ''Punarjanma Ki Paryyalochana''. Calcutta: Buddiwadi Songh. (Undated.)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was disputed by Indra Sen in an article later.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Indra. "Shantidevi Further Investigated". ''Proceedings of the India Philosophical Congress''. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; A further report, based on interviews conducted in 1936, was published in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Bose, Suskil C. ''A Case of Reincarnation'', Calcutta: Satsang, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life Shanti Devi was interviewed again, and a Swedish author who had visited her twice published a book about the case in 1994; the English translation appeared in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Sture Lönnerstrand, ''Shanti Devi: En berättelse om reinkarnation.'' Stockholm 1994. English translation: ''I Have Lived Before: The True Story of the Reincarnation of Shanti Devi'', Ozark Mountain Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-886940-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reincarnation==
According to these accounts, when she was about four years old, she told her parents that her real home was in [[Mathura]] where her husband lived, about 145&amp;nbsp;km from her home in Delhi. Discouraged by her parents, she ran away from home at age six, trying to reach Mathura. Back home, she stated in school that she was married and had died ten days after having given birth to a child. Interviewed by her teacher and headmaster, she used words from the Mathura dialect and divulged the name of her merchant husband, "Kedar Nath". The headmaster located a merchant by that name in Mathura who had lost his wife, Lugdi Devi, nine years earlier, ten days after having given birth to a son. Kedar Nath traveled to Delhi, pretending to be his own brother, but Shanti Devi immediately recognized him and Lugdi Devi's son. As she knew several details of Kedar Nath's life with his wife, he was soon convinced that Shanti Devi was indeed the [[reincarnation]] of Lugdi Devi. When Mahatma Gandhi heard about the case, he met the child and set up a commission to investigate. The commission traveled with Shanti Devi to Mathura, arriving on 15 November 1935. There she recognized several family members, including the grandfather of Lugdi Devi. She found out that Kedar Nath had neglected to keep a number of promises he had made to Lugdi Devi on her deathbed. She then traveled home with her parents. The commission's report concluded that Shanti Devi was indeed the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Personal life==
Shanti Devi did not marry. She told her story again at the end of the 1950s, and once more in 1986 when she was interviewed by [[Ian Stevenson]] and K.S. Rawat. In this interview she also related her [[near death experience]]s when Lugdi Devi died.&lt;ref name=rawat/&gt; K.S. Rawat continued his investigations in 1987, and the last interview took place only four days before her death on 27 December 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After Life Death: fact or Fiction|newspaper=Sunday Post ([[Kathmandu Post]])|date=14 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silvio Coucci''' (1914 - January 5, 1942) was an American [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] [[jockey]].

A New Yorker, in 1931 Silvio Coucci rode [[Thoroughbred]]s at [[Agua Caliente racetrack]] in [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]] under contract with brothers John and George Coburn. His performance brought him to the attention of the extremely wealthy [[Payne Whitney|Mrs. Payne Whitney]], owner of the prominent [[Greentree Stable]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]]. Mrs. Whitney bought out Coucci's contract and in 1932 the seventeen-year-old jockey burst onto the American racing scene with such success that he was being hailed as "The second [[Earl Sande]]." That year he rode Greentree Stable's Easy Play to victory in the [[Spinaway Stakes]] and for owner [[Morton L. Schwartz]] was aboard [[Gusto (horse)|Gusto]] for his wins in the 1932 [[American Derby]] as well as in the [[Arlington Classic]] which at the time had the largest [[Purse distribution|purse]] of any American horse race.

Coucci's career continued to flourish and in 1934 his victories included the [[California Breeders' Champion Stakes|Christmas Stakes]], in California and on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], [[New York (state)|New York's]] [[Suburban Handicap]]. He wound up the year second in the jockey standings behind [[Wayne D. Wright]] then the following year was the [[United States Champion Jockey by earnings]] with $319,760 in purse money. Riding at race tracks across the United States, some of his important wins en route to the 1935 jockey title came in the [[Santa Anita Derby]], [[Alabama Stakes]], [[Travers Stakes]] and the [[Belmont Futurity Stakes|Futurity Stakes]] aboard that year's [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse|Champion 2-Year-Old Colt]], [[Tintagel (horse)|Tintagel]]. 

During his career, Silvio Coucci rode for other notable owners such as [[Isabel Dodge Sloane]], [[William Robertson Coe|William R. Coe]], [[Alexander Pantages]] and [[Alfred G. Vanderbilt II]] for whom he won the 1939 [[San Vicente Stakes]].

On January 5, 1942 [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine reported that 27-year-old Silvio Coucci died as the result of a leap or fall from a hotel window in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]].

'''''The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock''''' is a 1994 [[action game|side scrolling action]] [[video game]] by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The story of the game is generally based on the 1960s ''[[The Flintstones]]'' cartoon series. The title is a reference to the 1927 novel ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' by [[B. Traven]] and its [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|1948 film adaptation]].

In the opening story of the game, the Water Buffalos' leader decides to retire. As his last decree as Great Poobah, he makes a contest in which whoever finds the Treasure of Sierra Madrock will be his successor. In the game, [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]] must find the treasure before any other Buffalo member (or even their wives, Wilma and Betty). The game features passwords that must be written down in order to continue the game from the highest level reached.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/flintstones-the-treasure-of-sierra-madrock| title = Story/designer information | publisher = [[MobyGames]] | date = | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flintstone boss.png|thumb|right|Players encounter a variety of enemies that must be dispatched using a club.]]

==Gameplay==
[[File:FlintstonesTreasureofSierraMadrockSNESHenpeckedHusbandBarney.png|250px|left|thumb|Barney has encountered his wife Betty, who drags him back to a previous location on the map.]]

The game itself first involves a [[Overworld|world map]] representing a [[Level (video gaming)|themed set of worlds]]. Rolling the dice results in either Fred or Barney moving to the appropriate space on the board. Depending on the landed space, the player must clear a level in that particular world, defeat bosses, or enter shops, among other things. On some zones, Wilma and Betty appear and if any one of them manage to meet their respective husband, she will drag him some spaces back to an arbitrary location.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; Moving the players in the game is similar to playing a Japanese [[sugoroku]] board game.&lt;ref name="35atwiki"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www35.atwiki.jp/sfcall/pages/525.html| title = Movement/difficulty information |language=Japanese| publisher = SFC no Game Seiha Shimasho | date = | accessdate = 2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The levels themselves are simple [[platform game|platformer]] segments.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; In these segments, the characters must traverse from left to right (and sometimes right to left), while avoiding hazards and defeating [[dinosaur]]s, Water Buffalo members or other [[Animal|creature]]s. In order to defeat enemies, Fred and Barney use a [[wood]] club.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cheats.ign.com/objects/006/006461.html| title = Basic information | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an overall difficulty level of "medium" to the game; providing frequent breaks from the low-difficulty horizontal scrolling action stages with mini-games that have a high level of difficulty.&lt;ref name="35atwiki"/&gt; There are also powerups such as brontoburger (energy) and clams (in-game currency). In a few cases, a powerup is a trap in which the Cavemouse appears, being followed by Dino. Unlike the TV show, Dino actually hurts the player if he is hit by him.

The earlier zones in the game can only be cleared by first defeating specific Water Buffalo members (most of which appeared at some point in the cartoon series) by winning them in a race located at a stadium.&lt;ref name="35atwiki"/&gt; Races use the game's [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to simulate variables like forward speed, leaning angle, maximum terrain speed, and vertical speed. These events must be found as their items are crucial to the success of the quest.&lt;ref name="35atwiki"/&gt; If any character go to the stadium, the race can be practiced. The person who operates the racing mini-game will give an item to both Fred and Barney after defeating him, so that they can go the next world.

The types of worlds involved include Bedrock, Snowrock (an ice world), and Magmarock (a fire world), amongst other worlds present in the game. Within each world are mini-game challenges that allow players to experience the diversity of that world.

==Reception==
''[[GamePro]]'' gave the game a negative review, summarizing, "Intermediate gamers will find this game repetitive and way too easy. Everyone else will find themselves leaving the cave for some fresh air rather than being stuck with this humdrum rock-knocker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: The Flintstones|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=59|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xenology''' is the scientific study of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Derived from the Greek ''xenos'', which as a substantive has the meaning "stranger, wanderer, refugee" and as an adjective "foreign, alien, strange, unusual."&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', new (ninth) edition, with a supplement, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== In science fiction ===
It is used to denote a hypothetical science whose object of study would be extraterrestrial societies developed by alien lifeforms. In science fiction criticism and studies the term has been advocated by writers such as [[David Brin]] ("Xenology: The New Science of Asking 'Who's Out There?'" ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', 26 April 1983)&lt;ref&gt;Brian M. Stableford, ''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2006, p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt; as an analogue of (terrestrial) [[ethnology]]. By extension the term may also refer to the fictional creation of "alternative humankinds".&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instances in which Xenology was referred to in a work of Science Fiction include the [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky| Brothers Strugatsky's]] 1972 novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]''. In section three of which one of the character's, a noble laureate by the name of Valentine Pillman, explains Xenology as "an unnatural mixture of science fiction and formal logic. At its core is a flawed assumption—that an alien race would be psychologically human."&lt;ref name="StrugatskyStrugatsky2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arkady Strugatsky|author2=Boris Strugatsky|title=Roadside Picnic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92|date=16 September 2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-365-40085-8|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In cultural studies ===
The term xenology was employed by German [[Indologist]] [[Wilhelm Halbfass]] in his ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'' (India and Europe: Perspectives on Their Spiritual Encounter) (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', Schwabe Verlag, Basel and Stuttgart, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the study of the ethnocentric views held by societies with regard to different classes of foreigner, in other words the positive or negative ways in which a given culture defines those outside or alien to it.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Killingley, "Mlecchas, Yavanas and Heathens: Interacting Xenologies in Early Nineteenth-Century Calcutta," in ''Beyond Orientalism: The Work of Wilhelm Halbfass and its Impact on Indian and Cross-cultural Studies'', ed. Eli Franco, Karin Preisendanz, Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenology is thus the study of the various modalities whereby self and otherness are defined "within a historically complex collision of cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Harvey P. Alper, review of ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', in ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (April, 1983), pp. 189-196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Freitas|Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] self-published a book on the subject, ''Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization'' (XRI, 1979). Freitas argued for the primacy of the term in the context of extraterrestrial life in a 1983 letter to the journal Nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Nature 301(13 January 1983):106 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v301/n5896/full/301106a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Correspondence to Nature Vol. 301(13), 13 January 1983, p 106. http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/NamingETL.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
