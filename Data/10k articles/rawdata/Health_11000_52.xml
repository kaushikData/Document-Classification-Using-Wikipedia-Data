The '''2009 flu pandemic''' hit [[Africa]] two months later than other continents with the first case reported in [[Egypt]] on June 2, 2009. As of December 1, 30 countries in Africa had reported cases and 7 countries in Africa had reported a total of 108 deaths.
 
Symptoms of H1N1 swine flu are like regular flu symptoms and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Many people with swine flu have had diarrhea and vomiting, but these symptoms can also be caused by many other conditions. That means that you and your doctor can't know, just based on your symptoms, if you've got swine flu. Healthcare professionals may offer a rapid flu test, although a negative result doesn't mean you don't have the flu. The accuracy of the test depends on the quality of the manufacturer’s test, the sample collection method, and how much of the virus a person is emitting at the time of testing.

Like seasonal flu, pandemic swine flu can cause neurological symptoms in children. These events are rare, but, as cases associated with seasonal flu have shown, they can be very severe and often fatal. Symptoms include seizures or changes in mental status (confusion or sudden cognitive or behavioral changes). It's not clear why these symptoms occur, although they may be caused by Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome usually occurs in children with a viral illness who have taken aspirin -- something that should always be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/features/swine-flu-faq-1?page=2|title=Swine Flu Symptoms - What Is Swine Flu - H1N1 Influenza A - Swine Flu Treatment|work=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case of swine influenza was detected in Algeria on June 20. This was an Algerian national, resident in [[Frankfurt]] and coming from [[Miami]] with her two children.

This first case was detected at [[Houari Boumediene Airport]]. Many Algerian immigrants and tourists were arriving during this holiday period, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. The woman suffering from flu was immediately transferred to the hospital of El-Kettar’ in [[Algiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/1491.html|title=Ennahar Online - First case of swine flu identified in Algeria|work=ennaharonline.com|access-date=2009-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031161912/http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/1491.html|archive-date=2009-10-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, a British medical student became the first confirmed case of swine flu in Kenya. The student, who was in a group of 33, was in Kenya to attend a series of medical camps in Nyanza province. The whole group was quarantined in their hotel in [[Kisumu]] while undergoing treatment.

There was a panic in [[Nairobi]] as mobile text messages circulated warning people to stay away from Sarit centre, a popular commercial establishment where another suspected case had been diagnosed. The patient's test results, however, came back negative for the H1N1 virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kenya_confirms_first_swine_flu_case|title=Kenya confirms first swine flu case|work=wikinews.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://swineflu.ushahidi.com/reports/view/764 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924061038/http://swineflu.ushahidi.com/reports/view/764 |archive-date=2009-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jlzMvITjfWhY0IePXScfbIeaoToA&lt;/ref&gt;

}}Dr '''Alice Mary Stewart''', ''née'' '''Naish''' (4 October 1906{{spaced ndash}}3 June 2002) was a British physician and [[epidemiologist]] specialising in [[social medicine]] and the effects of [[radiation]] on health. Her study of radiation-induced illness among workers at the [[Hanford Site|Hanford plutonium production plant]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]],  is frequently cited by those who seek to demonstrate that even very low doses of radiation cause substantial hazard. She was the first person to demonstrate the link between [[X-ray|x-rays]] of [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] women and disease in their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/04/world/alice-stewart-95-linked-x-rays-to-diseases.html|title=Alice Stewart, 95; Linked X-Rays to Diseases|last=McCoubrey|first=Carmel|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 1986.

==Early life==
Stewart was born in [[Sheffield]], England, the daughter of two physicians, Lucy (née Wellburn) and Albert Naish. Both were pioneers in paediatrics, and both became heroes in Sheffield for their dedication to children's welfare. Alice studied [[Medical school in the United Kingdom#Lecture-based learning|pre-clinical medicine]] at [[Girton College, Cambridge]], and in 1932 completed her clinical studies at the [[Royal Free Hospital]], London. She gained experienced in hospital posts in Manchester and London, before returning to the Royal Free Hospital as a [[Specialist registrar|registrar]]. In 1941 she took a teaching post at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|Oxford University Medical School]], and it was here she developed her interest in social medicine, advising on health problems experienced by wartime [[munitions]] workers.

==Epidemiological studies==
The department of social and preventive medicine at Oxford was created in 1942, with Stewart as assistant head. In 1950 she succeeded as head of the unit, but to her disappointment she was not granted the title of "professor", as awarded to her predecessor, because by then the post was considered not to be of great importance.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;  Nonetheless, in 1953 the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] allocated funds to her pioneering study of [[x-rays]] as a cause of childhood cancer, which she worked on from 1953 until 1956. Her results were initially regarded as unsound. Her findings on fetal damage caused by x-rays of pregnant women were eventually accepted worldwide and the use of medical x-rays during pregnancy and early childhood was curtailed as a result (although it took around two and a half decades).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Alice M; J.W. Webb; B.D. Giles; D. Hewitt, 1956. "Preliminary Communication: Malignant Disease in Childhood and Diagnostic Irradiation In-Utero," ''Lancet'', 1956, 2: 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart retired in 1974.

Her most famous investigation came after her formal retirement, while an honorary member of the department of social medicine at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Working with Professor [[Thomas Mancuso]] of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] she examined the sickness records of employees in the Hanford plutonium production plant, Washington state, and found a far higher incidence of radiation-induced ill health than was noted in official studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mancuso|first=Thomas|last2=Stewart|first2= Alice|last3= Kneale|first3= George|date=November 1977|title=Radiation exposures of Hanford workers dying from cancer and other causes|journal=Health Physics|publisher=Health Physics Society|location=MacLean VA|volume=33|pages=369–385|issn=1538-5159| pmid = 591314|doi=10.1097/00004032-197711000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Richard Doll]], the epidemiologist respected for his work on smoking-related illnesses, attributed her anomalous findings to a "questionable" statistical analysis supplied by her assistant, [[George Kneale]] (who was aware of, but may have miscalculated, the unintentional "over-reporting" of cancer diagnoses in communities near to the works). Stewart herself acknowledged that her results were outside the range considered statistically significant.&lt;ref name="KnealeStewart1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alice|last2=Kneale|first2= George|year=1978|title=Low-dose radiation|journal=The Lancet|volume=312|issue=8083|pages=262–263|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(78)91772-5|quote=[our] approach requires either much larger doses than were encountered in the Hanford study or a much larger data base}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=John|date=November 1980|title=On cancer and radiation|journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]|location=Chicago, IL|volume=36|issue=9|page=59|quote=The 90 percent confidence interval is bounded by the range from 380 to 448 cancer deaths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6983">'''Alvan R. Feinstein''' (December 4, 1925 – October 25, 2001) was a clinician, a [[researcher]] and an [[epidemiologist]] who made significant impact on clinical investigation, especially on the field of clinical epidemiology that he helped define.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01039-2 |title=Alvan Feinstein: |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=112 |issue=6 |pages=502–503 |year=2002 |last1=Goldman |first1=Lee }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as one of the fathers of modern clinical [[epidemiology]]. He died at the age of 75 in Toronto on 25 October 2001 and is survived by his wife and two children.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;O'Connor A. Dr. Alvan Feinstein, 75, Innovator in Diagnoses, Dies. October 29, 2001 New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Philadelphia]], Feinstein received his bachelor's degree (BSc 1947) and master's degree (MSc, 1948) at the [[University of Chicago]].  Feinstein received his medical degree (MD, 1952) at the [[University of Chicago School of Medicine]].  He completed his residency training in [[Internal Medicine]] at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]].  He was Board Certified in [[Internal Medicine]] in 1955 and became the medical director of Irvington House Institute (which later became part of New York University Langone Medical Center).&lt;ref name=JournalofEducationalSociology&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2263627 |jstor=2263627 |title=Convalescent Care in Rheumatic Fever: Irvington House |journal=The Journal of Educational Sociology |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=468–476 |last1=Anderson |first1=Harold C |year=1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he studied patients with [[rheumatic fever]] and challenged the belief that proper treatment after an early diagnosis kept those patients from developing severe heart disease later in life.  He demonstrated that the disease had different forms including one which causes joint pain and seldom progresses to heart disease. The other, which does result in heart disease, has no symptoms to evoke early detection. Thus, diagnosis of the disease at an early stage leads to a favorable outcome not because of early treatment but because those patients tend to have a less-virulent form.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

In 1962, Feinstein joined the [[Yale University School of Medicine]] faculty and became the founding director of its Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program in 1974. Under his direction, the program became recognized as one of the leading centers for training in clinical research methods.&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=3234{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was widely known for his incredible gifts for mentoring bringing a passion to academic medicine and the art of becoming an academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ambp.2008.07.008 |pmid=19084781 |title=The Making and the Being of an Academic (Ambulatory) Pediatrician |journal=Ambulatory Pediatrics |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=345–348 |year=2008 |last1=Leventhal |first1=John M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published his first paper as a medical student in 1951 and more than 400 throughout his career. He wrote six major textbooks, two of which, ''Clinical Judgment'' (1967) and ''Clinical Epidemiology'' (1985) are among the most widely referenced books in clinical epidemiology.  He completed the last one, ''Principles of medical statistics'' (2002), just before his death. At the time of his death he was the [[Sterling Professor]] of Medicine and Epidemiology, the Yale School of Medicine's most prestigious academic position.&lt;ref&gt;http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2001/10/31/alvan-feinstein-dies-at-age-75/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.56.5.328 |title=The teacher's teacher: A personal tribute to Alvan R Feinstein |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=328–329 |year=2002 |last1=Spitzer |first1=W O }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His editorial work included that of the Journal of Chronic Diseases (1982–1988) and he founded and was editor of the [[Journal of Clinical Epidemiology]] (1988–2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.56.5.322 |title=Alvan R Feinstein |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=322 |year=2002 |last1=Knottnerus |first1=J A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
During his career, Feinstein garnered numerous recognitions and awards; including the [[Francis Gilman Blake]] Award as outstanding teacher to Yale medical students (1969), Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award from the [[American College of Physicians]] (1982), Robert J. Glaser Annual Award from the Society for General Internal Medicine (1987), [[J. Allyn Taylor International Prize in Medicine]] (1987), [[Gairdner Foundation International Award]] (1993), and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from [[McGill University]] (1997). In 1991, Feinstein was named the [[Sterling Professor]] of Medicine and Epidemiology, Yale University's most prestigious academic honor.&lt;ref name=Yale /&gt;

==Relationship with the tobacco industry==
In his later years, controversy marred his career with claims that he may have helped the [[tobacco industry]] by publishing articles minimizing the deleterious effects of smoking.&lt;ref name="Yach"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1745 |pmc=1446867 |title=Junking Science to Promote Tobacco |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1745–1748 |year=2001 |last1=Yach |first1=Derek |last2=Bialous |first2=Stella Aguinaga }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of Feinstein's publications in 2002 concluded that "perhaps in hindsight Feinstein could be criticized for not having clearly indicated the sponsorship of the tobacco industry behind these publications, of which he was fully aware. However, this does not suffice to infer that he was the tobacco industry's man. Feinstein's attitude in matters of publication appears balanced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00526-7 |title=The controversial controversy of a passionate controversialist |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=1207–1213 |year=2002 |last1=Morabia |first1=Alfredo }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this review, an invited article written soon after Feinstein's death and published in the [[Journal of Clinical Epidemiology]], may not be unbiased. For the fourteen years preceding his death, Feinstein was Editor in Chief of this journal, which was the publication outlet for numerous articles and opinion pieces by Feinstein and his colleagues that aimed to debunk the research on tobacco, for which role the journal was subsequently criticized.&lt;ref name=Yach /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2136">In [[psychometrics]], an '''anchor test''' is a common set of [[Test (student assessment)|test]] items administered in combination with two or more alternative forms of the test with the aim of establishing the equivalence of the [[test score]]s on the alternative forms.  The purpose of the anchor test is to provide a baseline for an [[equating]] analysis between different forms of a test.&lt;ref name="KolenBrennan"&gt;Kolen, M.J., &amp; Brennan, R.L. (1995). Test Equating.  New York: Spring.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anchor test''' is one type of psychological assessment tool to measure an individual's knowledge or cognitive ability by testing the same areas in different ways. In psychometrics, to develop assessment tools that are reliable for testing certain skills and abilities are what most Psychometricists are interested in. Anchor tests are not intended to test the subject's ability to take tests, interpret questions, or understand a concept that is unrelated to the test questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=C.B|title=What is an anchor test|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-anchor-test.htm|website=Wisegeek|publisher=2003-2015 Conjecture Corporation|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it eliminates the incongruency between what the test is designed to assess and what it actually assesses. Subjects will be tested on the same knowledge and skills in multiple ways in an anchor test. Compared with traditional tests in both education and psychology, anchor tests are intended to find out what an individual is able to do rather than what an individual is unable to do. A study examined that higher anchor test to total test correlation leads to better equating then implies that an anchor test with items of medium difficulty may lead to better equating.&lt;ref name="A Note on the Choice of an Anchor Test in Equating"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Note on the Choice of an Anchor Test in Equating|url=http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/RR-12-14.pdf|website=ets.org |publisher=Educational Testing Service|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42503">Within the United States, the use of [[asbestos]] is limited by state and federal regulations and legislation. Improper use of asbestos and injury from exposure is addressed through administrative action, litigation, and criminal prosecution. Injury claims arising from asbestos exposure may be tried as [[mass tort]]s.

==Civil litigation==
Asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass tort in U.S. history, involving more than 8,000 defendants and 700,000 claimants.&lt;ref name="lloyds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Stranded Assets: the transition to a low carbon conomy|url=https://www.lloyds.com/~/media/files/news-and-insight/risk-insight/2017/stranded-assets.pdff|website=Lloyd's|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, "more than half of the 25 largest asbestos manufacturers in the US, including Amatex, Carey-Canada, Celotex, [[Eagle-Picher]], Forty-Eight Insulations, Manville Corporation, [[National Gypsum]], Standard Insulation, Unarco, and [[Rohn Industries|UNR Industries]] had declared [[bankruptcy]]. Analysts have estimated that the total costs of asbestos litigation in the U.S. alone will eventually reach $200 to $275&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="lloyds"/&gt; The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.

Claims made against employers by injured workers will typically be in the form of a [[Workers' compensation|workers compensation]] claim, although the long onset for diseases such as mesothelioma may make it impossible for a worker to pursue workers' compensation benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopkins|first1=Jamie S.|title=Disease victims often shut out of workers' comp system|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/04/18816/disease-victims-often-shut-out-workers-comp-system|website=The Center for Public Integrity|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for an injured worker to also bring a [[product liability]] claim against a third party that is responsible for introducing asbestos into the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Mesothelioma and Asbestosis - Asbestos Law and Litigation|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/environmental_law/mesothelioma.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos lawsuits in the U.S. have included the following as defendants:

===Common defenses===

====Third-party liability====
Manufacturers of machinery in which asbestos-containing parts were used have contested liability on the grounds that nearly all of them either did not ship asbestos-containing parts with their products at all (that is, asbestos was installed only by end users) or did not sell replacement parts for their own products (in cases where the plaintiff was allegedly exposed well after any factory-original asbestos-containing parts would have been replaced), and either way cannot be responsible for toxic third-party parts that they did not manufacture, distribute, or sell. In 2008, the [[Washington Supreme Court]], the first [[state supreme court]] to reach the issue, decided in favor of the defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Braaten v. Saberhagen Holdings'', 165 Wn.2d 373, 198 P.3d 493 (2008) and ''Simonetta v. Viad Corp.'', 165 Wn.2d 341, 197 P.3d 127 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of California]] also decided in favor of the defense in ''O'Neil v. Crane Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''O'Neil v. Crane Co.'', 53 Cal.4th 335, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 288, 266 P.3d 987 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chrysotile vs. amphibole====
Another area of dispute remains the so-called [[chrysotile]]-defense. Manufacturers of some products containing only [[chrysotile]] fibers claim that these are not as harmful as [[amphibole]]-containing products. As 95% of the products used in the United States historically were mostly chrysotile, this claim is widely disputed by health officials and medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Straif K. The Carcinogenicity of Asbestos – Evaluations by IARC and WHO, Recent Developments and Global Burden of Asbestos-Related Cancer. Abstract SY02-07 of paper presented during Symposia: Asbestos – A Global Disaster in Seoul, Korea. Page 28-29, Collection of Conference Abstracts of The XVIII World Congress on Safety and Health at Work.&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Health Organization recognizes that exposure to all types of asbestos fibers, including chrysotile, can cause cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovary, [[mesothelioma]], and [[asbestosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ipcs/assessment/public_health/chrysotile_asbestos_summary.pdf|title=Chrysotile Asbestos|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethics====
Defendants in asbestos litigation have accused the lawyers who represent plaintiffs of unethical conduct, but those allegations have not been successful in stopping the litigation, nor have courts been sufficiently convinced by the allegations to sanction the law firms against whom the allegations have been raised.&lt;ref name="Screen1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brickman|first1=Lester|title=Ethical Issues in Asbestos Litigation|journal=Hofstra Law Review|date=6 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Screening and solicitation: Defense firms allege that most lawsuits involving claims for non-malignant asbestos injuries are generated by asbestos screening companies, firms that are generally closely connected to trial lawyers but are run by people with no medical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Shannon P.|title=Companies Seek Dismissal of Thousands of Asbestos Cases|url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=900005549788/Companies-Seek-Dismissal-of-Thousands-of-Asbestos-Cases?slreturn=20170805133935|accessdate=5 September 2017|agency=The Legal Intelligencer|publisher=ALM Media Properties, LLC|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal scholars suggest that because lawyers often find screening companies using union locals as intermediaries the rule is not violated.&lt;ref name="Screen1"/&gt; Defendants also allege that plaintiffs' obtain diagnoses from physicians who do not follow proper standards when testing patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pal|first1=Shalmali|title=The back story on asbestos x-ray B readers|url=http://www.auntminnie.com/index.aspx?sec=ser&amp;sub=def&amp;pag=dis&amp;ItemID=62862|website=AuntMinnie.com|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=7 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excessive legal fees: Defendants have attempted to claim that contingency fees in asbestos cases are unreasonable, because the cases may not involve much risk or effort on the part of the plaintiff's lawyer. However, these claims have proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Screen1"/&gt;
* Product identification: As product identification is the most important part of preparing witnesses in asbestos cases, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they were exposed to enough asbestos for a long enough time derived from the product of a particular defendant in order to win their claim. Defendants have claimed that plaintiffs' lawyers manipulate their clients to identify solvent companies as suppliers instead of those that have filed for bankruptcy. No court has accepted this allegation.&lt;ref name="Screen1"/&gt;

===Asbestos bankruptcy trusts===
Since the bankruptcy filing of Johns-Manville in 1984, many U.S. and U.K. asbestos manufacturers have avoided litigation by filing bankruptcy. Asbestos bankruptcy trusts are personal injury [[Trust law|trust]]s established by firms that have filed for reorganization under [[Chapter 11]] of the [[United States Bankruptcy Code]] to pay [[personal injury]] claims caused by exposure to asbestos. At least fifty-six trusts were established from the mid-1970s through 2011.&lt;ref name="trustbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Lloyd|last2=McGovern|first2=Geoffrey|title=Asbestos Bankruptcy Trusts and Tort Compensation|date=2011|publisher=Rand Institute for Civil Justice|location=Santa Monica, California|isbn=9780833058348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest 26 of these trusts paid about 2.4 million claims totaling about $10.9 billion up to 2008.&lt;ref name="trustbook"/&gt; The trusts are governed by trust advisory committees that are generally controlled by lawyers from a few prominent law firms such as [[Baron &amp; Budd, P.C.]] and [[Weitz &amp; Luxenberg P.C.]]&lt;ref name="ForbesOne"/&gt;

Bankruptcy trusts may pay pennies on the dollar to people injured as a result of asbestos exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Hensler|first2=Deborah R.|last3=Gross|first3=Jennifer|last4=Sloss|first4=Elizabeth M.|last5=Schonlau|first5=Matthias|title=Asbestos Litigation|date=7 July 2005|publisher=Rand Corporation|isbn=0833040529|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sww7qFnHR-MC&amp;pg=PA102}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, these trusts may permit larger numbers of claimants to receive some kind of compensation, even if greatly reduced from potential recoveries in the tort system.

====Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement====
The federal Medicare Secondary Payer law imposes penalties for paying settlements directly to claimants without repaying the government for medical costs covered under the same programs under the legal doctrine of [[subrogation]].&lt;ref name="ForbesOne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Daniel|title=State AGs Probe Asbestos Bankruptcy Trusts To Recover Medicare Payments|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2017/03/20/state-ags-probe-asbestos-bankruptcy-trusts-to-recover-medicare-payments/#3d27ac047ce2|accessdate=14 April 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2016, attorneys general from 13 states sent demand letters to bankruptcy trusts for [[Armstrong World Industries]], [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], DII, and [[Owens Corning]]. The purpose of the demand letters was to determine if the funds are reimbursing states for medical treatment received under [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Drew|title=Alabama joins dozen states in asbestos bankruptcy trust investigations|url=https://altoday.com/archives/16031-alabama-ag-joins-asbestos-bankruptcy-trust-lawsuit|accessdate=27 November 2017|publisher=Alabama Today|date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bankruptcy trusts and litigated claims====

The pursuit of compensation for asbestos injuries often involves both litigation against solvent defendants and filing claims against asbestos bankruptcy trusts.&lt;ref name="RAND1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dixon|first1=Lloyd|last2=McGovern|first2=Geoffrey|title=Bankruptcy's Effect on Product Identification in Asbestos Personal Injury Cases|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR907.html|publisher=RAND|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of compensation recovered by an injured plaintiff may depend on whether evidence of exposure to products from bankrupt firms is introduced at trial. If no evidence of exposure from bankrupt firms is presented then increased financial responsibility is likely to be assigned to solvent defendants.&lt;ref name="RAND1"/&gt; Researchers from [[RAND | RAND Corporation]] found that if a company filed for bankruptcy plaintiffs claimed exposure to their products in interrogatories and depositions at significantly reduced rates.&lt;ref name="RAND1"/&gt;

When a plaintiff claiming an asbestos injury has filed a claim against a solvent defendant, courts may extend or reopen discovery when it is discovered that the plaintiff failed to disclose a trust claims. For example, in the 2008 case of ''Edwards v. John  Crane-Houdaille, Inc'' production of claim forms was delayed until two weeks before trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v. John Crane-Houda ille, Inc.'', No. 24X08000351  (Md. Cir. Ct. Balt.   City July 31, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2004 case of ''Stoeckler v. American Oil Co.''&lt;ref&gt;Stoeckler v. Am. Oil Co., No. 23,451  (Tex. Dist. Ct. Angelina Cnty. Jan. 28, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; the defendants discovered that the plaintiff did not disclose trust claims only three days after the start of the trial, resulting in the re-opening of discovery.&lt;ref name="brickman1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brickman|first1=Lester|title=Fraud and Abuse in Mesothelioma Litigation|journal=Tulane Law Review|date=July 2014|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2458144|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help avoid this type of issue, Judges will often adopt mandatory disclosure obligations for bankruptcy trust claims.&lt;ref name="brickman1"/&gt;

==Regulation==
According to a September 2004 of the ''American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine'', asbestos is still a hazard for 1.3&amp;nbsp;million US workers in the construction industry and for workers involved in the maintenance of buildings and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=13500 |title=American Thoracic Society Journal news tips for September 2004 (second issue) |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbestos is not part of an [[ASTM International|ASTM]] (American Society for Testing and Materials) E 1527-05 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA){{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. A building survey for asbestos is considered an out-of-scope consideration under the industry standard ASTM 1527-05 Phase I ESA (see ASTM E 1527-05). ASTM Standard E 2356-04 should be consulted by the owner or owner's agent to determine which type of asbestos building survey is appropriate, typically either a baseline survey or a design survey of functional areas. Both types of surveys are explained in detail under ASTM Standard E 2356-04. Typically, a baseline survey is performed by an EPA (or state) licensed asbestos inspector. The baseline survey provides the buyer with sufficient information on presumed asbestos at the facility, often which leads to reduction in the assessed value of the building (due primarily to forthcoming abatement costs). Note: EPA [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants|NESHAP]] (National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Regulations must be consulted in addition to ASTM Standard E 2356-04 to ensure all statutory requirements are satisfied, ex. notification requirements for renovation/demolition. Asbestos is not a material covered under [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act|CERCLA]] (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ) innocent purchaser defense. In some instances, the U.S. EPA includes asbestos contaminated facilities on the NPL (Superfund). Buyers should be careful not to purchase facilities, even with an ASTM E 1527-05 Phase I ESA completed, without a full understanding of all the hazards in a building or at a property, without evaluating non-scope ASTM E 1527-05 materials, such as asbestos, lead, PCBs, mercury, radon, et al. A standard ASTM E 1527-05 does not include asbestos surveys as standard practice.

===Federal===
In 1988, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)]] issued regulations requiring certain U.S. companies to report the asbestos used in their products.&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2607|publisher=law.cornell.edu|title=15 U.S. Code § 2607 - Reporting and retention of information &amp;#124; US Law &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute &amp;#124; Asbestos Information Act of 1988 |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Senate subcommittee of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee heard testimony on July 31, 2001, regarding the health effects of asbestos. Members of the public, doctors, and scientists called for the United States to join other countries in a ban on the product.&lt;ref name="btinternet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~ibas/lka_us_congress.htm |publisher=web.archive.org |title=Summer Asbestos Hearing in US Congress |accessdate=2016-11-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011122183531/http://www.btinternet.com/~ibas/lka_us_congress.htm |archivedate=2001-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several legislative remedies have been considered by the U.S. Congress but each time rejected for a variety of reasons. In 2005, Congress considered but did not pass legislation entitled the "Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005". The act would have established a $140&amp;nbsp;billion trust fund in lieu of litigation, but as it would have proactively taken funds held in reserve by bankruptcy trusts, manufacturers and insurance companies, it was not widely supported either by victims or corporations.

On April 26, 2005, Dr. [[Philip J. Landrigan]], professor and chair of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at [[Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Dr. Philip Landrigan, April 26, 2005|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Landrigan%20Testimony%20042605.pdf|website=Committee on the Judiciary|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=26 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; testified before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary against this proposed legislation. He testified that many of the bill's provisions were unsupported by medicine and would unfairly exclude a large number of people who had become ill or died from asbestos: "The approach to the diagnosis of disease caused by asbestos that is set forth in this bill is not consistent with the diagnostic criteria established by the American Thoracic Society. If the bill is to deliver on its promise of fairness, these criteria will need to be revised."  Also opposing the bill were the American Public Health Association and the Asbestos Workers' Union.&lt;ref name="pitt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php |title=JURIST - Paper Chase: Senate Judiciary Committee wants sickest asbestos victims compensated fastest |publisher=Jurist.law.pitt.edu |date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111103453/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php |archivedate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2006, the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] approved an amendment to the act which would have allowed victims of [[mesothelioma]] $1.1M within 30 days of their claim's approval.&lt;ref name="pitt"/&gt; This version would have also expanded eligible claimants to people exposed to asbestos from the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and to construction debris in hurricanes Katrina and Rita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestos Bill To Include 9/11, Storm Claims|url=http://www.floordaily.net/flooring-news/asbestos-bill-to-include-911-storm-claims|website=Floor Daily|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the bill's reliance on funding from private entities large and small, as well as debate over a [[sunset provision]] and the impact on the U.S. budgetary process caused the bill to fail to leave committee.
According to the [[Environmental Working Group]] Action Fund, 10,000 people die each year from asbestos-caused diseases in the United States, including one out of every 125 American men who die over the age of 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php |title=The Asbestos Epidemic in America |publisher=EWG |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Environmental Protection Agency ([[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]) has no general ban on the use of asbestos. However, asbestos was one of the first hazardous [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act of 1970, and many applications have been forbidden by the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA).

===State===
In 2010, Washington state passed a ban on hazardous materials in automotive brakes, phasing out asbestos in vehicle brakes, starting in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Brakes Law|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/hwtr/betterbrakes.html|website=Department of Ecology|publisher=State of Washington|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ohio passed became the first state to pass a law requiring transparency in asbestos bankruptcy trust claims.&lt;ref name="wire1"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Chamber Report: Ohio Law to Curb ‘Double Dip’ Asbestos Claims Ensures Fairness Without Burdening Plaintiffs|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170504006128/en/U.S.-Chamber-Report-Ohio-Law-Curb-‘Double|publisher=Business Wire|date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Oklahoma passed a similar law called The Personal Injury Trust Fund Transparency Act. This law applies to all personal injury trusts. It requires plaintiffs to disclose all previously filed and anticipated trust claims for personal injuries within 90 days of filing a personal injury tort but not until at least 180 days before the assigned court date. If the plaintiff anticipates filing a trust claim all proceedings are stayed until their filing is complete. Filing new claims or amending claims after the initial disclosure triggers a new disclosure requirement. The law also allows defendants to stay proceedings by showing that the plaintiff could make a good faith filing with a trust. The law gives plaintiffs ten days to either file such a claim or show that it would probably be unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="brickman1"/&gt;

In South Carolina in 2015, State Senator Shane Massey introduced Senate Bill 281, "The Court Transparency Act."  S.281 would prohibit the state of South Carolina from hiring outside lawyers. Similar bills have been passed into law by 18 states. The bill would also prevent juries from awarding damages that exceed actual out of pocket costs incurred by plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=January 21, 2015 - CAGC legislative issues, North Carolina and South Carolina construction news |url=http://www.cagc.org/advocacy/openwba/legis_update_012115.cfm |website=www.cagc.org |accessdate=2015-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118164001/http://www.cagc.org/advocacy/openwba/legis_update_012115.cfm |archivedate=November 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sen.

In June 2016, President Obama signed into law the Frank R. Lautenburg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2576).

==Abatement==
{{main| Asbestos abatement}}
[[File:AsbestosContainment.JPG|right|thumb|275px|Old [[Wailuku]] [[Post Office]] sealed off for asbestos removal.]]
Asbestos abatement (removal of asbestos) has become a thriving industry in the United States. Strict removal and disposal laws have been enacted to protect the public from airborne asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestos Laws and Regulations|url=https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/asbestos-laws-and-regulations|website=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clean Air Act requires that asbestos be wetted during removal and strictly contained, and that workers wear safety gear and masks. The federal government has prosecuted dozens of violations of the act and violations of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) related to the operations. Often these involve contractors who hire undocumented workers without proper training or protection to illegally remove asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/nyregion/father-and-son-get-long-terms-in-defective-asbestos-removal.html Father and Son Get Long Terms In Defective Asbestos Removal"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 24, 2004. Retrieved 2008-04-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. R. Grace and Company]] faces fines of up to $280&amp;nbsp;million for polluting the town of [[Libby, Montana]]. Libby was declared a [[Superfund]] disaster area in 2002, and the EPA has spent $54&amp;nbsp;million in cleanup. Grace was ordered by a court to reimburse the EPA for cleanup costs, but the bankruptcy court must approve any payments.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
===Civil===
The U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with several asbestos-related cases since 1986. Two large [[class action]] settlements, designed to limit liability, came before the court in 1997 and 1999. Both settlements were ultimately rejected by the court because they would exclude future claimants, or those who later developed asbestos-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-270.ZO.html |title=Amchem Products, Inc. v.

====''Borel v. Fibreboard Corp.''====
In this case a federal appeals court ruled that an insulation installer from Texas could sue asbestos manufactures for failure to warn. Borel's lawyers argued that had warning labels been affixed to Fiberboard's products he would have been able to protect himself more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corporation, 493 F. 2d 1076 (5th Cir. 1973)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10469427978676917319|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manville====
The Manville Corporation, formerly the [[Johns Manville|Johns-Manville]] Corporation, filed for reorganization and protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code in August 1982. At the time, it was the largest company ever to file bankruptcy, and was one of the richest. Manville was then 181st on the [[Fortune 500]], but was the defendant of 16,500 lawsuits related to the health effects of asbestos. The company was described by [[Ron Motley]], a South Carolina attorney, as "the greatest corporate mass murderer in history." Court documents show that the corporation had a long history of hiding evidence of the ill effects of asbestos from its workers and the public. One of many examples is a memo from Manville's medical director to corporate headquarters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php |title=Asbestos |publisher=EWG |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608074844/http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php |archivedate=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The fibrosis of this disease is irreversible and permanent so that eventually compensation will be paid to each of these men. But, as long as the man is not disabled it is felt that he should not be told of his condition so that he can live and work in peace and the company can benefit from his many years of experience.

====Garlock====
In a decision from January 2014, ''[[Gray v. Garlock Sealing Technologies]]'' had entered into bankruptcy proceedings, and discovery in the case uncovered evidence of fraud &lt;ref name="legalnewsline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalnewsline.com/issues/asbestos/247203-defense-attorney-says-filing-bankruptcy-trust-claims-after-trial-verdicts-is-issue-in-asbestos-litigation|author=Heather Isringhausen Gvillo|publisher=legalnewsline.com|title=Defense attorney: Judges should look for asbestos claims fraud &amp;#124; Legal News Line|accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to a reduction in estimated future liability to a tenth of what was estimated.

====RICO cases====
A number of lawsuits have been filed under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) in response to what defendants claim to be fraudulent asbestos-related lawsuits. RICO suits are civil in nature and brought by private parties. They typically allege that the suits themselves are forms of racketeering or that lawyers and experts had to engage in racketeering activities in order to bring them.&lt;ref name="Journo1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engstrom|first1=Nora Freeman|title=Retaliatory RICO and the Puzzle of Fraudulent Claiming|journal=Michigan Law Journal|date=2017|volume=115:639|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
*in 2012 a lawsuit was filed by CSX Transportation Inc. alleging that lawyers and a doctor who represented plaintiffs in asbestos cases had engaged in acts of civil racketering in their pursuit of fraudulent claims, resulting in a verdict in favor of CSX Transportation.&lt;ref name="Insurance"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Staff|title=W.Va. Jury Finds Doctor, 2 Lawyers Filed False Asbestos Claims|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Insurance Journal|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was later settled on appeal, leaving in place the civil racketeering verdict in favor of CSX Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Field|first1=Emily|title=CSX, Asbestos Attys End 4th Circ.

===Criminal===
Some companies and their executives have faced criminal prosecution for their actions in exposing workers to the dangers of asbestos, or their improper handling of asbestos waste.

====Adamo Wrecking Company====
On February 20, 1973 a federal grand jury in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] indicted Adamo Wrecking Company ("Adamo") for violating provisions of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] by knowingly causing the emission of asbestos by failure to wet and remove friable asbestos materials from demolitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preview of United States Supreme Court Cases, Oct. 1977 Term|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/prvw5&amp;div=1&amp;src=home|website=Hein Online|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=6 September 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adamo was one of a number of demolition contractors indicted throughout the country for the alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] dismissed the criminal indictment on the ground that it was not an "emission standard," but a "work practice standard," which under the terms of the statute, did not carry criminal liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Sigrid|title=Emission Standards - Quantification and Liability|journal=Natural Resources Journal|volume=18|issue=3|page=677|url=http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/nrj/vol18/iss3/13/|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government appealed and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the decision of the trial court, stating that it erred in determining that it had jurisdiction to review the validity of the standard in a criminal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States v. Adamo Wrecking Co., 545 F.2d 1, 3 (6th Cir. 1976)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16010077950238678835|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=15 June 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamo's attorneys appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;"Summary of Actions by Supreme Court on Various Cases", ''New York Times'', April 5, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Adamo when it held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to review the standard in a criminal proceeding and also agreed with the trial court that the requirements in the act were "not standards" but "procedures" and therefore the proceedings were properly dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weaver|first1=Warren|title=Court Allows More Challenges of E.P.A.

A federal [[grand jury]] indicted [[W. R. Grace and Company]] and seven top executives on February 5, 2005, for its operations of a [[vermiculite]] mine in [[Libby, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewg.org/reports/lungcancer/wrgrace.php EWG.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  The indictment accused Grace of [[wire fraud]], knowing endangerment of residents by concealing air monitoring results, obstruction of justice by interfering with an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) investigation, violation of the Clean Air Act, providing asbestos materials to schools and local residents, and conspiracy to release asbestos and cover up health problems from asbestos contamination. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] said 1,200 residents had developed asbestos-related diseases and some had died, and there could be many more injuries and deaths.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hancock|first1=Jay|title=Proving criminal intent in handling of asbestos products won't be easy|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-02-09/business/0502090155_1_asbestos-grace-criminally-charged|accessdate=5 September 2017|agency=The Baltimore Sun|date=9 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-02-08-grace-asbestos_x.htm|publisher=usatoday.com|title=Indictment charges W.R.

On June 8, 2006, a federal judge dismissed the [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge of "knowing endangerment" because some of the defendant officials had left the company before the five-year statute of limitations had begun to run. The wire fraud charge was dropped by prosecutors in March.

====Other prosecutions====
On April 2, 1998, three men were indicted in a conspiracy to use homeless men for illegal asbestos removal from an aging Wisconsin manufacturing plant. Then-US Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] said, "Knowingly removing asbestos improperly is criminal. Exploiting the homeless to do this work is cruel."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On December 12, 2004, owners of New York asbestos abatement companies were sentenced to the longest federal jail sentences for environmental crimes in U.S. history, after they were convicted on 18 counts of conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]], and actual violations of the Clean Air Act and Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The crimes involved a 10-year scheme to illegally remove asbestos. The RICO counts included obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud and bid rigging, all related to the asbestos cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/b1ab9f485b098972852562e7004dc686/324c5937dc68015a85256f7e0076a213!OpenDocument |title=12/23/2004: Father and Son Sentenced to Longest U.S. Jail Terms for Environmental Crimes |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |date=2004-12-23 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2006, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., two of its employees, and a contractor were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that they violated safety standards while removing asbestos from pipes in [[Lemon Grove, California]]. The defendants were charged with five counts of conspiracy, violating asbestos work practice standards and [[making false statements]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] discussed his plan for [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] in a speech delivered to a joint session of the [[111th United States Congress]] on September 9, 2009 at 8:00 PM (EDT).  The speech was delivered to Congress on the floor of the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the [[United States Capitol]]. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] presided over the joint session and was accompanied by the [[President of the United States Senate]], [[Joe Biden]], the [[Vice President of the United States]]. Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu]] was chosen as the [[designated survivor]] and did not attend the speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Energy secretary stays away during Obama health care speech to joint session of Congress |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/sns-ap-us-health-care-chu,0,7791126.story |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech==
[[File:Obama Health Care Speech to Joint Session of Congress.jpg|thumb|300px|Obama addresses a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]]]]Obama's speech addressed topics regarding the [[public health insurance option]], private insurance reform, estimated costs and revenue, basic coverage for individuals and employers, as well as subsidies and waivers for those who can't afford coverage, and the importance of [[tort reform]] in bringing costs down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Victoria |last=Colliver |title=Outline and analysis of Obama's proposals |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/09/MNJO19KPTV.DTL |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc. |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President's speech lasted 47 minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sheryl Gay |last=Stolberg |author2=Zeleny, Jeff |title=Obama, Armed With Details, Says Health Plan Is Necessary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.html?hp |publisher=New York Times |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contained 5,614 words.&lt;ref name="BBC-woo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama woos Congress on healthcare |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8247207.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2009-09-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090909234449/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8247207.stm| archivedate= 9 September 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was briefly interrupted by a cry of "You lie!" from Republican Rep. [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]], referring to a statement by Obama that his plan would not apply to illegal immigrants (discussed in more detail in [[#Outburst by Joe Wilson|the next section]]).

Obama quoted a letter sent to him from [[Ted Kennedy]], who had died a few weeks earlier.  Kennedy had composed the letter after he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and requested that the letter be sent after he died.  Quoting Kennedy's letter, Obama said, "that what we face is above all a moral issue; that at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kennedy  |first=Edward M. |authorlink=Ted Kennedy |title=Text of letter to the President from Senator Edward M. Kennedy |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Text-of-letter-to-the-President-from-Senator-Edward-M-Kennedy/ |date=2009-05-12 |work= |publisher=[[White House Press Secretary]] |accessdate=2009-09-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090910065606/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Text-of-letter-to-the-President-from-Senator-Edward-M-Kennedy/| archivedate= 10 September 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the quoted portions of his letter, Kennedy, a steadfast proponent of health care reform, also posed the question of what would happen if one knew treatment existed for a condition but one could not afford it.&lt;ref name="khabrein1"&gt;[http://www.khabrein.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26048&amp;Itemid=57&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=5 Presidential address to Congress Full text of President Obama health care speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama placed health care reform into a broader historical perspective, in which the nature and role of government has been the subject of historical debate, and compared his reform to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. He concluded his address by returning to Kennedy's theme of the "character of our country":

&lt;blockquote&gt;I understand how difficult this health care debate has been. I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them. I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road - to defer reform one more year, or one more election, or one more term. But that's not what the moment calls for. That's not what we came here to do. We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape it. I still believe we can act even when it's hard. I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress. I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet history's test. Because that is who we are. That is our calling. That is our character.&lt;ref name="khabrein1"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the speech, the president discussed the health coverage of illegal immigrants, saying: "There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false. The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally." At this point, South Carolina Republican Rep. [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] yelled "You lie!", briefly interrupting the speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Barack Obama, Joe Wilson |date=2009-09-09 |title= Obama Heckled by GOP During Speech to Congress |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aE_nEoE5kE |format= YouTube |publisher  = Associated Press |quote= The nastiness of August reached from the town halls into the Capitol as President Barack Obama spoke about his health care plan.

Issues and practices related to '''childbirth in Sri Lanka''' are influenced by the sociocultural composition, political history and violence within the country.

==Background==
[[Image:Sri Lanka-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|The island-nation of [[Sri Lanka]].]]
{{main|Sri Lanka}}

===Physical environment===
{{main|Geography of Sri Lanka}}
[[Sri Lanka]] is a small island nation in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the southeast coast of [[India]]. The island is characterized by a [[tropical monsoon climate]] that is divided into the northeast monsoon (December to March) and southwest monsoon (June to October).&lt;ref name=CIA2011&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terrain is mostly low, flat to rolling fertile plains. Highlands with deep valleys exist in the central-southern interior of the country.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; Nearly one-third of Sri Lanka's total land mass is covered by natural vegetation, however much of it has been depleted due to intensive agricultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Lanka - Plant and animal life {{!}} history - geography|url = http://www.britannica.com/place/Sri-Lanka/Plant-and-animal-life|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
{{main|History of Sri Lanka}}
The [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], who likely migrated from southern India, are first people known to inhabit [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=DeSilva1981&gt;
{{cite book
 | last=De Silva
 | first=K.M.
 | title=A history of Sri Lanka
 | publisher=C. Hurst and Co. Ltd.
 | place=London, U.K
 | year=1981
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly believed that they arrived in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1981/&gt; Near 300 BC, there is evidence that [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people began to migrate from Southern India to the island now known as Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1981/&gt; The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discovered the island largely by accident in 1505 CE and established their first trading settlement in 1517.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1981/&gt; The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] briefly controlled the coastal areas of the island, followed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the 17th century. With these colonizers came the introduction of [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries who sought to convert Sinhalese and Tamil people to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=DeSilva1981/&gt; By March 1815, the island was formally united under [[United Kingdom|British]] rule &lt;ref name=DeSilva1981/&gt; Throughout the 19th century, the British brought Tamil workers from Southern India to staff the growing number of [[rubber]] and [[tea]] plantations.&lt;ref name=U.S.2011&gt;
{{cite report

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The people of the island gained independence from the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1948 and formed the nation of [[Ceylon]]. The official name was changed to [[Sri Lanka]] in 1972, when [[Buddhism]] was named the primary [[religion]] of the country.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1981/&gt;

Throughout the late 20th century and into the 21st century, Sri Lanka remained a country wrought with turmoil and war. Increasing Sinhalese nationalism led to disenfranchisement of the Tamil minority. Beginning in 1983 and lasting nearly three decades, brutally violent armed conflicts took place between the pro-independent militant Tamil group, named [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), and the Sinhalese dominant Sri Lankan government force.&lt;ref name=UN2004&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These years were characterized by civil unrest, violence, guerrilla attacks, acts of terrorism and conventional warfare. During the conflict, Northern and Eastern provinces served as primary battlefields. It is estimated that more than 60,000 people were killed in the conflict.&lt;ref name=UN2004/&gt; A [[ceasefire]] was signed in 2002, but mostly ignored and officially rejected by the Sri Lankan government in 2008. The Sri Lankan government declared victory over the LTTE in May 2009 with the death of rebel leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]].&lt;ref name=Good2010&gt;Goodhand, J. (2010). Stabilising a victor's peace? humanitarian action and reconstruction in eastern Sri Lanka. Disasters, 34, S342-S367. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-7717.2010.01212.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Sri Lanka}}
Religion is a vibrant part of Sri Lankan culture. The predominant religions are [[Buddhism]], [[Hindu]], [[Muslim]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; [[Buddhism]] was introduced sometime between 250-210 BC,&lt;ref name=DeSilva1981/&gt; and became the official religion of Sri Lanka in 1972. The 1978 constitution grants primacy to Buddhism, while also ensuring freedom of religion for all citizens. Throughout Sri Lanka's long history, Buddhism has remained an active part of the culture. Nearly 70% of the population is Buddhist.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; Due to the extensive conflict and war in the northern and eastern provinces, data regarding religious affiliation is variable. The national census states that 8% of the population identified as [[Muslim]], 7% as [[Hindu]], 6% as [[Christian]], and the remaining 10% were unspecified.&lt;ref name=census2002&gt;Department of Census and Statistics, in collaboration with Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Welfare. (2002). Sri Lanka demographic and health survey 2000. Pitakotte, Sri Lanka: State Printing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Sri Lankan Muslims practice [[Sunni Islam]]. Sizable minorities of both Sinhalese and Tamils identify as Christians, most of whom are Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt;

===Political system===
{{Main|Government of Sri Lanka}}
[[Image:Coat of arms of Sri Lanka.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms of Sri Lanka]].]]
Sri Lanka is governed within the framework of a presidential representative [[democratic republic]].&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; In this multi-party system the [[president]] is the head of state, head of government and the commander of the armed forces. The long-standing conflict between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority is apparent within the political structure. Both the president and prime minister are members of the socialist [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]]. The party was founded in 1951, and generally represents the interests of the nationalist Sinhala parties. The primary opposition party is the conservative [[United National Party]]. In 1959, Sri Lanka was led by [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], the world's first female chief executive. [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] became president in 2005 and was re-elected in January, 2010, two years before the end of his term.&lt;ref name=U.S.2011/&gt;

===Economic system===
{{Main|Economy of Sri Lanka}}

Sri Lanka's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita is $4,900 USD &lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; with an annual growth rate estimated at 8%.&lt;ref name=U.S.2011/&gt; The average annual income is $964 USD &lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation, Global Health Facts. (2010). Country Data Source: Sri Lanka. Retrieved from http://www.globalhealthfacts.org/country.jsp?c=199&lt;/ref&gt; and about 6% of the population lives below $1 USD per day.&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt; In 2001, the country faced bankruptcy when national debt overtook GDP. Crisis was averted when the government gathered international loans after a ceasefire was signed with the LTTE.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt;

In 2009, a third of Sri Lankans worked in agriculture, a fourth in industry and the remainder primarily worked in services jobs.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; Four percent of males are unemployed.&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt; Women are becoming increasingly active in the job market and female unemployment has dropped from 22% in 1993, to 8% in 2009.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; The primary economic sectors include tourism, textiles, clothing manufacture, agricultural products and exportation of tea, apparel, gemstones and rubber.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt;

===Social structure and organization===
In Sri Lanka, there has not been a comprehensive national population census completed since 1981. The 2001 national census did not include vital information from conflict areas of the northern and eastern parts of the country. Due to the ongoing violence in Sri Lanka, most demographic data available is estimated based on 1981 or 2001 data, and variation exists among data sources. The [[CIA World Factbook]] lists Sri Lanka's current population as 20,653,913 persons.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; Considering the island is only {{convert|65,610|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, it is a very densely populated nation. Over 85% of the population live in non-urban environments.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; The largest city is [[Colombo]], with a population of 1,819,777.  Sri Lanka is occupied by several ethnic groups. The Sinhalese are the predominant ethnic group (74%), followed by [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] (13%), [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]] (5%) and [[Moors]] (Muslim) (7%).&lt;ref name=Rannan&gt;Rannan-Eliya, R. P. and Sikurajapathy, L. (2008). Sri Lanka: "Good Practice" in Expanding Health Coverage. In World Bank (311-354)&lt;/ref&gt; Sinhala is the national language and is the predominant language spoken by 74% of the population. Most Tamils and Moors speak Tamil, part of the South Indian linguistic group. Due to the extensive conflict between Sri Lankan government and Tamil separatists that took place in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several hundred thousand Tamil citizens fled their homes in conflict zones and were placed in government run camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs), or sought refuge in other countries.&lt;ref name=Foreign&gt;Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, First Session, December 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of displaced persons is unknown, though in 1994 it was estimated over 500,000 people were displaced internally and more than 200,000 people fled internationally.&lt;ref name=Chand&gt;Chandrakanthan, A. J. V. (1994). An exodus sans destination: Refugees and the internally displaced in Sri Lanka. Paper presented at the 4th International Research and Advisory Panel Conference, University of Oxford, Oxford, England&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, considerable effort has been made to relocate the hundreds of thousand IDPs from government camps. When forced to flee conflict zones, most IDPs left behind their homes, assets, and tools necessary for their livelihoods.&lt;ref name=Good2010/&gt; The Sri Lankan government reported that rations were provided for families selected for resettlement from IDP camps. These rations included agricultural tool kits, dry rations, an initial payment of Rs. 5,000 (est. $44 USD), a shelter grant of Rs. 25,000 (est. $219 USD), roofing sheets, provision of rice seed, fertilizer and transportation.&lt;ref name=Foreign/&gt; Even in resettled communities, many people continue to face insecurity and poverty.&lt;ref name=Good2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amirthalingam&gt;Amirthalingam, K. and Lakshman , R.W. (2009). Displaced livelihoods in Sri Lanka: an economic analysis. Journal of Refugee Studies, 22(4), 502-524. {{doi|10.1093/jrs/fep031}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2011, nearly 17,500 people continue to live at Menik Farm, Sri Lanka's largest camp for IDPs. Recent reports claim that the government hopes to resettle all conflict-displaced people by the end of 2011.&lt;ref name=IRIN&gt;Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), Asia. (2011). Sri Lanka: displaced to be resettled by end 2011 Retrieved from http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=91888&lt;/ref&gt; Rebuilding infrastructure in northern and eastern provinces affected by war is an ongoing task.&lt;ref name=Good2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amirthalingam/&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Sri Lanka}}
Sri Lanka's education system is state funded, and offered free of charge at all levels, including the university level. Schooling is compulsory for children from 5 to 13 years of age. The national literacy rate is 91%.&lt;ref name=census2002/&gt; The reported literacy rate of the urban population is 93%, 92% of the rural population and 75% of the estate population.&lt;ref name=census2002/&gt; The literacy rate among women is 89%.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; Nearly 70% of the population is educated beyond the 9th grade.&lt;ref name=census2002/&gt;

==Health Information==
{{Main|Health in Sri Lanka}}
Considering the low annual income and many years of internal conflict, Sri Lanka's health indicators are stronger than those of many other developing countries.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Global Health Database,&lt;ref name=Kaiser/&gt; 90% of Sri Lankans have access to water and 91% have access to sanitation. An estimated 2,800 people are living with HIV/AIDS, and 20,000 are living with tuberculosis. The life expectancy at birth is 74 years of age.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; Health services are provided to Sri Lankan citizens free of charge and over 93% of the population has access to basic health care. The national prevalence of anemia among school children is about 12%.&lt;ref name=Pathmeswaran&gt;Pathmeswaran, A., Jayatissa, R., Samarasinghe, S., Fernando, A., de Silva, R., Thattil, R., and de Silva, N. (2010). Health status of primary schoolchildren in Sri Lanka. Ceylon Medical Journal, 50(2), 46-50. {{doi|10.4038/cmj.v50i2.1567}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one third of Sri Lankan children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNICEF Sri Lanka - Our Focus Areas - Malnutrition|url = http://www.unicef.org/srilanka/activities_1667.htm|website = www.unicef.org|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; are undernourished ([[Body Mass Index|BMI]]-for age below the 5th percentile for age and sex).&lt;ref name=Pathmeswaran/&gt; Children in the northern and eastern provinces have a much higher proportion of health problems when compared to children living in other provinces.&lt;ref name=Pathmeswaran/&gt;

Sri Lanka has an extensive network of health care institutions. The health system consists of both the state and private sector. State health services include preventative, curative and rehabilitative health services. Health services are organized and delivered through the Department of Health Services and the Provincial Health Sector. The Sri Lankan health system incorporates Western, [[Ayurvedic]] and [[Homeopathic]] medicine. The Ministry of Health oversees national health services.&lt;ref name=Fernando2003&gt;Fernando, D., Jayatilleka, A., and Karunaratna, V. (2003). Pregnancy—reducing maternal deaths and disability in Sri Lanka: National strategies. British Medical Bulletin, 67(1), 85-98. {{doi|10.1093/bmb/ldg008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight Provincial Directors of Health Services are responsible for the management and implementation of health services within each province.  These services include provincial, base, district and rural hospitals, maternity homes and outpatient facilities. Each province is divided into geographical areas, with a defined population, who are served by a Medical Officers of Health (MOH). Within each MOH area, a team of field level health workers, including Public Health Nurses (PHN), Public Health Inspector (PHI) and Public Health Midwives (PHM), work with a Medical Officer to deliver health care services at a community level. The PHM are responsible for delivering antenatal, natal and postnatal services in hospitals, community health centers and in patient's homes.&lt;ref name=Fernando2003/&gt; Several different types of health care facilities exist and patients may choose where they receive services.

Sri Lanka's achievements in maternal health and family planning are perceived as a success. In the 1930s, Sri Lanka's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 2,000 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name=Prata&gt;Prata, N., Passano, P., Sreenivas, A. and Gerdts, C.E. (2010). Maternal mortality in developing countries: challenges in scaling-up priority interventions. Women’s Health, 6(2), 311-327. {{doi|10.2217/whe.10.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing this as a national problem, the government implemented programs to improve infrastructure, education, sanitation and health systems in poor and under-served areas. Simultaneously, there was an improvement in maternal health services and extensive training of, and improved community access to, Public Health Nurse-Midwives.&lt;ref name=Prata/&gt; Maternal care now encompasses antenatal care, intrapartum and postnatal care. These strategies enabled Sri Lanka to reduce the MMR by half every 6–12 years between 1930 and 1995.&lt;ref name=Prata/&gt; In 2002, the MMR was 43 per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name=Family&gt;Family Health Bureau (2007). Annual Report on Family Health Sri Lanka, 2004-2005, Ministry of Health Sri Lanka Publication, Colombo, Sri Lanka&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated total fertility rate is 2.2 births per woman and population growth rate is 0.93%.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt; The infant mortality rate was 11.2 per 1000 live births in 2003.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; The contraceptive prevalence rate was 70%; the infant mortality rate was 10.2 for female infants and 12.9 for male infants per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt;

In 1927, the midwifery services in the Colombo municipality were re-organized to include training of all midwives working in the municipality.&lt;ref name=Fernando2003/&gt; Since then, PHM training has continued expand and follow a standardized course. By 1958, about 58% of the births were attended by a skilled birth attendant, of which 25% were deliveries in the home by a PHM.&lt;ref name=Fernando2003/&gt; Since the 1950s the number of institutional (maternity home or hospital) deliveries has continued to increase, and in 2001, 92% of all deliveries took place in institutions.&lt;ref name=Fernando2003/&gt;

===Effect of conflict on maternal health===
Many years of ethnic conflict have led to separation between the various ethnic and religious groups who inhabit Sri Lanka. Women in living in the conflict zones of northern and eastern Sri Lanka experience worse maternal outcomes compared to national averages.&lt;ref name=WHO2002&gt;World Health Organization (2002) Health system and health needs of the north-east Sri Lanka. Colombo, Sri Lanka: Vishva Lekha&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in the areas found significantly higher levels of poverty in conflict zones. On a national level, the proportion of the population living in poverty was 22.7%, but in the district of Amapara, nearly 65% of the population was living in poverty in 2002.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda&gt;Kottegoda, S., Samuel, K., &amp; Emmanuel, S. (2008). Reproductive health concerns in six conflict-affected areas of Sri Lanka. Reproductive Health Matters, 16(31), 75-82. {{doi|10.1016/S0968-8080(08)31359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people living in conflict areas have higher rates of school drop-out, marry earlier and become pregnant earlier than young people in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; Women in these areas face especially poor health outcomes These women are also subject to higher rates of domestic violence and many women report that their husbands force them to have sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; Women in these areas have reduced access to contraception, and this may increase pregnancies in conflict zones.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; The total rate of fertility in conflict zones is 2.6 live births per woman &lt;ref name=Fernando2003/&gt; while the national average is 2.2 live births per woman.&lt;ref name=CIA2011/&gt;

Lack of basic health infrastructure combined with shortages of health professionals has severely limited reproductive health services in the northern and eastern provinces.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; They have extremely limited access to emergency obstetric care, increased rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, and higher rates of low birth weight babies.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt;
While the national rates of home birth are very low, one out of five women in conflict areas birth at home.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; In some districts, such as Batticaloa, as many as 41% of women give birth at home.&lt;ref name=Fernando2003/&gt; Primary reasons for home births are: destruction of health centers, danger of travel, lack of transportation and poverty.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; The national PHM program virtually eliminated traditional birth attendants in Sri Lanka, but when women are forced to birth at home they may have the assistance of a traditional medicine woman, known as ''Marauthuvivhvhi''.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; These birth attendants use home remedies, such as powders, herbs, oils and an herbal drink called ''perunkayam'' to support the woman through birth.&lt;ref name= Kottegoda/&gt; These factors increase the risk involved with childbirth and highlight the needs of women living in the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=WHO2002/&gt;

==Marriage==
Unlike other Asian countries, Sri Lankan women have had equal access to education for many years and men and women enjoy similar rates of literacy. In other countries women's increased access to education and increased presence in the workforce has delayed the age of marriage, but these factors are less influential in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Malhortra&gt;Malhortra, A, and Tsui, A.O. (1996). Marriage timing in Sri Lanka: The role of modern norms and ideas. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 58, 476-490&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, Sri Lankans marry later than people in other Asian countries. In 1961, the average age of marriage was 22 years old, and today the average age of marriage is 25 years old in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Malhortra/&gt; Muslim women marry earlier than Sinhalese and Tamil women.&lt;ref name=Malhortra/&gt; School attendance is believed to delay the age of marriage because women in school are not considered adults and are not ready for marriage. Birth order also influences age of marriage. Women with unmarried older sisters tend to marry later because of the tradition that women should marry in their birth order.&lt;ref name=Malhortra/&gt; Women who have arranged marriages typically marry later than those who choose their own husbands.&lt;ref name=Malhortra/&gt;

==Infertility==
[[Infertility]] is a deeply distressing issue among Sri Lankan couples.  In the Sinhalese culture, birth is the sign of a successful marriage and rituals are performed if a woman does not conceive during the early years of marriage.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana&gt;Paranavitana, R. (2008). Some customs and superstitions associated with the childbirth in Sri Lankan Sinhalese society. Research Journal of Folkloristics, 1(1), 35-39&lt;/ref&gt; Often the couple and family members will make vows at a religious shrine and seek blessings from monks to help with conception.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; When a woman has a difficult time becoming pregnant, some people believe it is caused by misdeeds that took place in a previous lifetime.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; Performing virtuous deeds in the present life can help neutralize these deeds. Examples of beneficial acts include giving money to monks, beggars or children in need, lighting lamps or bathing the foot of a sacred Bo-tree with water or milk.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt;

A cultural issue arises when considering sperm donation among Buddhists. While donation of blood or body products are considered virtuous giving of one's self, semen is a very different matter.&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;Simpson, B. (2004). Impossible gifts: bodies, Buddhism and bioethics in contemporary Sri Lanka. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 10(4), 839-859. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9655.2004.00214.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aruvedic medicine, semen is "considered the highest of substances" and "loss of such a powerful substance is widely held to have a number of consequences such as anxiety, mental impairment, and impotence.&lt;ref name=Simpsonp553&gt;Simpson, B. (2004). p. 553&lt;/ref&gt;  Some physicians expressed concerns about the risk of potential mix-ups of sperm in [[in-vitro fertilization]], fearing "children with such origins might experience a deep and troubling sense of strangeness towards a father who is not biologically related whilst expressing a desire to establish the genitor's real identity.".&lt;ref name=Simpsonp553/&gt; Because sperm donation involves ejaculation, which has origins in "physical pleasure for which there can be no justification in Buddhism," acquiring donor sperm is often a difficult task.&lt;ref name=Simpsonp553/&gt; Monetary incentives cannot be used because the purchase of human tissue, including gametes, is illegal &lt;ref name=Simpson/&gt;).

==Pregnancy==
===Ideas regarding pregnancy===
Even though the government has actively encouraged family planning, Sri Lankans still regard pregnancy as a blessing and birth is a symbol of a successful marriage.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wanasundera&gt;Wanasundera, N.P. (2002). Cultures of the world: Sri Lanka. New York: Marshall Cavendish Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnancy outside of marriage is very rare in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Malhortra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olsson&gt;Olsson, P. and Wijewarena, K. (2010). Unmarried women’s decisions on pregnancy termination: Qualitative interviews in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, 1, 135-141. {{doi|10.1016/j.srhc.1010.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Culturally it is important that a woman remains a virgin until marriage.&lt;ref name=Olsson/&gt; Single mothers do not receive government-based aid. Children born to unwed mothers are often labeled as illegitimate and considered outcasts in society.&lt;ref name=Olsson/&gt;

===Preparation for birth===
When husbands learn their wife is pregnant, they make a vow to perform the ''Ratrayakuma'' ritual.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; This ritual, which involves hanging a pot containing coins, a betel leaf and flowers from the rafters, is done to appease the evil spirit Rata Yaka, who is believed to prevent successful child bearing and delivery.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; During a first pregnancy, couples often visit temples of special significance in the Buddhist faith.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; Examples of such temples are [[Temple of the Tooth]] in [[Kandy]] or the Sacred [[Bodhi tree]] at [[Anuradhapura]]. At the temple they pray for the pregnancy and ask for an uncomplicated birth and healthy life.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; They make vows to ensure their wishes are granted. If their wishes are granted, they return to the temple or shrine to make offerings of praise to the Gods who protected their newborn child and mother during pregnancy and birth.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt;

During pregnancy, family members take care to please the pregnant mother and protect her, and her unborn child, by relieving her of household duties.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; The pregnant woman's mother, grandmother or mother-in-law supervises meals. While pregnant, women may experience ''Doladuka'', or suffering of two hearts.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; This experience includes unusual desires to eat particularly sour fruits or indulge in specific acts.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; These wishes must be fulfilled to protect the fetus from physical or mental defects. Pregnant women avoid eating twinned foods as they are thought to lead to the birth of twins. Relatives and friends visit often to give gifts of fruits and boiled rice with curry wrapped in a banana leaf.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt; Traditionally, baby showers are considered bad luck and gifts are not given until after the birth of the child.&lt;ref name=Wanasundera/&gt; When preparing clothing for the new baby, care is taken to never complete the garment before the birth of the baby, as this assumes the birth is a certainty.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt;

In the last three months of pregnancy, it is typical for women move their parents’ home and stay a few weeks after the delivery to recover and receive care.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998&gt;De Silva, W.I. (1998). Puerperal morbidity: A neglected area of maternal health in Sri Lanka. Biodemography and Social Biology, 45(3), 223-245&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is especially common among first time mothers.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; During this time, Buddhist monks are invited to the home to chant blessings and expel evil spirits who might harm the woman and fetus.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt;

===Prenatal care===
The PHM provides prenatal care to women at home visits and in health clinics.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; These visits include blood pressure screening, measurement of weight and education related to nutritional needs during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=DeSilva2001&gt;De Silva, W.I. and Ban, D.J. (2001). Biomedical facts and social constructs: the relative attention paid to prenatal and postpartum periods in Sri Lanka. Asia-Pacific Population Journal, 16(2), 45-62&lt;/ref&gt; A PHM registers all pregnant women, and most are registered in the first trimester of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Nearly every pregnant woman (98.5%) receives antenatal care.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; According to Demographic and Health Survey 2000, 95% of women visited a clinic at least once during pregnancy and 84% had a midwife visit her home.&lt;ref name=census2002/&gt; Most women receive six or more home visits by the PHM during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeSilva2001/&gt; Only a very small percent of pregnant women receive fewer than three visits by a PHM.&lt;ref name=DeSilva2001/&gt; Women typically receive one visit during the first trimester, then two to three visits additional during each of the second and third trimesters.&lt;ref name=DeSilva2001/&gt;

===Extrinsic factors===
Currently little information exists regarding extrinsic factors that may affect pregnancy, such as air, water, food and drink. This is an area for additional research.

==Birth==
===Location and type of delivery===
Skilled [[birth attendant]]s attend more than 97% of births In Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=census2002/&gt; Nearly all births (99%) take place in a hospital or maternity home and are assisted by a physician or PHM.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; All first pregnancies and high-risk pregnancies are referred to a health facility staffed by an obstetrician. Most women give birth vaginally, but the incidence of [[cesarean section]], or C-section, is rising. In 1986, the rate of C-section was 9% and by 1999, the rate rose to 14.4% of births in government hospitals.&lt;ref name=Fernando1999&gt;Fernando, L. and Abeywardena, M. (1999). Trends in caesarean section. Sri Lanka Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 16, 14-20&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 66% of births are spontaneous vaginal deliveries, 4% are operative vaginal deliveries and 30% are by C-section.&lt;ref name=Lumbiganon&gt;Lumbiganon, P., Laopaiboon, M., Gülmezoglu, A. M., Souza, J. P., Taneepanichskul, S., Ruyan, P., …Villar, J. (2010). Method of delivery and pregnancy outcomes in Asia: The WHO global survey on maternal and perinatal health 2007–08. The Lancet, 375(9713), 490-499. {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61870-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that the increase in C-sections is due to a variety of factors, including increased use of epidural anesthesia and fetal monitoring.&lt;ref name=Gunasekera&gt;Gunasekera, P.C., Wijesinghe, P.S. and Goonewardene, I.M. (2001). The caesarean rate is rising&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of technology===
Little information is known about actual practices in Sri Lanka, but the Sri Lankan College of Obstetric Gynecology (SLCOG) publishes national guidelines for management of certain conditions of pregnancy.

===Uncomplicated labor===
SLCOG defines normal labor as "spontaneous onset, low-risk at the start and remaining low risk throughout the process".&lt;ref name=SLCOGap1&gt;Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SLCOG). (2010). National guidelines: Management of uncomplicated labor. p.1. Retrieved from http://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2010/national-guidelines/pdf/Management-Uncomplicated-Labour-SLCOG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Normal labor results in a birth between 37 and 42 weeks gestation and the fetus is delivered from a vertex presentation.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa&gt;Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SLCOG). (2010). National guidelines: Management of uncomplicated labor. Retrieved from http://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2010/national-guidelines/pdf/Management-Uncomplicated-Labour-SLCOG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Once a woman is determined to be in uncomplicated labor, confirmed by vaginal examination and painful contractions, she is transferred to the labor suite of the hospital or maternity home.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; While routine enemas are not recommended, SLCOG does emphasize that "efforts must be make to minimize fecal soiling…to overcome the practical difficulties associated with cleaning and maintaining sterility".&lt;ref name=SLCOGap7&gt;Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SLCOG). (2010). National guidelines: Management of uncomplicated labor. p.7. Retrieved from http://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2010/national-guidelines/pdf/Management-Uncomplicated-Labour-SLCOG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Low risk women are allowed to consume clear fluids during early labor, but must consult an anesthesiologist first.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; SLCOG recommends that maternal preference be honored when considering mobility and posture during labor. The organization recommends standing and lateral recumbent positioning to minimize reductions in uterine blood supply and reductions in cardiac output.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; Intermittent fetal heart auscultation and observation of vaginal discharge is used to assess the fetal condition.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; A [[partogram]] is recommended to facilitate monitoring during labor.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; During the second stage of labor, women are encouraged to assume the most comfortable position.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; In the second stage of labor fetal heart rate should be assessed every 15 minutes and the fetal heart rate should be assessed after each contraction while bearing down.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; Active management of labor with [[oxytocin]] is recommended in the third stage of labor.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; Medio-lateral episiotomies are recommended to expedite delivery or prevent perineal injury.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; Once the neonate is delivered, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, controlled cord traction should be applied. It is recommended that the placenta, membranes and umbilical cord are examined for abnormalities after delivery.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; After delivery, women should be monitored for complication for two hours in the labor suite.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt;

===Premature rupture of membranes===
Management of preterm rupture of membranes involves either expectant or active management.&lt;ref name=SLCOGb&gt;Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SLCOG).(2010). National guidelines: Management of premature rupture of membranes. Retrieved from http://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2010/national-guidelines/pdf/Management-PROM-SLCOG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The classification depends on maturity of the fetus, neonatal facilities available at the place of birth, presence of infection and fetal distress.&lt;ref name=SLCOGb/&gt; Expectant management involves general observation of vital signs and fetal observations, including kick count, presentation, daily electronic fetal monitoring and weekly ultrasound.&lt;ref name=SLCOGb/&gt; Active management beyond 32 weeks gestational age involves administration of corticosteroids, antibiotics and awaiting active labor.&lt;ref name=SLCOGb/&gt; If active labor does not begin within 24 hours, delivery is advised.&lt;ref name=SLCOGb/&gt;

===Pain management in labor===
Generally, Sri Lankan women prefer to give birth without pharmacologic pain management. SLCOG recommends that birthing women be provided with adequate analgesia and the selection of pain relief is determined by institutional protocols, drug availability and patient preference.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; Pethidine is the most common drug used for pain management during labor, especially in maternity units where clinicians with advanced medical training and monitoring facilities may not be present.&lt;ref name=Warnakulasuriya&gt;Warnakulasuriya, A. (2010). Obstetric anaesthesia. Sri Lankan Journal of Anaesthesiology, 18(1), 5-9. {{doi|10.4038/slja.v18i1.1553}}&lt;/ref&gt; During C-sections, 80% of women receive spinal anesthesia, 15% epidural and 5% general anesthesia.&lt;ref name=Warnakulasuriya/&gt; Non-pharmacologic pain management includes breathing techniques, hot and cold therapy, massage, relaxation techniques, acupuncture, herbalism and hypnosis.&lt;ref name=SLCOGa/&gt; Women often recite ''pirith'' to control breathing during labor. This is a chant performed by monks during pregnancy to ensure safe delivery.&lt;ref name=Paranavitana/&gt;

===Extrinsic factors===
Currently little information exists regarding extrinsic factors that affect birth, such as air, water, food and drink. This is an area for additional research.

==Registration of Birth==
Every birth should be registered with the government to obtain a birth certificate which act as the main legal document for a citizen in Sri Lanka. The name of the child (which is given by the parent), details of the mother and the father will be entered in the birth certificate. The birth certificate will be required to obtain the National Identity Card, Passport and many more legal activities. An application form should be obtained from Divisional Secretariat and proceed with the registration.&lt;ref name=dev_sec&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtain a Certified Copy of the Certificate of Birth|url=http://www.gic.gov.lk/gic/index.php?option=com_info&amp;id=355&amp;task=info&amp;lang=en|work=Government Information Center|publisher=GIC|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth traditions==
The specific date and time of birth are carefully recorded to determine a child's horoscope. The time of birth determines the zodiac sign, and also specific character traits of the child.&lt;ref name=Wanasundera/&gt; The horoscope is significant throughout the lifecycle. It is read by an astrologer at birth, puberty, prior to an examination or new job, when determining if a potential spouse is a good match, or for any other important decision.&lt;ref name="dev_sec"/&gt;

==Postpartum==
The postpartum time is not clearly defined; however the puerperium period is defined as the first six weeks in the postpartum period.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; Most women who deliver vaginally spend one night in a health institution, while about 5% return home the day of delivery.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; Women who deliver by C-section typically spend seven nights in the health institution before returning home.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt;

Sri Lanka does not have a system to record maternal morbidity, but research suggests maternal morbidity is an area of concern among Sri Lankan mothers. Sri Lankan mothers generally feel that it is natural to experience ill health after childbirth.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; About 90% of women who deliver vaginally and 75% women who deliver by C-section report illness in the puerperium period.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; Examples of these illnesses include excessive bleeding, fever, constipation, breast engorgement, painful urination, backache and abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt; Buddhist mothers have the highest incidence of illness while Muslim mothers had the fewest number of poor health outcomes after birth.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1998/&gt;

==Newborn Rites of Passage==
Newborn rites of passage vary among ethnic group. Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim families publicly announce the birth of a child as a gesture of accepting the newborn as a member of the family.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, M., Claus, P. and Diamond, S. (Eds.). (2003). South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. New York, NY: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a casual or grand celebration and often involves food, dancing and singing.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;

===Sinhalese===
The exact time of birth is reported to an astrologer who uses the child's horoscope to determine the best letters for the child's name. ''Nam tebima'' is the Sinhalese naming ceremony.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; The baby's first outing is typically to a Buddhist temple on a full moon day to receive blessings for a prosperous life. ''Idul kata gema'' is the ceremony to celebrate a baby's first solid food. The ceremony, which takes place either in the family home or in a temple, involves placing dishes of rice boiled with milk, traditional sweets, a banana, a book and a piece of jewelry.&lt;ref name=Wanasundera/&gt; The family observes as the baby is allowed to crawl onto the mat and select an item. If the child chooses the food, he or she will have a healthy appetite for life, if the child chooses the book he or she will have a future in academia, and if the child chooses the jewelry he or she has a promise of fortune and success.&lt;ref name=Wanasundera/&gt;

===Tamil===
The name-giving ceremony, ''Namakarana samskar'', typically takes place 11–41 days after birth.&lt;ref name=Wanasundera/&gt; During this ceremony the baby's father whispers the new name in the infant's right ear. It is typical to celebrate a baby's first consumption of solid food when a child receives his or her first taste of rice. The ceremony typically occurs in a ''kovil'', or Hindu temple.&lt;ref name=Wanasundera/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; The meal of boiled rice usually occurs between six and eight months of age.&lt;ref name=Wanasundera/&gt; Other childhood rituals include the ''Chudakarana samskara'', or head-shaving ceremony, which represents purity and removes all remnants of birth pollution. This event marks the end of infancy and the beginning of childhood.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; ''Karnavedhna Samskara'' is the name of the ear piercing ceremony that typically takes place either in a temple or at home on the first birthday.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;

===Muslim===
Muslim boys are circumcised between the ages of seven days and ten years.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; Some communities circumcise males as neonates, while others believe the child should be old enough to understand the significance of the event.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; Traditionally, a community member performed circumcisions in the boy's home, though some families now have the procedure done in a medical center.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; The celebration includes new clothes for the boy and a special meal prepared for family and friends.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;

==Breastfeeding==
Breastfeeding is a culturally accepted and encouraged practice in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Agampodi1"&gt;Agampodi, S.B. and Agampodi, T.C. (2008). Effect of low cost public health staff training on exclusive breastfeeding. Indian Journal of Pediatrics, 75(11), 1115-1119. {{doi|10.1007/S12098-008-0185-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of breastfeeding initiation is nearly 100%.&lt;ref name=census2003&gt;Department of Census and Statistics, in collaboration with Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Welfare. (2003). Sri Lanka demographic and health survey 2002. Department of Census and Statistics. Sri Lanka: Colombo&lt;/ref&gt; In Sri Lanka, public health officials recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child's life.&lt;ref name="Agampodi1"/&gt; PHM and medical officers of health provide pre-and post-natal counseling and education to support women in breastfeeding practices.&lt;ref name="Agampodi1"/&gt; In 2000, 54% of women breastfed exclusively for the first four months of life.&lt;ref name=census2003/&gt; Little data exists to determine rate of exclusive breastfeeding at six months of age, but it is believed that very few mothers breastfeed exclusively until their newborn reaches six months of age.&lt;ref name=Agampodi2007&gt;Agampodi, S.B, Agampodi, T.C. and Piyaseeli, U.K. (2007). Breastfeeding practices in a public health field practice area in Sri Lanka: a survival analysis. International Breastfeeding Journal, 2(3). {{doi|10.1186/1746-4358-2-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study that integrated low cost staff training with job supervision of PHM showed a significant increase in exclusive breastfeeding among mothers in Beruwala, Sri Lanka. The authors believe that six months exclusive breastfeeding is a realistic goal in Sri Lanka and suggest a need to increase training and support for PHM in maternal health care settings.&lt;ref name="Agampodi1"/&gt;

==Circumcision==
No information exists on the current rates of male or female circumcision in Sri Lanka. Generally, these are not common procedures among Buddhist and Hindu populations. Male circumcision is practiced among Muslims and is traditionally an occasion for celebration.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;

==Contraception==
[[Contraception]] is widely used in Sri Lanka, though generally considered a women's issue. The country has a vasectomy rate of 3.7% &lt;ref name=East&gt;East, M. (2002). Contraceptive Sterilization: Global Issues and Trends, EngenderHealth: 17-64.&lt;/ref&gt; and many people believe vasectomy inhibits men from performing hard labor.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1992&gt;De Silva, W.I. (1992). Do fertility intentions and behaviour influence sterilization in Sri Lanka? Asia Pacific Population Journal, 7(4), 41-60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, to increase the use of vasectomy in family planning, the Sri Lankan government began offering monetary incentives to men who agreed to undergo the procedure. Financial payment was the often primary reason for obtaining a vasectomy.&lt;ref name=Dias1988&gt;Dias, L.R. and Dias, M.K. (1988). The motivating factors for vasectomy in Sri Lanka. Journal of Family Welfare, 34(4), 12-22&lt;/ref&gt; Many Sri Lankan couples discuss the need for contraception to limit family size and space pregnancies.&lt;ref name=DeSilva2001/&gt; More than two thirds of the married population use some form of contraception.&lt;ref name=East/&gt; Generally, husbands support the use of female contraception.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1992/&gt; In 1993, nearly one fourth of married women were sterilized,&lt;ref name=East/&gt; however the prevalence of female sterilization fell to 17% of ever-married women by 2007.&lt;ref name=Rodrigo&gt;Rodrigo, C. and Muhuthar, R. (2009). Acceptance of ligation and resection of tubes for contraception in Sri Lanka. Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care, 35, 266 {{doi|10.1783/147118909789587231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women feel it is important to use a method of contraception approved by their husbands.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1992/&gt; This information guides the need to educate both men and women about contraceptive options, use and side effects.&lt;ref name=DeSilva1992/&gt;

==Additional information==
*From 1977 to 1978, an outbreak of acute [[polyneuropathy]] affected more than 20 young women. This illness that was restricted to girls attaining menarche and to women after childbirth. The cause of neuropathy could be traced to tri-cresyl phosphate found as a contaminant in gingili oil.&lt;ref name=ScienceDirect&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T1B-49MDGY5-2DY&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=01%2F10%2F1981&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1730511651&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3aeed3f140afad92f254e44ab67e8560&amp;searchtype=a TOXIC POLYNEUROPATHY DUE TO GINGILI OIL CONTAMINATED WITH TRI-CRESYL PHOSPHATE AFFECTING ADOLESCENT GIRLS IN SRI LANKA] Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, [[University of Colombo]].

They focused on 11 diseases which cause relatively few deaths at present and primarily strike the poor. They estimated that it would cost between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6099">The '''Corpulence Index''' ('''CI''') or '''Ponderal Index''' ('''PI''') is a measure of leanness (corpulence) of a person&lt;ref name=Ensminger&gt;''Foods and Nutrition Encyclopedia'', Audrey H. Ensminger, Marion Eugene Ensminger. p. 1645&lt;/ref&gt; calculated as a relationship between mass and height.&lt;ref name=oregon&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/exss323/Intro_Lab/PI.HTM EXSS 323: LAB 1 - BIOMECHANICS TOOLS: Computers, Algebra and Trig] Oregon State University&lt;/ref&gt;
It was first proposed in 1921 as the "Corpulence measure" by Swiss physician Fritz Rohrer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Der Index der Körperfülle als Maß des Ernährungszustandes|author=F. Rohrer|journal=Münchner Med. Wschr|volume=68|year=1921|pages=580–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence is also known as '''Rohrer's Index'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-ponderal-index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the [[body mass index]], but the mass is normalized with the third power of body height rather than the second power.&lt;ref name=babar/&gt;

'''Diacetyl''' ([[IUPAC]] [[systematic name]]: '''butanedione''' or '''butane-2,3-dione''') is an [[organic compound]] with the chemical formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a yellow or green liquid with an intensely buttery flavor. It is a [[Vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] [[diketone]] (two [[Carbonyl|C=O]] groups, side-by-side) with the [[chemical formula|molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Diacetyl occurs naturally in alcoholic beverages and is added to some foods to impart its buttery flavor.

==Chemical structure==
A distinctive feature of diacetyl (and other 1,2-diketones) is the long C–C bond linking the carbonyl centers. This bond distance is about 1.54&amp;nbsp;Å, compared to 1.45&amp;nbsp;Å for the corresponding C–C bond in [[1,3-butadiene]]. The elongation is attributed to repulsion between the polarized carbonyl carbon centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = K. | last1 = Eriks | first2 = T. D. | last2 = Hayden | first3 = S.

==Occurrence==
Diacetyl arises naturally as a byproduct of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. In some fermentative bacteria, it is formed via the [[thiamine pyrophosphate]]-mediated condensation of [[pyruvate]] and [[acetyl CoA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Speckman | first1 = R.

Cultured cream, cultured butter, and cultured buttermilk owe their tart flavour to lactic acid bacteria and their buttery aroma and taste to diacetyl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42692251|title=Modern food microbiology|last=Jay|first=James M|date=2000|publisher=Aspen Publishers|year=|isbn=083421671X|location=Gaithersburg, Md|pages=120|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Diacetyl is produced industrially by [[dehydrogenation]] of [[2,3-butanediol]]. [[Acetoin]] is an intermediate.&lt;ref name="ketones"&gt;{{Ullmann | last1= Siegel|first1= H.|last2= Eggersdorfer|first2= M. | title = Ketones | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a15_077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===In food products===
Diacetyl and [[acetoin]] are two compounds that give [[butter]] its characteristic taste. Because of this, manufacturers of [[artificial butter flavoring]], [[margarine]]s or similar [[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]]-based products typically add diacetyl and acetoin (along with [[beta-carotene]] for the yellow color) to make the final product butter-flavored, because it would otherwise be relatively tasteless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Pavia | title = Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques | edition = 4th | isbn = 978-0-495-28069-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic cigarettes===
Diacetyl is used as a flavoring agent in some [[electronic cigarette aerosol and liquid|liquids used in electronic cigarettes]]&lt;ref name=EatonChapt5&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24952/chapter/8?term=Diacetyl#175 |author1=Committee on the Review of the Health Effects of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, National Academies of Sciences|editor1-last=Eaton |editor1-first=David L. |editor2-last=Kwan |editor2-first=Leslie Y. |editor3-last=Stratton |editor3-first=Kathleen |title=Public Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes |date=2018 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=9780309468343 |page=175 |language=en |pmid=29894118|chapter=Chapter 5: Toxicology of E-Cigarette Constituents}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people nearby may be exposed to it in the exhaled aerosol at levels near the limit set for occupational exposure.&lt;ref name=EatonChapt3&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24952/chapter/6?term=Diacetyl#82 |author1=Committee on the Review of the Health Effects of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, National Academies of Sciences|editor1-last=Eaton |editor1-first=David L. |editor2-last=Kwan |editor2-first=Leslie Y. |editor3-last=Stratton |editor3-first=Kathleen |title=Public Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes |date=2018 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=9780309468343 |page=82 |language=en |pmid=29894118|chapter=Chapter 3: E-Cigarette Devices, Uses, and Exposures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In alcoholic beverages===
At low levels, diacetyl contributes a slipperiness to the feel of the [[alcoholic beverage]] in the mouth. As levels increase, it imparts a [[butter]]y or [[butterscotch]] flavor.

In some styles of beer (e.g. in many beer styles produced in the United Kingdom, such as stouts, English bitters, and Scottish ales), the presence of diacetyl can be acceptable or desirable at low or, in some cases, moderate levels. In other styles, its presence is considered a flaw or undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=Lee|title=Brew Chem 101|date=1996|publisher=Storey Books|isbn=0-88266-940-0|pages=64-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diacetyl is produced during fermentation as a byproduct of [[valine]] synthesis, when yeast produces [[Acetolactate|α-acetolactate]], which escapes the cell and is spontaneously [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] into diacetyl. The yeast then absorbs the diacetyl, and reduces the [[ketone]] groups to form [[acetoin]] and 2,3-butanediol.

Beer sometimes undergoes a "diacetyl rest", in which its temperature is raised slightly for two or three days after fermentation is complete, to allow the yeast to absorb the diacetyl it produced earlier in the fermentation cycle. The makers of some wines, such as [[chardonnay]], deliberately promote the production of diacetyl because of the feel and flavor it imparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diacetyl|url=http://www.ecmdb.ca/compounds/ECMDB21446|work=''E. coli'' Metabolome Database|publisher=ECMDB|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diacetyl is present in some chardonnays known as "butter bombs", although there is a trend back toward the more traditional French styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sonomacutrer.com/content/trends-chardonnay|title = Trends in Chardonnay|date = |accessdate = December 2, 2015|website = Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2018}}

Concentrations from 0.005&amp;nbsp;mg/L to 1.7&amp;nbsp;mg/L were measured in chardonnay wines, and the amount needed for the flavor to be noticed is at least 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nielsen |first=J.

==Safety==

===Worker safety===
{{Globalize/US|section|date=May 2016}}

====United States====
The United States [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] has suggested diacetyl, when used in artificial butter flavoring (as used in many consumer foods), may be hazardous when heated and inhaled over a long period.

Workers in several factories that manufacture [[artificial butter flavoring]] have been diagnosed with [[bronchiolitis obliterans]], a rare and serious disease of the [[lungs]]. The cases found have been mainly in young, healthy, nonsmoking males. As with other end-stage lung diseases, transplantation is currently the most viable treatment option. However, lung transplant rejection is very common and happens to be another setting in which bronchiolitis obliterans is known to occur.

The disease has been called "popcorn worker's lung" because it was first seen in former workers of a [[microwave popcorn]] factory in [[Missouri]],&lt;ref name=Levy2011&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levy|editor1-first=Barry S.|editor2-last=Wegman|editor2-first=David H.|editor3-last=Baron|editor3-first=Sherry L. |editor4-last=Sokas|editor4-first=Rosemary K.|title=Occupational and environmental health recognizing and preventing disease and injury|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199750061|page=414|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNfQrXnjkKUC&amp;pg=PA414|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] refers to it by the more general term "flavorings-related lung disease".&lt;ref name=Levy2011 /&gt; It has also been called "flavorings-related bronchiolitis obliterans"&lt;ref name=Levy2011 /&gt; or diacetyl-induced bronchiolitis obliterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Committee to Review the Respiratory Diseases Research Program, Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|title=Respiratory diseases research at NIOSH : reviews of research programs of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|date=2008|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309118736|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tv1jAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who work with flavorings that include diacetyl are at risk for flavorings-related lung disease, including those who work in popcorn factories, restaurants, other snack food factories, bakeries, candy factories, margarine and cooking spread factories, and coffee processing facilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Flavorings-Related Lung Disease: Exposures to Flavoring Chemicals - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flavorings/exposure.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate =October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Teamsters|International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] and the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] petitioned the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] to promulgate an emergency temporary standard to protect workers from the deleterious health effects of inhaling diacetyl vapors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Defending Science|url=http://defendingscience.org/upload/Union%20Petition%20to%20CHAO%20on%20Diacetyl%20Signed.pdf|title=UFCW and Teamsters' Petition to OSHA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210336/http://defendingscience.org/upload/Union%20Petition%20to%20CHAO%20on%20Diacetyl%20Signed.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was followed by a letter of support signed by more than 30 prominent scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Defending Science|url=http://defendingscience.org/upload/Scientists%20Letter%20to%20OSHA%20on%20Diacetyl07262006.pdf|title=Scientists' Letter to Secretary Chao|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210131/http://defendingscience.org/upload/Scientists%20Letter%20to%20OSHA%20on%20Diacetyl07262006.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter is under consideration. On January 21, 2009, OSHA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for regulating exposure to diacetyl.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register'', January 21, 2009 issue&lt;/ref&gt; The notice requests respondents to provide input regarding adverse health effects, methods to evaluate and monitor exposure, the training of workers.

Two bills in the [[California Legislature]] seek to ban the use of diacetyl.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/us/06butter.html?ex=1336104000&amp;en=8d5a0800872c853f&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Flavoring-Factory Illnesses Raise Inquiries], New York Times, May 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_0451-0500/sb_456_cfa_20070601_161435_sen_floor.html SB 456 Senate Bill - Bill Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220191327/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_0451-0500/sb_456_cfa_20070601_161435_sen_floor.html |date=2007-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_0501-0550/ab_514_cfa_20070602_170841_asm_floor.html AB 514 Assembly Bill - Bill Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220173824/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_0501-0550/ab_514_cfa_20070602_170841_asm_floor.html |date=2007-12-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 U.S. OSHA Safety and Health Information Bulletin and companion Worker Alert recommend employers use safety measures to avoid exposing employees to the potentially deadly effects of butter flavorings and other flavoring substances containing diacetyl or its substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehstoday.com/standards/osha/osha-safety-measures-diacetyl-exposure-5161/ OSHA Recommends Safety Measures to Protect Workers from Diacetyl Exposure], EHS Today, December 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A preliminary ''[[in vitro]]'' study, published in 2012, suggests that diacetyl may exacerbate the effects of [[beta-amyloid]] aggregation, a process linked to [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/tx3001016 | title = The Butter Flavorant, Diacetyl, Exacerbates β-Amyloid Cytotoxicity | year = 2012 | last1 = More | first1 = Swati S. | last2 = Vartak | first2 = Ashish P. | last3 = Vince | first3 = Robert | journal = [[Chemical Research in Toxicology]] | pages = 120706140246003 | volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in rats and mice has shown that diacetyl can damage the airway and damage cells that line the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Consumer safety===
In 2007, the [[Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association]] recommended reducing diacetyl in [[butter]] flavorings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femaflavor.org/sites/default/files/statements-releases/FEMA_Statement_9407.pdf|title=Comments of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States on New Information on Butter Flavored Microwave Popcorn|publisher=[[Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association|FEMA]]|type=press release|access-date=2012-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018143518/http://www.femaflavor.org/sites/default/files/statements-releases/FEMA_Statement_9407.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers of butter flavored popcorn including [[Pop Weaver]], [[Trail's End]], and [[ConAgra Foods]] (maker of [[Orville Redenbacher's]] and [[Act II (popcorn)|Act II]]) began removing diacetyl as an ingredient from their products.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver Popcorn Company. Press Release: [http://www.popweaver.com/NoDiacetylPressRelease.pdf Pop Weaver introduces first microwave popcorn with flavoring containing no diacetyl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001111/http://www.popweaver.com/NoDiacetylPressRelease.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ConAgra Foods Press Release [http://media.conagrafoods.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=202310&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1087864&amp;highlight= ConAgra Foods press release announcing removal of added diacetyl]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Wayne Watson, a regular microwavable popcorn consumer for years, was awarded [[US$]]7.27&amp;nbsp;million in damages from a federal jury in [[Denver]], which decided his lung disease was caused by the chemicals in microwave popcorn and that the popcorn's manufacturer, [[Gilster-Mary Lee Corporation]], and the grocery store that sold it should have warned him of its dangers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?n=81014-conagra-popcorn-lung-diacetyl ABC News: 'Popcorn Lung' Lawsuit Nets $7.2M Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfeedresearcher.com/data/articles_m38_2/popcorn-watson-lungs.html#hdng0 NewsFeed Researcher: 'Popcorn Lung' Lawsuit Nets $7.2M Award]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DP92112&gt;{{cite news|title=Centennial man with "popcorn lung" disease gets $7.3 million award |url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21586951/centennial-man-popcorn-lung-disease-gets-7-3 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=September 21, 2012 |author=Mark Jaffe |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6As16codb?url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21586951/centennial-man-popcorn-lung-disease-gets-7-3 |archivedate=September 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union regulation ===
The [[European Commission]] has declared diacetyl is legal for use as a flavouring substance in all EU states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsai.ie/legislation/food/eu_docs/Flavourings/Dir99.217.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119011834/http://www.fsai.ie/legislation/food/eu_docs/Flavourings/Dir99.217.pdf |date=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a diketone, diacetyl is included in the EU's flavouring classification Flavouring Group Evaluation 11 (FGE.11). A Scientific Panel of the EU Commission evaluated six flavouring substances (not including diacetyl) from FGE.11 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = The EFSA Journal | year = 2004 | volume = 166 | pages = 1–44 | title = Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in contact with Food (AFC) on a request from the Commission | url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/Scientific_Opinion/afc_opinionflav_ej166_en1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this study, the panel reviewed available studies on several other flavourings in FGE.11, including diacetyl. Based on the available data, the panel reiterated the finding that there were no safety concerns for diacetyl's use as a flavouring.

In 2007, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA), the EU's food safety regulatory body, stated its scientific panel on food additives and flavourings (AFC) was evaluating diacetyl along with other flavourings as part of a larger study.&lt;ref name=cpld2007&gt;[http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?n=81014-conagra-popcorn-lung-diacetyl Europe takes 'wait-and-see' stance on diacetyl flavouring. Oct 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Diacetyl was banned in eliquids / ecigarettes in the EU under the EU Tobacco Products Directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1762_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
Before inserting or removing a diaphragm, one should first wash one's hands&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jennifer|title=Diaphragms, Caps, and Shields|publisher=Planned Parenthood|date=December 2005|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/birth-control-pregnancy/birth-control/diaphragms-caps-and-shields.htm|accessdate=2006-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012053633/http://www.plannedparenthood.org/birth-control-pregnancy/birth-control/diaphragms-caps-and-shields.htm|archivedate=2006-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid introducing harmful bacteria into the vaginal canal.

The rim of a diaphragm is squeezed into an oval or arc shape for insertion. A water-based lubricant (usually spermicide) may be applied to the rim of the diaphragm to aid insertion.  One [[teaspoon]] (5 [[Litre|mL]]) of [[spermicide]] may be placed in the dome of the diaphragm before insertion, or with an applicator after insertion.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Richard|title=Diaphragm Fitting|journal=American Family Physician|volume=69|issue=1|date=January 2004|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040101/97.html|accessdate=2006-10-15|pmid=14727824|pages=97–100|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100035/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040101/97.html|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diaphragm must be inserted sometime before [[sexual intercourse]], and remain in the vagina for 6 to 8 hours after a man's last ejaculation.&lt;ref name="fwhc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaphragm|publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center|date=January 2006|url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/diaphram.htm|accessdate=2006-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020084323/http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/diaphram.htm|archivedate=2006-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For multiple acts of intercourse, it is recommended that an additional 5 mL of spermicide be inserted into the vagina (not into the dome—the seal of the diaphragm should not be broken) before each act. Upon removal, a diaphragm should be cleansed with warm mild soapy water before storage. The diaphragm must be removed for cleaning at least once every 24 hours&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt; and can be re-inserted immediately.

Oil-based products should not be used with latex diaphragms. Lubricants or vaginal medications that contain oil will cause the latex to rapidly degrade and greatly increases the chances of the diaphragm breaking or tearing.&lt;ref name="fwhc" /&gt;

Natural latex rubber will degrade over time. Depending on usage and storage conditions, a latex diaphragm should be replaced every one to three years.&lt;ref name="OrthoPI"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical|year=2004|url=http://www.ortho-mcneilpharmaceutical.com/ortho-mcneilpharmaceutical/shared/pi/diaph_patient.pdf#zoom=100|format=PDF|title=After your doctor or health care provider prescribes your Ortho diaphragm|accessdate=2007-07-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926084423/http://www.ortho-mcneilpharmaceutical.com/ortho-mcneilpharmaceutical/shared/pi/diaph_patient.pdf#zoom=100|archivedate=2007-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="old method"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of diaphragms, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed two ways: ''method effectiveness'' and ''actual effectiveness''.  The method effectiveness is the proportion of couples correctly and consistently using the method who do not become pregnant. Actual effectiveness is the proportion of couples who intended that method as their sole form of birth control and do not become pregnant; it includes couples who sometimes use the method incorrectly, or sometimes not at all. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.

For all forms of contraception, actual effectiveness is lower than method effectiveness, due to several factors:

* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the method's users
* conscious user non-compliance with method

For instance, someone using a diaphragm might be fitted incorrectly by a health care provider, or by mistake remove the diaphragm too soon after intercourse, or simply choose to have intercourse without placing the diaphragm.

''Contraceptive Technology'' reports that the method failure rate of the diaphragm with spermicide is 6% per year.&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{cite book|first=RA|last=Hatcher|author2=Trussel J|author3=Stewart F|year=2000|title=Contraceptive Technology|edition=18th|publisher=Ardent Media|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9664902-6-8|url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531095926/http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html|archivedate=2008-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual pregnancy rates among diaphragm users vary depending on the population being studied, with yearly rates of 10%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bulut A |title=Assessing the acceptability, service delivery requirements, and use-effectiveness of the diaphragm in Colombia, Philippines, and Turkey|journal=Contraception|volume=63|issue=5|pages=267–75|year=2001|pmid=11448468| doi=10.1016/S0010-7824(01)00204-9|last2=Ortayli|last3=Ringheim|last4=Cottingham|last5=Farley|last6=Peregoudov|last7=Joanis|last8=Palmore|last9=Brady|last10=Diaz|last11=Ojeda|last12=Ramos}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 39%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Kippley|author2=Sheila Kippley|year=1996|title=The Art of Natural Family Planning|edition=4th addition|publisher=The Couple to Couple League|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=978-0-926412-13-2|pages=146}}, which cites:&lt;br&gt;

Unlike some other cervical barriers, the effectiveness of the diaphragm is the same for women who have given birth as for those who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Trussell J |author2=Strickler J |author3=Vaughan B|title=Contraceptive efficacy of the diaphragm, the sponge and the cervical cap|journal=Fam Plann Perspect|volume=25|issue=3| pages=100–5, 135|year=1993|pmid=8354373|doi=10.2307/2136156|jstor=2136156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
The diaphragm does not interfere with a woman's natural cycle, therefore, no reversal or wait time is necessary, if contraception is no longer wanted or needed.

The diaphragm only has to be used during intercourse. Many women, especially those who have sex less frequently, prefer [[barrier contraception]] such as the diaphragm over methods that require some action every day.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Like all cervical barriers, diaphragms may be inserted several hours before use, allowing uninterrupted foreplay and intercourse. Most couples find that neither partner can feel the diaphragm during intercourse.

The diaphragm is less expensive than many other methods of contraception.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

===Sexually transmitted infections===
There is some evidence that the cells in the cervix are particularly susceptible to certain [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs).  Cervical barriers such as diaphragms may offer some protection against these infections.&lt;ref name="old method" /&gt; However, research conducted to test whether the diaphragm offers protection from HIV found that women provided with both male [[condoms]] and a diaphragm experienced the same rate of [[HIV]] infection as women provided with male condoms alone.&lt;ref name="new role"&gt;{{cite web|title=QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS: The MIRA Diaphragm Trial Results|url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/documents/MIRA_QA-7-12.doc|format=DOC|publisher=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society|date=July 2007|accessdate=2007-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802070004/http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/documents/MIRA_QA-7-12.doc|archivedate=2007-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID) is caused by certain STIs, diaphragms may lower the risk of PID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=J|first=Kelaghan|author2= G.L. Rubin, H.W. Ory and P.M. Layde|date=July 1982|title=Barrier-method contraceptives and pelvic inflammatory disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=248|issue=2|pages=184–187|doi=10.1001/jama.248.2.184|pmid=7087109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cervical barriers may also protect against [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), the virus that causes [[cervical cancer]], although the protection appears to be due to the spermicide used with diaphragms and not the barrier itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Hildesheim A |title=Barrier and spermicidal contraceptive methods and risk of invasive cervical cancer |journal=Epidemiology|volume=1|issue=4|pages=266–72|year=1990|pmid=2083303|doi=10.1097/00001648-199007000-00003|last2=Brinton |last3=Mallin |last4=Lehman |last5=Stolley |last6=Savitz |last7=Levine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaphragms are also considered a good candidate as a delivery method for [[microbicide]]s (preparations that, used vaginally, protect against STIs) that are currently in development.&lt;ref name="old method" /&gt;

==Side effects==
Women (or their partners) who are allergic to [[latex]] should not use a latex diaphragm.

Diaphragms are associated with an increased risk of [[urinary tract infection]] (UTI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fihn S| title=Association between diaphragm use and urinary tract infection|journal=JAMA|volume=254|issue=2|pages=240–5|year=1985|pmid=3999367|doi= 10.1001/jama.254.2.240| last2=Latham| last3=Roberts| last4=Running| last5=Stamm}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heaton C, Smith M|title=The diaphragm|journal=Am Fam Physician|volume=39|issue=5|pages=231–6|year=1989|pmid=2718900|last2=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urinating before inserting the diaphragm, and also after intercourse, may reduce this risk.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

[[Toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS) occurs at a rate of 2.4 cases per 100,000 women using diaphragms, almost exclusively when the device is left in place longer than 24&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

The increase in risk of UTIs may be due to the diaphragm applying pressure to the [[urethra]], especially if the diaphragm is too large, and causing irritation and preventing the bladder from emptying fully.  However, the spermicide [[nonoxynol-9]] is itself associated with increased risk of UTI, [[Candidiasis|yeast infection]], and [[bacterial vaginosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Information: Nonoxynol-9 cream, film, foam, gel, jelly, suppository|work=Medical University of South Carolina|date=March 2006|url=http://www.muschealth.com/cds/CPDrugInfo.details.aspx?cpnum=1477&amp;language=english|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012161848/http://muschealth.com/cds/CPDrugInfo.details.aspx?cpnum=1477&amp;language=english|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-12|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, some advocate use of lactic acid or lemon juice based spermicides, which might have fewer side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |first=  |title=Natural Spermicides and Femprotect  |work=Ovusoft.com Message Boards  |date=June 2003  |url=http://forums.ovusoft.com/tm.asp?m=1508226&amp;p=1&amp;tmode=6  |accessdate=2006-10-17  }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=Level C |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;br&gt;

It has also been suggested that, for women who experience side effects from [[nonoxynol-9]], it may be acceptable to use the diaphragm without any spermicide. One study found an actual pregnancy rate of 24% per year in women using the diaphragm without spermicide; however, all women in this study were given a 60&amp;nbsp;mm diaphragm rather than being fitted by a clinician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nonspermicide fit-free diaphragm trial reported|journal=Network|volume=5|issue=3|pages=7|year=1984|pmid=12279800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have been small and given conflicting results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ferreira A A|title= Effectiveness of the diaphragm, used continuously, without spermicide|journal=Contraception|volume=48|issue=1|pages=29–35|year=1993|pmid=8403903|doi= 10.1016/0010-7824(93)90063-D|last2= Araújo|last3= Regina|last4= Diniz|last5= Faúndes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bounds W |title=The diaphragm with and without spermicide.

In the early 1920s, [[Marie Stopes]] claimed that when wearing a diaphragm, the vagina is stretched such that certain movements made by the woman for the benefit of the man were restricted by the diaphragm spring. In later years there was some discussion of this, with two authors supporting this concept and one opposed. One of them argued in the later 1920s-1930s, that while the muscle movement by women is restricted it doesn't make all that much difference since most "women (in the 1920s) are not able to operate their pelvic muscles voluntarily to the best advantage" (during sex). However, Stopes anticipated this rebuttal, and in so many words classified it as a lame excuse.&lt;ref&gt;cook, Hera: The long sexual revolution: English women, sex and contraception 1800-1975.  Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 247-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Diaphragms are available in diameters of 50&amp;nbsp;mm to 105mm (about 2–4&amp;nbsp;inches). They are available in two different materials: [[latex]] and [[silicone]]. Diaphragms are also available with different types of springs in the rim.&lt;ref name="cbas diaphragm"&gt;{{cite web |title=Diaphragms |work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society |year=2000 |url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/diaphragms.cfm |accessdate=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005063906/http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/diaphragms.cfm |archivedate=2006-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''arcing spring'' folds into an arc shape when the sides are compressed. This is the strongest type of rim available in a diaphragm, and may be used by women with any level of vaginal tone. Unlike other spring types, arcing springs may be used by women with mild [[cystocele]], [[rectocele]], or [[Retroverted uterus|retroversion]].&lt;ref name="owh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Diaphragms |work=Ortho Women's Health |publisher=Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical |year=2001 |url=http://www.orthowomenshealth.com/products/diaphragmsprods.html |accessdate=2006-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016162727/http://www.orthowomenshealth.com/products/diaphragmsprods.html |archivedate=2006-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arcing spring diaphragms may be easier to insert correctly than other spring types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women find arcing-spring diaphragm easier to insert, studies indicate|journal=Contracept Technol Update|volume=7|issue=4|pages=41–2|year=1986|pmid=12340681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''coil spring'' flattens into an oval shape when the sides are compressed. This rim is not as strong as the arcing spring, and may only be used by women with average or firm vaginal tone.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt; If an arcing spring diaphragm is uncomfortable for a woman or, during intercourse, her partner, a coil spring may prove more satisfactory. Unlike the arcing spring diaphragms, coil springs may be inserted with a device called an introducer.

A ''flat spring'' is much like a coil spring, but thinner. This type of rim may only be used by women with firm vaginal tone. Flat spring diaphragms may also be inserted with an introducer for women uncomfortable using their hands.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt; Ortho used to manufacture a flat-spring diaphragm called the Ortho White.&lt;ref name="fpn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contraceptive Diaphragm|work=Family Practice Notebook|year=2000|url=http://www.fpnotebook.com/GYN14.htm|accessdate=2006-10-18|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060902071412/http://www.fpnotebook.com/GYN14.htm|archivedate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexions also manufactured a flat-spring diaphragm up until 2014.&lt;ref name="cbas diaphragm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="owh" /&gt;

There are a number of variations. The SILCS diaphragm is made of silicone, has an arcing spring, and a finger cup is molded on one end for easy removal. The Duet [[disposable]] diaphragm is made of dipped polyurethane, pre-filled with [[BufferGel]] (BufferGel is currently in clinical trials as a spermicide and [[Microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases|microbicide]]).&lt;ref name="cbas diaphragm"/&gt; Both the SILCS and Duet diaphragms are one-size-fits-all.

===Fitting===
[[Image:Fem isa 3.gif|thumb|1: [[urinary bladder|bladder]], 2: [[Pubis (bone)|pubic bone]], 3: [[urethra]], 4: [[vagina]], 5: [[uterus]], 6: [[Fornix vaginae|fornix]], 7: [[cervix]], 8: '''diaphragm''', 9: [[rectum]]]]
Diaphragms usually come in different sizes and require a fitting appointment with a health care professional to determine which size a woman should wear.  Single size diaphragms that do not require fitting also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new kind of diaphragm|year=2015|url=http://www.path.org/projects/silcs.php|accessdate=2015-11-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026065737/http://www.path.org/projects/silcs.php|archivedate=2015-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correctly fitting diaphragm will cover the [[cervix]] and rest snugly against the [[Pubis (bone)|pubic bone]]. A diaphragm that is too small might fit inside the vagina without covering the cervix, or might become dislodged from the cervix during intercourse or bowel movements.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt; It is also more likely that a woman's partner will feel the anterior rim of a too-small diaphragm during intercourse. A diaphragm that is too large will place pressure on the [[urethra]], preventing the bladder from emptying completely and increasing the risk of [[urinary tract infection]].&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt; A too-large diaphragm may also rub a sore on the vaginal wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaphragms: Management of Side Effects|work=PocketGuide for Family Planning Service Providers: Barriers and Spermicides|publisher=Reproductive Health Online|year=2003|url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/English/6read/6multi/pg/barr7.htm#Vaginal%20lesion|accessdate=2007-09-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416010609/http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/6read/6multi/pg/barr7.htm#Vaginal%20lesion|archivedate=2007-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaphragms should be re-fitted after a weight change of 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg (10&amp;nbsp;lb) or more.&lt;ref name="fwhc" /&gt; The traditional clinical guideline is that a decrease in weight may cause a woman to need a larger size, although the strength of this relationship has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kugel C, Verson H|title= Relationship between weight change and diaphragm size change|journal=Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing|volume=15|issue=2|pages= 123–9|year=1986|pmid=3517255|doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.1986.tb01377.x|last2= Verson}}&lt;br&gt;

Diaphragms should also be re-fitted after any pregnancy of 14 weeks or longer.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt; Full-term vaginal delivery especially will tend to increase the size diaphragm a woman needs, although the changes to the [[pelvic floor]] during pregnancy mean even women who experience second-trimester miscarriage, or deliver by [[Caesarean section|C-section]], should be refitted.

''Vaginal tenting'', an increase in the length of the vagina, occurs during arousal. This means that during intercourse, the diaphragm will not fit snugly against the pubic bone because it is carried higher up the vaginal canal by the movement of the cervix. If the diaphragm is inserted after arousal has begun, extra care must be taken to ensure the device is covering the cervix.&lt;ref name="OrthoPI" /&gt;

A woman might be fitted with a different size diaphragm depending on where she is in her [[menstrual cycle]]. It is common for a woman to wear a larger diaphragm during menstruation. It has been speculated that a woman may be fitted with a larger size diaphragm when she is near [[ovulation]].&lt;ref name="tcoyf"&gt;{{cite book|first= Toni|last=Weschler|year=2002|title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility|pages=232|edition=Revised|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-093764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct size for a woman is the largest size that she can wear comfortably throughout her cycle.

In the United States, diaphragms are available by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] only. Many other countries do not require prescriptions.

==Mechanism of action==
The spring in the rim of the diaphragm forms a seal against the vaginal walls. The diaphragm covers the [[cervix]], and physically prevents sperm from entering the [[uterus]] through the [[external orifice of the uterus|os]].

Traditionally, the diaphragm has been used with spermicide, and it is widely believed the spermicide significantly increases the effectiveness of the diaphragm.  Insufficient studies have been conducted to determine effectiveness without spermicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=L.|last2=Nanda|first2=K.|last3=Grimes|first3=D.|date=2002|title=Diaphragm versus diaphragm with spermicides for contraception|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD002031|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002031|issn=1469-493X|pmid=12137639}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12535422|date = July 2018}}

It is widely taught that additional spermicide must be placed in the vagina if intercourse occurs more than six hours after insertion.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OrthoPI" /&gt;  However, there has been very little research on how long spermicide remains active within the diaphragm. One study found that spermicidal jelly and creme used in a diaphragm retained its full spermicidal activity for twelve hours after placement of the diaphragm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leitch W|title=Longevity of Ortho Creme and Gynol II in the contraceptive diaphragm|journal=Contraception|volume=34|issue=4|pages=381–93|year=1986|pmid=3780236|doi=10.1016/0010-7824(86)90090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has long been recommended that the diaphragm be left in place for at least six or eight hours after intercourse. No studies have been done to determine the validity of this recommendation, however, and some medical professionals have suggested intervals of four hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kovacs G|title=Fitting a diaphragm| journal=Aust Fam Physician|volume=19|issue=5|pages=713, 716|year=1990|pmid=2346425}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even two hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernstein G|title=Is effectiveness of diaphragm compromised by postcoital swimming or bathing?|journal=JAMA|volume=237|issue=3|pages=2643–2644|year=1977|pmid=12259737|doi= 10.1001/jama.237.24.2643}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sufficient to ensure efficacy. One manufacturer of [[contraceptive sponge]]s recommends leaving the sponge in place for only two hours after intercourse.&lt;ref name="CBAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponges |work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society |year=2004 |url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/sponges.cfm |accessdate=2006-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114062634/http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/sponges.cfm |archivedate=2009-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such use of the diaphragm (removal before 6 hours post-intercourse) has never been formally studied, and cannot be recommended.

It has been suggested that diaphragms be dispensed as a one-size-fits-all device, providing all women with the most common size (70&amp;nbsp;mm). However, only 33% of women fitted for a diaphragm are prescribed a 70&amp;nbsp;mm size, and correct sizing of the diaphragm is widely considered necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mauck C |title=Diaphragms in clinical trials: is clinician fitting necessary?|journal=Contraception|volume=69|issue=4|pages=263–6|year=2004|pmid=15033398|doi= 10.1016/j.contraception.2003.11.006|last2=Lai|last3=Schwartz|last4=Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of blocking the cervix to prevent pregnancy is thousands of years old.  Various cultures have used cervix-shaped devices such as oiled paper cones or lemon halves, or have made sticky mixtures that include [[honey]] or cedar resin to be applied to the [[External orifice of the uterus|cervical opening]].&lt;ref name="pp2"&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Birth Control Methods|work=Planned Parenthood|date=June 2002|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/PPFA/history_bc_methods.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214142126/http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/PPFA/history_bc_methods.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the diaphragm—which stays in place because of the spring in its rim, rather than hooking over the cervix or being sticky—is of more recent origin.

An important precursor to the invention of the diaphragm was the rubber [[vulcanization]] process, patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1844. In the 1880s, a [[Germany|German]] gynecologist, Wilhelm P. J. Mensinga, published the first description of a rubber contraceptive device with a spring molded into the rim. Wilhelm P. J. Mensinga (1836-1910) wrote first under the pseudonym C. Hasse, and the Mensinga diaphragm was the only brand available for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Über die facultative Sterilität vom prophylaktischen und hygienischen Standpunkt (Pseudonym C.

American birth control activist [[Margaret Sanger]] fled to Europe in 1914 to escape prosecution under the [[Comstock laws]], which prohibited sending contraceptive devices, or information about contraception, through the mail. Sanger learned about the diaphragm in the [[Netherlands]] and introduced the product to the [[United States]] when she returned in 1916. Sanger and her second husband, Noah Slee, illegally imported large quantities of the devices from Germany and the Netherlands. In 1925, Slee provided funding to Sanger's friend Herbert Simonds, who used the funds to found the first diaphragm manufacturing company in the U.S., the Holland-Rantos Company.&lt;ref name="pp2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographical Note|work=The Margaret Sanger Papers|publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College|location=Northampton, Mass|year=1995|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html|accessdate=2006-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912180741/http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html|archivedate=2006-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaphragms played a role in overturning the federal Comstock Act. In 1932, Sanger arranged for a Japanese manufacturer to mail a package of diaphragms to a New York physician who supported Sanger's activism. U.S. customs confiscated the package, and Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, in the court case ''[[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries]]'', a federal appellate court ruled that the package could be delivered.&lt;ref name="pp2" /&gt;

Although in Europe, the [[cervical cap]] was more popular than the diaphragm, the diaphragm became one of the most widely used contraceptives in the United States. In 1940, one-third of all U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception. The number of women using diaphragms dropped dramatically after the 1960s introduction of the [[Intrauterine device|IUD]] and the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]. In 1965, only 10% of U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception.&lt;ref name="evolution" /&gt; That number has continued to fall, and in 2002 only 0.2% of American women were using a diaphragm as their primary method of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chandra|first=A|author2=Martinez GM|author3=Mosher WD|author4=Abma JC|author5=Jones J.|title=Fertility, Family Planning, and Reproductive Health of U.S. Women: Data From the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth|journal=Vital and Health Statistics|volume=23|issue=25|year=2005|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_025.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630135904/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_025.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-30|df=}} See Table 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-sized, silicone diaphragm was developed by [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]] during the late 2000s. It was licensed to Kessel Marketing &amp; Vertriebs GmbH of Frankfurt, Germany which began to market it as the Caya Diaphragm. The diaphragm was approved for contraception in Europe in 2013 and in the United States the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.path.org/projects/silcs.php |title=A new kind of diaphragm |accessdate=2015-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026065737/http://www.path.org/projects/silcs.php |archivedate=2015-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dirofilariasis''' is an infection by parasites of the genus ''[[Dirofilaria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-09|title=Dirofilariasis: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/236698-overview#a3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
It can be caused by:
* ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]''
* ''[[Dirofilaria repens]]''
* ''[[Dirofilaria tenuis]]''

==Diagnosis==
Dirofilariasis is often diagnosed by the examination of tissue obtained as part of the diagnostic investigation of [[Lesion|coin lesions]]. Blood tests are not yet helpful in the diagnosis of dirofilariasis in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/dirofilariasis/faqs.html |title=CDC - Dirofliariasis - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) |last=Prevention |first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and |website=www.cdc.gov |language=en-us |access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment with [[tetracycline antibiotics]] has been reported to damage [[Dirofilaria immitis]], often causing death of adult worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kramer |first=L. |last2=Grandi |first2=G. |last3=Leoni |first3=M. |last4=Passeri |first4=B. |last5=McCall |first5=J. |last6=Genchi |first6=C. |last7=Mortarino |first7=M. |last8=Bazzocchi |first8=C. |date=2008-12-10 |title=Wolbachia and its influence on the pathology and immunology of Dirofilaria immitis infection |journal=Veterinary Parasitology |volume=158 |issue=3 |pages=191–195 |doi=10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.09.014 |issn=0304-4017 |pmid=18947926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hungary, a '''dohánybolt''', in full '''nemzeti dohánybolt''' ({{ety|hu|nemzeti|national||dohány|tobacco||bolt|shop, store}}) is a government-approved and government-controlled shop that sells [[tobacco]] products.

The shops must not have wares on display to those outside, similar to the rules for [[betting shop]]s in the United Kingdom. Depending on the size of the shop, they also may often serve coffee and [[soft drink]]s, but it is illegal to smoke in a dohánybolt. Some of the larger have tables outside and essentially become a [[café]].

'''Empathy''' is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=392335 | title=The importance of empathy as an interviewing skill in medicine | author1=Bellet, Paul S. | author2=Michael J.

Types of empathy include cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and [[Wiktionary:somatic#Etymology|somatic]] empathy.&lt;ref name="Rothschild, B. 2006"&gt;Rothschild, B. (with Rand, M. L.). (2006). ''Help for the Helper: The psychophysiology of compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''empathy'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word εμπάθεια (''empatheia'', meaning "physical affection or passion"). This, in turn, comes from εν (''en'', "in, at") and πάθος (''[[pathos]]'', "passion" or "suffering").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2334198 Empatheia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was adapted by [[Hermann Lotze]] and [[Robert Vischer]] to create the German word ''Einfühlung'' ("feeling into"), which was translated by [[Edward B. Titchener]] into the English term empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener E.B. (1909/2014) [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf Introspection and empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132552/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf |date=July 26, 2014 }} Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2014; 7: 25–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| citeseerx=10.1.1.143.2396 | first = Vittorio | last = Gallese | year = 2003 | title = The Roots of Empathy: The Shared Manifold Hypothesis and the Neural Basis of Intersubjectivity | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 36 | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.1159/000072786 | pmid=14504450 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern Greek, εμπάθεια means "malice", "hostility".

''[[Alexithymia]]'' is a word used to describe a deficiency in understanding, processing or describing emotions ''in oneself'' as opposed to in others.&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;Bar-On, Reuven; Parker, James DA (2000). ''The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace''. San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-7879-4984-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: ἀλέξω (''alekso'', meaning "push away, repel, or protect") and ''θυμός'' (''thymos'', meaning "the soul, as the seat of emotion, feeling and thought"). Thus alexithymia literally means "pushing away your emotions".

Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of emotional states, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them; experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions; discerning what another person is thinking or feeling;&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G H M Pijnenborg, G.H.M. |author2=Spikman, J.M. |author3=Jeronimus, B.F. |author4=Aleman, A. |year=2012|title= Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy |journal= European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|volume=263|issue=4|pages=299–307|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|doi=10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|pmid=23076736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S.D., &amp; Klein, K.J.

''Journal of Socio-Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another a blur.&lt;ref name="Decety, J" /&gt;

It also is the ability to feel and share another person's emotions. Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another's emotions, while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"&gt;Snyder, C. R., Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti. Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths. Second ed. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011. 267–75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having empathy can include having the understanding that there are many factors that go into decision making and cognitive thought processes. Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many others factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy. According to Hoffman everyone is born with the capability of feeling empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Hanania|first=Ronit|last2=Davidov|first2=Maayan|last3=Zahn-Waxler|first3=Carolyn|date=2011-06-01|title=Empathy development from 8 to 16 months: Early signs of concern for others|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638311000506|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=34|issue=3|pages=447–458|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compassion]] and [[sympathy]] are terms associated with empathy.  Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an [[empathic concern]], a feeling of concern for another, in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier.&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). These things called empathy: Eight related but distinct phenomena. In J. Decety and W. Ickes (Eds.), The Social Neuroscience of Empathy (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–15). Cambridge: [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empathy is distinct also from [[pity]] and [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"/&gt; Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves, often described as "feeling sorry" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a [[crowd|mob]]) imitatively "catches" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hatfield E. |author2=Cacioppo J. L. |author3=Rapson R. L. |year=1993 |title=Emotional contagion |url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=96–99 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119002643/http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate&lt;ref name="Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010"&gt;Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Malley W. J. | year = 1999 | title = Teaching Empathy | url = | journal = America | volume = 180 | issue = 12| pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.

Empathy necessarily has a "more or less" quality. The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2002 | title = From passivity to competence: A conceptualization of knowledge, skill, tolerance, and empathy | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1521/psyc.65.4.338.20239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2013 | title = The parameters of empathy: Core considerations for psychotherapy and supervision | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2393689 | journal = Advances in Descriptive Psychology | volume = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meltzoff A.N. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2003 | title = What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 358 | issue = 1431| pages = 491–500 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 | pmid=12689375 | pmc=1351349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling.

In the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains. According to positive psychologists, people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be [[altruistic]].&lt;ref name="Snyder, C.

== Classification and types of empathy ==

Empathy is generally divided into two major components:&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers K, Dziobek I, Hassenstab J, Wolf OT, Convit A | date = Apr 2007 | title = Who cares?

=== Affective empathy ===
{{vanchor|Affective empathy}}, also called ''emotional empathy'':&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt; the capacity to respond with an appropriate emotion to another's mental states.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Our ability to empathize emotionally is based on emotional contagion:&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt; being affected by another's emotional or arousal state.&lt;ref name="Waal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/BIOL608W/deWaalAnnRevPsych2008.pdf | title=Putting the Altruism Back into Altruism: The Evolution of Empathy | author=Frans B.M. deWaal | journal=Annu.

Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

* [[Empathic concern]]: sympathy and compassion for others in response to their suffering.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minio-Paluello | first1 = Ilaria | last2 = Lombardo | first2 = Michael V. | last3 = Chakrabarti | first3 = Bhismadev | last4 = Wheelwright | first4 = Sally | last5 = Baron-Cohen | first5 = Simon | title = Response to Smith's Letter to the Editor "''Emotional Empathy in Autism Spectrum Conditions: Weak, Intact, or Heightened?''" | journal = [[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]] | volume = 39 | issue = 12 | page = 1749 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-009-0800-x | date = December 2009 | ref = harv }} [http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/bc249/papers/minio-paluello_2009_jadd.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050227/http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/bc249/papers/minio-paluello_2009_jadd.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}

* '''{{vanchor|Somatic empathy}}''' is a physical reaction, probably based on [[mirror neuron]] responses, in the [[somatic nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Rothschild, B. 2006"/&gt;

== Development of empathy ==

=== Evolutionary development across species ===

An increasing number of studies in [[ethology|animal behavior]] and [[neuroscience]] claim that empathy is not restricted to humans, and is in fact as old as the mammals, or perhaps older. Examples include [[dolphin]]s saving humans from drowning or from [[shark attack]]s. Professor Tom White suggests that reports of [[cetacea]]ns having three times as many spindle cells — the nerve cells that convey empathy — in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;White, T. I. (2007). In defense of dolphins: the new moral frontier. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

A multitude of behaviors has been observed in [[primate]]s, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in [[bonobo]]s, which are reported as the most empathetic of all the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandin|first=Jo|title=Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy|year=2007|publisher=Zoological Society of Milwaukee &amp; The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc.|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-9794151-0-4|page=109|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124025312/https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|archivedate=November 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The age of empathy: nature's lessons for a kinder society By: Waal, F.

For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety, [empathy] is not specific to humans. He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social [[attachment theory|attachment]], and [[parental care]].&lt;ref name="Decety, J"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Decety J | year = 2011 | title = The neuroevolution of empathy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1231 | issue = 1| pages = 35–45 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06027.x | pmid=21651564|bibcode = 2011NYASA1231...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the [[brainstem]], the [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Svetlova M. | year = 2012 | title = Putting together phylogenetic and ontogenetic perspectives on empathy | url = | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.05.003 | pmid = 22682726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others, all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness. Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

=== Ontogenetic development in the individual ===

According to researchers at the [[University of Chicago]] who used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), children between the ages of 7 and 12 years appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain. Their findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Michalska K.J. |author3=Akitsuki Y. | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the pain?

The research also found additional aspects of the brain were activated when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual, including regions involved in moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ Brain Scans Show Children Naturally Prone to Empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102202203/http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ |date=January 2, 2009 }} Newswise.

Despite being able to show some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most children do not show a fully fledged [[theory of mind]] until around the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wimmer H. |author2=Perner J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–28 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; Children usually become capable of passing "false belief" tasks, considered to be a test for a theory of mind, around the age of four. Individuals with [[autism]] often find using a theory of mind very difficult (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1988; the [[Sally-Anne test]]).

Empathetic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing and addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels that have the properties of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is held to be a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Those adults operating with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Douglas|title=Empathetic Maturity: Theory of Moral Point of View in Clinical Relations|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=36–46|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|pmid=11554532|doi=10.1097/00012272-200109000-00006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907234403/http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theories and empirical findings ==

=== Influence of empathy on helping behavior ===
Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006" /&gt; Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.

Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanovic|first=Zdravko|author2=Struthers, Greenglass |title=Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims? Assessment of Trait and Situational Predictors|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=August 8, 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=245–267|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x/asset/asap1262.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvu9nj&amp;s=2892713f7a99d42574ccda68fa2bbfc1c1578249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have posited that taking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy) allows these individuals to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the emotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, victim-blaming, and ultimately can lead to avoidance rather than helping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einolf|first=Christopher|title=Is Cognitive Empathy More Important than Affective Empathy? A Response to "Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims?"|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=March 13, 2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=268–271|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x/asset/asap1281.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvq647&amp;s=df598d6cfad7025a88420f2f5c207c0c980672fa|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, despite this evidence for empathy-induced altruistic motivation, egoistic explanations may still be possible. For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects’ sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation (Dovidio, 1990). But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249–260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===
Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion. Studies today enable us to see the activation of mirror neurons and attempt to explain the basic processes of empathy. By isolating these mirror neurons and measuring the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities,&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keen | first = Suzanne | year = 2006 | title = A Theory of Narrative Empathy | url = | journal = Narrative | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 207–36 | doi=10.1353/nar.2006.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; science has come one step closer to finding the reason for reactions like empathy. Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains (Dr. Christian Keysers). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"/&gt; Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.

In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartlett M.

A meta-analysis of recent fMRI studies of empathy confirmed that different brain areas are activated during affective–perceptual empathy and cognitive–evaluative empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763410001739 | title=Is there a core neural network in empathy?

Using [[fMRI]], neuroscientist [[Tania Singer]] showed that empathy-related neural responses tended to be significantly lower in males when observing an "unfair" person experiencing pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer T, Seymour B, O'Doherty JP, Stephan KE, Dolan RJ, Frith CD |date=Jan 2006 | title = Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7075| pages = 466–9 | bibcode = 2006Natur.439..466S | last2 = Seymour | last3 = O'Doherty | last4 = Stephan | last5 = Dolan | last6 = Frith | doi = 10.1038/nature04271 | pmid = 16421576 | pmc = 2636868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis from the journal of ''[[Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews]]''  also found that, overall, there are sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females, on average, were found to have higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathy: Gender effects in brain and behavior|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages = 604–627|volume = 46|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.09.001|first = Leonardo|last = Christov-Moore|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Simpson|first3 = Gino|last3 = Coudé|first4 = Kristina|last4 = Grigaityte|first5 = Marco|last5 = Iacoboni|first6 = Pier Francesco|last6 = Ferrari|pmid = 25236781|pmc = 5110041|year = 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814055810/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|archivedate = August 14, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another investigation with similar brain tools such as [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] amplitudes found, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger [[grey matter]] volumes in posterior [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]] and anterior [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal cortex]]  areas which are correlated with [[mirror neuron]]s in [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] literature.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Throughout prehistory, females were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Empathy in educational contexts ===
Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = McAlinden | first = Maggie | contribution = Can teachers know learners' minds?

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.&lt;ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"/&gt;

An important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. H. D., and A. P. Harbaugh. (2010).

=== Empathy in intercultural contexts ===
In order to achieve intercultural empathy, psychologists have employed empathy training. One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires.  Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn’t seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that "relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication".

US researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.&lt;ref&gt;William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, &amp; Richard Brislin (1979).

University of Portland.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental and environmental influences ===

The environment has been another interesting topic of study. Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.

A study done by Caroline Tisot  looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.

This study found that a few parenting practices – as opposed to parenting style as a whole – contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke. In most cases empathy is usually impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Richard|last2=Oishi|first2=Kenichi|last3=Hsu|first3=John|last4=Lindquist|first4=Martin|last5=Gottesman|first5=Rebecca F.|last6=Jarso|first6=Samson|last7=Crainiceanu|first7=Ciprian|last8=Mori|first8=Susumu|last9=Hillis|first9=Argye E.|date=2013-08-01|title=Acute lesions that impair affective empathy|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=136|issue=8|pages=2539–2549|doi=10.1093/brain/awt177|issn=0006-8950|pmc=3722353|pmid=23824490|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129031206/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this it has been found that damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can impact profoundly on a person's capacity to experience empathy toward another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Arielle de|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|date=2012-07-01|title=Changes in emotional empathy, affective responsivity, and behavior following severe traumatic brain injury|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=34|issue=6|pages=606–623|doi=10.1080/13803395.2012.667067|issn=1380-3395|pmid=22435955}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have suffered from an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy according to previous studies. In fact, more than 50% of people who suffer from a traumatic brain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Sousa|first=Arielle|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Li|first4=Sophie|last5=Dimoska|first5=Aneta|last6=James|first6=Charlotte|date=2010-10-01|title=Why don't you feel how I feel?

This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding one's own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individual’s emotional state.

== Applications ==

The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad  for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Batson C. D. |author2=Moran T. | year = 1999 | title = Empathy-induced altruism in a prisoner's dilemma | url = | journal = Eur. J. Soc.

On a more positive note, aroused individuals in an empathetic manner may focus on the long-term welfare rather than just the short-term of those in need. Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Empathy in the broadest sense refers to a reaction of one individual to another's emotional state. Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. But, how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–26 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empathic anger and distress ==

=== Anger ===

Empathic anger is an [[emotion]], a form of empathic distress.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w126637624m00103/ |title= Empathy and justice motivation|doi=10.1007/BF00991641 |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |year=1990|last1=Hoffman|first1=Martin L.|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing.

Empathic anger has direct effects on both helping and punishing desires. Empathic anger can be divided into two sub-categories: trait empathic anger and state empathic anger.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: Assessing a new dimension of empathy: Empathic anger as a predictor of helping and punishing desires, Vitaglione, Guy D. &amp; Barnett, Mark A. {{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194128/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between empathy and anger response towards another person has also been investigated, with two studies basically finding that the higher a person's perspective taking ability, the less angry they were in response to a provocation. Empathic concern did not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohr P. |author2=Howells K. |author3=Gerace A. |author4=Day A. |author5=Wharton M. | year = 2007 | title = The role of perspective taking in anger arousal | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Day A. |author2=Mohr P. |author3=Howells K. |author4=Gerace A. |author5=Lim L. | year = 2012 | title = The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students | url = | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 56 | issue = 4|pages = 599–613 | doi = 10.1177/0306624X11431061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distress ===

Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

== Impairment in psychopathology ==

A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. [[Psychopathy]] and [[narcissism]] have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas [[bipolar disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline traits]] have been associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s have been associated with various combinations, including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; [[Schizophrenia]], too, has been associated with deficits in both types of empathy.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017 |title=Empathic abilities in people with schizophrenia. |year=2008 |last1=Bora |first1=E. |last2=Gökçen |first2=S. |last3=Veznedaroglu |first3=B. |pmid=18514324 |volume=160 |issue=1 |journal=Psychiatry Res |pages=23–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;

=== Autism ===

The interaction between empathy and [[autism spectrum|autism]] is a complex and ongoing field of research. Several different factors are proposed to be at play.

A study of [[high-functioning autism|high-functioning]] adults with autistic spectrum disorders found an increased prevalence of [[alexithymia]],&lt;ref name="Hill et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hill E. |author2=Berthoz S. |author3=Frith U |year=2004 |title=Brief report: cognitive processing of own emotions in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder and in their relatives. |url=http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022613.41399.14 |pmid=15162941 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619122446/http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a personality construct characterized by the inability to recognize and articulate emotional arousal in oneself or others.&lt;ref name="Hill et al." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G.J. and Bagby, R.M &amp; Parker, J.D.A.

One study found that, relative to typically developing children, high-functioning autistic children showed reduced [[mirror neuron]] activity in the brain's [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (pars opercularis) while imitating and observing emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dapretto M. |author2=Davies M.S. |author3=Pfeifer J.H. |author4=Scott A.A. |author5=Sigman M. |author6=Bookheimer S.Y. |author7=Iacoboni M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–31 | doi=10.1038/nn1611 | pmid=16327784 | pmc=3713227}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals. Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism, including impaired theory of mind and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman. – 'EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum' in Brain Research (2005) p.190&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;

Previous studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind is the ability to understand the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The terms cognitive empathy and [[theory of mind]] are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Theory of mind relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex, and empathy, i.e. the ability to share the feelings of others, relies on the sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The lack of clear distinctions between [[theory of mind]] and cognitive empathy may have resulted in an incomplete understanding of the empathic abilities of those with Asperger syndrome; many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with Asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillberg | first1 = C.

Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] suggests that those with classic [[autism]] often lack both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; However, other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that people with [[Asperger syndrome]] may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind, but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as, and higher personal distress, than controls.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy,&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;Phoebe Caldwell, "Letters", London Times, Dec 30 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism, emotional empathy depends on [[mirror neuron]] activity (which, as described previously, has been found to be reduced in those with autism), and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others, while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others’ emotions. These “disorders of empathy” further highlight the importance of the ability to empathize by illustrating some of the consequences to disrupted empathy development.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicole M., and Daniel S. Messinger. "The development of empathy: How, when, and why." ''Moral Behavior and Free Will: A Neurobiological and Philosophical Aprroach'' (2011): 341-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] (E-S) suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their capabilities along two independent dimensions, empathizing (E) and systemizing (S). These capabilities may be inferred through tests that measure someone's Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Five different "brain types" can be observed among the population based on the scores, which should correlate with differences at the neural level. In the E-S theory, autism and Asperger syndrome are associated with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing. The E-S theory has been extended into the Extreme Male Brain theory, which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an "Extreme Type S" brain type, corresponding with above-average systemizing but challenged empathy.&lt;ref name="e-s theory"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon |year=2009 |title=Autism: The Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) Theory |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=1156 |issue=The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience 2009 |pages=68&amp;ndash;80 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |bibcode = 2009NYASA1156...68B |pmid=19338503 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain: specifically, people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile.

While the discovery of a higher incidence of diagnosed autism in some groups of second generation immigrant children was initially explained as a result of too little vitamin D during pregnancy in dark-skinned people further removed from the equator, that explanation did not hold up for the later discovery that diagnosed autism was most frequent in children of newly immigrated parents and decreased if they immigrated many years earlier as that would further deplete the body's store of vitamin D. Nor could it explain the similar effect on diagnosed autism for some European migrants America in the 1940s that was reviewed in the 2010s as a shortage of vitamin D was never a problem for these light-skinned immigrants to America. The decrease of diagnosed autism with the number of years the parents had lived in their new country also cannot be explained by the theory that the cause is genetic no matter if it is said to be caused by actual ethnic differences in autism gene prevalence or a selective migration of individuals predisposed for autism since such genes, if present, would not go away over time. It have therefore been suggested that autism is not caused by an innate deficit in a specific social circuitry in the brain, also citing other research suggesting that specificalized social brain mechanisms may not exist even in neurotypic people, but that particular features of appearance and/or minor details in behavior are met with exclusion from socialization that shows up as apparently reduced social ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigrant Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Relationship between the Perspective of the Professionals and the Parents’ Point of View" 2013 Milena Pereira Pondé PhD, Cécile Rousseau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Prevalence of autism according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin" 2011 Marie-Jose Dealberto&lt;/ref&gt;

A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and [[sadness]]), including decreased activation of the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate cortical]] regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Skelly, L.

A recent study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their "empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.&lt;ref name="empathy switch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727080108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Tanya.

Work conducted by Professor [[Jean Decety]] with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] parts of the brain, but more activity in the [[striatum]] and the [[insular cortex|insula]] when compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Skelly | first2 = L.

It was predicted that people who have high levels of psychopathy would have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but would lack in their ability to use affective empathy. People that scored highly on psychopathy measures were less likely to portray affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and affective empathy correspond strongly. The DANVA-2 portrayed those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullins-Nelson | first1 = Jana L. | last2 = Salekin | first2 = Randall T. | last3 = Anne-Marie | first3 = R.

Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which includes the ability to ''feel'' the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as [[emotional contagion]]), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Korina|last2=Spengler|first2=Stephanie|last3=Bermpohl|first3=Felix|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2017-04-06|title=Social cognition in aggressive offenders: Impaired empathy, but intact theory of mind|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00745-0|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-00745-0|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..670W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]], on the other hand, are claimed to be often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Zero Degrees of Empathy: A New Theory of Human Cruelty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QUPgbxY4C4C |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin UK |location= |isbn= 9780713997910|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and [[punishment]] as psychopathy, as it means suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences (e.g. non-shared environment having more influence than family environment). It is suggested that psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;“How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain” 2017 Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Role of Culture in Empathy: The Consequences and Explanations of Cultural Differences in Empathy at the Affective and Cognitive Levels" 2014 David Atkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other conditions ===

Research indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.

[[Borderline personality disorder]] is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Minzenberg et al., 2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minzenberg|first=M.J.|first2=M.|last2=Fisher-Irving|first3=J.H.|last3=Poole|first4=S.|last4=Vinogradov|year=2006|title=Reduced self-referential source memory performance is associated with interpersonal dysfunction in borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|url=http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516001713/http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|archivedate=May 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much, several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states (impaired [[cognitive empathy]]), as well as an impaired [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces, suggesting increased empathic capacities.&lt;ref name="Wagner and Linehan, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=A.W.|author2=M.M Linehan|year=1999|title=Facial expression recognition ability among women with borderline personality disorder: implications for emotion regulation?|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=T.R.|first2=M.Z. |last2=Rosenthal |first3=D.S. |last3=Kosson |first4=J.S. |last4=Cheavens |first5=C.W. |last5=Lejuez |first6=R.J. |last6=Blair|year=2006|title=Heightened sensitivity to facial expressions of emotion in borderline personality disorder.|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.647 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, possible that impaired cognitive empathy (the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective) may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction, while "hyper-emotional empathy"{{Verify source|date=August 2013}} may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy, yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy.&lt;ref name=Harari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harari|first=Hagai|author2=Simone G.

Proper empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another. Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Two general methods have been identified here. An individual may simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings it provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then access the environment for a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Waal F.

Some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] an anti-empathy crusader claims emotional engagement of empathy leads to racism and prejudice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 2010, team led by Grit Hein and Tania Singer gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported. Each participant received a mild electric shock, then watched another go through the same pain. When the wristbands matched, both brains flared: with pain, and empathic pain.

Early indicators for a lack of empathy:

#Forming opinions early and defending them vigorously
#Thinking that other people are overly sensitive
#Refusing to listen to other points of view
#Blaming others for mistakes
#Not listening when spoken to
#Holding grudges and having difficulty to forgive

There are concerns that the empathizer's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p.&amp;nbsp;104). It is evidenced that societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy.&lt;ref name="WeinerCraighead2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irving B. Weiner|author2=W.

== Ethical issues ==

The extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wyschogrod E | year = 1981 | title = Empathy and sympathy as tactile encounter | url = | journal = J Med Philos | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/6.1.25 | pmid = 7229562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances. For instance, [[Tania Singer]] says that clinicians or caregivers must be objective to the emotions of others, to not over-invest their own emotions for the other, at the risk of [[compassion fatigue|draining away]] their own resourcefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|title=Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout|work=Wired UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515020421/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|archivedate=May 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a [[caregiving]] situation.

==== Ethics ====

In his 2008 book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time:Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', writer [[Iain King]] presents two reasons why empathy is the "essence" or "DNA" of right and wrong. First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including that it is "partly self-standing", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.&lt;ref name="King2008-74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&amp;nbsp;... Something rooted in empathy must have more of the essence of good about it than something which is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows empathy-based judgements to have sufficient distance from a personal opinion to count as "moral". His second argument is more practical: he argues, "Empathy for others really is the route to value in life", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue Ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.&lt;ref name="King2008-227"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;A Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }} Global Oneness article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Publishers Weekly]] state that "King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].

In the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phenomenology ====

In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not "my" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Some postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present. If we watch from a fictitious past, can tell the present with the future tense, as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy. There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, G. (1976) Prefazione 6. L'elemento storico e politico -sociale, in G.B. Marino, ''L'Adone'' Milano&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===

[[Heinz Kohut]] is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.

In evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the "ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-13-238245-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business and management ===

In the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of "Open Empathy Organizations". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success

== Measurement ==
{{citation style|section|date=July 2013}}
Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.

Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.

Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax (1967b).&lt;ref&gt;Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax. Madison, Wisconsin, The University of Wisconsin Press pp.&amp;nbsp;555–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimenters, including Mehrabian and Epstein (1972),&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mehrabian A. |author2=Epstein N. | year = 1972 | title = A measure of emotional empathy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 525–543 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00078.x | pmid = 4642390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.

Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Levenson R. W. |author2=Ruef A. M. | year = 1992 | title = Empathy: a physiological substrate | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.234 | pmid = 1403614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leslie K. R. |author2=Johnson-Frey S. H. | year = 2004 | title = Functional imaging of face and hand imitation: towards a motor theory of empathy | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 601–607 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.038 | pmid = 14980562 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bodily or "somatic" measures can be looked upon as behavioral measures at a micro level. Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of "emotional contagion" or mirroring (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992*; Leslie et al., 2004*). It should be pointed out that these reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking ("if I were him I would feel&amp;nbsp;...").

Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy (e.g. Geher, Warner and Brown, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geher G. |author2=Warner R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Predictive validity of the emotional accuracy research scale | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 373–388 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00045-3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;); scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form (e.g. Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"/&gt;). Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates (e.g. Davis, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M. H. | year = 1980 | title = A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy | url = | journal = JSAS Catalogue of selected documents in psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). More recent paper-based tools include The [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) created by [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen]] and Wheelwright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baron-Cohen S. |author2=Wheelwright S. |year=2004 |title=The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences |url=http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=163–175 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 |pmid=15162935 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304035846/http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items.

For the very young, picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers (e.g. Denham and Couchoud, 1990). Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions (Barnett, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett M. A. | year = 1984 | title = Similarity of experience and empathy in preschoolers | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy. These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy (Geher et al., 2001)*. Gladstein (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, G. A. (1987). What It All Means. Empathy and counseling: explorations in theory and research. G. A. Gladstein. New York, Springer-Verlag: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathizer, the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer. He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon "empathy"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Duan C. |author2=Hill C. E. | year = 1996 | title = The current state of empathy research | url = | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 261–274 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the ''Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen D, Lew R, Hershman W, Orlander J |year= 2007 |title= A cross-sectional measurement of medical student empathy |journal= J Gen Intern Med |volume= 22 |issue= 10 |pages= 1434–8 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x |pmc= 2305857 |pmid= 17653807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is the only published measurement tool to date that accounts for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four 7-item scales covering the above subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M | year = 1983 | title = Measuring individual differences in empathy: evidence for a multidimensional approach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–126 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

== Other animals ==

Research has shown that the ability of empathy in other species is attainable. Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species, including (but not limited to) canines, felines, dolphins, primates, rats and mice {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In animals, empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival, the sharing of food, companionship and pack-oriented mentality. It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response. Many researchers{{Who|weasel|date=May 2014}} maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of [[anthropomorphism]].

Researchers Zanna Clay and [[Frans de Waal]] studied the socio-emotional development of the [[bonobo]] chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clay|author2=Zanna|title=Development of socio-emotional competence in bonobos.|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=November 5, 2014|volume=110|issue=45|pages=18121–18126|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=181339d9-1520-40c7-a9e4-ce8ac385d6d9%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-39226-002|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316449110|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018121C |pmc=3831480}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It was found that the bonobos  sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.

Empathic-like responding has been observed in [[chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110–12115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=11&amp;sid=24706b87-cfc3-4942-8f8f-8d4fa8b29f28%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2010-14411-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.

It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537–544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=bf4000d0-6a9c-4225-8ebf-82db56f427e8%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-01472-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads.  Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.

[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0510-1 |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851–859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|accessdate=October 5, 2014|pages=851–859|pmid=22644113}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.

When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223–229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=c35dba7e-d8a4-4b46-8855-20319f7a74e3%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-21521-001 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.

'''Fatima Zohra Ardjoune''' is an [[People's National Army (Algeria)|Algerian Army]] [[General officer|general]]. She is the first woman in the [[Arab world]] to attain this rank. A medical doctor, she pioneered research in the field of [[hematology]] in the country in the 1980s. She serves as director-general of the army's central hospital.  

== Early life and career ==
Fatima Zohra Ardjoune was born in [[Sétif]] and attended an indigenous primary school followed by a girls high school in [[Kouba, Algeria|Kouba]]. As a child she wanted to help others, and went on to study medicine at the [[University of Algiers]].&lt;ref name=general/&gt;

Ardjoune joined the [[People's National Army (Algeria)|People's National Army of Algeria]] in February 1972. In the 1980s she worked with her husband Mohamed Ardjoun (now a Colonel and director of the army's Blood Transmission Centre) to research blood-borne diseases. The couple were among the first Algerians to carry out research in the field and developed the country's first screening methods at Maillot Hospital.&lt;ref name=general/&gt;

Ardjoune's doctoral thesis was accepted in 1983 and she was promoted to the rank of [[Commandant (rank)|commandant]] (equivalent to major) in 1986. She was appointed a professor in 1991 and promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=general&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kechar|first1=Mounir|title=Pr Fatima Zohra Ardjoune, la première femme général de l'armée algérienne|url=http://www.algerlablanche.com/index.php?post/Pr-Fatima-Zohra-Ardjoune%2C-la-premi%C3%A8re-femme-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-l-arm%C3%A9e-alg%C3%A9rienne|accessdate=17 April 2018|publisher=Algeria Blanche|date=31 March 2014|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardjoune writes scientific papers on hematology and supervises post-graduate research students at the National School of Military Health, the [[University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene]] and at the [[University of Algiers]].&lt;ref name=general/&gt;&lt;ref name=hem/&gt;

'''Food policy''' is the area of [[public policy]] concerning how food is produced, processed, distributed, and purchased. Food policies are designed to influence the operation of the food and agriculture system. This often includes decision-making around production and processing techniques, marketing, availability, utilization and consumption of food, in the interest of meeting or furthering social objectives. Food policy can be promulgated on any level, from local to global, and by a government agency, business, or organization. Food policymakers engage in activities such as regulation of food-related industries, establishing eligibility standards for food assistance programs for the poor, ensuring safety of the food supply, [[food labeling]], and even the qualifications of a product to be considered [[organic food|organic]].&lt;ref name="What is a food policy?"/&gt;

[[File:Holding rice.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of hands holding rice.|Rice]]

Most food policy is initiated at the domestic level for purposes of ensuring a safe and adequate food supply for the citizenry.&lt;ref name="Linked National Models"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fischer, G. |author2=Frohberg, K. |author3=Keyzer, M.A. |author4=Parikh, K.S. | title=Linked National Models: A Tool for International Policy Analysis| year=1988| publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] | location=The Netherlands| isbn=978-9024737345}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[developing nation]], there are three main objectives for food policy: to protect the poor from crises, to develop long-run markets that enhance efficient resource use, and to increase food production that will in turn promote an increase in income.&lt;ref name="Managing food price risks and instability in a liberalizing market environment"/&gt;

Food policy comprises the mechanisms by which food-related matters are addressed or administered by governments, including international bodies or networks, and by public institutions or private organizations. Agricultural producers often bear the burden of governments' desire to keep food prices sufficiently low for growing urban populations.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/how-neighborhoods-lost-food/|author=Boeing, G.|title=How Our Neighborhoods Lost Food, and How They Can Get It Back|journal=Progressive Planning|date=2016|volume=206|issue=Winter|pages=35–37|accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low prices for consumers can be a disincentive for farmers to produce more food, often resulting in hunger, poor trade prospects, and an increased need for food imports.&lt;ref name="Linked National Models" /&gt;

In a more developed country such as the [[United States]], food and nutrition policy must be viewed in context with regional and national economic concerns, environmental pressures, maintenance of a [[social safety net]], encouragement of private enterprise and innovation, and an agrarian landscape dominated by fewer, larger mechanized farms.&lt;ref name="Wilde"&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilde| first=Parke| title=Food Policy in the United States: An Introduction| year=2013| publisher=[[Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] |location=London and New York| isbn=978-1-84971-428-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialized countries strive to ensure that farmers earn relatively stable incomes despite price and supply fluctuations and adverse weather events. The cost of subsidizing farm incomes is passed along to consumers in the form of higher food prices.&lt;ref name="Linked National Models" /&gt;

== History ==

===History of food policy within the U.S. federal government===
The history of food policy in the United States started in the 1880s with policies being carried out by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]. In 1883, [[Harvey W. Wiley]], M.D., was appointed chief chemist at USDA. Wiley devoted his career to raising public awareness of problems with [[adulterated food]]; developing standards for [[food processing]]; and campaigning for the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], also known as the "Wiley Act". For much of the 1880s, policymakers discussed how to deal with diseased [[livestock]] being imported into or exported out of the United States. In 1884, the USDA [[Bureau of Animal Industry]] (BAI) was created with the purpose of ensuring that diseased livestock could not be used as food. In 1890, the BAI was charged also with testing meats being exported from the U.S. and ensuring these were disease-free. In 1906, the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] and the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]] (FMIA) were both signed into law. Both prevent production and sale of adulterated or misbranded foods, the Pure Food and Drug Act focusing on general foods, and FMIA focusing on meats.&lt;ref name="FSIS History"/&gt;

The Bureau of Chemistry, which was charged with enforcing the Pure Food and Drug Act, was reorganized in 1927, becoming the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration, and eventually came to be called the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1931. In 1938, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] was passed by Congress, giving the FDA authority to set food safety standards. The FDA was reorganized to be under the direction of the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] in 1940. The Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) was passed in 1946, allowing inspection of exotic and game animals on a pay-by-case basis, and giving the USDA the authority to inspect, certify and identify the class, quality and condition of agricultural products.&lt;ref name="FSIS History"/&gt;

In 1953, with large-scale reorganization in the USDA, the BAI and Bureau of Dairy were abolished, among other bureaus, and their duties were transferred to the [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS). The [[Poultry Products Inspection Act]] was passed in 1957. This ensured that [[poultry]] products shipped in [[interstate commerce]] as well as those products being imported into the U.S. were continually inspected for diseases, and that product labels are accurate. In 1958, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was amended to include the Food Additive Amendment, addressing concerns over invisible hazards from chemicals added to the foods. Also, the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act was passed in 1958. In 1978, this act was amended to ensure that all meat that was inspected by the FSIS to be used for human consumption was humanely slaughtered.&lt;ref name="FSIS History"/&gt;

In 1965, reorganization of the ARS' Consumer and Marketing Service brought federal meat and poultry inspection into one program. In 1967, the [[Wholesome Meat Act]] amended the FMIA, and in 1968, the Wholesome Poultry Act amended the PPIA, both requiring states to conduct inspection programs at least as stringent as federal inspections. The Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA), passed in 1970, ensured the continuous inspection of the processing of egg products. In 1995, this task was taken over by FSIS, and the FDA took responsibility for shell egg products. In 1977, following several changes in organization, the Food Safety and Quality Service, renamed the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) in 1981, was created to perform meat and poultry grading.&lt;ref name="FSIS History"/&gt;

Following an ''[[E. coli]]'' outbreak in 1993, inspections began to rely more on scientific tests as opposed to the usual sensory-based inspections. FSIS pushed research of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In 1996, the Pathogen Reduction/HACCP Systems were issued, ensuring that illness-causing [[pathogen]]s are reduced on raw products. Now, while the industry must ensure they are using safe practices, the government is ultimately responsible for setting safety standards and enforcing those standards through inspections and regulation.&lt;ref name="FSIS History"/&gt;

While [[food safety]] concerns may have motivated some of the earliest food policy initiatives, public policies developed around other forms of consumer protections during the latter half of the 20th century, including [[food labeling]] and [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion#Dietary Guidelines for Americans|dietary guidance]]. The role of [[poverty]] in [[food insecurity]] as well as agricultural concerns have also contributed to the food policy landscape and debate in the United States in recent decades.

===History of food policy outside of the U.S. federal government===
The primary international agency with a focus on food policy is the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the United Nations, established in 1945 with four express purposes: to improve [[nutrition]] and [[living standards]] in member nations, improve the efficiency of production and distribution of all food and agricultural products, better the conditions of rural populations, and expand the world economy in such a way that it would ensure humanity's freedom from hunger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/022/k8024e.pdf Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, FAO hosted the first World Food Conference in [[Rome]] and adopted a "Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/EradicationOfHungerAndMalnutrition.aspx Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]. United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Adopted on 16 November 1974 by the World Food Conference convened under General Assembly resolution 3180 (XXVIII) of 17 December 1973; and endorsed by General Assembly resolution 3348 (XXIX) of 17 December 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, numerous public and private efforts were launched to better understand the agricultural, economic, social, climatological, and geo-political contributors to hunger. Organizations such as the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] were founded to fund research designed to lead to "sustainable solutions for ending hunger and poverty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=About IFPRI| url=http://www.ifpri.org/ourwork/about| publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and annually produces a Global Food Policy Report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/book-9464/ourwork/researcharea/global-food-policy-report Global Food Policy Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-makers seek to better understand how economic principles govern supply and demand and how supply and demand influence [[food security]], first defined in the 1970s as "the ability to meet food needs in a consistent way,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Anderson| first=Molly D.| author2=John T. Cook| title=Community food security: Practice in need of theory?| journal=Agriculture and Human Values| year=1999| volume=16| pages=141–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the definition continues to evolve.

Food policies evolve as nations improve their economic condition, moving from an economy based on isolated, self-sufficient rural farming to one based on trade and the development of a wider variety of goods and services offered. [[Urbanization]], population growth, and shifting health concerns affect the way food policy is approached.&lt;ref name="Linked National Models" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt; The following table adapted from Simon Maxwell and Rachel Slater succinctly describes the evolutionary shift in food policies internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Maxwell| first=S.| author2=Slater, R.| title=Food policy old and new| journal=Development Policy Review| year=2003| volume=21 | issue=5–6|pages=531–553| doi=10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00222.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food policies and population health in a global setting ==

Food policy is generally linked to the health of a population. The early literature in under-nutrition involving [[developing countries]] was concerned with the effects of food shortage practices on spreading diseases such as [[marasmus]] and [[kwashiorkor]]. With increases in food production, consumption of energy-dense foods, and the reduction of [[physical activity]], there has been an increase in the prevalence of [[obesity]] in [[developed countries]], especially in [[middle income]] families, and in some [[developing countries]]. Such issues are receiving greater attention from nutritionists and health economists in part because of the life-time costs of treating associated conditions such as [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]]. Also, these policies have aided gains in [[life expectancy]] achieved in the last few decades by reducing the rate of premature deaths due to obesity and [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref name="The World is Getting Fat"/&gt;

From the standpoint of policy makers, the diets of lower income families within developing countries need to contain higher quantities of nutrients such as dietary [[protein]], [[iron deficiency|iron]], [[calcium]], [[vitamin A]], and [[vitamin C]], in relation to overall [[energy intake]]. By contrast, food policies for developed countries should encourage lower consumption of energy-dense foods such as those high in [[dietary fat]] and [[sugar]]s, while promoting higher intakes of [[dietary fiber]] for improving health.&lt;ref name="books2"/&gt;

==Food policy in the United States==

In the United States, food policy decisions are made by government entities at the federal, state, and local level. The primary arenas of federal involvement in food policy include agriculture, nutrition assistance, food safety, dietary guidance, and labeling. Industry initiatives and the work of advocacy organizations that affect food policy are also addressed in this section. Most food policies are developed incrementally, often in reaction to changed circumstances, political climates, or needs.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;

=== Governance ===
All three branches of the federal government play a role in the formulation of food policy in the United States.

==== Executive Branch ====
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] is the federal agency that is responsible for ensuring the safety of food products, with the exception of meat, poultry, an processed eggs. The various offices within the FDA carry out the agency's unified food program that protects and promotes the public health through the following activities:

*Ensuring the safety of foods for humans, including [[food additive]]s and [[dietary supplement]]s, by setting science-based standards for preventing [[foodborne illness]] and ensuring compliance with these standards
*Ensuring the safety of [[animal feed]] and the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, including the safety of drug residues in human food derived from animals
*Protecting the food and feed supply from intentional [[food contaminant|contamination]]
*Ensuring that [[food label]]s are truthful and contain reliable information consumers can use to choose healthy diets.&lt;ref name="How do USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service differ from the activities of FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition?"/&gt;

[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb | right | 350px |alt=myplate | [[MyPlate]] has been developed to take the place of the widely known [[food pyramid (nutrition)|food pyramid]]. MyPlate illustrates the proportions of each food group which should be present at each meal.]]
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has a broad range of interests involved in food policy.

The [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) is responsible for making sure that the United States' commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.&lt;ref name="About FSIS"/&gt;

The [[Food and Nutrition Service]] (FNS) focuses on helping children and needy families get proper nutrition through food assistance programs and nutrition education. Two widely known programs within FNS are the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP) and the [[National School Lunch Program]] (NSLP).&lt;ref name="About FNS"/&gt;

The [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] (CNPP) works to improve the health and well-being of Americans by developing and promoting dietary guidance that links scientific research to the nutrition needs of consumers.&lt;ref name="About CNPP"/&gt; The widely accepted food pyramid was used as part of this dietary guidance, but more recently [[MyPlate]] has been developed to show proper nutrition practices in reference to a place setting. The [[food group]]s of fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy are each allotted a certain amount of space on the plate, showing the public the proportional amounts of each food they should be eating during each meal.&lt;ref name="MyPlate"/&gt;

The [[National Organic Program]] (NOP) regulates the standards for any farm that wants to sell an agricultural product as being organically produced.&lt;ref name="Organic Certification"/&gt; In order for the agricultural product to be labeled organic, [[synthetic fertilizer]]s, [[sewage sludge]], [[irradiation]], and [[genetic engineering]] may not be used.&lt;ref name="National Organic Program"/&gt; Additionally, any animal product that is labeled organic must follow guidelines that the livestock living conditions, health care practice and feed follow organic specifications.

==== Legislative Branch ====

With authority over the nation's annual budget, [[United States Congress|Congress]] also plays a role in the formulation of food policies, particularly around issues related to farming and nutrition assistance. In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Committee on Agriculture]] is the lead player; in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], it is the [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry|Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry]]. The budget and appropriations committees of each house also play a role. When a program or policy is subject to [[mandatory spending]] requirements, meaning that congressional budget committees must fully fund the program for all who meet eligibility criteria, it is the authorizing agriculture committees in both houses that have the power to define the scope of eligibility for the programs. Programs that are not considered mandatory are considered [[discretionary spending]] programs, and power over the bottom line is in the hands of the appropriations committees of each house charged with setting annual spending levels.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;

==== Judicial Branch ====

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has been involved in numerous decisions that have affected food policy around trade and patent concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Healey| first=Jon| title=Supreme Court hands Monsanto a GMO victory| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/13/news/la-ol-supreme-court-monsanto-seeds-patent-20130513| accessdate=December 5, 2013| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; food safety,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=David| first=Stephanie D.| title=Raw milk in court: Implications for public health policy and practice| journal=Public Health Rep.| pmc= 3461852| pmid=23115386| volume=127| issue=6| pages=598–601| year=2012| doi=10.1177/003335491212700610}}&lt;/ref&gt; and labeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Egelko| first=Bob| title=U.S. court rebuffs Bush on tuna ban / White House chided for trying to loosen 'dolphin-safe' rules| url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/U-S-court-rebuffs-Bush-on-tuna-ban-White-House-2575385.php| accessdate=December 5, 2013| newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle| date=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more systematic and aggressive use of the court system to challenge practices that are linked to obesity has been proposed. Examples include initiating lawsuits against real estate developers who do not include recreational facilities in their designs, school boards that allow exclusive vending rights to soft drink companies, and manufacturers of non-nutritious foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mello| first=MM |author2=Studdert, DM |author3=Brennan, TA| title=Obesity: The new frontier of public health law| journal=New England Journal of Medicine| year=2006| volume=354| issue=24| pages=2601–10| doi=10.1056/nejmhpr060227 | pmid=16775242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of federal food policy ==

=== The farm bill ===
{{main article|United States farm bill}}
From a public finance point of view, the two most costly undertakings of the federal government are spending on nutrition assistance and [[farm subsidy]] programs, both governed in an omnibus farm bill that is refashioned every five years. Nutrition assistance is by far the costliest food policy program in the nation, followed by farm subsidies. The role of agricultural concerns and nutrition assistance are described in more detail below.

=== Agricultural concerns ===
{{main article|Agricultural policy of the United States}}
Government interventions in the agricultural economy influence the quantities produced and price of food.&lt;ref name="Linked National Models" /&gt; A number of different instruments are used to incentivize farmers to grow crops and buffer them through difficult economic or weather cycles, including [[price support]]s, supply controls, [[deficiency payment]]s, direct payments, insurance, and demand expansion. Updated every five years, the [[United States farm bill]] specifies the type of policy instruments that will be funded in a given cycle and at what cost. Subsidies to farming interests, determined primarily by the farm, are expected to cost $223 billion over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2022, according to the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS). [[Crop insurance]] is the most expensive of the federal farm subsidies, followed by conservation policies and commodity supports.&lt;ref name="CRS Report 2012"&gt;Monke, J. Budget Issues Shaping a 2012 Farm Bill, No. R42484, Congressional Record Service, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives and senators from states that receive the lion's share of farm subsidies often dominate the committees on agriculture in the House and Senate.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt; [[Agricultural economics]] plays an increasingly larger role in the understanding of both domestic and global food trade policy decisions.

The primary demand expansion program supported by the federal government through the Department of Agriculture is known as the [[commodity checkoff program]]. It is responsible for a series of familiar advertising campaigns to create higher demand for commodity products such as milk, beef, pork, and eggs. Familiar slogans from these campaigns include "[[Got Milk?]]"; "[[Pork. The Other White Meat]]"; and "[[The Incredible, Edible Egg]]". Checkoff programs do not exist for some of the healthier foods grown and produced in the U.S., including poultry, fish, and whole grains, and marketing support for [[produce]] is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Forker| first1=Olan D.| last2 = Ward| first2=Ronald W.| title=Commodity checkoff programs: A self-help marketing tool for the nation's farmers?| url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/131161/2/ForkerandWard.pdf| accessdate=December 5, 2013| newspaper=[[Choices Magazine]] |date=Fourth Quarter 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, policy makers have come under increased pressure to balance the interests of traditional farming in the United States and issues around [[organic farming]], the [[environmental impact of agriculture]], [[food vs. fuel]], and international [[food security]] concerns.

=== Nutrition assistance ===

Ensuring adequate food for families and individuals living in poverty is also a centerpiece of any nation's food policy efforts. In the United States, this aid primarily takes the form of monthly benefits that are calculated based on family income, adjusted for certain deductible living expenses and household size, and can only be used for the purchase of foods. The program known for decades as "food stamps" was revamped and renamed [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP) in 2008 to acknowledge the change from paper food stamps to [[electronic benefit transfer]] or EBT cards. SNAP is a [[mandatory spending]] program;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A Closer Look at Mandatory Spending| url=http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/BS_Mandatory_print.pdf| publisher=[[Congressional Budget Office]]| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government must designate funds for the program sufficient to cover benefits for all who meet the eligibility requirements. The farm bill also authorizes funding for SNAP and other nutrition assistance programs, projected to cost $772 billion over the 10-year-period from 2013 to 2022.&lt;ref name="CRS Report 2012" /&gt;

==== Children ====

The nutritional needs of children in poverty are an important component of nutrition assistance in the United States. In fiscal year 2011, 45.1 percent of all recipients of SNAP benefits were children.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Tiehen, Dean Joliffe, Craig Gundersen. "Alleviating Poverty in the United States: The Critical Role of SNAP Benefits", Economic Research Report No. ERR-132, April 2012, USDA Economic Research Service&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children ([[WIC]]) is an effort to ensure the healthcare and nutrition needs of pregnant and [[lactating]] low-income women and their children under the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Oliveira, Elizabeth Racine, Jennifer Olmsted, and Linda M. Ghelfi. [http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/fanrr-food-assistance-nutrition-research-program/fanrr27.aspx#.UqzAqI2E7Fl "The WIC Program: Background, Trends, and Issues"], Food Assistance and Nutrition Research Report No. (FANRR-27), October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Meyers| first1=A.F.| last2=Sampson| first2=A.| last3=Weitzman |first3=M.D.| last4=Rogers| first4=B.| last5=Kayne| first5=H.| title=School breakfast program performance| journal=Am.

The [[National School Lunch Act]] created the National School Lunch Program in 1946 to ensure that low-income children received a fully or partially subsidized meal in the middle of their school day. Revisions to the program were made under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] with the enactment of the [[Child Nutrition Act]], which integrated the school lunch programming with the [[Special Milk Program]] and launched a new national [[School Breakfast Program]]. Numerous studies have confirmed a link between school performance and the school breakfast program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kleinman| first=R.E. |author2=Hall, S. |author3=Green, H. |author4=Korzec-Ramirez, D. |author5=Patton, K. |author6=Pagano, M.E. |author7=Murphy, J.M.| title=Diet, breakfast, and academic performance in children| journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism| year=2002| volume=46| issue=1 | series=Suppl 1| pages=24–30| doi=10.1159/000066399| pmid=12428078 |pmc=3275817}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010]] was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] and serves to reauthorize expenditures on food programming for children. Nutrition standards for school breakfasts and lunches were revised for the first time in 15 years through the passage of the act to align them more closely with the [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion|Dietary Guidelines for Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Nutrition Standards for School Meals| url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/governance/legislation/nutritionstandards.htm| publisher=USDA Food and Nutrition Service| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government has faced increased pressure to improve the nutritional quality of meals served in public schools over the last several decades from a wide range of advocacy groups such as the Healthy Schools Campaign and celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]]'s "School Food Revolution" launched in a [[TED talk]] in February 2010.&lt;ref name="12/5/2013"&gt;{{cite web| title=Jamie Oliver: Teach every child about food| url=http://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_oliver.html| publisher=TED Conferences, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this pressure stemmed from federal efforts in the 1980s to broaden the definition of qualifying food groups in what became known as the "[[ketchup as a vegetable]]" controversy during the [[Reagan administration]].

==== Older Americans ====

Concerns about senior citizens living in poverty in the 1960s led to the establishment of the Elderly Nutrition Program (ENP) in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Ponza, M., Ohls, J.C., Posner, B.M. [http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/nutrition/elderlynutrition_litreview.pdf "Elderly Nutrition Program Evaluation Literature Review"]. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., for US Department of Health and Human Services. March 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Nutrition Services| url=http://www.aoa.gov/AoARoot/AoA_Programs/HCLTC/Nutrition_Services/index.aspx| publisher=Administration on Aging| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This federally funded program provides grants to state and area agencies on aging to help finance the cost of congregate and home-delivered meals for older adults living independently in the community. The program is periodically re-authorized under the [[Older Americans Act]] and is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Administration on Aging. The primary activity funded under Title III is the preparation and serving of nutritious meals for adults over the age of 60 and their spouses. Title III-A provides funding for tribal organizations to provide similar meal services. The meals are distributed through two mechanisms: (1) delivered to the homes of seniors who are not mobile or have self-care challenges, and (2) served at a group meeting place such as a senior center, church, community hall or public school. Homebound seniors receive one meal per day (several fresh and frozen meals may be included in a single delivery), and communities that offer congregate meals are encouraged to offer a meal at least five times per week. Meals must meet Dietary Reference Intakes and USDA Dietary Guidelines for older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Ponza, et al. "Serving Elders at Risk. The Older Americans Act Nutrition Programs: National Evaluation of the Elderly Nutrition Program 1993-1995". July 1996. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aging&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the budget for [[Title III]] programs was $817.8 million&lt;ref&gt;Colello, K. "[http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RS21202.pdf Older Americans Act: Title III Nutrition Services Program]", Congressional Research Service Report for Congress. June 17, 2011. Retrieved 9/27/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 2.6 million people were served. Grants are made by the Administration on Aging to state agencies and local area councils on aging that provide a variety of other services to their communities' seniors. The program relies heavily on volunteers; a savings of about 10% per meal is attributed to volunteer labor.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Aging. Retrieved 9/25/2013. http://www.aoa.gov/aoaroot/program_results/Nutrition_Report/er_vol1ch5a1.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last 20 years, more funds were shifted from congregate meal support to home-delivered foods, often referred to as [[Meals on Wheels]]. While the aim of ENP is to target low-income elderly in cities as well as rural settings, there is no [[means test]] to use these services; drafters of the initial legislation wanted to limit barriers to use of the program by older adults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2011/06/t20110621a.html Statement by Kathy Greenlee], Assistant Secretary Administration on Aging, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), on Senior Hunger and the Older Americans Act before Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, United States Senate, Tuesday June 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Role of obesity in nutrition assistance ====

Nutrition assistance in the U.S. takes place in a unique context given the prevalence of [[Obesity in the United States|obesity]] among adults and children. More than 69 percent of American adults aged 20 and older were considered overweight or obese in 2009-2010, and 12 percent of children aged 2 to 5 were classified as obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Obesity and Overweight| url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/overwt.htm| publisher=[[US Centers for Disease Control]]| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Studies have found some correlations between food insecurity and obesity among women, but findings regarding men and children have been inconsistent. A framework for using this information to inform policies surrounding food benefits has been proposed. The framework suggests that strategies for coping with the social, psychological and economical stresses of poverty are central to the link between poverty and unhealthy weight status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dinour| first=L.M. |author2=Bergen, D. |author3=Yeh, M-C| title=The Food Insecurity-Obesity Paradox: A review of the literature and the role food stamps may play| journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association| date=November 2007| volume=107| issue=11| pages=1952–1961| doi=10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.006| pmid=17964316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Role of farmers' markets ====

A concern about lack of access to fresh produce for many inner city recipients of SNAP benefits has led to an effort to increase the role [[farmers' market]]s can play in providing healthy fruits and vegetables to those receiving nutrition assistance. From 2005 to 2010, the number of farmers' markets authorized and equipped to manage SNAP transactions increased from 444 to 1,611.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Love| first=Drew| title=Farmers Market SNAP Sales Soar in 2010| url=http://farmersmarketcoalition.org/snap-sales-soar-2010/| publisher=Farmers Market Coalition| accessdate=December 5, 2013| date=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Farmers' Market Nutrition Program / Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program|Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program]] provides funding for coupons given to needy older adults for use in local markets and roadside produce vendors approved by each state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP)| url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/sfmnp/senior-farmers-market-nutrition-program-sfmnp| publisher=USDA| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food safety ===

In broad policy terms, [[food safety]] can be described as an attempt to limit contaminants in the food supply. Traditionally, contaminants of greatest concern were [[pathogen]]s. According to 2011 estimates by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), 48 million people are sickened, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases during each year. The top five offenders were [[norovirus]], ''[[salmonella]]'', ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'' spp., and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=CDC Estimates of Foodborne Illness in the United States| url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/2011-foodborne-estimates.html| publisher=US Centers for Disease Control| accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Accounting Office]] has written numerous reports highlighting the dangers inherent in a fragmented approach to U.S. food safety. Federal regulation of food safety is split primarily among agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, but some responsibilities are also delegated to the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[Department of Commerce]], and the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. Within the Department of Health and Human Services, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is responsible for the safety of most food products with the exception of meat, poultry, and processed eggs. Animal drugs and livestock feed are also part of the FDA safety mandate, while outbreaks of foodborne illnesses are monitored and probed by the CDC. Within the USDA, the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] is charged with oversight of the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of meat, poultry and processed eggs. Inspectors are required to be onsite at nearly every [[slaughterhouse]] in the nation when animals are being readied for human consumption. As a result, the FSIS has a larger annual budget and employs a much larger number of inspectors than the FDA, even though the FDA's mandate is much broader. Other USDA agencies with a role in food safety include the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS), which aims to prevent animal and plant diseases in domestic and imported products, and the [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (AMS), a service whose primary function is to set quality, grades and marketing standards for dairy products, fruits, vegetables and meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/320/316742.pdf United States Government Accountability Office Report to Congressional Committees. Federal Food Safety Oversight]. March 2011. GAO-11-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to pathogens, chemical additives to food are of increasing concern to Americans. A critical concept related to chemical additives in food is known as [[generally recognized as safe]] or GRAS, a designation of the Food and Drug Administration for food substances that are exempt from safety testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)| url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/| publisher=US Food and Drug Administration| accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 12,000 samples of fruits and vegetables available to U.S. consumers are collected each year and tested for residue from pesticides, and the results are published in an annual [[Pesticide Data Program]] (PDP) hosted by the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Pesticide Data Program (PDP)| url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateC&amp;navID=&amp;rightNav1=&amp;topNav=&amp;leftNav=ScienceandLaboratories&amp;page=PesticideDataProgram&amp;resultType=&amp;acct=pestcddataprg| publisher=USDA Agricultural Marketing Service| accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of policy instruments that can be used to try to remedy risks to health posed by the farming and processing of foods for consumption. The government can develop process rules that explicitly state which procedures are appropriate for handling particular foods. Performance standards set quality standards against which foods are measured, such as grades for meat or eggs. Food labeling rules, government-funded food safety research, and consumer education are additional tools. The potential for [[product liability]] lawsuits against manufacturers with poor safety practices offers another incentive for producers to take appropriate care when handling and processing foods.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;

===Food labeling===

====FDA-regulated labeling====
Food labeling requirements are spelled out in the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (abbreviated FFDCA, FDCA, or FD&amp;C). Nutrition labeling is required for most prepared foods, and is voluntary for raw produce and fish. The most recognizable label is the [[nutrition facts label]] found on all prepared foods. This lists the suggested serving size followed by the amount per serving of calories, fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, protein, and a list of some micronutrients found in the food. Ingredients are also included on the label, listed from the highest quantity to the lowest quantity.

There are also requirements for [[allergen]] labeling. According to the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-282, Title II), 2% of adults and 5% of infants and children have [[food allergies]], and 90% of these allergies are related to milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans. Labeling must contain a list of these major food allergens which are contained in the product, or which may have come in contact with the food during production.&lt;ref name="Food Allergen Labeling"/&gt;

====USDA-regulated labeling====
[[File:USDA organic seal.svg|thumb|right |alt=USDA organic seal | This seal is found on all food products that meet NOP regulations to be called "100% Organic" or "Organic".]]

According to the [[Organic Foods Production Act]] and the National Organic Program:&lt;ref name="Organic Labeling"/&gt;
*A product can be labeled "100% Organic" if it contains only organic ingredients and processing aids.
*The label "Organic" is used for products containing at least 95% organic products.
*Products made up of at least 70% organic ingredients may be labeled "Made with organic ingredients".

====Unregulated terms====
Some factual labeling terms are not regulated.&lt;ref name="Organic Labeling"/&gt; These terms include:

*No drugs or growth hormones used
*[[Free range]] / [[cage free]]
*Sustainably harvested

Use of these terms on labels may be added in effort to improve marketing for the product.

=== Dietary guidance ===

Consumers report skepticism about the quality of dietary advice generally, often stating confusion due to conflicting nutrition information from different sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ayoob| first=K-T |author2=Duyff, R.L. |author3=Quaglini, D.| title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Food and Nutrition Misinformation| journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association| date=February 2002| volume= 102| issue = 2| pages=260–266| doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(02)90062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] within the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] is charged with reviewing the scientific literature and forging agreement on a series of food choices and behaviors that are compiled and issued every five years as the [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]]. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee is currently meeting and expects to publish new guidelines in the fall of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015| url=http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015.asp| publisher=USDA/HHS| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general public is invited to submit comments to the advisory committee, which are published on the website of the [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015| url=http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2015/comments/default.aspx| publisher=USDA/HHS| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comments submitted come from academic institutions, individual physicians, members of the public, and industries with a stake in the guidelines. For example, among those giving oral testimony to the committee that developed the 2010 guidelines were representatives of the sugar, fisheries, dairy, egg, pork, beef, soy foods, and produce industries. Others offering testimony included the [[Council for Responsible Nutrition]], the [[University of Washington]], the [[American Heart Association]], The Cancer Project]], the [[Institute of Food Technologists]], and the Vegetarian Union of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans| url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DGAs2010-PublicTestimonyOnDGACReport.htm| publisher=USDA/HHS|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While open to public input, the development of the dietary guidelines is an example of a food policy promulgated solely within the executive branch of the federal government.

For more than a decade, dietary guidelines were illustrated with a [[food pyramid (nutrition)|food pyramid]], but the 2010 guidelines were accompanied by a new graphic, [[MyPlate]]. This graphic attempts to show proper nutrition practices in reference to a place setting. Five food groups - fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy - are drawn in ideal proportions for each meal.&lt;ref name="MyPlate"/&gt; Periodic reports from government agencies, surveys, and studies indicate that the U.S. population fails to meet the government's dietary guidelines. Americans eat insufficient quantities of fruits and vegetables and consume too many foods high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krebs Smith| first=S.M. |author2=Guenther, P.M. |author3=Subar, A.F. |author4=Kirkpatrick, S.I. |author5=Dodd, K.W.| title=Americans Do Not Meet Federal Dietary Recommendations| journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] | year=2010| volume=140:1832–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with nutritional assistance, dietary guidelines are formulated in an environment that is increasingly aware of the health risks faced by the nation due to the growing number of overweight and obese individuals. While the field of nutrition and public health works closely with a [[social ecological model]] that places individual behavior determinants and choices in the context of his or her familial, community, and societal contexts, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are directed solely at individual behaviors around food, nutritional intake and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ory| first=M.G. |author2=Jordan, P.J. |author3=Bazzarre, T.| title=The Behavior Change Consortium: Setting the stage for a new century of health behavior-change research| journal=Health Education Research| year=2002| volume=17| issue=5| pages=500–511| doi=10.1093/her/17.5.500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy proponents (non-U.S. government) ==

=== Advocacy and coalitions ===

Every citizen of the United States could be described as a stakeholder in food policy, but farming and food industry interests are generally the dominant players when advocating for and against legislation and regulation at the federal level; public health advocates and consumer interest groups also play a role. Action by the federal government on food policy is often more important to farmers and food manufacturers or distributors because their income is derived from these economic activities, whereas consumers in the U.S. spend only about 10 percent of their income on food. This generally makes farmers or food industry executives easier to organize around policy issues than the public at large.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;

[[Non-profit organization]]s that accept charitable donations and are organized under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Service Code are limited in the funds they can spend on [[lobbying]] activities under the code, while profit-making businesses and trade associations do not face the same restrictions. As a result, some charitable groups with a stake in U.S. food policy decisions create a separate organization for lobbying purposes and devise a funding mechanism that does not include tax-deductible charitable contributions.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt; Funds spent by industry and other interest groups on lobbying and political campaigns are tracked and made publicly available by the not-for-profit [[Center for Responsive Politics]] through its website, [http://www.opensecrets.org Open Secrets].

===Food policy councils===
Many food policy councils (FPCs) also work to educate the public, shape public policy, and even create new programs. Many states, regions, cities and other organizations have formed their own FPCs.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt; Some of these FPCs are commissioned by the government, while others are collaborative efforts by grassroots organizations. The earliest grassroots food policy councils were the City of Hartford Advisory Commission on Food Policy established in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.hartfordfood.org/programs/food-policy-and-advocacy/ | title=FOOD POLICY AND ADVOCACY &amp;#124; Hartford Food System}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Marin Food Policy Council established in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ucanr.edu/sites/MarinFoodPolicyCouncil/Council_History_and_Background_311/ | title=Council History and Background}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some councils are found at universities, such as the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity]] at [[Yale University|Yale]].

State-run FPCs include:

*Alaska Food Policy Council
*Arkansas Food Policy Council
*Connecticut Food Policy Council
*Florida Food Policy Council
*Georgia Food Policy Council
*Hawaii Food Policy Council
*Illinois Food, Farms &amp; Jobs Council
*Tri-State Food Policy Council (Illinois, Iowa, Missouri)
*Iowa Food Systems Council
*Kansas State Food Policy Council
*Massachusetts Food Policy Alliance
*Michigan Food Policy Council
*Mississippi Food Policy Council
*Montana Food System Council
*New Mexico Food and Agriculture Policy Council
*New York State Council on Food Policy
*North Carolina Sustainable Local Food Advisory Council
*Ohio Food Policy Advisory Council
*South Carolina Food Policy Council
*Virginia Food System Council

=== Food industry initiatives ===

Not all policies involving food in the public marketplace originate within government. The food industry has also set standards for itself from time to time. Often, these voluntary efforts stem from industry concerns that they may face heavier or piecemeal regulations from federal or state regulators.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;

==== Facts Up Front ====

Facts Up Front is an initiative by the [[Grocery Manufacturers Association]] (GMA) that is designed to simplify nutrition information on products with a front-of-package (FOP) label that highlights the calories, saturated fat, sodium, and sugars in a single serving of an item.&lt;ref name="GMA"&gt;{{cite web| title=Facts Up Front Front-of-Pack Labeling Initiative| url=http://www.gmaonline.org/issues-policy/health-nutrition/facts-up-front-front-of-pack-labeling-initiative/| publisher=Grocery Manufacturers Association| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially called "Nutrition Keys", the industry took this action at a time when federal agencies expressed concerns about the potential for consumer confusion stemming from competing attempts to simplify nutrition information on packaged goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Layton| first=Lyndsey| title=FDA seeks better nutrition labeling| url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-10-21/news/36923054_1_nutrition-facts-label-smart-choices-program-nutritional-criteria| accessdate=December 12, 2013| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| date=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress and the Centers for Disease Control charged the Institute of Medicine with conducting a study with an eye toward recommendations to standardize these labels, and a report was issued in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, [http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Front-of-Package-Nutrition-Rating-Systems-and-Symbols-Promoting-Healthier-Choices.aspx "Front-of-Package Nutrition Rating Systems and Symbols: Promoting Healthier Choices"]. Oct. 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The GMA initiative was launched in January 2011, and compliance is voluntary.&lt;ref name="GMA" /&gt;

==== Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative ====

Launched in 2007, this voluntary effort called for food manufacturers to set nutritional criteria for food products they advertise during children's programming. Organized through the [[Better Business Bureau]], the initiative was widely criticized by advocates for federal regulation of advertising to children.&lt;ref&gt;Kunkel, D., McKinley, C., Wright, P. [http://www.childrennow.org/uploads/documents/adstudy_2009.pdf "The Impact of Industry Self-Regulation on the Nutritional Quality of Foods Advertised on Television to Children"]. ''[[Children Now]]''. December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A scorecard developed by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University to track changes in the advertising of cereal to children was issued in 2012 and covered changes during the period of 2008 to 2011. Among the findings: total media spending to advertise child-targeting cereals had increased 34 percent, cereal company spending on Spanish-language TV more than doubled in that time period, two cereal companies launched new [[advertising in video games]] or advergame websites, and the majority of cereals children see advertised on television consist of one-third or more sugar. Overall nutrition had improved for 13 of 16-targeted brands, and preschoolers' exposure the cereal advertising declined by 6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Harris| first1=J.L.| last2=Schwartz| first2=M.B.| last3=Brownell| first3=K.D.| title=Cereal f.a.c.t.s. 2012| url=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2012/rwjf73207| publisher=[[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food politics ==
{{main article|Food politics}}

As with other actors in the public policy arena, food policy makers must account for a variety of political, social, environmental and economic agendas that affect a nation's food supply. Food politics, both domestically and internationally, play an important role in agenda setting, rule making, and implementation. Politics come into play on a variety of different fronts as the needs of the populace to have reliable, safe, affordable access to food are balanced against the desire to ensure farmers can earn a viable living.

== Conflicts ==

Food policy has both political and economic factors that contribute to the challenges it faces. Food policy is not completely based on politics, but politics have an impact. Countries that have more political involvement typically have more of an influence on solving issues dealing with hunger and poverty. Countries that have less political involvement may not have as much to do with food policy.

The solution to hunger and poverty can be found by increasing the amount of food intake per individual. The amount to increase by depends on how much food is needed to carry out day-to-day tasks. Some challenges that this solution faces are: having enough money to afford the cost of food, having the food supply, and having a sufficient supply of nutritional foods. Also, having the education on what foods to buy and which are nutritional can be an issue. These are all factors that can cause a food policy to fail.

Food policy involves both consumers and producers. If prices are too high for consumers to afford nutritional food products, then it reduces the amount they can purchase. High food prices can cause lower-income households to have a poorer quality diet. Producers rely on food prices for income and therefore cannot make the prices so low that they are not able to survive. There is a fine line between supply and demand, which creates a challenge for food policy.&lt;ref name="Food Policy Analysis"/&gt;

'''Glycogen storage disease type IX''' is a [[hereditary]] deficiency of glycogen [[phosphorylase kinase]] B that affects the [[liver]] and [[skeletal muscle]] tissue. It is inherited in an X-linked or [[autosomal recessive]] manner.&lt;ref name="gen"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK55061/ |title=Phosphorylase Kinase Deficiency |last=Goldstein |first=Jennifer |last2=Austin |first2=Stephanie |last3=Kishnani |first3=Priya |last4=Bali |first4=Deeksha |date=1993 |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |location=Seattle (WA) |pmid=21634085 |editor-last1=Pagon |editor-first1=Roberta A |editor-last2=Adam |editor-first2=Margaret P |editor-last3=Ardinger |editor-first3=Holly H |editor-last4=Wallace |editor-first4=Stephanie E |editor-last5=Amemiya |editor-first5=Ann |editor-last6=Bean |editor-first6=Lora JH |editor-last7=Bird |editor-first7=Thomas D |editor-last8=Fong |editor-first8=Chin-To |editor-last9=Mefford |editor-first9=Heather C }} update 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms in glycogen storage disease type IX include:&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt;
* [[Hepatomegaly|Enlarged liver]]
* Slowed growth 
* Motor development delay (mild)
* [[Ketotic hypoglycemia|Low blood sugar accompanied by ketosis]]
* [[Hypotonia|Lack of muscle tone]]
Most of these signs and symptoms diminish as adulthood sets in.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt;

== Genetics ==
Glycogen storage disease type IX can be inherited via:&lt;ref name="genh"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glycogen-storage-disease-type-ix#inheritance |title=Glycogen storage disease type IX |website=Genetics Home Reference |access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Expert=370 |title=Glycogen storage disease due to phosphorylase kinase deficiency|website=Orphanet |access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
There are two types of this inherited condition, ''glycogen storage disease IXa1'' and ''glycogen storage disease IXa2'' that affect the liver of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.omim.org/entry/306000|title=Glycogen storage disease IX |website=OMIM |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations in [[PHKA2]] have been seen in individuals with glycogen storage disease IXa2.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Management ==
[[File:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif |thumb|upright=0.7 |Glucose]]
The management of Glycogen storage disease IX requires treatment of symptoms by frequent intake of complex carbohydrates and protein to combat the low blood sugar. A nutritionist will advise on suitable diets. Liver function is regularly monitored and problems managed as they arise. However, liver problems have only been successfully treated by a [[Liver transplant|transplant]]. Routine checks of metabolism are needed to ensure blood sugar (glucose) and ketones are managed. Regular moderate exercise is beneficial, although over-vigorous exercise is to be avoided, especially in those with enlarged livers.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fernandes |first1=John |last2=Saudubray |first2=Jean-Marie |last3=van den Berghe |first3=Georges |title=Inborn Metabolic Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9783662031476 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=97zoCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 |accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gold Diggers of Broadway lobby card.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lobby card for ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929), an example of a film which helped create the American public association of chorus girls with gold diggers.]]
'''Gold digging''' is a type of [[Transactional sex|transactional]] relationship&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger pp. 60&lt;/ref&gt; in which people, especially women, engage in relationships for money rather than love. When it turns into marriage, it is a type of [[marriage of convenience]]. 

[[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]] was in the 1920s considered the perfect example of a gold digger,&lt;ref&gt;Sharot p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; with some claims existing that the term was even coined to describe her.&lt;ref&gt;"Some people even claimed the term has been coined by a Hearst newspaperman to describe Peggy and her behavior." Robenblum pp. unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular association between [[Chorus line|chorus girls]] and gold diggers was established in 1919 by "The Gold Diggers" play, association which was also present in the subsequent film four years later, ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920s and 1930s American cinema the "gold digger" was the type of ''[[femme fatale]]'' that gradually replaced the [[Femme fatale#20th-century film and theatre|"vamp"]].&lt;ref&gt;"The gold digger came to replace the vamp as the most prominent type of femme fatale." Sharot pp. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; The character type would be featured, for example, in ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', a 1953 film starring [[Marilyn Monroe]], alongside Schatze Page and Loco Dempsey. 

In the analysis of rap music it has been theorized that the "gold digger script" is one of a few prevalent [[sexual script theory|sexual scripts]] present for young African American women.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Kanye West]]'s "[[Gold Digger (Kanye West song)|Gold Digger]]" references gold digging.

In [[South Africa]], [[private healthcare|private]] and [[public health]] systems exist in parallel. The public system serves the vast majority of the population, but is chronically underfunded and understaffed. The wealthiest 20% of the population use the private system and are far better served. In 2005, South Africa spent 8.7% of [[GDP]] on [[health care]], or US$437 per capita. Of that, approximately 42% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/data/Search.jsp |title=WHO Statistical Information System |accessdate=23 September 2008 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 79% of doctors work in the private sector.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ataguba, John Ele-Ojo.

== History ==
[[Image:KwaMai Mai Market.jpg|thumb|Kwa Mai Mai in [[Johannesburg]], a market dedicated to traditional medicine.]]
The first hospital in South Africa, a temporary tent to care for sick sailors of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (the Company) afflicted by diseases such as typhoid and scurvy, was started at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Juta's Manual of Nursing, Volume 1|last=Mogotlane|first=Mataniele Sophie|publisher=Juta and Company Ltd|year=2003|isbn=9780702156656|editor-last=Young|editor-first=Anne|location=South Africa|pages=6-9|editor-last2=Van Niekerk|editor-first2=C. F.|editor-last3=Mogotlane|editor-first3=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent hospital was completed in 1656. Initially, convalescent soldiers provided to others whatever care they could, but around 1700 the first ''Binnenmoeder'' (Dutch for matron) and ''Siekenvader'' (male nurse/supervisor) were appointed in order to ensure cleanliness in the hospital, and to supervise bedside attendants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Company subsequently employed Sworn Midwives from Holland, who practiced midwifery and also trained and examined local women who wished to become midwives. Some of the early trainees at the Cape were freed Malay and coloured slaves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1807, other hospitals were built in order to meet the increasing demand for healthcare. The first hospitals in the Eastern Cape were founded in Port Elizabeth, King Williamstown, Grahamstown and Queenstown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Missionary hospitals ===
Roman Catholic Nuns of the Assumption Order were the first members of a religious order to arrive in South Africa. In 1874, two Nightingale nurses, Anglican Sisterhoods, the Community of St Michael and All Angels arrived from England.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley led to an explosion of immigrants, which, coupled with the "generally squalid conditions" around mines, encouraged the spread of diseases dysentery, typhoid, and malaria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following negotiations with the Anglican Order of St Michael, Sister Henrietta Stockdale and other members were assigned to the Carnarvon hospital in 1877. Sister Stockdale had studied nursing and taught the nurses at Carnavorn what she knew; these nurses would move to other hospitals in Barbeton, Pretoria, Queenstown, and Cape Town, where they in turn trained others in nursing. This laid the foundation of professional nursing in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sister Stockdale was also responsible for the nursing clauses in the Cape of Good Hope Medical and Pharmacy Act of 1891, the world's first regulations  requiring state registration of nurses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most mission hospitals have become public hospitals in contemporary South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 20th-century nursing ===
The Anglo-Boer war and World War 1 severely strained healthcare provision in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Formal training for black nurses began at Lovedale in 1902. In the first half of the 20th century, nursing was not considered appropriate for Indian women but some males did become registered nurses or orderlies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1912, the South African military recognised the importance of military nursing in the Defence Act. In 1913, the first nursing journal, The South African Nursing Record, was published. In 1914, The South African Trained Nurses' Association, the first organisation for nurses, formed. In 1944, the first Nursing Act was promulgated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1935, the first diploma courses to enable nurses to train as tutors were introduced at the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Cape Town.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The establishment of independent states and homelands in South Africa also created independent Nursing Councils, and Nursing Associations for the Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei. Under the post-Apartheid dispensation, these were all merged to form one organisation, the [[Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa]] (DENOSA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Health infrastructure ==

===Staffing===
In 2013, it was estimated that vacancy rates for doctors were 56% and for nurses 46%.  Half the population lives in rural areas, but only 3% of newly qualified doctors take jobs there.  All medical training takes place in the public sector but 70% of doctors go into the private sector. 10% of medical staff are qualified in other countries.  Medical student numbers increased by 34% between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitals===
{{See|List of hospitals in South Africa}}
There are more than 400 public hospitals and more than 200 private hospitals. The provincial health departments manage the larger regional hospitals directly. Smaller hospitals and primary care clinics are managed at district level. The national [[Department of Health (South Africa)|Department of Health]] manages the 10 major teaching hospitals directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital]] is the third largest hospital in the world and it is located in [[Johannesburg]].

=== Uniform Patient Fee Schedule ===
[[File:Public and non-public sector nurses and physicians in SA.jpg|thumb|250px|Nurses and medical practitioners per 1000 people in the public and nonpublic sector.]]
The public sector uses a Uniform Patient Fee Schedule (UPFS) as a guide to billing for services. This is being used in all the provinces of South Africa, although in Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and Eastern Cape, it is being implemented on a phased schedule. Implemented in November 2000, the UPFS categorises the different fees for every type of patient and situation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;User Guide-UPFS 2009. Department of Health of Republic of South Africa. June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

It groups patients into three categories defined in general terms, and includes a classification system for placing all patients into either one of these categories depending on the situation and any other relevant variables. The three categories include full paying patients—patients who are either being treated by a private practitioner, who are externally funded, or who are some types of non-South African citizens—, fully subsidised patients—patients who are referred to a hospital by Primary Healthcare Services—, and partially subsidised patients—patients whose costs are partially covered based on their income. There are also specified occasions in which services are free of cost.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===HIV/AIDS antiretroviral treatment===

Because of its abundant cases of HIV/AIDS among citizens (about 5.6&amp;nbsp;million in 2009) South Africa has been working to create a program to distribute anti-retroviral therapy treatment, which has generally been limited in poorer countries, including neighboring country [[HIV/AIDS in Lesotho|Lesotho.]] An anti-retroviral drug aims to control the amount of virus in the patient’s body. In November 2003 the Operational Plan for Comprehensive HIV and AIDS Care, Management and Treatment for South Africa was approved, which was soon accompanied by a National Strategic Plan for 2007–2011. When South Africa freed itself of apartheid, the new health care policy has emphasised public health care, which is founded with primary health care. The National Strategic Plan therefore promotes distribution of anti-retroviral therapy through the public sector, and more specifically, primary health care.&lt;ref&gt;Ruud KW, Srinivas SC, Toverud EL. Antiretroviral therapy in a South African public health care setting – facilitating and 
constraining factors. Southern Med Review (2009) 2; 2:29–34&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the World Health Organization, about 37% of infected individuals were receiving treatment at the end of 2009. It wasn’t until 2009 that the South African National AIDS Council urged the government to raise the treatment threshold to be within the World Health Organization guidelines. Although this is the case, the latest anti-retroviral treatment guideline, released in February 2010, continue to fall short of these recommendations. In the beginning of 2010, the government promised to treat all HIV-positive children with anti-retroviral therapy, though throughout the year, there have been studies that show the lack of treatment for children among many hospitals. In 2009, a bit over 50% of children in need of anti-retroviral therapy were receiving it. Because the World Health Organization’s 2010 guidelines suggest that HIV-positive patients need to start receiving treatment earlier than they have been, only 37% of those considered in need of anti-retroviral therapy are receiving it.

A controversy within the distribution of anti-retroviral treatment is the use of generic drugs. When an effective anti-retroviral drug became in available in 1996, only economically rich countries could afford it at a price of $10,000 to $15,000 per person per year. For economically disadvantaged countries, such as South Africa, to begin using and distributing the drug, the price had to be lowered substantially. In 2000, generic anti-retroviral treatments started being produced and sold at a much cheaper cost. Needing to compete with these prices, the big-brand pharmaceutical companies were forced to lower their prices. This competition has greatly benefited low economic countries and the prices have continued decline since the generic drug was introduced. The anti-retroviral treatment can now be purchased at as low as eighty-eight dollars per person per year. While the production of generic drugs has allowed the treatment of many more people in need, pharmaceutical companies feel that the combination of a decrease in price and a decrease in customers reduces the money they can spend on researching and developing new medications and treatments for HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm "HIV &amp; AIDS in South Africa." AIDS &amp; HIV Information from the AIDS Charity AVERT. AVERT: International HIV and AIDS Charity.] Web. 10 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare provision in the post-war period===

Following the end of the Second World War, South Africa saw a rapid growth in the coverage of private medical provision, with this development mainly benefiting the predominantly middle class white population. From 1945 to 1960, the percentage of whites covered by health insurance grew from 48% to 80% of the population. Virtually the entire white population had shifted away from the free health services provided by the government by 1960, with 95% of non-whites remaining reliant upon the public sector for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/reports/2002/inquiry/sahs.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - DoHConsDocFinal.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195909/http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/reports/2002/inquiry/sahs.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of health insurance schemes became effectively compulsory for white South Africans due to membership of such schemes being a condition of employment, together with the fact that virtually all whites were formally employed. Pensioner members of many health insurance schemes received the same medical benefits as other members of these schemes, but free of costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/reports/2002/inquiry/sahs.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - DoHConsDocFinal.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195909/http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/reports/2002/inquiry/sahs.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since coming to power in 1994, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) has implemented a number of measures to combat health inequalities in South Africa. These have included the introduction of free health care in 1994 for all children under the age of six together with pregnant and breastfeeding women making use of public sector health facilities (extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996) and the extension of free hospital care (in 2003) to children older than six with moderate and severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.org.za/depts/ci/pubs/pdf/general/gauge2006/gauge2006_healing.pdf |title=South African Child Gauge 2006 - FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National health insurance===
The current government is working to establish a national health insurance (NHI) system out of concerns for discrepancies within the national health care system, such as unequal access to healthcare amongst different socio-economic groups. Although the details and outline of the proposal have yet to be released, it seeks to find ways to make health care more available to those who currently can’t afford it or whose situation prevents them from attaining the services they need. There is a discrepancy between money spent in the private sector which serves the wealthy (about US$1500 per head per year) and that spent in the public sector (about US$150 per head per year) which serves about 84% of the population.  About 16% of the population have private health insurance.  The total public funding for healthcare in 2012/3 was R21 billion. The NHI scheme is expected to require expenditure of about R336 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHI is speculated to propose that there be a single National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) for health insurance. This fund is expected to draw its revenue from general taxes and some sort of health insurance contribution. The proposed fund is supposed to work as a way to purchase and provide health care to all South African residents without detracting from other social services. Those receiving health care from both the public and private sectors will be mandated to contribute through taxes to the NHIF. The ANC hopes that the NHI plan will work to pay for [[health care costs]] for those who cannot pay for it themselves.

There are those who doubt the NHI and oppose its fundamental techniques. For example, many believe that the NHI will put a burden on the upper class to pay for all lower class health care. Currently, the vast majority of health care funds comes from individual contributions coming from upper class patients paying directly for health care in the private sector. The NHI proposes that health care fund revenues be shifted from these individual contributions to a general tax revenue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Because the NHI aims to provide free health care to all South Africans, the new system is expected to bring an end to the financial burden facing public sector patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za.news.yahoo.com/rising-fees-public-hospitals-hit-patients-hard-060851046--finance.html|title=Yahoo|work=Yahoo|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refugees and asylum seekers ==
The [[South African constitution|South African Constitution]] guarantees everyone "access to health care services" and states that "no one may be refused emergency medical treatment." Hence, all South African residents, including [[Refugee|refugees]] and [[Asylum seeker|asylum seekers]], are entitled to access to health care services.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of South Africa of 1996. Article 27(1). http://www.elections.org.za/content/Documents/Laws-and-regulations/Constitution/Constitution-of-the-Republic-of-South-Africa,-1996/&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Department of Health (South Africa)|Department of Health]] directive stated that all refugees and asylum seekers – without the need for a permit or a [[Identity document#South Africa|South African identity document]] – should have access to free [[Anti-retroviral treatments|anti-retroviral treatment]] at all public health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Directive: Refugees/Asylum Seekers with or without permit''. Department of Health.'' Ref: BI 4/29 REFUG/ASYL 8 2007 http://www.probono.org.za/Downloads/asylum_seekers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Refugee Act entitles migrants to full legal protection under the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] as well as the same basic health care services which inhabitants of South Africa receive.&lt;ref&gt;Refugees Act No. 130 of 1998 https://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/a130-98_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although infectious diseases "as prescribed from time to time" does bar entry, grant of temporary and permanent residence permits according to the Immigration Act, this does not include an infection with HIV and therefore migrants cannot be declined entry or medical treatment based on their HIV status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.migration.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Migrants-Right-to-Health-in-Southern-Africa.pdf|title=MIGRANTS’ RIGHT TO HEALTH In Southern Africa|last=Wachira|first=George Mukundi|publisher=International Organization for Migration|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Immigration Act 13 of 2002 s. 29(1)''(a) https://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/a13-02_0.pdf''&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent.co.uk (2011-08-04). Retrieved on 2011-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, International Beer Day has three declared purposes:

# To gather with friends and enjoy the taste of [[beer]].
# To celebrate those responsible for brewing and serving beer.
# To unite the world under the banner of beer, by celebrating the beers of all nations together on a single day.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt;

==Celebration==
Participants are encouraged to give one another the 'gift of beer' by buying each other drinks, and to express gratitude to brewers, [[bartender]]s, and other beer technicians. In the international spirit of the holiday, it is also suggested that participants step out of their domestic/locally brewed comfort zone and sample a beer from another culture.&lt;ref name="nashuatelegraph1"/&gt;

==Popularity==
International Beer Day began as a celebration at the founders’ local bar, but has since expanded to become a worldwide event. Celebrations are planned throughout the United States as well as in Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, England, France, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Scotland, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vanuatu, and Venezuela.

Popular forms of International Beer Day Events include: Tapping of new or rare beers, all-day [[happy hour]]s, beer flights, trivia nights, [[binge drinking]] and other games (such as [[beer pong]]), beer/food pairings and beer gear giveaways.&lt;ref name="nashuatelegraph1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt;

==Date change==
From 2007 through 2012, International Beer Day was celebrated on August 5. After International Beer Day 2012, the founders took a poll of fans and chose to move the holiday to the first Friday in August.&lt;ref name="ibdfirstfriday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/internationalbeerday/posts/10151554502158803|title=Reminder: Due to popular demand,... - International Beer Day - Facebook|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistics]], '''intra-rater reliability''' is the degree of agreement among repeated administrations of a diagnostic test performed by a single rater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/strokengine-assess/definitions-en.html Stroke Engine glossary (McGill Faculty of Medicine)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outcomesdatabase.org/show/category/id/8 Outcomes database glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; Intra-rater reliability and [[inter-rater reliability]] are aspects of [[test validity]].

'''Kim Chang-ho''' ({{lang-ko|김창호}}) was a South Korean mountain climber. Kim began climbing after reading about [[Alexander the Great]]'s exploits.&lt;ref name="BMC"/&gt; 

In 2012, he won the Piolets d'or Asia award with An Chi-young when they made the first ever ascent of Himjung (7,092m) in Nepal; the [[British Mountaineering Council]] noted that, "Kim also made the first ascent of 7,762m Batura II. Together with Batura I West (7,775m), which remains virgin, Batura II was one of the highest unclimbed named summits in the [[Karakoram]] (and indeed Asia)".&lt;ref name="BMC"/&gt;

In 2013, he became the first Korean to climb all of the world's [[Eight-thousander| 14 mountains over 8,000 metres]] without using supplementary oxygen;&lt;ref name="The Korea Times 21 May 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last= Kwon |first= Ji-youn | authorlink= |title= Kim scales 14 Himalaya peaks without oxygen tanks|url= http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=136095| date= 21 May 2013|newspaper= [[The Korea Times]] |location= | accessdate= 13 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in doing so he also set the record for completing the feat in the shortest time.&lt;ref name="BBC News 13 October 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title= Nepal storm kills climbers on Himalayan peak Gurja |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45848535| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 13 October 2018 | website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 13 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His new world record of seven years, 10 months and six days was over a month quicker than the previous one, held by [[Jerzy Kukuczka]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="BMC"&gt;{{cite web | title= Korean Everest Sea to Summit marred by tragedy| url= https://www.thebmc.co.uk/korean-everest-sea-to-summit-marred-by-tragedy | last= Griffin| first= Lindsay| date= 27 May 2013 | publisher= [[British Mountaineering Council]] | accessdate= 13 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, Kim used an "eco-friendly" approach, taking 60 days to reach the [[Everest Base Camp|Mount Everest base camp]] using "kayak, bicycle and foot" rather than flying to [[Lukla]].&lt;ref name="The Korea Times 21 May 2013"/&gt;

He was killed, along with several others including fellow South Korean climbers and local mountain guides, in [[Nepal]] in October, 2018, when a snowstorm destroyed the 3500m-altitude base camp beneath Mount Gurja in the [[Dhaulagiri]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |author1= Bhadra Sharma |author2= Kai Schultz | author3= Choe Sang-Hun | title= Snowstorm Kills at Least 8 Climbers in Nepal|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/world/asia/nepal-climbers-himalaya-mountains.html | date= 13 October 2018| newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |location=New York City| accessdate= 13 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lago di Ortiglieto''' is a reservoir in northwest Italy which straddles the [[Metropolitan City of Genoa]] in Liguria, and [the [Province of Alessandria]] in Piedmont.

== History ==
Lago di Ortiglieto reservoir was firstly designed in 1906 by [[engineer|ing.]] Zunini and was built from 1917 to 1925 by a company of [[Genoa]] named ''Officine Elettriche Genovesi''. There were two dams, the higher of 45 metres (''bric Zerbino'' dam) and another one of 15 metres (''Diga della Sella Zerbino''). After a period of heavy rains of August 1935 the sella Zerbino dam crashed, generating a flood of the [[Orba (river)|Orba]] which caused 111 dathts, mainly in the [[Ovada]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/2015/08/13/edizioni/alessandria/oggi-il-ricordo-delle-vittime-del-crollo-della-diga-di-molare-aggiornamenti-ITwPVk0ZM6Fsgl2Rp7ozbI/pagina.html] Daniela Prato. ''In settanta alla camminata in ricordo delle 111 vittime del crollo della diga di Molare'', article from "[[La Stampa]] – Alessandria" of 13 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays Ortiglieto lake is much smaller tha in the past and there is only one dam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3397">'''The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test''' ('''MAST''') [[Screening (medicine)|screening tool]] was developed in 1971, and is one of the oldest [[alcoholism]]-screening tests for identifying [[alcoholic|dependent drinker]]s.&lt;ref name=Buddy&gt;{{cite web|last=Buddy|first=T|title=Michigan Alcohol Screening Test|url=http://alcoholism.about.com/od/tests/a/mast.htm|publisher=About.Com|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use is constructed for the [[Epidemiology|general population]]. There are other versions of the MAST screening tool, all of which can be [[Self-administration|self-administered]] or via interview with someone who is trained in the tool being used. All MAST screening tools are scored on a point scale system.&lt;ref name=Cork&gt;{{cite web|last=Project Cork|title=Clinical Tools|url=http://www.projectcork.org/clinical_tools/|publisher=Project Cork|accessdate=20 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415173712/http://www.projectcork.org/clinical_tools/|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated on the Project Cork [[website]],&lt;ref name=Cork /&gt; there are 25 questions to the "MAST" screening tool. The length of the screening tool makes administering it inconvenient in many busy [[primary health care]] settings, along with [[emergency department]] settings. The tool also mainly focuses on the patient’s [[alcohol abuse|problems]] throughout their lifetime, rather than the problems the patient is currently showing signs of.&lt;ref name=Buddy /&gt; The questions throughout the screening tool operate in the past tense, which means that it is less likely to detect any problems with [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] in its early stages, according to Buddy, T.&lt;ref name=Buddy /&gt; The extended questioning is a benefit in a sense that one accomplishes a bit of the assessment section when conducting the screening; furthermore, it allows the individual conducting the screening to achieve better communication and rapport with the client.

The MAST-G screening tool is directed towards screening [[Geriatrics|geriatric]] clients. With the MAST-G tool, there is a set of 24 questions, rather than the previous 25 questions as in the "MAST" tool. There has always been an underlying question as to the sensitivity and [[reliability (research methods)|reliability]] when questioning geriatric clients.&lt;ref name=Luttrell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luttrell|first=S |author2=Watkin, V. |author3=Livingston, G. |author4=Walker, Z. |author5=D’ath, P. |author6=Patel, P. |author7=Katona, C|title=Screening for Alcohol Misuse in Older People|journal=International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|year=1997|volume=12|issue=12|pages=1151–1154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related screening tool is the "brief MAST", which is much shorter than the previous tests at 10 questions. There is also the Short-MAST tool similar to the brief test; it contains 13 questions.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shields|first=A.L.|author2=Howell, R.

The '''Nightingale Pledge''', named in honour of [[Florence Nightingale]], is a modified version of the [[Hippocratic Oath]]. [[Lystra Gretter]] and a Committee for the Farrand Training School for Nurses in [[Detroit, Michigan]], created the pledge in 1893. Gretter, inspired by the work of Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, credited the pledge to the work of her committee, but was herself considered "the moving spirit behind the idea" for the pledge.&lt;ref name="Crathern_1953"&gt;

The Nightingale Pledge is a statement of the ethics and principles of the nursing profession in the United States, and it is not used outside of the US. It included a vow to "abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous" and to "zealously seek to nurse those who are ill wherever they may be and whenever they are in need." In a 1935 revision to the pledge, Gretter widened the role of the nurse by including an oath to become a "missioner of health" dedicated to the advancement of "human welfare"—an expansion of nurses' bedside focus to an approach that encompassed public health.&lt;ref name="Crathern_1953"/&gt;

US nurses have recited the pledge at [[pinning ceremony|pinning ceremonies]] for decades. In recent years, many US nursing schools have made changes to the original or 1935 versions, often removing the "loyalty to physicians" phrasing to promote a more independent nursing profession, with its own particular ethical standards.&lt;ref name="Yates"&gt;

'''The Occupational Safety and Health Consultants Register''' (OSHCR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oshcr.org/ OSHCR]. The Occupational Safety and Health Consultants Register.&lt;/ref&gt; is a public register of UK-based health and safety advice consultants, set up to assist UK employers and business owners with general advice on workplace health and safety issues.  The register was established in response to the Government’s October 2010 report on 'Common Sense, Common Safety', which recommended that all health and safety consultants should be accredited to professional bodies and a web-based directory established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oshcr.org/Page/AboutOSHCR About OSHCR]. About OSHCR&lt;/ref&gt;

== The register ==
The scheme is voluntary for individuals who provide commercial advice on general health and safety management issues. Consultants who are registered on OSHCR, have been assessed by their professional body and have achieved a set standard based on their qualifications and experience. Each consultant must maintain their continuing professional development, abide by a code of conduct and be committed to giving sensible and proportionate advice to businesses.

On launching the register [[Department for Work and Pensions|Work and Pensions Minister]] [[Chris Grayling]] said "We have launched an official Occupational Safety and Health Consultants Register for those health and safety practitioners who are properly accredited to one of the professional bodies in the industry.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ergonomics.org.uk/oshcr New online directory of health and safety advisors]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services to business owners ==
Many businesses develop in-house competence to manage their health and safety risks and do not need to use health and safety consultants. Other employers however, may need additional help and the consultants registered on OSHCR will have a status recognised by the participating bodies in the OSHCR scheme.

The register enables businesses to search for a consultant by geographical area, industry or topic, to enable them to find someone who will provide specific, tailored advice, relevant to their business needs.

== Participating bodies ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8108">'''Polynomial conjoint measurement''' is an extension of the [[theory of conjoint measurement]] to three or more attributes. It was initially developed by the mathematical psychologists David Krantz (1968) and [[Amos Tversky]] (1967). The theory was given a comprehensive mathematical exposition in the first volume of ''Foundations of Measurement'' (Krantz, Luce, Suppes &amp; Tversky, 1971), which Krantz and Tversky wrote in collaboration with the mathematical psychologist [[R. Duncan Luce]] and philosopher [[Patrick Suppes]]. Krantz &amp; Tversky (1971) also published a non-technical paper on polynomial conjoint measurement for behavioural scientists in the journal ''Psychological Review''.

As with the theory of conjoint measurement, the significance of polynomial conjoint measurement lies in the quantification of natural attributes in the absence of concatenation operations. Polynomial conjoint measurement differs from the two attribute case discovered by Luce &amp; Tukey (1964) in that more complex composition rules are involved.

==Polynomial conjoint measurement==

===Krantz's (1968) schema===

Most scientific theories involve more than just two attributes; and thus the two variable case of conjoint measurement has rather limited scope. Moreover, contrary to the theory of ''n'' – component conjoint measurement, many attributes are non-additive compositions of other attributes (Krantz, et al., 1971). Krantz (1968) proposed a general schema to ascertain the sufficient set of cancellation axioms for a class of polynomial combination rules he called ''simple polynomials''. The formal definition of this schema given by Krantz, et al., (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;328) is as follows.

Let &lt;math&gt;Y =\big\{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n \big\}&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;S\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest set of simple polynomials such that:
* &lt;math&gt;y_i \in S\left(Y\right), i = 1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;Y_1, Y_2 \subset Y &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Y_1 \cap Y_2 = \varnothing, G_1 \in S\left(Y_1\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2 \in S\left(Y_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G_1 + G_2\, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_1 G_2\, &lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;S\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Informally, the schema argues:
a)	single attributes are simple polynomials;
b)	if ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are simple polynomials that are disjoint (i.e. have no attributes in common), then ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are simple polynomials; and 
c)	no polynomials are simple except as given by a) and b).

Let ''A'', ''P'' and ''U'' be single disjoint attributes. From Krantz’s (1968) schema it follows that four classes of simple polynomials in three variables exist which contain a total of eight simple polynomials:
* ''Additive'': &lt;math&gt;A + P + U\, &lt;/math&gt;;
* ''Distributive'': &lt;math&gt;\left(A + P\right)U\, &lt;/math&gt;; plus 2 others obtained by interchanging ''A'', ''P'' and ''U'';
* ''Dual distributive'': &lt;math&gt;A P + U\, &lt;/math&gt; plus 2 others as per above;
* ''Multiplicative'': &lt;math&gt;A P U\, &lt;/math&gt;.

Krantz’s (1968) schema can be used to construct simple polynomials of greater numbers of attributes. For example, if D is a single variable disjoint to A, B, and C then three classes of simple polynomials in four variables are A + B + C + D, D + (B + AC) and D + ABC. This procedure can be employed for any finite number of variables. A simple test is that a simple polynomial can be ‘split’ into either a product or sum of two smaller, disjoint simple polynomials. These polynomials can be further ‘split’ until single variables are obtained. An expression not amenable to ‘splitting’ in this manner is not a simple polynomial (e.g. AB + BC + AC (Krantz &amp; Tversky, 1971)).

===Axioms===

Let &lt;math&gt;A = \big\{a, b, c, \ldots \big\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P = \big\{p, q, r, \ldots \big\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U = \big\{u, v, w, \ldots \big\}&lt;/math&gt; be non-empty and disjoint sets. Let " &lt;math&gt;\succsim&lt;/math&gt; " be a simple order. Krantz et al. (1971) argued the quadruple &lt;math&gt;Z = \langle A, P, U, \succsim \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a ''polynomial conjoint system'' if and only if the following axioms hold.

* ''WEAK ORDER''.
* ''SINGLE CANCELLATION''. The relation " &lt;math&gt;\succsim&lt;/math&gt; " satisfies single cancellation upon ''A'' whenever &lt;math&gt;\left(a, p, u\right)\succsim \left(b, p, u\right)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\left(a, q, v\right)\succsim \left(b, q, v\right)&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;a, b \in A; p, q \in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u, v \in U&lt;/math&gt;. Single cancellation upon ''P'' and ''U'' is similarly defined.
* ''DOUBLE CANCELLATION''. The relation " &lt;math&gt;\succsim&lt;/math&gt; " upon &lt;math&gt;A \times P &lt;/math&gt; satisfies double cancellation if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;a, b, c \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p, q, r \in P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left(a, q, u\right)\succsim \left(b, p, u\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(b, r, u\right)\succsim \left(c, q, u\right)&lt;/math&gt; therefore &lt;math&gt;\left(a, r, u\right)\succsim \left(c, p, u\right)&lt;/math&gt; is true for all &lt;math&gt;u \in U&lt;/math&gt;. The condition holds similarly upon &lt;math&gt;A \times U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U \times P&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''JOINT SINGLE CANCELLATION''. The relation " &lt;math&gt;\succsim&lt;/math&gt; " upon &lt;math&gt;A \times P&lt;/math&gt; satisfies joint single cancellation such that &lt;math&gt;\left(a, p, u\right)\succsim \left(b, q, u\right)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\left(a, p, v\right)\succsim \left(b, q, v\right)&lt;/math&gt; is true for all &lt;math&gt;a, b \in A; p, q \in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u, v \in U&lt;/math&gt;. Joint independence is similarly defined for &lt;math&gt;A \times U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U \times P&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''DISTRIBUTIVE CANCELLATION''. Distributive cancellation holds upon &lt;math&gt;A \times P \times U&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\left(a, p, u\right)\succsim \left(c, r, v\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left(b, q, u\right)\succsim \left(d, s, v\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(d, r, v\right)\succsim \left(b, p, u\right)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\left(a, q, u\right)\succsim \left(c, s, v\right)&lt;/math&gt; is true for all &lt;math&gt;a, b, c, d\in A; p, q, r, s \in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u, v\in U&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''DUAL DISTRIBUTIVE CANCELLATION''. Dual distributive cancellation holds upon &lt;math&gt;A \times P \times U&lt;/math&gt; if and only if
&lt;math&gt;\left(a, r, w\right)\succsim \left(c, s, v\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left(d, p, u\right)\succsim \left(b, t, x\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left(d, r, x\right)\succsim \left(e, s, u\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(c, t, y\right)\succsim \left(d, q, y\right)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\left(a, p, v\right)\succsim \left(b, q, w\right)&lt;/math&gt; is true for all &lt;math&gt;a, b, c, d, e\in A; p, q, r, s, t \in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u, v, w, x, y\in U&lt;/math&gt;.

*''SOLVABILITY''. The relation " &lt;math&gt;\succsim&lt;/math&gt; " upon &lt;math&gt;A \times P \times U&lt;/math&gt; is solvable if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;a, b\in A; p, q \in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u, v \in U&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;c \in A; r \in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w \in U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \sim \left(b, q, w\right) \sim \left(b, r, v\right) \sim \left(c, q, v\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''ARCHIMEDEAN CONDITION''.

===Representation theorems===

The quadruple &lt;math&gt;Z = \langle A, P, U, \succsim \rangle&lt;/math&gt; falls into one class of three variable simple polynomials by virtue of the joint single cancellation axiom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19351">The '''President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic''' was a commission formed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1987 to investigate the [[AIDS pandemic]]. It is also known as the '''Watkins Commission''' for [[James D. Watkins]], its chairman when the commission issued its final report in 1988.

== Organization ==
President Reagan issued {{Executive Order|12601}} creating the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic on June 24, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald Reagan - 1987|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/1987.html|work=Executive Orders Disposition Tables|publisher=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, he appointed Dr. [[W. Eugene Mayberry]], CEO of the [[Mayo Clinic]], to chair the commission. Jeff Levi, executive director of the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] objected to the appointment of someone with no experience with the disease, but others praised Mayberry's experience in both medical research and clinical services.&lt;ref name=mayberry&gt;{{cite news|last=Boffey|first=Philip M.|title=Hospital Official to Lead President's AIDS Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/26/us/hospital-official-to-lead-president-s-aids-panel.html|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 26, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration officials said it would resist pressure from gay rights activists to include a representative of the gay community on the commission. [[Gary Bauer|Gary L. Bauer]], the assistant to the President for policy development who would soon become head of the [[Family Research Council]], said: "I would be very surprised if an administration opposed to making appointments on the basis of race or sex would agree to make an appointment based on bedroom habits".&lt;ref name=mayberry/&gt; The commission was charged with producing a preliminary report in 3 months and a final report within a year.&lt;ref name=mayberry/&gt;

The president named the other commission members on July 23.&lt;ref name=ousts&gt;{{cite news|last=Boffey|first=Philip M.|title=U.S. Panel on AIDS, Citing Challenges, Ousts Staff Chief|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/15/us/us-panel-on-aids-citing-challenges-ousts-staff-chief.html|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 15, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saying AIDS needed to go "the way of smallpox and polio", President Reagan announced the appointments at the commission's first meeting. They included:&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan's AIDS Panel: Who the Members are|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/24/us/reagan-s-aids-panel-who-the-members-are.html|accessdate=February 13, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 24, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dr. [[Colleen Conway-Welch]], dean of nursing at [[Vanderbilt University]]&lt;ref name=ousts/&gt; 
*[[John J. Creedon]], CEO of [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]]&lt;ref name=names/&gt; 
*Dr. [[Theresa L. Crenshaw]], a sex educator and opponent of condoms as a means of preventing the spread of HIV
*[[Richard DeVos|Richard M. DeVos]], president of [[Amway]]&lt;ref name=ousts/&gt;
*Dr. [[Burton J. Lee III]], a physician at the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]&lt;ref name=ousts/&gt;
*Frank Lilly, a geneticist at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]]. Lilly had served on the board of the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC) from 1984 to 1986. He was "one of the first openly gay Presidential appointees".&lt;ref name=lilly&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|title=Frank Lilly, a Geneticist, 65; Member of National AIDS Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/16/nyregion/frank-lilly-a-geneticist-65-member-of-national-aids-panel.html|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 16, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., an African American and the health commissioner of Indiana and president of the [[Association of State and Territorial Health Officers]]; named vice-chairman by Mayberry.&lt;ref name=resign/&gt; 
*Cardinal [[John Joseph O'Connor (cardinal)|John O'Connor]]
*[[Penny Pullen]], an Illinois legislator and advocate of mandatory premarital HIV testing and later founder of the [[Illinois Family Institute]] 
*Corinna "Cory" SerVaas, editor of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''&lt;ref name=names&gt;{{cite news|last=Boffey|first=Philip M.|title=Reagan Names 12 to Panel on AIDS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/24/us/reagan-names-12-to-panel-on-aids.html|accessdate=February 13, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 24, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Dr. [[William B. Walsh]], president of [[Project HOPE]], a medical relief organization&lt;ref name=resign/&gt; 
*James D. Watkins, a retired admiral

At the commission's first meeting, Lilly and O'Connor, seated side by side, "chatted cordially", the ''New York Times'' reported. When the meeting ended, reporters and television cameras surrounded Lilly leaving him, he said, "shell-shocked" and "scared to death".&lt;ref name=names/&gt; Senator [[Gordon Humphrey]], a New Hampshire Republican, attacked Lilly's appointment, said the President "should strive at all costs to avoid sending the message to society—especially to impressionable youth—that homosexuality is simply an alternative lifestyle" and said the President should have named heterosexual experts to the commission.&lt;ref name=names/&gt;

The commission planned visits to review activities in several localities, beginning with a two-day visit to New York City by 5 commissioners in August/September. They visited hospitals and met with volunteers, health-care providers, and representatives of gay organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Thomas|title=Members of Federal AIDS Commission |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/02/nyregion/members-of-federal-aids-commission-visit-facilities-in-city.html |accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 2, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The commission's executive director was forced to resign in September "after a power struggle and allegations of inadequate performance," wrote the ''New York Times'', in which Mayberry yielded to the demands of some members of the commission for better staff support than they felt they were receiving. Lee said: "For whatever reason, lack of staff or whatever, things just weren't happening. With Gene Mayberry out in Rochester, Minnesota, most of the time, the commission felt we had to get a really good, high-powered, full-time person" to manage the commission staff.&lt;ref name=ousts/&gt; On October 7, Mayberry and Myers quit, as did the commission's senior staff adviser for medical and research affairs, Dr. Franklin Cockerill 3d, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in AIDS. Lilly said he was considering resigning but would wait to see who replaced the chairman and vice-chairman. The administration immediately announced the appointment of James D. Watkins, a retired admiral who had been Chief of Naval Operations.&lt;ref name=resign&gt;{{cite news|last=Boffey|first=Philip M.|title=Leaders of AIDS Panel Quit Amid Feuds and Criticism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/08/us/leaders-of-aids-panel-quit-amid-feuds-and-criticism.html |accessdate= February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 8, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' said Mayberry had been "viewed as a moderating influence on the views of other members who are considered more ideological in their approach" and that "[b]y virtually all accounts, the commission has got off to a slow start in recruiting staff and organizing for its task." Myers said that "The personalities are intense" and that "I don't feel the commission as currently constituted would be effective."&lt;ref name=resign/&gt; Comments from those familiar with the commission and its responsibilities expressed dismay at the resignations. Richard Dunne, executive secretary of GMHC, said: "The AIDS epidemic is out of control, and it seems, so is the Presidential Commission on AIDS."&lt;ref name=resign/&gt; On October 9, DeVos said that the president needed to avoid naming commissioners who were "emotionally" involved in the commission's work and that, in one newspaper's account of his statement, "some homosexuals want to 'capture the agenda'".&lt;ref name=quick&gt;{{cite news|title=Head of AIDS Commission Pledges Quick Reorganization of Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/us/head-of-aids-commission-pledges-quick-reorganization-of-panel.html|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 11, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Years later, Watkins' wife reported that Watkins told Reagan "I'm a sailor and a submariner, and I know nothing about medicine", and that Regan replied: "You're exactly who we're looking for."&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; On October 11, Watkins announced plans to move quickly with reorganizing the commission staff. Noting that he was speaking to reporters on the day of a [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights|political march and rally in Washington]], he said, "We have in Washington today one of the largest gay rights activist demonstrations that we have had—we are sensitive to them as human beings and to their issues". He continued: "We haven't done the job to date, I am sorry to say, but I feel comfortable and the other members of the commission feel comfortable that I can take it and mold them together and bring all of our prima donnas, including me, into a nice, neat, unified package."&lt;ref name=quick/&gt; He named a new executive director on October 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boffey|first=Philip M.|title=Executive Director Named for President's AIDS Commission|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/14/us/executive-director-named-for-president-s-aids-commission.html |accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 14, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without Bauer's approval, Watkins later added two commission members who had track records as critics of the Reagan administration: Kristine Gebbie, Oregon public health commissioner and president of the AIDS Task Force of the American Society of State and Territorial Health Officers and Dr. Benny J. Primm, director of a New York City treatment program for addicts. Primm was the only African American on the commission and the only one with expertise on the intravenous drug use.&lt;ref name=boodman/&gt; Of the challenge of heading the commission, Watkins later said: "I really wasn't sure I could pull it out of the swamp."&lt;ref name=boodman/&gt;

==Reports==
In February 1988, the commission released an interim report focused on IV drugs that called for a $20-billion, 10-year effort to fight AIDS. Watkins described it as "only seven-tenths of a percent of the defense budget."&lt;ref name=boodman&gt;{{cite news|last=Boodman|first=Sandra G.|title=But Toughest Tasks Lie Ahead: AIDS Commission's New Chairman Earns High Marks for Leadership|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-04-17/news/mn-1898_1_aids-task-force|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 17, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; William B. Rubenstein, an attorney with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) who earlier sued the commission anticipating that its membership would bias its findings, found Watkins' work "a pleasant surprise".&lt;ref name=boodman/&gt;

On June 2, 1988, Watkins described the commission's draft report and called for state and federal laws to provide anti-discrimination protection for AIDS patients. He called that discrimination "the rule, not the exception." He explained that testing and the identification of sexual partners could not be successful without such protections against discrimination: "So, once those with HIV are treated like anyone else with a disability, then we will find that what is best for the individual is also best for the public health." He said "Semen, blood, and ignorance surround this epidemic, and we were in that last category" when starting work. &lt;ref name=van&gt;{{cite news|last=Van|first=John|title=Aids Panel Urges Antibias Laws |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-06-03/news/8801040536_1_testing-for-hiv-infection-hiv-positive-test-aids-research |accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an initial review, Dr. [[Mathilde Krim]], founder of the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] thought the commission's work both more expert than she expected and free of ideology.&lt;ref name=van/&gt; Tim Sweeney, executive director of GMHC call the draft report "courageous, aggressive and compassionate" and added: "We challenge the President, Congress and presidential candidates to respond to this report by implementing its recommendations".&lt;ref name=van/&gt; The [[American Public Health Association]] called it "an aggressive first step towards developing an integrated national strategy to deal with the AIDS epidemic."&lt;ref name=van/&gt; 

The commission produced its final report on June 24, 1988. The commissioners approved it by a vote of 7 to 6. Its recommendations surprised observers by arguing against every measure advocating by conservative observers, such as mandatory testing, and characterizing partner notification as an inappropriate activity for medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Engel|first=Jonahan|title=The Epidemic: A History of Aids |year=2009 |publisher=HarperCollins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQud7Hf6oLIC&amp;pg=PT114&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal findings and recommendations were designed to provide a national strategy for managing the epidemic. It made more than 500 recommendations, which it summarized under these headings:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED299531&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED299531 The Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic Report], June 24, 1988.

Vice President George Bush, who was running for President at the time, immediately endorsed both an executive order and legislation to meet the commission's call for the extension of Federal anti-discrimination protection to those with AIDS and those who test positive for HIV. He emphasized children in his discussions with reporters: "My conscience has been advising me on AIDS.... I'd hate it if a kid of mine got a blood transfusion and my grandson had AIDS and the community discriminated against that child, that innocent child". Reagan said his drug policy advisor would review the report and make recommendations to him in 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyd|first=Gerald M.|title=Bush Backs Protection Of AIDS Victim Rights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/29/us/bush-backs-protection-of-aids-victim-rights.html|accessdate=February 12, 2013 |newspaper=New York Times|date=June 29, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Reagan later said he opposed such discrimination in principle but took no action before his term as president ended in January 1989.&lt;ref name=urged&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Julie|title=Bush Is Urged to Be a Leader in the Fight on AIDS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/02/us/bush-is-urged-to-be-a-leader-in-the-fight-on-aids.html|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 2, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration took small steps while ignoring the commission's central points. It acted to inform recipients of blood transfusions that they were at risk, made plans to speed FDA drug approvals, and developed proposals to add facilities for the [[Centers for Disease Control]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Engel|first=Jonahan|title=The Epidemic: A History of Aids |year=2009 |publisher=HarperCollins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQud7Hf6oLIC&amp;pg=PT115&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Anthony Fauci]] later described the significance of Watkins' military background to the debate over the nation's response to AIDS: "To have a presidential commission chairman with his background to come out so strongly against stigma and discrimination was a very, very important step".&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news|last=Shapiro|first=T. Rees|title=James D. Watkins, who led Reagan’s commission on AIDS in the 1980s, dies at 85|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-07-27/local/35488422_1_radio-free-watkins-james-david-watkins-aids-patients|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randy Shilts]] called the report "a sweeping battle plan.... AIDS was war, Watkins reasoned, and in a war ''somebody must be in charge''; that's how you ''get things done''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shilts |first=Randy |title=And the Band Played On|year=1987|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=NY|pages=609-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to inaction on the part of the Reagan administration, Congress passed legislation sponsored by Representative [[J. Roy Rowland|Roy Rowland]], a Georgia Democrat and the only physician in Congress, that created the [[National Commission on AIDS]]. The legislation specified that commission's members must be "individuals with experience and/or expertise pertinent to the AIDS epidemic". It produced several reports over the next 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harden|first=Victoria A.|title=AIDS at 30: A History|year=2012|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QosAu8D4ELEC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Sprigg Steuart''' (1797–1876) was a [[Maryland]] physician and an early pioneer of the treatment of mental illness. He was instrumental in the expansion and modernisation of The Maryland Hospital for the Insane, now known as the [[Spring Grove Hospital Center]], which became his life's work. Spring Grove continues to treat mental illness today, and is the second oldest institution of its kind in the United States. Steuart was relieved of his position as superintendent of the hospital at the start of the [[American Civil War]], because he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Union, but he was reinstated at the war's end, and remained superintendent almost until his death in 1876.

==Early life==

Steuart was born in Baltimore in November 1797, younger son of the physician Dr James Steuart and his wife Rebecca. He was the fourth of eight siblings, of whom two died in infancy, of scarlet fever.&lt;ref name="Nelker, p.70" /&gt; He was raised at the family mansion at [[Maryland Square]] &lt;ref&gt;Nelker, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; and educated at [[St. Mary's Seminary and University|St Mary's College, Baltimore]].

===War of 1812===
During the [[War of 1812]], at the age of seventeen, Steuart volunteered his assistance as aide-de-camp &lt;ref name="russel p.163" /&gt; to the [[Washington Blues]], a company of militia raised and commanded by his older brother, Captain (later Major General) [[George H. Steuart (Major General)|George H. Steuart]] (1790–1867), and served at the [[Battle of North Point]] on September 12, 1814, where the [[Maryland National Guard|Maryland Militia]] were able to hold off a British attack long enough to shore up the defence of Baltimore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nelker, 136, Memoirs of Richard Sprigg Steuart.&lt;/ref&gt; As he later recalled in his memoirs:

:"I found my little knowledge of surgery very useful. One of the soldiers had been shot through the thigh wounding the femoral artory, so...I made a tourniquet, arresting the flow of blood, to place him in my wagon and bring him to the Maryland hospital. Here surgeon Gibson received him and finally amputated his leg."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Medical career==
[[File:RST medicine case.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Medicine case of Richard Sprigg Steuart.]]
After the war, Steuart began the study of law under Brigadier General [[William H. Winder]],&lt;ref name="russel p.163" /&gt; who had commanded the [[United States]] forces at the [[Battle of Bladensberg]] and was court-martialled afterwards. However, Steuart abandoned law in favor of medicine, which he studied under Dr William Donaldson in 1818 at [[University of Maryland Medical Center|Maryland Medical University]]. He graduated with his M.D. in 1822, publishing in the same year a work ''On the Action of Arteries''.&lt;ref name="russel p.163"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UM4VrWHJUaUC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=steuart+judge+land+office&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=steuart%20judge%20land%20office&amp;f=false Quinan, John Russel, p.163, ''Medical Annals of Baltimore from 1608 to 1880''] BiblioLife (2008) Retrieved Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation he went into partnership with Donaldson at his general medical practice in Baltimore for seventeen years and, after Donaldson's death, succeeded to the practice. Early on however he began to specialize in the relatively neglected field of mental illness, and in 1834 he became President of the Board of Visitors of the [[Spring Grove Hospital Center|Maryland Hospital for the Insane.]]&lt;ref name="russel p.163" /&gt;

In 1843 Steuart was elected to the Professorship of the Theory and Practice of Physic at the University of Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjIKvjyORwwC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=dr+r+steuart&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=KzCZS4zRM53EMfiE1LwH&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=dr%20r%20steuart&amp;f=false p.391, Maryland Medical and Surgical Journal, Volume 3] Retrieved March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1848-49, and again from 1850–51, he served as president of the [[MedChi|Medical and Chirurgical faculty of the State of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7nMo6Dq-bQEC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=richard+sprigg+steuart&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=f0uVS6kmiew1nJDd8wI&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20sprigg%20steuart&amp;f=false ''Transactions of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland''] Retrieved March 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1853 he was described by the American Journal of the Medical Sciences as "well known as one of the most eminent physicians of this city [of Baltimore]",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KgQHAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA547&amp;dq=Dr.+R.+S.+Steuart&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=y-mYS7B9lbA2vbfsmwc&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Dr.%20R.%20S.%20Steuart&amp;f=false p.547,  ''The American Journal of the Medical Sciences, Volume 26'' (1853).] Retrieved March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dix-Dorothea-LOC.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Dorothea Dix]] lobbied for reform of the treatment of mental illness in Maryland.]]
Steuart's most notable contribution to the field of mental illness was his work for the Maryland Hospital for the Insane (founded in 1797), where he became President of the Board and Medical Superintendent, and which became his life's work. By the mid-nineteenth century The hospital's bed capacity was no longer adequate, and Steuart managed to obtain authorization and funding from the [[Maryland General Assembly]] for the construction of a new, larger facility at Spring Grove. In co-operation with the social reformer [[Dorothea Dix]], who in 1852 gave an impassioned speech to the Maryland legislature, Steuart chaired the committee known as the Commissioners for Erecting a Hospital for the Insane, that selected the Hospital's present site in [[Catonsville]].

The cost of purchasing {{convert|136|acre|km2}} of land for the hospital was $14,000, of which $12,340 was raised through private contributions, with Steuart himself personally contributing $1,000, a very large sum at the time. The purchase was completed in 1853, but construction of the new buildings was delayed by the Civil War, and the hospital was not finally completed until 1872,&lt;ref name="History of Spring Grove Hospital"&gt;[http://www.springgrove.com/history.html#Dorothea%20Dix%20--%20An%20Impassioned%20Plea History of Spring Grove Hospital] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126030551/http://springgrove.com/history.html |date=2010-01-26 }} Retrieved March 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; when it was described by one contemporary as "one of the largest and best appointed Insane Asylums in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UM4VrWHJUaUC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=richard+steuart+spring+grove&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=UhqVS6T3FZHmMPulhNMM&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20steuart%20spring%20grove&amp;f=false Quinan, John Russell, p.50, ''Medical Annals of Baltimore from 1608 to 1880''] Retrieved March 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Steuart's brother, Major General George H. Steuart, had two sons who suffered from mental illness,&lt;ref name=MHS&gt;[http://www.mdhs.org/library/mss/ms000758.html archive of the Maryland Historical Society] Retrieved Jan 13 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that this was one of the causes of Steuart's particular interest in Spring Grove Hospital and the treatment of mental illness.

==Tobacco planter and gentleman farmer==
[[File:Dodon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Steuart's Plantation house at [[Dodon (farm)|Dodon]], on the South River near [[Annapolis]].]]
In 1842 Steuart inherited from his uncle [[William Steuart (Mayor of Baltimore)|William Steuart]] a tobacco plantation comprising around {{convert|1600|acre|km2}} of land and about 150 slaves, at [[Dodon (farm)|Dodon]], near the [[South River (Maryland)|South River]] in [[Anne Arundel County]], Maryland.&lt;ref name="Nelker, p150"/&gt; Dodon had been purchased by Steuart's grandfather in around 1740, and the inheritance made Steuart a wealthy landowner and slaveholder. As a result, Steuart gave up his general medical practice, after what he described as "23 years of hard professional life"&lt;ref&gt;Nelker, p137, memoirs of Richard Sprigg Steuart&lt;/ref&gt; in order to concentrate on managing his new estate.

===The problem of slavery===
[[File:Cape Palmas etch.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Cape Palmas, a colony for free blacks founded in Liberia by the [[Maryland State Colonization Society]].]]
Like many Southern slaveholders, Steuart held conflicting views on the question of [[slavery]]. Although he recognized that the South's "[[peculiar institution]]" could not continue indefinitely, he was hostile to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] efforts to end it by force.

From 1828 Steuart served on the Board of Managers of the [[Maryland State Colonization Society]], of which [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], one of the co-signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], was president. Steuart's father, James Steuart, was vice-president, and his brother George H. Steuart was also on the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_TEdAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=geo+h+steuart&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=O45QS8-CMZuCywTuv4SRDA&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=geo%20h%20steuart&amp;f=false ''The African Repository, Volume 3'', 1827, p.251, edited by Ralph Randolph Gurley] Retrieved Jan 15 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The MSCS was a branch of the [[American Colonization Society]], an organization dedicated to returning black Americans to lead free lives in African states such as [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jx8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''The African Repository, Volume 14, p.42] Retrieved March 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter to [[John L. Carey]], in 1845, published in [[Baltimore]] by the printer John Murphy, Steuart asked rhetorically: 
:"is there a man in Maryland, is there a single man connected with slavery who does not feel its existence to be a curse upon our beautiful land? Is there one who has not many a time...expressed a fond hope that he might live to witness...the entire exodus of the negro race from among us? If there is such a man, I have never met with him here...indeed it is impossible for a man of sound judgment and feelings...to behold the power and prosperity of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]]...in comparison with our own state, and not feel the deepest regret for our deficiencies."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sprigg Steuart, ''Letter to John Carey'' 1845, [https://archive.org/stream/lettertojohnlcar00steu/#page/4/mode/2up p.4.] Retrieved Jan 21 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Steuart was envious of the greater relative prosperity of the Northern States, and especially their much greater population growth. In Maryland, he argued, slavery held back economic progress:

:"It is a matter of common observation that white laborers will not settle where slaves occupy the soil, however partially they may do so among free negroes. The white man shrinks from a union of labor with those who are regarded by their masters as an inferior race, and gradually he comes to regard labor itself as degrading, and fit only for those whom heaven has stamped with a color darker than his own."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sprigg Steuart, ''Letter to John Carey'' 1845, [https://archive.org/stream/lettertojohnlcar00steu/#page/4/mode/2up p.5.] Retrieved Jan 21 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Much though he may have opposed the institution of slavery in principle, Steuart was strongly opposed to the radical agenda of the Abolitionists. Instead, he recommended voluntary [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] by the slave holders, leading to the repatriation to Africa of free black settlers:
:"The colored man [must] look to Africa, as his only hope of preservation and of happiness...it will be found that this course of procedure...will...secure the removal of the great body of the African people from our State. The President of the [[Maryland State Colonization Society|Maryland Colonization Society]] says "the object of Colonization is to prepare a home in Africa for the free colored people of the State, to which they may remove when the advantages which it offers, and above all the pressure of irresistible circumstances in this country, shall excite them to emigrate."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sprigg Steuart, ''Letter to John Carey'' 1845, [https://archive.org/stream/lettertojohnlcar00steu/#page/4/mode/2up pp.10-11.] Retrieved Jan 21 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
[[File:Baltimore Riot 1861.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Baltimore riot of April 1861.]]
The outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 found Steuart and his family sympathetic to the Southern cause, though Maryland did not secede from the Union. Pre-war loyalties in Maryland were divided between North and South, but the Northern cause prevailed. In April, the city was shaken by the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]], as Union soldiers travelled through the city by rail. Steuart wrote:
:"I happened to be in Baltimore on the night of the 19th April 1861, and witnessed the outburst of feeling on the part of the people. Generally, when the Massachusetts troops were passing thru the city of Baltimore, it was evident to me that 75 p.c. of the population was in favour of repelling these troops. Instinctively the people seemed to look upon them as intruders, or as invaders of the South, not as defenders of the City of Baltimore. How or by whom the first blow was given can not be now ascertained, but the feeling of resistance was contagious and powerful. The Mayor of the City, nevertheless, thought it his duty to keep the peace and protect these troops in their passage thru Baltimore." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LHkbTYE7D8gC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=southern+richard+sprigg+steuart+april+19&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=peyHS7LnMpW-NqjlqOsM&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=southern%20richard%20sprigg%20steuart%20april%2019&amp;f=false Mitchell, Charles W., p.101, ''Maryland voices of the Civil War''.] Retrieved February 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Steuart was among those who placed pressure on Governor Hicks to summon the state Legislature to vote on secession, following Hicks to Annapolis with a number of fellow citizens:
:"to insist on his [Hicks] issuing his proclamation for the Legislature to convene, believing that this body (and not himself and his party) should decide the fate of our state"...if the Governor and his party continued to refuse this demand that it would be necessary to depose him".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 22 Governor Hicks finally announced that the state legislature would meet in a special session in Frederick, a strongly pro-Union town. In the end, Steuart's efforts to persuade Maryland to secede from the Union were in vain. On April 29, the Maryland Legislature voted 53–13 against secession. and the state was swiftly occupied by Union soldiers to prevent any reconsideration.

===Fugitive===
The political situation remained uncertain until May 13, 1861 when Union troops occupied the state, restoring order and preventing a vote in favour of Southern secession, and by late summer Maryland was firmly in the hands of Union soldiers. Arrests of Confederate sympathizers soon followed, and Steuart's brother, Major General Steuart, fled to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], after which much of his family's property was confiscated by the Federal Government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fNspu2FxwUwC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=strategic+value+steuart&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=UsCKS4G8NI20MNu68NUM&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=strategic%20value%20steuart&amp;f=false Brugger, Robert J., p.280, ''Maryland, A Middle Temperament: 1634-1980''] Retrieved Feb 28 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The family's Baltimore residence, [[Maryland Square]], was seized by the [[Union Army]] and [[Jarvis Hospital]] was soon erected on the grounds of the estate, to care for Federal wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Nelker, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GHSteuart.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Steuart's nephew, Confederate Brigadier General [[George H. Steuart (brigadier general)|George H. "Maryland" Steuart.]]]]
Dodon was not confiscated by the Union but, during the course of the war, horses were raised and trained and then smuggled south for [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces, as well as medical supplies such as [[quinine]]. As a result, Dodon was often raided by Union troops, frequently forcing Steuart to flee into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;Nelker, 150&lt;/ref&gt; According to a family memoir:

:"Dr Steuart was constantly away from home, avoiding the raiding parties from the Northern soldiers who sought to capture him, because of the help he gave the South by secretly sending supplies of quinine, and other necessities...to the Southern hospitals. Wakened...in the dead of night, [his wife Maria] dressed quietly and...admitted the Northern soldiers, and then stealing past the sentries, walked half a mile to the 'quarters', and sent a trusty messenger to warn his master not to return. Old William Hawkins, when a soldier put a pistol to his head saying 'tell us where your master is', replied 'I'd rather be dead than tell'."&lt;ref name="Nelker, p150"&gt;Nelker, p150&lt;/ref&gt;

Steuart's support for the Confederacy came at a high price. He was relieved of his duties at the Hospital after he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Union.&lt;ref name="helsel p.19"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IDeJwUdU9AAC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=richard+sprigg+steuart&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=-J2HS9zSNo20MNu68NUM&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20sprigg%20steuart&amp;f=false Helsel, David S., p.19, ''Spring Grove State Hospital''] Retrieved February 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the Baltimore resident W W Glenn described Steuart as a fugitive from the authorities:
:"I was spending the evening out when a footstep approached my chair from behind and a hand was laid upon me. I turned and saw Dr. R. S. Steuart. He has been concealed for more than six months. His neighbors are so bitter against him that he dare not go home, and he committed himself so decidedly on the 19th April and is known to be so decided a Southerner, that it [is] more than likely he would be thrown into a Fort. He goes about from place to place, sometimes staying in one county, sometimes in another and then passing a few days in the city. He never shows in the day time &amp; is cautious who sees him at any time. He has several negroes in his confidence at different places." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LHkbTYE7D8gC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=richard+sprigg+steuart+baltimoreans&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=BO-HS4KXAZ2uMvGWueYM&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20sprigg%20steuart%20baltimoreans&amp;f=false Mitchell, Charles W., p.285, ''Maryland Voices of the Civil War''] Retrieved February 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the war===
After the war, in 1868, Steuart was eventually reinstated to the hospital as superintendent, and remained in charge when its operations moved to the newly completed hospital at Spring Grove in 1872, thereby living to see the fulfillment of his life's work and ambition.&lt;ref name="History of Spring Grove Hospital"/&gt; However, he was once again removed in 1875 when the board, under his leadership, mortgaged the hospital to a group of private investors, after the Maryland Legislature had failed to fully fund its operations.&lt;ref name="helsel p.19" /&gt;

He gave an address in 1876 to the Alumni Association of Maryland Medical University,&lt;ref name="russel p.163" /&gt; but died the same year on July 13, and is buried at his family estate of [[Dodon (farm)|Dodon]] in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Nelker, p.70" /&gt;

Modern psychological testing can be traced back to 1908 with the introduction of the first successful intelligence test, the Binet-Simon Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, John W. (2008) A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4th Ed.)  Concept of Intelligence (283-284) New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Binet-Simon came the revised version, the Stanford-Binet, which was used in the development of the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests used by the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;Fancher, R. (1985). The Intelligence Men: Makers of the IQ Controversy. New York:W.W. Norton &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, Robert S. Woodworth developed the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet (WPDS), to determine which soldiers were better prepared to handle the stresses of combat. The WPDS signaled a shift in the focus of psychological testing from intellect to personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, and Issues |last1=Kaplan |first1=Robert M. |last2=Saccuzzo |first2=Dennis P. |year=2009 |edition=Seventh |publisher=Wadsworth |location=Belmont (CA) |isbn=978-0-495-09555-2 |laysummary=http://www.cengagebrain.com/shop/en/US/storefront/US?cmd=catProductDetail&amp;ISBN=0495095559&amp;cid=GB1 |laydate=9 November 2010 |pages=17&amp;ndash;18|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s, the quantitative measurement of personality traits had become a central theme in psychology, and it has remained so into the 2000s. During this time, numerous variations and versions of ‘personality tests’ have been created, including the widely used Myers-Briggs, DISC, and Cattell’s 16PF Questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.businessballs.com/personalitystylesmodels.htm Personality Theories, Types and Tests.]” Businessballs.com. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Role-Based Assessment (RBA) differs significantly from personality testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Presser|first=Janice|title=Validating the Business Benefits of TGI Role-Based Assessment|work=The Gabriel Institute|publisher=The Gabriel Institute|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Instead of quantifying individual personality factors, RBA’s methodology was developed, from its very beginnings, to make qualitative observations of human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnapp-Rafael |first1=Marci |year=2011 |title=Hiring Top-Quality Team Players: An Executive Recruiter Discovers 'A New Way to Know' |journal=Canadian Institute of Management |volume=Summer 2011 |pages=22–23 |url=http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402145733/http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, RBA is a form of behavioral simulation. Understanding the quality of a person’s behavior on a team can be a valuable adjunct to other forms of evaluation (such as data on experience, knowledge, skills, and personality) because the ability to successfully cooperate and collaborate with others is fundamental to organizational performance.

==Concepts==
=== Coherence ===
In TGI Role-Based Assessment, ‘Coherence’ describes a positive and constructive orientation to working with others to achieve common goals, overcome obstacles, and meet organizational needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overvew: TGI Products &amp; Services|url=https://thegabrielinstitute.com/products_and_services.php|work=The Gabriel Institute|publisher=The Gabriel Institute|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schick|first=Shane|title=Role-based assessment of IT execs comes to Canada|url=http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/role-based-assessment-of-it-execs-comes-to-canada/142887|work=IT World Canada|publisher=CIO Canada|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnapp-Rafael |first1=Marci |year=2011 |title=Hiring Top-Quality Team Players: An Executive Recruiter Discovers 'A New Way to Know' |journal=Canadian Institute of Management |volume=Summer 2011 |pages=22–23 |url=http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402145733/http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Role===
A person’s ‘Role’ describes their strongest affinity for, or attraction to, serving a certain type of organizational need, e.g., planning for the future vs. executing current tasks vs. preserving and sharing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overvew: TGI Products &amp; Services|url=https://thegabrielinstitute.com/products_and_services.php|work=The Gabriel Institute|publisher=The Gabriel Institute|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnapp-Rafael |first1=Marci |year=2011 |title=Hiring Top-Quality Team Players: An Executive Recruiter Discovers 'A New Way to Know' |journal=Canadian Institute of Management |volume=Summer 2011 |pages=22–23 |url=http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402145733/http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Teaming Characteristics===
Each RBA report includes a detailed section on ‘Teaming Characteristics’, which are derived, in part, from the relationship between a person’s level of Coherence and their unique Role (or Roles). As their name suggests, Teaming Characteristics can help managers and coaches to understand how well a person will ‘fit’ within a team and/or adapt to their job responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overvew: TGI Products &amp; Services|url=https://thegabrielinstitute.com/products_and_services.php|work=The Gabriel Institute|publisher=The Gabriel Institute|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnapp-Rafael |first1=Marci |year=2011 |title=Hiring Top-Quality Team Players: An Executive Recruiter Discovers 'A New Way to Know' |journal=Canadian Institute of Management |volume=Summer 2011 |pages=22–23 |url=http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402145733/http://www.teamquestsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hiring-Top-Quality-Team-Players-Published4.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Development==
Dr. Janice Presser began collaborating with Dr. Jack Gerber in 1988 to develop tools and methods for measuring the fundamental elements of human ‘teaming’ behavior, with a goal of improving individual and team performance. Their work combines decodes of research, blending Dr. Presser’s earlier work in family and social relationships with Dr. Gerber’s ‘Mosaic Figures’ test, which had been designed to produce qualitative information on how individuals view other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzales-Frisbie|first=Jennifer|title=Personality Tests in Jeopardy: An  Evaluation of the Seventh Circuit's Decision in Karraler V. Rent-A-Center and its Impact on the Future Use of Personality Tests In Pre-Employment Screening|journal=University of Pennsylvania Journal of Labor and Employment Law|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=185–205|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jbl/articles/volume9/issue1/Gonzales-Frisbie9U.Pa.J.Lab.&amp;Emp.L.185(2006).pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three generations of assessments were developed, tested and used in the context of actual business performance. The initial Executive Behavior Assessment was focused on the behavior of persons with broad responsibility for organizational performance. The second iteration, called the Enhanced Executive Behavior Assessment, incorporated metrics on the behavior of executives working in teams. Drs. Presser and Gerber then successfully applied their testing methodology to team contributors outside of the executive ranks, and as development and testing efforts continued, Role-Based Assessment (RBA) emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=https://thegabrielinstitute.com/who_we_are.php|work=The Gabriel Institute|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1999, RBA was established as a paper-based assessment, and was being sold for use in pre-hire screening and organizational development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schick|first=Shane|title=Role-based assessment of IT execs comes to Canada|url=http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/role-based-assessment-of-it-execs-comes-to-canada/142887|work=IT World Canada|publisher=CIO Canada|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drs Presser and Gerber formed The Gabriel Institute in 2001, with the goal of making RBA available to a greater audience via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzales-Frisbie|first=Jennifer|title=Personality Tests in Jeopardy: An  Evaluation of the Seventh Circuit's Decision in Karraler V. Rent-A-Center and its Impact on the Future Use of Personality Tests In Pre-Employment Screening|journal=University of Pennsylvania Journal of Labor and Employment Law|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=185–205|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jbl/articles/volume9/issue1/Gonzales-Frisbie9U.Pa.J.Lab.&amp;Emp.L.185(2006).pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mid-year in 2009, TGI Role-Based Assessment&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; became generally available as an [[online assessment]] instrument. Later in 2009, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) published a two-part white paper by Dr. Presser, which introduced ground- breaking ideas on the measurement and valuation of human synergy in organizations, and an approach to the creation of a strong, positively oriented human infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;SHRM - “[http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Pages/InfrastructureCHI.aspx The Measurement &amp; Valuation of Human Infrastructure: An Introduction to CHI Indicators]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SHRM – “[http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Pages/New%20Way%20to%20Know.aspx The Measurement &amp; Valuation of Human Infrastructure: An Intro. To the ‘New Way to Know’]”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The most common use of TGI Role-Based Assessment is in pre-hire screening evaluations. RBA’s focus on ‘teaming’ behavior offers a different way to allegedly predict how an individual will fit with company culture, on a given team, and how they are likely to respond to specific job requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds Wickman, Lindsay. “[http://talentmgt.com/articles/view/rolebased_assessment_thinking_inside_the_box/3 Role-Based Assessment: Thinking Inside the Box.]” Talent Management Magazine (October 2008). Media Tec Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  While other pre-hire testing may run the "risk of violating the ADA" (Americans with Disabilities Act), this does not appear to be an issue with Role-Based Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzales-Frisbie|first=Jennifer|title=Personality Tests in Jeopardy: An  Evaluation of the Seventh Circuit's Decision in Karraler V. Rent-A-Center and its Impact on the Future Use of Personality Tests In Pre-Employment Screening|journal=University of Pennsylvania Journal of Labor and Employment Law|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=185–205|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jbl/articles/volume9/issue1/Gonzales-Frisbie9U.Pa.J.Lab.&amp;Emp.L.185(2006).pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;


RBA is also claimed to have unique potential for strengthening a human infrastructure. Results from RBA reports can be aggregated, providing quantitative data that is used for analysis and resolution of team performance problems, and to identify and select candidates for promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds Wickman, Lindsay. “[http://talentmgt.com/articles/view/rolebased_assessment_thinking_inside_the_box/3 Role-Based Assessment: Thinking Inside the Box.]” Talent Management Magazine (October 2008).

The '''Silver Lining Foundation''' ({{zh|'''雲彩行動'''}},'''YúnCǎiXíngDòng ''') was founded in [[Nanning]], [[Guangxi]], [[China]], in 2007. Silver Lining started as a small shop that sold hand-crafted jewelry. Nearly all the employees were disabled orphans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Silver Lining Workshop. | publisher=Silver Lining Foundation | accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, an orphanage (Gūan ài Zhōng Xīn) was instituted in [[Dahua]], Guangxi, China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesilverliningfoundation.org/en/action_content.asp?id=21 | title=Caring Center Orphanage | publisher=Silver Lining Foundation | accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 a [[Rehabilitation medicine|rehabilitation center]] for kids diagnosed with [[cerebral palsy]] was built. The founders of the Silver Lining Organization are Chris and Lydia Yeung, who currently live in Nanning, China with two of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.nnnews.net/News/10/05/24/NNNEWSQ175034T20100524NVEWNY50F.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=GB2312 | title=Around people a sense of personnel clouds to orphans support a sky | publisher=NNews [Nanning] | accessdate=May 12, 2012 | author=Liu, JiangPing}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
To improve the lives of impoverished children and their families and to educate, care for, and show love to all individuals, equipping them with the proper tools to give back to their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesilverliningfoundation.org/en/about.asp?id=93 | title=Our Mission | publisher=Silver Lining Foundation | accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2005, Chris and Lydia Yeung, along with their three children, came to China to work at an orphanage for disabled children. They returned to the [[United States]] that year, but in 2007, the Yeung family once again returned to China. Chris and Lydia started to work with the disabled orphans they met in 2005 and discovered that many of them were without jobs because of their disabilities. Lydia decided to help these young adults and started a [[swarovski crystal]] shop in a small apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesilverliningfoundation.org/en/about.asp?id=92 | title=Our Story | publisher=Silver Lining Foundation | accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Silver Lining started to sponsor impoverished families whose children had cerebral palsy. The next year, Silver Lining foundation signed a five-year contract to reserve a building for future use as their first orphanage. In 2010, Silver Lining started to sponsor poverty stricken children in the DaHua mountain rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesilverliningfoundation.org/en/media_coverage/201101/orientaldaily-hk-20110127.jpg | title=Oriental Daily [DaHua] | date=January 27, 2011 | accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the same year, the Silver Lining Foundation was officially recognized as a [[Non-Profit Organization]] by the Chinese and [[Hong Kong]] government. Silver Lining created a rehabilitation center for cerebral palsy children in 2011.

==Silver Lining Foundation Projects==
===Silver Lining Workshop===
The first of the Silver Lining Foundation projects, the Silver Lining Workshop, was established in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.nnnews.net/News/10/05/24/NNNEWSQ175068T20100524NDRHVGU7Q.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=GB2312 | title=Nanning disabled orphans woven fine jewelry | publisher=NNews [Nanning] | date=May 24, 2010 | accessdate=May 12, 2012 | author=Liu, JiangPing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydia said that the purpose of starting this workshop was to give hope and opportunities to individuals society had overlooked. The Silver Lining Workshop offers employees musical lessons, which have resulted in the starting of a band called "Inspiration," by the handicapped orphans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://ngzb.gxnews.com.cn/html/2008-12/09/content_165098.htm&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8 | title=Disabled orphans charity handicrafts love pass touched by friends | publisher=Nan Guo Zao Bao [Nanning] | date=December 9, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2012 | author=Liu, JianQin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver Lining Orphanage===
In 2009, Silver Lining started an orphanage in DaHua, Guangxi, China. The Silver Lining Care Center adopts a new dimension to the structure of the orphanage. In order to provide a healthy home environment for the children, every six kids are assigned to a married couple, who live under the same roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgx.xinhuanet.com%2Fdtzx%2F2011-01%2F12%2Fcontent_21846292.htm&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=gbk | title=The Dahua clouds care center ribbon-cutting ceremony to accept mountain orphans stay | publisher=NNews [DaHua] | date=December 9, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2012 | author=Qing, YiBin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver Lining DaHua Mountain Sponsorship===
As of 2010, the Silver Lining foundation has been sponsoring a school located in the poverty stricken mountains of DaHua. Silver Lining provides vegetables, meat, blankets, clothes, and beds for the children who live at school during the school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesilverliningfoundation.org/en/action_content.asp?id=19 | title=Basic daily needs and educational needs of impoverished children in the mountainous areas | publisher=Silver Lining Foundation | accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smokers Express''' (or Smokers Express Airlines) was a [[Cocoa Beach, Florida]]-based company that would have provided [[inflight smoking|smoking flights]] to destinations within the [[United States]].  Founded in 1993 by William Walts and George "Mickey" Richardson, the company never received enough funding to begin operations.

==Concept==
Upset not only by the non-smoking policy of most major airlines but also by the quality of other amenities such as food and [[in-flight entertainment]], Walts conceived the idea of a "smokers airline".  His company would not only allow smoking on flights, but encourage it by handing out free cigarettes and "full-size" ashtrays during flight.  The airline also advertised free headsets (for listening to in-flight entertainment) and "real food for real people", which consisted of [[hamburgers]], [[pizza]], and [[steaks]].

Because [[Federal Aviation Administration]] restrictions prohibit smoking on flights within the United States, Smokers Express was intended to be a membership-based airline.  Customers would have been required to join and pay a $25 yearly fee, and only persons age 21 or older would have been allowed to join. A side effect to this policy was a promise that the flights would be free of "screaming babies."

==Aircraft==
The company began by purchasing three [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[DC-9]] aircraft, with the intention of leasing 27 additional DC-9s.
The aircraft would have been renovated with a high-volume air recirculation system, as well as improved flame-retardant carpet.

==Routes==
The airline originally intended to fly to 11 different destinations, adding more as additional funding enabled. The planned initial destinations were:
*[[Las Vegas, Nevada]]
*[[Dallas]]/[[Ft. Worth]], [[Texas]]
*[[Houston, Texas]]
*[[New Orleans, Louisiana]]
*[[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]
*[[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]
*[[Newark, New Jersey]]
*[[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]
*[[Orlando, Florida]]
*[[Titusville, Florida]]
*[[Miami, Florida]]

The first flight would have taken place on August 16, 1993.

==Company structure==
Smokers Express was designed to be an employee-owned company.  It relied mostly on membership dues and ticket sales, however, no tickets were ever sold.  The company did not advertise directly, but relied on word-of-mouth, various articles and TV news references.  Despite what the company perceived as a positive response to their concept, it failed to raise enough funds to begin operations.

'''Squamous-cell carcinoma of the vagina''' is a potentially invasive type of [[cancer]] that forms in the tissues of the [[vagina]].  Though uncommon, [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous-cell cancer]] of the vagina (SCCV) is the most common type of [[vaginal cancer]]. It is further subdivided inot the following subtypes: keratinizing, nonkeratinizing, basaloid, and warty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dynamed.com/topics/dmp~AN~T114827/Squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-vagina|title=Squamous-cell Carcinoma of the Vagina|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dynamed.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms in [[squamous cells]], the thin, flat cells lining the vagina. Squamous cell vaginal cancer spreads slowly and usually stays near the vagina, but may spread to the lungs, liver, or bone. This is the most common type of vaginal cancer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/vaginal/patient/vaginal-treatment-pdq|title=Vaginal Cancer Treatment|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCCV accounts for approximately 85% of vaginal cancer cases and initially spreads superficially within the vaginal wall. It can later invade other vaginal tissues. The carcinoma can [[Metastasis|metastasize]] to the lungs, and less frequently in liver, bone, or other sites. SCC of the vagina is associated with a high rate of infection with oncogenic strains of [[Human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV) and has many risk factors in common with [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/vaginal/hp/vaginal-treatment-pdq|title=Vaginal Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version, Incidence and Mortality|last=|first=|date=|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
SCCV may not cause early signs or symptoms and may be found during a routine [[Pelvic examination|pelvic exam]] and [[Pap test]]. Signs and symptoms may be caused by other types of vaginal cancer or by other conditions:
* [[Vaginal bleeding|bleeding]] or [[Vaginal discharge|discharge]] not related to menstrual period
* [[Dyspareunia|pain during sexual intercourse]]
* [[Pelvic pain|pain in the pelvic area]]
* lump in the vagina
* [[Dysuria|pain when urinating]]
* [[constipation]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Risks==
* [[multiple sex partners]]
* age &gt; 60 years
* [[smoking]]
* human papillomavirus ([[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV) infection]]
* early age at first intercourse&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis includes a complete assessment of [[medical history]] and physical examination. A pelvic exam is typically performed. Other diagnostic procedures used are the pap test, [[colposcopy]] and [[biopsy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other procedures are used to aid in diagnosis: [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]], [[CT scan]] (CAT scan), [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] (magnetic resonance imaging), [[Positron emission tomography|PET scan]] (positron emission tomography scan), and [[cystoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/vaginal/patient/vaginal-treatment-pdq#section/_26|title=Stages of Vaginal Cancer|last=|first=|date=|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Those most affected are:
*older women
**peak incidence 60-79 years
**&lt; 15% in women &lt; 50 years old
**&lt; 10% in women &lt; 40 years old
*Fifty percent of SCCV associated with [[hysterectomy]]
*Incidence may increase with [[pelvic organ prolapse]]
* More prevalent in black and Hispanic women
*accounts for 80%-90% of all vaginal cancers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends upon the following:
* stage and size of the cancer
* Whether the cancer is close to other organs that may be damaged by treatment
* Whether the patient has a [[uterus]] or has had a hysterectomy
* Whether the patient has had past [[Radiation therapy|radiation treatment]] to the pelvis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">The '''strontium unit''' is a [[Physical unit|unit]] used to measure the amount of [[radioactivity]] from [[strontium]]-90, a [[radionuclide]] found in [[nuclear fallout]], in a subject's body. Since the [[human]] body absorbs strontium as if it were [[calcium]], incorporating it into the [[skeleton]], its presence is very common. One strontium unit is equal to one [[picocurie]] from strontium-90 per [[gram]] of calcium (37 [[becquerel]]s per kilogram) in the subject's skeleton.

The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] holds that the maximum safe measure of strontium-90 in a person is one hundred strontium units (3700 Bq/kg). The average [[United States|American]] is estimated to have three to four strontium units.

The strontium unit was formerly known briefly as the '''sunshine unit''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctor Warns of Atom War Results|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1MFIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2gENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4333,3366520&amp;dq=sunshine-units&amp;hl=en|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=Meriden Journal, via Google News|date=3 June 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electromagnetic Radiation Effects Addressed by Canadian Hospital|url=http://ivn.us/2012/06/24/electromagnetic-radiation-effects-canadian-hospital/|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=IVN.us|date=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Pluto|url=http://www.merkle.com/pluto/pluto.html|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term promoted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] until public ridicule brought about its disuse. (Among the sources of this outcry was a [[George Carlin]] performance, released on the CD ''[[Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics]]'', during a passage on governmental euphemisms for dangerous or unethical activities: "The Pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation in something they call 'sunshine units'!")

This concept was first presented as "the third state" by the scholar of former Soviet Union, Berkman, in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ongfujian.com.sg/health.php#top Health Management of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Help You Get Rid of Sub-health (2010). Retrieved March 25, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also interpreted as different terms like "intermediate state", "grey state" or "a general [[malaise]]". Sub-health is a term which is widely used by [[Chinese people]], or in connection with [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM).&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beijing.ufh.com.cn/en/health-information/articles/98/Sub-health/|title=Beijing United - Sub-health|last=Cai|first=Lang|date=1 August 2011|publisher=United Family Healthcare|accessdate=18 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080710/http://beijing.ufh.com.cn/en/health-information/articles/98/Sub-health/|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feel that the notion of SHS has been invented to sell people medical products.&lt;ref name="Huáng jiànshǐ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xys.org/xys/ebooks/others/science/dajia11/baojian4.txt|script-title=zh:世上本无"亚健康" 只因此词有"金砖"|last=Huáng|first=Jiànshǐ|date=April 2010|language=Chinese|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms considered indicators of SHS include aches, [[Fatigue (medical)#Chronic fatigue|chronic fatigue]], [[indigestion]], [[sleep disorders]], [[Nasal congestion|congestion]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[distraction]], [[nausea]], and poor mood.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.apdnews.com/news/27522.html|title=97% HK citizens suffer from "suboptimal health" symptoms: survey|last=Lin|first=Alyssa|date=4 June 2013|work=Asia Pacific Daily|accessdate=18 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014827/http://en.apdnews.com/news/27522.html|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suboptimal Health Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epmajournal.com/content/supplementary/1878-5085-5-4-s1.pdf|title=Suboptimal Health Survey|work=EPMA Journal|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis&lt;ref name="Li2013"/&gt;==
SHS was measured by the suboptimal health questionnaire (SHSQ-25) including 25 items.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each subject was asked to rate a specific statement on a five-point Likert-type scale, based on how often they suffered various specific complaints in the preceding 3 months: (1) never or almost never, (2) occasionally, (3) often, (4) very often, and (5) always. The raw scores of 1 to 5 on the questionnaire were recoded as 0 to 4. SHS scores were calculated for each respondent by summing the ratings for the 25 items. A high score represents a high level of SHS (poor health). The Cronbach’s α coefficient of the SHSQ-25 was 0.91, indicating good internal consistency. The final questionnaire congregated into a score (SHSQ-25) which could significantly distinguish among several abnormal conditions and could be used as a translational medicine instrument for health measuring in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Wei|last2=Yan|first2=Yuxiang|date=2012-11-14|title=Suboptimal health: a new health dimension for translational medicine|url=http://clintransmed.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2001-1326-1-28|journal=Clinical and Translational Medicine|language=En|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1186/2001-1326-1-28|issn=2001-1326|pmc=3561061|pmid=23369267|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criteria for diagnosis of subhealth was defined as the presence of ≥ 1 of the following abnormalities: body mass index ≥ 25&amp;nbsp;kg/m2 or waist circumference ≥ 102&amp;nbsp;cm in men and 88&amp;nbsp;cm in women; systolic pressure 120-139 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure 80-89 mmHg; serum triglyceride level ≥ 150&amp;nbsp;mg/dL and/or total cholesterol level ≥ 200&amp;nbsp;mg/dL and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level &lt; 40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL in men and 50&amp;nbsp;mg/dL in women; serum glucose level 110–125&amp;nbsp;mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2; levels of liver enzymes in liver function tests between 41-59 U/L, or with fatty liver disease but &lt; 33% of affected hepatocytes; levels of oxidative stress biomarkers beyond the reference range of 95%; or problems with both sleep quality and psychological state.&lt;ref name="Li2013"/&gt;

==Population Health Status==
Despite significant advances in medicine and public health, suboptimal health persists.  Understanding health on a population level is an approach that seeks to improve the health of an entire population or subpopulation, to unravel variations in health outcomes, and to identify effective strategies for reducing or eliminating inequities both within and between population groups. 
Any foundation for understanding population health considers: 1) how population health is defined and measured; 2) the biological, behavioral, cultural, social, and environmental determinants of population health; 3) the role of healthcare and economic decision-making in population health; 4) and intervention and policy strategies for improving population health.

The parameters of measuring what we term '[[health]]' and '[[Well-being|wellness]]' is a matter of ongoing health research and debate.  Definition of terms is foundational, covering [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|alternative medicine]], [[Workplace wellness|workforce wellness]], [[Wellness (medicine)|freedom from disease]], and the U.N. definition of the highest achievable standard of individual and population [[well-being]].

Engineers have proposed digital, handheld methods for many of those individuals to closely monitor their own health conditions, hoping to get need demands of both SHS groups and [[aging]] populations. Such a proposed healthcare system, which can provide self-monitoring of one's health status, early warning of disease, and even an instant report of the physiological signal analysis for individuals, is becoming more and more popular among many Chinese persons for whom it could be made available, in part because its theoretical foundations are based in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[H. Ding, J. He, and W. Wang, "The sub-health evaluation based on the modern diagnostic technique of traditional Chinese medicine," in Proc. Workshop Edu. Technol. Comput.

SHS is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease.

The SHSQ-25 is a self-rated questionnaire of perceived health complaints, which can be used as a new instrument for predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM). An ongoing longitudinal SHS cohort survey (China Sub-optimal Health Cohort Study, COACS) consisting of 50,000 participants will provide a powerful health trial to use SHSQ-25 for its application to PPPM through patient stratification and therapy monitoring using innovative technologies of predictive diagnostics and prognosis: an effort of paradigm shift from reactive to predictive medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Wei|last2=Russell|first2=Alyce|last3=Yan|first3=Yuxiang|date=2014-01-01|title=Traditional Chinese medicine and new concepts of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine in diagnosis and treatment of suboptimal health|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1878-5085-5-4|journal=EPMA Journal|volume=5|pages=4|doi=10.1186/1878-5085-5-4|issn=1878-5085|pmc=3926271|pmid=24521056}}&lt;/ref&gt;  one study also confirmed the association between chronic psychosocial stress and SHS, indicating that improving the psychosocial work environment may reduce SHS and then prevent chronic diseases effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yan|first=Yu-Xiang|last2=Dong|first2=Jing|last3=Liu|first3=You-Qin|last4=Zhang|first4=Jie|last5=Song|first5=Man-Shu|last6=He|first6=Yan|last7=Wang|first7=Wei|date=2015-01-02|title=Association of suboptimal health status with psychosocial stress, plasma cortisol and mRNA expression of glucocorticoid receptor α/β in lymphocyte|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2014.999233|journal=Stress|volume=18|issue=1|pages=29–34|doi=10.3109/10253890.2014.999233|issn=1025-3890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SHS is associated with endothelial dysfunction.

The Gordie Foundation was created in memory of 18-year-old Gordie Bailey who died on September 17, 2004 following a [[hazing]] incident involving [[Short-term effects of alcohol|alcohol]] in the  Chi Psi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Chi Psi Central Office - The Chi Psi Educational Trust | title = About Chi Psi | publisher = Chi Psi Fraternity | url = http://www.chipsi.org/?page=AboutChiPsi | accessdate = 2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] house at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]] campus in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Actress [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]] is the Honorary Spokesperson for The Gordie Foundation.

In the summer of 2010, the Gordie Foundation and the [[University of Virginia]] Center for Alcohol and Substance Education merged to form the Gordie Center for Substance Abuse Prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Gordie Center for Substance Abuse Prevention | title = About Us | work = The Gordie Center for Substance Abuse Prevention | publisher = Gordie Center | date = Last Modified: Wednesday, 19-Feb-2014  | url = http://gordiecenter.studenthealth.virginia.edu/about | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; All operations that were previously under the Gordie Foundation are currently maintained through the Gordie Center, now located in Charlottesville, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [http://news.virginia.edu/content/marian-anderfuren Anderfuren, Marian] | title = Gordie Foundation Merges With U.Va.'s Alcohol and Substance Education Center | publisher = UVA Today (University of Virginia) | date = September 16, 2010 | url = http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=12897 | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On the evening of September 16, 2004, '''Lynn Gordon Bailey Jr. ("Gordie")''' and twenty-six other Chi Psi [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining a fraternity or sorority|pledges]] dressed in coats and ties for [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining a fraternity or sorority|"bid night"]] were taken blindfolded to the [[Arapaho National Forest|Arapaho Roosevelt National Forest]] where they were told to consume four 1.75 liter bottles of 80-proof Ten High Bourbon Whiskey and six 1.5 liter bottles of Carlo Rossi wine around a bonfire in 30 minutes. Older active fraternity men stated to the group that “no one is leaving here until these are gone.” When the group returned to the Fraternity Lodge, Gordie was [[Short-term effects of alcohol#Effect by dosage|visibly intoxicated]] and did not drink any more. He was placed on a couch to “sleep it off” at approximately 11:00pm. Later in the evening, while Gordie was [[Short-term effects of alcohol#Effect by dosage|unconscious]], his brothers used permanent markers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yFlo-3APxI |title=Passed Out with shoes on |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Pledge auction|scrawl demeaning sayings and pictures]] on all parts of his body. Gordie was left alone for [[Golden hour (medicine)|10 hours]] before he was found dead&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gordiescall.org/gordies-story&lt;/ref&gt; the next morning, face down on the floor.

==Litigation==
Following Gordie's death, his mother Leslie Lanahan brought legal action against the Alpha Psi Delta chapter of Chi Psi, located in Boulder, Colorado. Following four and a half years of negotiation, the two sides agreed to a settlement in March 2009. Among the terms, Chi Psi agreed that Gordie had indeed been hazed by brothers of the chapter on the evening of September 16, 2004. The national fraternity also agreed to use Gordie's story in all pledge education about hazing, as well as to require that all chapters, or "Alphas", recruit a live-in adult supervisor. In accordance with a request by Chi Psi, details of the financial portion of the settlement cannot be disclosed.

==Biography==
[[Image:Gordie hires.jpg|thumb|Gordie Bailey (1986-2004)]]

Gordie was 18 years old when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E0D71F30F935A1575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=lynn%20gordon%20bailey&amp;st=cse |title=Paid Notice - Deaths BAILEY, LYNN GORDON, JR. - Paid Death Notice - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=2004-09-26 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month earlier, he had enrolled as a freshman at the University of Colorado [[Leeds School of Business]]. In his four weeks at the University, Gordie had been named to the club [[lacrosse]] team and had become a pledge at Chi Psi Fraternity. Gordie went to Colorado after three years at [[Deerfield Academy]] in [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]] where he participated in athletics, music and drama. In his senior year he was co-captain of the varsity football team playing both middle linebacker and offensive guard. He also started at defense on the school’s New England championship lacrosse team.

While a senior, Gordie mentored younger students as a [[Proctor]] in an underclass dormitory. In his spare time, he and his fellow Proctors made humorous videos with their Proctees. Prior to attending Deerfield, Gordie attended [[St. Mark's School of Texas|St. Mark’s School of Texas]] in Dallas and [[The Lamplighter School]], also in Dallas.

==The GORDIEcheck==
The Gordie Foundation focuses on public awareness of the consequences of alcohol abuse among students. For example, alcohol-related incidents claim the lives of over 1700 students annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/NIAAACollegeMaterials/magandprev.aspx |title=Magnitude of Alcohol-Related Mortality And Morbidity Among U.S. College Students Ages 18–24: Changes from 1998 to 2001 |publisher=collegedrinkingprevention.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gordie Foundation encourages students to take responsibility for their friends. For example, the Foundation encourages students to "save a life" and "make the call" for help to prevent another senseless tragedy. Another of their educational phrases is, "Friends Check Friends." I.e., never leave an intoxicated person alone to "sleep off" the effects of alcohol. The amount of alcohol it takes to pass out is dangerously close to the amount it takes to kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factsontap.org/factsontap/naked_truth/booze_truths.htm |title=prevention and intervention program for high school and college students |publisher=Facts on Tap |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use the acronym '''PUBS''' to check for signs of alcohol poisoning:  '''P'''uking while passed out, '''U'''nresponsive (to pinching or stimuli), '''B'''reathing (irregular, slow or none at all), '''S'''kin (cold, blue or clammy).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gordiescall.org/education/alcohol&lt;/ref&gt;  Any of these should trigger a call to 911, as should a slowing in the heart rate or respiratory rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gordiescall.org/education/alcohol&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gordie's Call Campaign==
''Gordie's Call'' is a national campaign with a mission to prevent alcohol abuse and hazing through the use of peer intervention among young adults. The primary campaign initiative is to eliminate deaths from alcohol abuse and hazing, challenge attitudes about the true risks of these activities, and to promote healthy campus environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gordiescall.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==''HAZE'' the documentary==
The Gordie Foundation, with director [[Pete Schuermann]], has produced both a full-length and a shortened, content edited [[documentary film]] entitled HAZE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HAZE: The Movie | publisher = Gordie Center for Substance Abuse Prevention at the University of Virginia | date = Last Modified: 19-Feb-2014 | url = http://www.gordiescall.org/haze-the-movie | accessdate = 2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; that explores the environment on today’s college campuses that leads to alcohol-related deaths like Gordie's. Highlighting many aspects of Gordie’s story, the film illuminates the heavily veiled and largely misunderstood realm of college [[drinking games|binge and competitive drinking]] and [[hazing]], and the continually mounting risks associated with such behavior. HAZE features graphic and disturbing scenes of the real-life consequences of alcohol abuse and acts of hazing perpetrated against young men and women by their peers. Psychologists, researchers, college student affairs personnel and students themselves offer valuable insights into the environment many college students and even high school students encounter during what are intended to be formative and enlightening years. What emerges is evidence of an unsettling trend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wechsler | first = H |author2=Lee JE |author3=Kuo M |author4=Seibring M |author5=Nelson TF |author6=Lee H  | title = Trends in College Binge Drinking During a Period of Increased Prevention Efforts: Findings From 4 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study Surveys: 1993-2001 | journal = Journal of American College Health | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 203–217 | year = 2002 | url = http://archive.sph.harvard.edu/cas/Documents/trends/ | accessdate = 2014-02-26 | doi=10.1080/07448480209595713}}&lt;/ref&gt; toward recklessness and overindulgence which most students regard with ambivalence.

HAZE has been selected to be screened at several prestigious film festivals, including its premiere at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} It has also been selected to be shown in 2009 at the [[Dallas International Film Festival]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the [[Newport Beach Film Festival]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} and the [[Indie Spirit Film Festival]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. In 2011, it was shown at the [[Virginia Film Festival]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].

==National GORDIEday==
National GORDIEday&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gordiescall.org/education/nationalgordieday&lt;/ref&gt; is held annually in the fall, with the seventh-annual event scheduled to take place on September 25, 2014 in conjunction with National Hazing Prevention Week&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalhazingpreventionweek.com&lt;/ref&gt; events center on spreading awareness about the dangers of binge and competitive drinking, the warning signs of alcohol poisoning, and the inherent risks involved with hazing. Events include handing out awareness materials, posting flyers, screening the documentary HAZE and hosting speakers.

'''Trifocals''' are [[glasses|eyeglasses]] with [[lens (optics)|lenses]] that have three regions which correct for distance, intermediate (arm's length), and near vision. [[John Isaac Hawkins]] developed the trifocal lens in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Harold A.|title=The Ophthalmic Assistant: A Text for Allied and Associated Ophthalmic Personnel|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4557-3346-0|page=205|edition=9th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I3oH--MnVYC&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=john%20hawkins%20ben%20franklin%20lenses&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trifocals are mostly used by people with advanced [[presbyopia]] who have been prescribed 2 [[diopter]]s or more of reading addition.  The intermediate addition is normally half the reading addition.  So, for someone with a distance prescription of −4 diopters and a reading addition of +3, the reading portion of their trifocals would have a net power of −1, and the intermediate segment would be −2.5 diopters.  

Trifocal lenses are made in similar styles to [[bifocals]], but with an additional segment for intermediate vision above the reading section.  A common style is the 7×28 flat-top or D-shaped segment, 28 mm wide, with a 7 mm high intermediate segment.  Larger intermediate segments are available, and are particularly useful for people who spend a lot of time using computers.

Trifocals are becoming rarer as more people choose to wear [[progressive lens]]es.
