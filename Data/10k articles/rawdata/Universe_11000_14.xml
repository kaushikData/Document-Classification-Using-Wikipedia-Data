'''Ashok Sinha''' (born 8 November 1964) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Environmentalism|environmental]] campaigner.

==Scientific and policy background==
Sinha studied [[physics]] at the [[University of Bristol]] and completed his Ph.D. in renewable energy at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Following this he spent a number of years pursuing research into [[History of climate change science|climate change science]] at Reading University and Imperial College, producing a variety of publications on climate feedback process. He then moved into policy analysis with [[Forum for the Future]] working on climate change-renewable energy policy proposals.

==Campaigning==
Ashok Sinha was one of the group of UK NGO activists who founded the UK [[Make Poverty History campaign]], serving on its governing body (and chairing its Policy &amp; Lobbying Group) which he did whilst he was leading the [[Jubilee Debt Campaign]].

In 2005 he became Director of the newly founded Stop Climate Chaos coalition (SCC), now called the [http://www.theclimatecoalition.org/ Climate Coalition]. SCC gained a high-profile with its [[I Count]] campaign (winner of two International Green Awards, 2007), which was the UK's campaign partner with the UK [[Live Earth]] event. Stop Climate Chaos was also instrumental in helping to secure the UK's Climate Change Act, helping to put a brake on the building of new unabated coal-fired power stations, and for delivering [[Stop Climate Chaos#The Wave|The Wave]] (ahead of the UN climate summit in Copenhagen) which was at the time the biggest single climate change campaign event ever held globally.

In a voluntary capacity Sinha has also been a Board member (and Vice Chair) of Amnesty International UK and of the London Cycling Campaign.

He was listed as one of the UK's top 100 Ethical Heroes by New Consumer magazine in 2007, one of the UK's top 100 environmentalists by the Independent on Sunday in 2008, and has been listed annually as one of London's 1000 most influential people by the Evening Standard between 2012 and 2016.

==Current activities==
Ashok Sinha is currently Chief Executive of the [http://www.lcc.org.uk London Cycling Campaign], leading the sustainable transport charity's successful Love London, Go Dutch and Space for Cycling campaigns. He is also currently the Chair of the [https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/london-sustainable-development-commission London Sustainable Development Commission] and a trustee of the [https://www.creeksidecentre.org.uk/ Creekside Education Trust].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">'''Automated fueling''' or '''robotic fueling''' involves the use of [[automation]] to remove human labor from the fueling process. The fueling is performed by a robotic arm, which opens the car's flap, unscrews the cap, picks up the fuel nozzle and inserts it into the tank opening. It requires the contours and dimensions of the fuel cap to be present in the database.

[[File:Electricity Grid Schematic English.svg|thumb|right|200px|General layout of electricity networks (typical).]]
'''Availability Based Tariff''' (ABT) is a frequency based pricing mechanism applicable in [[India]] for unscheduled electric power transactions. The ABT falls under [[electricity market]] mechanisms to charge and regulate power to achieve short term and long term network stability as well as incentives and dis-incentives to grid participants against deviations in committed supplies as the case may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC of ABT |accessdate=14 August 2014 |url=http://www.nrldc.org/docs/documents/Articles/abc_abt.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212544/http://www.nrldc.org/docs/documents/Articles/abc_abt.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
ABT Mechanism in [[Electricity sector in India]] is adopted since the year 2000 and in a few other countries for pricing bulk power across various stakeholders. ABT concerns itself with the tariff structure for bulk power and is aimed at bringing about more responsibility and accountability in power generation and consumption through a scheme of incentives and disincentives. As per the notification, ABT was initially made applicable to only central generating stations having more than one SEB/State/Union Territory as its beneficiary. Through this scheme, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission [[Central Electricity Regulatory Commission|(CERC)]] looks forward to improve the quality of power and curtail the following disruptive trends in power sector:

*Unacceptably rapid and high frequency deviations (from 50&amp;nbsp;Hz) causing damage and disruption to large scale industrial consumers
*Frequent grid disturbances resulting in generators tripping, [[power outage]]s and power grid disintegration.

The ABT scheme has now been expanded to cover the Intrastate systems as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= MERC Order on ABT in State of Maharashtra|accessdate=14 August 2014|url=http://www.mercindia.org.in/pdf/Ord_17_05_2007_CNo_42_of_2006.zip}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power generation or grid capacity has increased substantially in last fifteen years particularly after the [[Electricity Act (2003)|Electricity Act 2003]] by introduction of competition and unbundling of vertically integrated utilities (SEBs) into separate entities in charge of [[electricity generation]], [[electricity transmission]], and [[electricity distribution]]. Deregulation and competition has facilitated participation of private sector on large scale in electricity generation, transmission and distribution. Of late, [[Electricity sector in India|Indian electricity sector]] is transforming from perennial deficit to surplus electricity availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://indianpowersector.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Report-OPEN-ACCESS-IN-INDIA.pdf|title=  Open Access in Indian power sector|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume of purchased electricity that could not be transmitted to the buyers due to transmission lines congestion is only 0.3% of the total electricity consumed in the financial year 2013-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tables 1 &amp; 25; Report on Short-term Power Market in India, 2014-15|accessdate=4 October 2015|url=http://www.cercind.gov.in/2015/MMC/AnnualReport14-15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It means that the actual power deficit in India is less than 1% excluding under priced electricity demand. ABT/DSM mechanism needs improvements to address the requirements of all stake holders (including final electricity consumers) for encouraging least cost electricity generation / tariff based on demand verses availability in the grid.&lt;ref name=abt&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789313/Electricity-Online-Trading Electricity online trading in India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iefe.unibocconi.it/wps/allegatiCTP/RR_No_2_ERI_viola_1.pdf|title=  Integrating European Electricity Markets|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a need of well represented [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation|Electric Reliability Organization]] to involve all the grid participants for framing guidelines for power system operation and accreditation which is presently looked after by the [[Central Electricity Authority (India) | CEA]]

Bulk power purchasers can buy electricity on daily basis for short, medium and long term duration from [[Reverse auction|reverse e-auction]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/government-asks-states-to-purchase-short-term-power-through-reverse-e-auction/articleshow/51684372.cms|title= Government asks states to purchase short term power through reverse e-auction|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reverse e-auction, availability based tariff /Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM) is applied to settle the failed commitments by the electricity sellers or buyers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vidyutpravah.in/ |title=Vidyut Pravah  |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iexindia.com/products.aspx?id=15&amp;mid=2 |title=IEX Power Trading Process Flow  |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electricity prices transacted under reverse e-auction facility are far less than the prices agreed under bilateral agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/reverse-e-auction-lowering-power-prices-ind-ra/articleshow/52433857.cms|title= Reverse e-auction lowering power prices.

For those power generators who have made power purchase agreements (PPA) with Discoms and need not participate in day ahead market (DAM) trading on daily basis, the pecking order among the power generators in a state is called merit order power generation where the lesser variable generation cost electricity producer is selected out of the available generators to maintain the normal grid frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://meritindia.in/ |title= Merit Order Despatch of Electricity for Rejuvenation of Income and Transparency|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ABT details ==

*What is availability?
[[Availability]], for the purpose of the ABT order means the readiness of the generating station to deliver ex-bus output expressed as a percentage of its ex-bus [[Power rating|rated capacity (MCR)]]. Electricity is a commodity whose cost of storing is more than its production cost. The most economical method for electricity generation, transmission and distribution is [[Just-in-Time Manufacturing|just in time production]] where the availability and reliability of the entire system shall be very high to meet the unpredictable electricity demand on minute to minute basis.

* How is availability calculated?
Availability of thermal generating station for any period shall be the percentage ratio of average Sent Out Capability (SOC) for all the time blocks during that period and the rated MCR / SOC of generating station. The [[SAIDI]] (System Average Interruption Duration Index) is commonly used as a reliability indicator by electric power utilities.
&lt;!-- If someone could write the formula it would be good. Not an expert in writing formula in Wiki --&gt;

* Is unified electric grid of India, a [[smart grid]]?
During the fiscal year 2014-15, 1,043 billion KWh of electricity (three times that of [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]]) was supplied and met 138,215 MW maximum peak load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nldc.in/attachments/article/265/Monthly%20Report%20April%202015.pdf |title=April, 2015 Monthly report, National Load despatch Centre (NLDC) |accessdate=25 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527151507/http://www.nldc.in/attachments/article/265/Monthly%20Report%20April%202015.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total installed generation capacity is 267,637 MW at the end of fiscal year 2014–15. Its size is of global scale comparable only with [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity|EU grid]], [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation|NERC grid]], [[State Grid Corporation of China|China electricity grid]] and [[Russian electricity grid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Electricity sector in India#Electricity transmission and distribution]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Indian grid lacks the basic features of smart grid for optimum use of its deployed resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-can-achieve-1-65-billion-units-of-electricity-next-year-piyush-goyal/articleshow/53103685.cms|title= India can achieve 1,650 billion units of electricity next year, Piyush Goyal |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the effectiveness criteria of a smart grid?
Generally the top 10% of the unrestricted daily peak load (MW) persists only for 1% (15 minutes) of the total duration and its energy share (MWHr) is of the order of 0.2% of the daily energy supplied. Instead of generating this substantial extra power for a short duration, automatic selective [[demand response|load shedding]] can be implemented on bulk consumers with [[Standby generator|standby power facility]] to eliminate the load spikes without inconvenience to most of the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Control of the National Grid (Great Britain)#Frequency Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128365808|title= How Smart Is The Smart Grid?|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, working captive power plants start feeding to the grid by giving break to the captive power supply up to a maximum of 30 minutes duration. The standby generator / captive power owner would be paid for providing [[National Grid Reserve Service|grid reserve ancillary services]].

With an installed capacity of proper mix of base load and [[Load following power plant|variable load generation]] capability (excluding low [[Capacity factor|capacity utilisation]] or [[intermittent energy source|secondary power]] or negative [[Load profile|load]] type on daily basis such as solar, wind, etc without storage) equivalent to the unrestricted annual maximum peak load, the most effective and economical smart grid shall be able to cater more than 99 [[percentile]] duration unrestricted load/demand on daily basis with 100% stable operation of the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk:Availability-based tariff]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68530.pdf|title=National Study by NREL-Pathways to Integrate 175 Gigawatts of Renewable Energy into India's Electric Grid, Vol I|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of smart grid is to supply required electricity at optimum cost with reliability to the final consumers.

== Scheduling ==

*Each day of 24 hrs starting from 00.00 hours be divided into 96 time blocks of 15 minutes each.
*Each generating station is to make advance declaration of its capacity for generation in terms of MWh delivery ex-bus for each time block of the next day. In addition, the total ex-bus MWh which can actually be delivered during the day will also be declared in case of hydro stations. These shall constitute the basis of generation scheduling.
*While declaring the capability, the generator should ensure that the capability during peak hours is not less than that during other hours.
*The Scheduling as referred to above should be in accordance with the operating procedures in force.
*Based on the above declaration, the Regional Load Dispatch Centre(RLDC) shall communicate to the various beneficiaries their respective shares of the available capability.
*After the beneficiaries give their requisition for power based on the generation schedules, the RLDC shall prepare the generation schedules and drawal schedules for each time block after taking into account technical limitations and transmission constraints.
*The schedule of actual generation shall be quantified on ex-bus basis, whereas for beneficiaries, scheduled drawals shall be quantified at their respective receiving points.
*For calculating the drawal schedule for beneficiaries, the transmission losses shall be apportioned in proportion to their drawals.
*In case of any forced outage of a unit, or in case of any transmission bottleneck, RLDC will revise the schedules. The revised schedules will become effective from the 4th time block, counting the time block in which the revision is advised by the generator, to be the 1st one.
*It is also permissible for the generators and the beneficiaries to revise their schedules during a day, but any such revisions shall be effective only from the 6th time block reckoned in the manner as already stated.

==ABT drawbacks==
[[File:Reservepower.png|320px|thumb|right|An idealized representation of the four kinds of reserve power and the time intervals after an unexpected failure that they are in use.&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Kirby, [https://uc-ciee.org/downloads/spinning_rpt_tm200319.pdf Spinning Reserve from Responsive Loads], Oak Ridge National Laboratory, March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* As per DSM / UI procedure, the incentives and penalty to the grid participants are charged based on the average grid frequency in a time block of 15 minutes duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiapowertrading.info/real-time-power-grid-frequency/|title= Real Time Power Grid Frequency|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dsm&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cercind.gov.in/2014/regulation/noti132.pdf|title= Deviation Settlement Mechanism and related matters, CERC, GoI|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a time block, it is normal that frequency goes above rated 50&amp;nbsp;Hz frequency and comes down below rated frequency as the number of frequency excursions above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz are more than 100 in a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srldc.org/var/ftp/reports/freq/2015/Aug15/05-08-2015-freq.pdf |title=Typical daily frequency graph of Indian grid |accessdate=6 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104052/http://www.srldc.org/var/ftp/reports/freq/2015/Aug15/05-08-2015-freq.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the average frequency in a time block remains close to the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz without giving much benefit in the applicable UI tariff for a Discom who is consuming the surplus power available in the grid or generators with valid scheduling who is reducing the generation when frequency is above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Similarly, the generators and Discoms who are not adhering to grid discipline are not penalised with UI tariff in excess of normal tariff when average grid frequency in a time block is used for fixing UI/DSM charges. Each time block is further needs to be separated into two parts for application of UI charges. One for the duration the frequency is more than 50&amp;nbsp;Hz whose average frequency is considered for fixing UI/ DSM charges to consume the excess power in the grid or reduce excess power generation. Another for the duration the frequency is less than 50&amp;nbsp;Hz whose average frequency is considered for fixing UI/DSM charges to reduce over drawl and encourage additional power generation.
* Whenever distribution feeders from a substation are switched on after a break down or scheduled power cut, it should be done only when grid frequency is above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz such that it does not lead to steep drop in the frequency . The total numbers of feeders switching on, in a day are substantial at national level to cause load (≥ 500 MW) increase on the grid to cause wide fluctuations.
* The incentives and disincentives are prefixed  (annually/periodically) by the electricity regulator (CERC) for the variation in the grid frequency which may not reflect the actual situation temporally and spatially on day-to-day basis. There is a need to decide the electricity tariff by the grid participants (generators, discoms, transcos &amp; final consumers) on day-to-day basis for achieving further fine tuning.&lt;ref name=abt/&gt;
* The ABT mechanism aims to maintain grid frequency at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz but does not permit the grid participants to decide the optimum frequency within the permitted frequency band (say 49.20 to 50.80&amp;nbsp;Hz) on day-to-day basis.&lt;ref name=abt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/publications/entsoe/Operation_Handbook/Policy_1_final.pdf|title= ENTSO-E Operation Handbook Policy 1 (2009), Load frequency control &amp; performance,(refer last page)|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is required not to impose additional load shedding/power cuts when frequency is within the safe variation limits.&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt;
* [[Transmission system operator]] (TSO) is obliged to provide non-discriminatory transmission access to electricity generators and consumers in order to promote competition. ABT mechanism does not bring at par all the grid participants whether in private or central sector or state sector ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.financialexpress.com/article/fe-columnist/ease-trading-of-power/67089/|title= Ease trading of power|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ABT mechanism does not encourage to install the generating units at advantageous locations to offer least cost electricity to the final electricity consumers.&lt;ref name=abt/&gt; ABT mechanism is suitable in an electricity grid suffering from [[Rolling blackout|perennial power shortages]] to prevent overdrwals but it is not suitable for the grid with surplus electricity generation with non-discriminatory responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/power-minister-piyush-goyal-on-power-surplus-electricity/1/218807.html|title=Power Minister Piyush Goyal says power available for free | accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CERC regulation on [[Ancillary services (electric power)|ancillary services]] operations, are permitting only inter state power generating stations to provide these services which are discriminatory by not allowing rest of electricity generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://indianpowersector.com/2015/08/cerc-regulation-on-ancillary-services-operations-2015/|title= CERC regulation on Ancillary Services Operations, 2015|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every state is conducting independently [[load management]] to avoid overdrawal from other states by using mix of generation sources (ex: hydro power or peaking power plants) to adhere to their power drawal commitments on 15 minutes period basis in ABT mechanism. Thus hydro power stations are ending up to cater base load instead of peak load in non-monsoon months also (ex: Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, HP, J&amp;K, Uttarakhand, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srldc.org/DailyReport.aspx |title=Daily reports; Power supply position; SRLDC |accessdate=17 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717130132/http://www.srldc.org/DailyReport.aspx |archivedate=17 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; TSO is responsible to ensure the provision of reserves  (including [[spinning reserve]] for base load power plants by operating in frequency follow mode with upper &amp; lower generation caps) that will allow for sudden contingencies by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each grid trading block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/siemens-technology-is-helping-achieve-smooth-grid-integration-of-renewables-prashan-jain-siemens-ltd/60841650 |title=Siemens technology is helping achieve smooth grid integration of renewables |accessdate=27 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/10/04/world-first-technology-measures-electricity-grid-stability/ |title=World’s First Technology To Measure Electricity Grid Stability Announced |accessdate=7 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The available hydro power stations in a region/grid should be used to cater peaking load only at regional/national level. Using hydro power stations to cater peak load, would improve the peaking load capability of a regional/national grid and maintain safe grid frequency and network stability. The 24 hours duration of a day should be divided into four parts only (i.e. daytime peak load period, daytime off peak load period, nighttime peak load period and nighttime off peak load period) instead of 96 number 15 minutes periods for commercially settling the power transactions to cater better to the peak load requirements within the safe frequency range.
* Many [[List of power stations in India|gas turbine power stations]] are not operating due to perennial natural gas shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/generation/2015/October/tentative/tentative.html|title= Monthly generation report of power stations; October, 2015; CEA |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, many [[List of power stations in India#Diesel sets|DG sets (large &amp; medium sizes)]] are also idling throughout the year due to better availability of grid power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/gensets-add-up-to-under-half-of-installed-power-capacity/|title= Gensets add up to under half of installed power capacity; August, 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, these power generation units can be put to use for [[National Grid Reserve Service|grid reserve service]] either with liquid / gas fuels when there is unexpected tripping of operating power plants (five nos of 660 MW stations in a short duration) or tripping of a high voltage transmission line to prevent the grid operation below safe limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/commercial-opportunities-for-back-up-generation-and-load-reduction-via-national-grid-the-national-electricity-transmission-system-operator-netso-for-england-scotland-wales-and-offshore.html Commercial Opportunities for Back-Up Generation and Load Reduction via National Grid, the National Electricity Transmission System Operator (NETSO) for England, Scotland, Wales and Offshore.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.claverton-energy.com/turn-your-standby-generation-into-profit-making-assets.html|title= How to Turn Standby Generation Into Profit-Making Assets |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also allow all the available transmission lines at their full capacity in service without the need to maintain n+1 reserve capacity for meeting any break down and thus accruing savings in high voltage transmission losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/no-central-help-to-debt-ridden-state-run-power-discoms-piyush-goyal/articleshow/47579813.cms|title= Modification to existing transmission lines to double the capacity |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unified national grid stability can also be enhanced further by converting the existing back to back HVDC links into HVAC links bypassing the existing converter stations.

==Natural gas transmission==
The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) was created in the year 2005 to regulate downstream activities in the petroleum and natural gas sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/1167477996/legis1167478048_Legislative_Brief_PNGRB_Bill_2005.pdf|title= The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Bill, 2005|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is requirement of natural gas [[Transmission system operator|TSO]] also for imparting optimum use of the gas on hourly basis for meeting peak load in the electricity grid and minimize gas transport distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/exchange-in-the-works-to-discover-local-gas-price/articleshow/66340538.cms|title= Exchange in the works to discover local gas price |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available gas should be stored up to rated pressure in the pipe grid for generating power during peak demand hours on a daily (or more) basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/india-to-test-gas-fired-plants-as-peakers-to-smooth-power-grid/65418654|title= India to test gas-fired plants as ‘peakers’ to smooth power grid|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus available limited gas quantity is used to meet the peak electricity loads by all gas based power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cea.nic.in/resd_com_reports.html|title= Report on Indian electricity grid management requirements |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also gas should not be transported from a power deficit region to a power surplus region by the gas grid and generated power from gas there shall not be transmitted to the power deficit region to avoid misuse of the gas and power grid infrastructure.

In [[quantum mechanics]], a '''boson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|s|ɒ|n}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Longman pronunciation dictionary |first=John C. |last= Wells |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow, England |year=1990 |isbn=978-0582053830 }} entry "Boson"

|title= boson|website=Collins Dictionary |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/boson?showCookiePolicy=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a particle that follows [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. Bosons make up one of the two classes of [[elementary particle|particles]], the other being [[fermion]]s.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;{{cite book |author=Carroll, Sean |year=2007 |series=Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The dark side of the universe |title=Guidebook |at=Part&amp;nbsp;2, p.&amp;nbsp;43 |publisher=The Teaching Company |isbn=978-1598033502 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;boson: A force-carrying particle, as opposed to a matter particle (fermion).

Examples of bosons include [[fundamental particle]]s such as [[photons]], [[gluons]], and [[W and Z bosons]] (the four force-carrying [[gauge boson]]s of the [[Standard Model]]), the recently discovered [[Higgs boson]], and the hypothetical [[graviton]] of [[quantum gravity]]. Some composite particles are also bosons, such as [[meson]]s and stable nuclei of even [[mass number]] such as [[deuterium]] (with one proton and one neutron, atomic mass number = 2), [[helium-4]], or [[lead-208]];&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[even and odd atomic nuclei|Even-mass-number nuclides]], which comprise 153/254 = ~ 60% of all stable nuclides, are bosons, i.e. they have integer spin. Almost all (148 of the 153) are even-proton, even-neutron (EE) nuclides, which necessarily have spin&amp;nbsp;0 because of pairing. The remaining 5&amp;nbsp;stable bosonic nuclides are odd-proton or odd-neutron stable nuclides (see [[even and odd atomic nuclei#Odd proton, odd neutron]]); these odd–odd bosons are: {{nuclide|Hydrogen|2|link=yes}}, {{nuclide|Lithium|6|link=yes}},{{nuclide|Boron|10|link=yes}}, {{nuclide|Nitrogen|14|link=yes}} and [[Tantalum-180m|{{nuclide|Tantalum|180|m}}]]). All have nonzero integer spin.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some [[quasiparticle]]s (e.g. [[Cooper pair]]s, [[plasmon]]s, and [[phonon]]s).&lt;ref name="Jr.2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Poole, Charles P. Jr. |title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Condensed Matter Physics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXwrqM2hU0EC |date=11 March 2004 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-054523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130}}

An important characteristic of bosons is that their statistics do not restrict the number of them that occupy the same [[quantum state]]. This property is exemplified by helium-4 when it is cooled to become a [[superfluid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary
|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boson |article=boson |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |access-date=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike bosons, two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum space. Whereas the elementary particles that make up matter (i.e. [[lepton]]s and [[quark]]s) are fermions, the elementary bosons are force carriers that function as the 'glue' holding matter together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Sean |title=Explain it in 60&amp;nbsp;seconds: Bosons |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/january-2013/bosons |website=Symmetry Magazine |publisher=[[Fermilab]]/[[SLAC]] |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property holds for all particles with integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (s = 0, 1, 2, etc.) as a consequence of the [[spin–statistics theorem]].
When a gas of Bose particles is cooled down to temperatures very close to [[absolute zero]], then the [[kinetic energy]] of the particles decreases to a negligible amount, and they condense into the lowest energy level state. This state is called a [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]. It is believed that this property is the explanation of superfluidity.

==Types==
Bosons may be either [[elementary particle|elementary]], like [[photon]]s, or [[composite particle|composite]], like [[meson]]s.

While most bosons are composite particles, in the [[Standard Model of Particle Physics]] there are five bosons which are elementary:
* the [[Standard Model]] requires (at least) one ''[[scalar boson]]'' (spin=0)
:{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Higgs Boson}} [[Higgs boson]]

* the four ''[[vector boson]]s'' (spin=1) that are the [[gauge boson]]s for the [[Standard Model]]:
:{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Photon}} &amp;nbsp; [[Photon]]
:{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Gluon}} &amp;nbsp; [[Gluon]]s (eight different types)
:{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Z boson}} &amp;nbsp; [[W and Z bosons|Neutral weak boson]]
:{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|W boson+-}} &amp;nbsp; [[W and Z bosons|Charged weak boson]]s (two types)

There may be a sixth ''tensor boson'' (spin=2), the [[graviton]] (G), that would be the force-carrier for [[Gravitational force|gravity]]. It remains a hypothetical elementary particle since all attempts so far to incorporate [[Gravitational force|gravitation]] into the Standard Model have failed. If the graviton does exist, it must be a boson, and could conceivably be a gauge boson.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Despite being the carrier of the gravitational force which interacts with mass, the graviton is expected to have no mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composite bosons, such as [[helium]] nuclei, are important in [[superfluidity]] and other applications of [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s.

==Properties==
[[Image:Symmetricwave2.png|right|thumb|Symmetric wavefunction for a (bosonic) 2-particle state in an infinite square well potential.]]
Bosons differ from [[fermions]], which obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state (see [[Pauli exclusion principle]]).

Since bosons with the same energy can occupy the same place in space, bosons are often [[force carrier]] particles, including composite bosons such as [[mesons]]. Fermions are usually associated with [[matter]] (although in [[quantum mechanics]] the distinction between the two concepts is not clearcut).

Bosons are particles which obey Bose–Einstein statistics: When one swaps two bosons (of the same species), the [[wavefunction]] of the system is unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Srednicki, Mark |year=2007 |url=http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html |title=Quantum Field Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=28–29 |isbn=978-0-521-86449-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermions, on the other hand, obey Fermi–Dirac statistics and the Pauli exclusion principle: Two fermions cannot occupy the same [[quantum state]], accounting for the "rigidity" or "stiffness" of matter which includes fermions. Thus fermions are sometimes said to be the constituents of matter, while bosons are said to be the particles that transmit interactions (force carriers), or the constituents of [[radiation]]. The [[quantum field]]s of bosons are [[bosonic field]]s, obeying [[canonical commutation relation]]s.

The properties of [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s, [[superfluid]] helium-4 and Bose–Einstein condensates are all consequences of statistics of bosons. Another result is that the spectrum of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is a [[Planck spectrum]], one example of which is [[black-body]] radiation; another is the thermal radiation of the opaque early Universe seen today as [[microwave background radiation]]. 
Interactions between elementary particles are called [[fundamental interaction]]s. The fundamental interactions of [[virtual particle|virtual]] bosons with real particles result in all [[force]]s we know.

All known elementary and composite particles are bosons or fermions, depending on their spin: Particles with half-integer spin are fermions; particles with integer spin are bosons. In the framework of nonrelativistic [[quantum mechanics]], this is a purely empirical observation. In relativistic quantum field theory, the [[spin–statistics theorem]] shows that half-integer spin particles cannot be bosons and integer spin particles cannot be fermions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sakurai, J.J. |year=1994 |title=Modern Quantum Mechanics |edition=Revised |page=362 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=978-0-201-53929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In large systems, the difference between bosonic and fermionic statistics is only apparent at large densities — when their wave functions overlap. At low densities, both types of statistics are well approximated by [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], which is described by [[classical mechanics]].

==Elementary bosons==
{{Standard model of particle physics|cTopic=[[Elementary particle]]s}}
{{See also|List of particles#Bosons}}

All observed elementary particles are either fermions or bosons. The observed elementary bosons are all [[gauge boson]]s: photons, [[W and Z bosons]], gluons, except the [[Higgs boson]] which is a [[scalar boson]].
* Photons are the force carriers of the [[electromagnetic field]].
* W and Z bosons are the force carriers which mediate the [[weak interaction|weak force]].
* Gluons are the fundamental force carriers underlying the [[strong force]].
* [[Higgs boson]]s give W and Z bosons (and other particles) mass via the [[Higgs mechanism]]. Their existence was confirmed by [[CERN]] on 14 March 2013.

Finally, many approaches to quantum gravity postulate a force carrier for gravity, the [[graviton]], which is a boson of spin plus or minus two.

==Composite bosons==
{{see also|List of particles#Composite particles|label 1=List of particles: Composite particles}}

Composite particles (such as [[hadron]]s, [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and [[atom]]s) can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents. More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an even number of fermions is a boson, since it has integer spin.

Examples include the following:
*Any meson, since mesons contain one [[quark]] and one antiquark.
*The nucleus of a [[carbon-12]] atom, which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
*The [[helium-4]] atom, consisting of 2 protons, 2 neutrons and 2 electrons.
*The nucleus of deuterium, known as a [[deuteron]], and its anti-particle.

The number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.

==Quantum states==
Bose–Einstein statistics encourages identical bosons to crowd into one [[quantum state]], but not any state is necessarily convenient for it. Aside of statistics, bosons can [[interaction|interact]] – for example, helium-4 atoms are repulsed by [[intermolecular force]] on a very close approach, and if one hypothesizes their condensation in a [[position space|spatially-localized]] state, then gains from the statistics cannot overcome a prohibitive [[potential energy|force potential]]. A spatially-delocalized state (i.e. with low {{abs|[[wave function|''&amp;psi;''(''x'')]]}}) is preferable: if the [[number density]] of the condensate is about the same as in ordinary liquid or solid state, then the repulsive potential for the ''N''-particle condensate in such state can be no higher than for a liquid or a crystalline lattice of the same ''N'' particles described without quantum statistics. Thus, Bose–Einstein statistics for a material particle is not a mechanism to bypass physical restrictions on the [[density]] of the corresponding substance, and superfluid [[liquid helium]] has a density comparable to the density of ordinary [[liquid]] matter. Spatially-delocalized states also permit for a low [[momentum operator|momentum]] according to the [[uncertainty principle]], hence for low [[kinetic energy]]; this is why superfluidity and [[superconductivity]] are usually observed in low [[temperature]]s.

Photons do not interact with themselves and hence do not experience this difference in states where to crowd (see [[squeezed coherent state]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4816">[[File:Generic Small Braking Chopper.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Braking chopper]]
'''Braking choppers''', sometimes also referred to as '''braking units''', are used in the DC [[voltage]] intermediate circuits of [[frequency converters]] to control [[voltage]] when the load feeds energy back to the intermediate circuit.   This arises, for example, when a magnetized [[Electric motor|motor]] is being rotated by an overhauling load  and so functions as a [[Electrical generator|generator]] feeding power 
to the DC voltage intermediate circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Leonhard, 2001 "Control of Electrical Drives" Springer Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Krishnan, 2001 "Electric Motor Drives: Modeling, Analysis, and Control", Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;
They are an application of the [[chopper (electronic)| chopper principle]],  using on-off control of a switching device.

==Operation==
[[File:Braking chopper in use.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Large braking chopper installation]]

A braking chopper is an electrical switch that  limits the DC bus voltage by switching the braking energy to a resistor where the braking energy is converted to heat. Braking choppers are automatically activated when the actual DC bus voltage exceeds a specified level depending on the nominal voltage of the [[variable-frequency drive]]

==Benefits==
# Simple electrical construction and well-known technology.
# Low fundamental investment for chopper and [[resistor]].
# The chopper works even if AC supply is lost. Braking during main power loss may be required. E.g. in [[elevator]] or other safety related applications.

==Drawbacks==

# The braking energy is wasted if the heated air can not be used.
# The braking chopper and resistors require additional space.
# May require extra investments in the cooling and heat recovery system.
# Braking choppers are typically dimensioned for a certain cycle, e.g. 100% [[Electric power|power]] 1/10 minutes, long braking times require more accurate dimensioning of the braking chopper.
# Increased risk of fire due to hot resistor and possible dust and chemical components in the ambient air space.
# The increased DC bus [[voltage]] level during braking causes additional voltage stress on motor insulation.

==Applications==
Braking choppers are inappropriate when:
# The braking cycle is needed only occasionally.
# The amount of braking energy with respect to motoring energy is extremely small.
# The ambient air includes substantial amounts of dust or other potentially combustible or explosive or metallic components.

Braking choppers are appropriate when:
# The braking is continuous or regularly repeated.
# The total amount of braking energy is high in respect to the motoring energy needed.
# The instantaneous braking power is high, e.g. several hundred kW for several minutes.
# Braking operation is needed during main power loss.

==Flux braking==

[[Flux]] braking is another method, based on [[Electric motor|motor]] losses,  for handling an overrunning load. When braking in the drive system is needed, the motor flux and thus also the magnetizing [[Electric current|current]] component used in the motor are increased. The control of flux can be easily achieved through the [[direct torque control]] principle. With DTC the [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is directly controlled to achieve the desired torque and flux for the motor. During flux braking the motor is under DTC control which guarantees that braking can be made according to the specified speed ramp. This is very different to the [[DC injection braking]] typically used in drives. In the DC injection method DC current is injected to the motor so that control of the motor flux is lost during braking. The flux braking method based on DTC enables the motor to shift quickly from braking to motoring power when requested.

In flux braking the increased current means increased losses inside the motor. The braking power is therefore also increased although the braking power delivered to the frequency converter is not increased. The increased current generates increased losses in motor resistances. The higher the resistance value the higher the braking energy dissipation inside the motor. Typically, in low power motors(below 5&amp;nbsp;kW) the resistance value of the motor is relatively large in respect to the nominal current of the motor. The higher the power or the voltage of the motor the less the resistance value of the motor in respect to motor current.
In other words, flux braking is most effective in a low power motor.

'''China Airlines Flight 605''' (callsign "Dynasty 605") was a daily non-stop flight departing from [[Taipei]] at 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and arriving at [[Kai Tak Airport]] in [[Hong Kong]] at 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time. On November 4, 1993, the plane crashed after overrunning the runway on landing during a storm.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/world/293-rescued-in-hong-kong-after-jet-lands-in-the-water.html?scp=79&amp;sq=China%20Airlines%201993%20crash&amp;st=Search 293 Rescued in Hong Kong After Jet Lands in the Water]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. November 4, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first major loss of a Boeing 747-400.

== Accident ==
Flight 605, a [[Boeing 747-400]], touched down more than {{Convert|2,100|ft}} past the [[runway]]'s [[displaced threshold]], at a speed of {{convert|150|knot|km/h}}, following an IGS runway 13 approach.  [[1993 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Ira (Husing)|Tropical Storm Ira]] was generating {{convert|20|knot|km/h|adj=on}} [[crosswind]]s on that runway, gusting to {{convert|38|knot|km/h}}, from a heading of 070 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19931104-0 AS Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilots received several computer-generated [[wind shear]] and [[glide slope]] deviation warnings, and observed severe [[airspeed]] fluctuations, during the last mile before touchdown.  The [[auto brake]]s were set at only the number two level and then were turned off seconds after touchdown, when the captain elected to use manual braking and [[thrust reversal]].  The [[speedbrakes]] were extended briefly, but then retracted. This caused the plane to "float," making the brakes ineffective until the speed brakes were extended again.

The captain deliberately turned the plane to the left when he realized the plane would overrun the runway, and into the [[approach lighting system]] (ALS) for runway 31.  That action caused a "[[ground loop (aviation)|ground loop]]", making the plane slide off the left side of the [[runway]] into [[Victoria Harbour]], thereby preventing a collision with the ALS for runway 31.  It finally came to rest in shallow water, with a heading of almost 180 degrees out from the direction of runway 13.

A [[British Airways]] pilot had refused to make the approach to Kai Tak runway 13 minutes before the CAL 605 captain decided to attempt it.

The investigation indicated that the accident was caused by the captain's failure to initiate the mandatory [[missed approach]] procedure when he observed the severe airspeed fluctuations, combined with the wind shear and glide slope deviation alerts.

== Aftermath ==

Immediately after the aircraft came to rest in the water, crew members ensured that all passengers donned life jackets and evacuated onto eight of the ten main deck emergency exits. These exits (as on all 747s) are equipped with inflatable evacuation slide/rafts for ditching emergencies. The passenger cabin remained completely above water during the evacuation, although eventually sinking tail-first. Additional damage to the nose and first-class cabin was noted. There were 23 minor injuries among passengers and crew. 

The plane was written off as a total hull loss. The plane's vertical stabilizer interfered with the accuracy of the ILS signals for runway 31, so it was removed with dynamite shortly after the crash. That permitted airliners to make safe ILS approaches whenever the wind patterns mandated the use of runway 31 (the reciprocal direction of runway 13).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nycaviation.com/2009/11/04/on-this-day-in-aviation-history-november-4th Aviation History]&lt;/ref&gt; The China Airlines lettering and the Chinese characters were removed, as was part of the livery on the fuselage, to conceal the identity of the aircraft as belonging to China Airlines. After the accident, the aircraft was stored near the [[HAECO]] building for use in firefighting practice.

==Test procedure==
In the test, a 200 g sample of –21&amp;nbsp;mm to +19&amp;nbsp;mm particle range coke is heated at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C under 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere pressure]] of [[carbon dioxide]] for 2 hours. The coke is preheated and cooled under [[nitrogen]] and the weight loss during reaction is measured. The percentage weight loss is known as the reactivity (CRI). The reacted coke is placed in an I-type drum (no lifters) and subjected to 600 revolutions in 30 minutes. The percent of [[carbon]] material removed from the drum that is +10&amp;nbsp;mm is known as the coke strength after reaction (CSR).

A liquid air powered car called [[Liquid Air]] was built between 1899 and 1902 but it couldn't at the time compete in terms of efficiency with other engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Liquid Air Energy Network |publisher=Liquid Air Energy Network (LAEN) |year=2015 |url=http://liquidair.org.uk/about-liquid-air#ql-history }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a [[liquid nitrogen vehicle]] was built. Peter Dearman, a garage inventor in Hertfordshire, UK who had initially developed a liquid air powered car, then put the technology to use as [[grid energy storage]] &lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The [[Dearman engine]] differs from former nitrogen engine designs in that the nitrogen is heated by combining it with the heat exchange fluid inside the cylinder of the engine.&lt;ref name="T&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Mullistava idea: Tulevaisuuden auto voi kulkea typpimoottorilla |author=Raili Leino |date=2012-10-22 |journal=Tekniikka&amp;Talous |url=http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/autot/mullistava+idea+tulevaisuuden+auto+voi+kulkea+typpimoottorilla/a849225 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Technology |publisher=Dearman Engine Company |year=2012 |url=http://www.dearmanengine.com/cms/the-technology/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022012756/http://www.dearmanengine.com/cms/the-technology/ |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This primary source provides the same information as the Finnish language reliable source. --&gt;

==Grid energy storage==

===Process===
When it is cheaper (usually at night), electricity is used to cool air from the atmosphere to -195&amp;nbsp;°C using the [[Liquefaction of gases#Claude.27s Process|Claude Cycle]] to the point where it [[liquefaction|liquefies]]. The [[liquid air]], which takes up one-thousandth of the volume of the gas, can be kept for a long time in a large [[vacuum flask]] at [[atmospheric pressure]]. At times of [[Peak demand|high demand for electricity]], the liquid air is pumped at [[high pressure]] into a [[heat exchanger]], which acts as a [[boiler]]. Air from the atmosphere at ambient temperature, or hot water from an industrial heat source, is used to heat the liquid and turn it back into a gas. The massive increase in volume and pressure from this is used to drive a [[turbine]] to generate electricity.&lt;ref name=HPS_process/&gt;

===Efficiency===
In isolation the process is only 25% efficient, but this is greatly increased (to around 50%) when used with a low-grade cold store, such as a large gravel bed, to capture the cold generated by evaporating the cryogen. The cold is re-used during the next refrigeration cycle.&lt;ref name=HPS_process&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/?page_id=1405 |title=Process |author= |date= |work=company website |publisher=Highview Power Storage |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efficiency is further increased when used in conjunction with a [[power plant]] or other source of [[low-grade heat]] that would otherwise be lost to the atmosphere. Highview Power Storage claims an AC to AC round-trip efficiency of 70%, by using an otherwise [[waste heat]] source at 115&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=HPS_CES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/?page_id=8 |title=Cryo Energy System |author= |date= |work=company website |publisher=Highview Power Storage |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IMechE]] (Institution of Mechanical Engineers) agrees that these estimates for a commercial-scale plant are realistic.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; However this number was not checked or confirmed by independent professional institutions.

Currently surplus gaseous nitrogen is produced as a byproduct in the production of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="T&amp;T" /&gt; Oxygen can be used in [[oxy-combustion]] coal power plants, enabling [[CO2]] capture and [[CO2 sequestration|sequestration]].&lt;ref name="Carbon Capture"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Air separation units for coal power plants |date=June 22, 2011 |journal=Carbon Capture Journal |url=http://www.carboncapturejournal.com/news/air-separation-units-for-coal-power-plants/2965.aspx |accessdate=2016-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gaseous nitrogen can be liquefied by available liquefaction capacities for further use. Cryogenic distillation of air is currently the only commercially viable technology for large scale oxygen production.&lt;ref name="Carbon Capture" /&gt;

The system is based on proven technology, used safely in many industrial processes, and does not require any particularly rare elements or expensive components to manufacture.

This is based on research by the Birmingham Centre for Cryogenic Energy Storage (BCCES) associated with the University of Birmingham, and has storage for up to 15MWhrs, and can generate a peak supply of 5Mw (so when fully charged lasts for 3 hours at maximum output) and is designed for an operational life of 40 years.

[[Image:Darrieus-windmill.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 1: A Darrieus wind turbine once used to generate electricity on the [[Magdalen Islands]]]] 
The '''Darrieus wind turbine''' is a type of [[vertical axis wind turbine]] (VAWT) used to generate [[electricity]] from the [[energy]] carried in the [[wind]]. The [[turbine]] consists of a number of curved [[airfoil|aerofoil]] blades mounted on a vertical rotating shaft or framework. The curvature of the blades allows the blade to be stressed only in tension at high rotating speeds. There are several closely related wind turbines that use straight blades. This design of wind turbine was patented by [[Georges Jean Marie Darrieus]], a [[France|French]] [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]; filing for the patent was October 1, 1926. There are major difficulties in protecting the Darrieus turbine from extreme wind conditions and in making it self-starting.

==Method of operation==
[[Image:Eoliennes Gaspesie.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 2: A very large Darrieus wind turbine on the [[Gaspé peninsula]], [[Quebec]], Canada]]
[[Image:Taiwan 2009 JinGuaShi Historic Gold Mine Combined Darrieus Savonius Wind Turbines FRD 8638.jpg|thumb|right|Combined Darrieus-[[Savonius wind turbine|Savonius]] generator used in [[Taiwan]]]]
[[Image:Darrieus.jpg|thumb|How the Darrieus wind turbine works]]

In the original versions of the Darrieus design, the aerofoils are arranged so that they are [[symmetrical]] and have zero [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|rigging angle]], that is, the angle that the aerofoils are set relative to the structure on which they are mounted. This arrangement is equally effective no matter which direction the wind is blowing—in contrast to the conventional type, which must be rotated to face into the wind.

When the Darrieus rotor is spinning, the aerofoils are moving forward through the air in a circular path. Relative to the blade, this oncoming airflow is added vectorially to the wind, so that the resultant airflow creates a varying small positive [[angle of attack]] (AoA) to the blade. This generates a net force pointing obliquely forwards along a certain 'line-of-action'. This force can be projected inwards past the turbine axis at a certain distance, giving a positive torque to the shaft, thus helping it to rotate in the direction it is already travelling in. The aerodynamic principles which rotate the rotor are equivalent to that in autogiros, and normal helicopters in autorotation.

As the aerofoil moves around the back of the apparatus, the angle of attack changes to the opposite sign, but the generated force is still obliquely in the direction of rotation, because the wings are symmetrical and the rigging angle is zero. The rotor spins at a rate unrelated to the windspeed, and usually many times faster. The energy arising from the torque and speed may be extracted and converted into useful power by using an [[electrical generator]].

The aeronautical terms [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Lift-induced drag|drag]] are, strictly speaking, forces across and along the approaching net relative airflow respectively, so they are not useful here. We really want to know the tangential force pulling the blade around, and the radial force acting against the bearings.

When the rotor is stationary, no net rotational force arises, even if the wind speed rises quite high—the rotor must already be spinning to generate torque. Thus the design is not normally self-starting. Under rare conditions, Darrieus rotors can self-start, so some form of brake is required to hold it when stopped.

One problem with the design is that the [[angle of attack]] changes as the turbine spins, so each blade generates its maximum torque at two points on its cycle (front and back of the turbine). This leads to a sinusoidal (pulsing) power cycle that complicates design. In particular, almost all Darrieus turbines have resonant modes where, at a particular rotational speed, the pulsing is at a natural frequency of the blades that can cause them to (eventually) break.  For this reason, most Darrieus turbines have mechanical brakes or other speed control devices to keep the turbine from spinning at these speeds for any lengthy period of time.

Another problem arises because the majority of the mass of the rotating mechanism is at the periphery rather than at the hub, as it is with a propeller.  This leads to very high [[centrifugal force|centrifugal]] stresses on the mechanism, which must be stronger and heavier than otherwise to withstand them. One common approach to minimise this is to curve the wings into an "egg-beater" shape (this is called a "[[troposkein]]" shape, derived from the Greek for "the shape of a spun rope") such that they are self-supporting and do not require such heavy supports and mountings. See. Fig. 1.

In this configuration, the Darrieus design is theoretically less expensive than a conventional type, as most of the stress is in the blades which torque against the generator located at the bottom of the turbine.  The only forces that need to be balanced out vertically are the compression load due to the blades flexing outward (thus attempting to "squeeze" the tower), and the wind force trying to blow the whole turbine over, half of which is transmitted to the bottom and the other half of which can easily be offset with guy wires.

By contrast, a conventional design has all of the force of the wind attempting to push the tower over at the top, where the main bearing is located.  Additionally, one cannot easily use guy wires to offset this load, because the propeller spins both above and below the top of the tower.  Thus the conventional design requires a strong tower that grows dramatically with the size of the propeller.  Modern designs can compensate most tower loads of that variable speed and variable pitch.

In overall comparison, while there are some advantages in Darrieus design there are many more disadvantages, especially with bigger machines in the MW class. The Darrieus design uses much more expensive material in blades while most of the blade is too close to the ground to give any real power. Traditional designs assume that wing tip is at least 40m from ground at lowest point to maximize energy production and lifetime.  So far there is no known material (not even [[carbon fiber]]) which can meet cyclic load requirements.{{Citation needed|reason=See the Darrieus wind turbines in the photos?

== Giromills ==

&lt;/ref&gt;
also called the '''Giromill''' or '''H-bar''' design, in which the long "egg beater" blades of the common Darrieus design are replaced with straight vertical blade sections attached to the central tower with horizontal supports.

== Cycloturbines ==

Another variation of the Giromill is the '''Cycloturbine''', in which each blade is mounted so that it can rotate around its own vertical axis.  This allows the blades to be "pitched" so that they always have some angle of attack relative to the wind.  The main advantage to this design is that the torque generated remains almost constant over a fairly wide angle, so a Cycloturbine with three or four blades has a fairly constant torque.  Over this range of angles, the torque itself is near the maximum possible, meaning that the system also generates more power.  The Cycloturbine also has the advantage of being able to self-start, by pitching the "downwind moving" blade flat to the wind to generate drag and start the turbine spinning at a low speed.  On the downside, the blade pitching mechanism is complex and generally heavy, and some sort of wind-direction sensor needs to be added in order to pitch the blades properly.

A schematic of a self-acting pitch control system that does not require a wind-direction system is shown in Figure 4.

==Helical blades==
[[File:Vertical-axis wind turbine at Hartnell College Alisal Campus.gk.webm|thumb|A helical Darrieus turbine at [[Hartnell College]].]]
The blades of a Darrieus turbine can be canted into a helix, e.g. three blades and a helical twist of 60 degrees, similar to [[Gorlov helical turbine|Gorlov's water turbines]]. Since the wind pulls each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine, this feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing destructive pulsations. This design is used by the [[Turby wind turbine|Turby]], [[Urban Green Energy]], [[Enessere]], Aerotecture and [[Quietrevolution wind turbine|Quiet Revolution]] brands of wind turbine.

==Active lift turbine==
[[File:Axial_and_normal_force.png|thumb|Fig 5: Active lift turbine - Axial and normal force.]]
[[File:Crank rod system.png|thumb|Fig 6: Active lift turbine - Crank rod system.]]
The relative speed creates on the blade, a force. This force can be decomposed into an axial and normal force (fig5). In the case of a Darrieus turbine, the axial force associated with the radius creates a torque and the normal force creates on the arm a stress which is alternately for each half turn, a compression stress and an extension stress.
With a  crank rod system (fig.5), the principle of the Active Lift Turbine is to transform this alternative constraint into an additional energy recovery.

In mathematics, a '''Δ-set''' ''S'', often called a '''semi-simplicial set''', is a [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] object that is useful in the construction and [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] of [[topological space]]s, and also in the computation of related [[Invariant theory|algebraic invariants]] of such spaces.  A Δ-set is somewhat more general than a [[simplicial complex]], yet not quite as general as a [[simplicial set]].

==Definition and related data==
Formally, a '''Δ-set''' is a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;\{S_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; together with maps

:&lt;math&gt;d_i : S_{n+1} \rightarrow S_n &lt;/math&gt;

with ''i'' = 0,1,...,''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 for ''n'' ≥ 1 that satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; d_i \circ d_j = d_{j-1} \circ d_i &lt;/math&gt;
whenever ''i &lt; j''.

This definition generalizes the notion of a simplicial complex, where the &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; are the sets of ''n''-simplices, and the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the face maps.  It is not as general as a simplicial set, since it lacks "degeneracies."

Given Δ-sets ''S'' and ''T'', a '''map of Δ-sets''' is a collection
:&lt;math&gt; \{ f_n: S_n \rightarrow T_n \}_{n=0}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt; f_n \circ d_i = d_i \circ f_{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;
whenever both sides of the equation are defined.  With this notion, we can define the '''[[Category (mathematics)|category]] of Δ-sets''', whose objects are Δ-sets and whose morphisms are maps of Δ-sets.

Each Δ-set has a corresponding '''geometric realization''', defined as
:&lt;math&gt;|S| = \left( \coprod_{n=0}^{\infty} S_n \times \Delta^n \right)/_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt;
where we declare that

: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma,d^i t) \sim (d_i \sigma, t) \quad \text{ for all} \quad \sigma \in S_n, t \in \Delta^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Simplex#The standard simplex|standard ''n''-simplex]], and

:&lt;math&gt; d^i : \Delta^{n-1} \rightarrow \Delta^n &lt;/math&gt;

is the inclusion of the ''i''-th face.  The geometric realization is a topological space with the [[quotient topology]].

The geometric realization of a Δ-set ''S'' has a natural [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]]
: &lt;math&gt;|S|_0 \subset |S|_1 \subset \cdots \subset |S|, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;|S|_N = \left( \coprod_{n=0}^{N} S_n \times \Delta^n \right)/_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt;
is a "restricted" geometric realization.

==Related functors==
The geometric realization of a Δ-set described above defines a covariant [[functor]] from the category of Δ-sets to the category of topological spaces.  Geometric realization takes a Δ-set to a topological space, and carries maps of Δ-sets to induced continuous maps between geometric realizations (which are topological spaces).

If ''S'' is a Δ-set, there is an associated free abelian [[chain complex]], denoted &lt;math&gt;( \mathbb{Z} S, \partial )&lt;/math&gt;, whose ''n''-th group is the [[free abelian group]]
: &lt;math&gt; (\mathbb{Z} S)_n = \mathbb{Z} \langle S_n \rangle, &lt;/math&gt;
generated by the set &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, and whose ''n''-th differential is defined by

: &lt;math&gt; \partial_n = d_0 - d_1 + d_2 - \cdots + (-1)^n d_n. &lt;/math&gt;

This defines a covariant functor from the category of Δ-sets to the category of chain complexes of abelian groups.  A Δ-set is carried to the chain complex just described, and a map of Δ-sets is carried to a map of chain complexes, which is defined by extending the map of Δ-sets in the standard way using the [[universal property]] of free abelian groups.

Given any topological space ''X'', one can construct a Δ-set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sing}(X)&lt;/math&gt; as follows.  A singular ''n''-simplex in ''X'' is a continuous map

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma : \Delta^n \rightarrow X. &lt;/math&gt;

Define

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{sing}_n^{}(X) &lt;/math&gt;

to be the collection of all singular ''n''-simplicies in ''X'', and define

:&lt;math&gt;d_i : \mathrm{sing}_{i+1}(X) \rightarrow \mathrm{sing}_i(X) &lt;/math&gt;

by

:&lt;math&gt; d_i(\sigma) = \sigma \circ d^i,&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''i''-th face map.  One can check that this is in fact a Δ-set.  This defines a covariant functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of Δ-sets.  A topological space is carried to the Δ-set just described, and a continuous map of spaces is carried to a map of Δ-sets, which is given by composing the map with the singular ''n''-simplices.

==An example==
This example illustrates the constructions described above.  We can create a Δ-set ''S'' whose geometric realization is the unit circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;, and use it to compute the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of this space.  Thinking of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; as an interval with the endpoints identified, define
:&lt;math&gt; S_0 = \{v\}, \quad S_1 = \{e\}, &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;S_n = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n ≥ 2''.  The only possible maps &lt;math&gt;d_0,d_1:S_1 \rightarrow S_0,&lt;/math&gt; are
:&lt;math&gt; d_0(e) = d_1(e) = v. \quad&lt;/math&gt;
It is simple to check that this is a Δ-set, and that &lt;math&gt;|S| \cong S^1&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, the associated chain complex &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}S,\partial)&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \langle e \rangle \stackrel{\partial_1}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z} \langle v \rangle \longrightarrow 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_1(e) = d_0(e) - d_1(e) = v - v = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
In fact, &lt;math&gt;\partial_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''.  The homology of this chain complex is also simple to compute:
:&lt;math&gt; H_0(\mathbb{Z}S) = \frac{\ker \partial_0}{\mathrm{im} \partial_1} = \mathbb{Z} \langle v \rangle \cong \Z, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; H_1(\mathbb{Z}S) = \frac{\ker \partial_1}{\mathrm{im} \partial_2} = \mathbb{Z} \langle e \rangle \cong \Z. &lt;/math&gt;
All other homology groups are clearly trivial.

One advantage of using Δ-sets in this way is that the resulting chain complex is generally much simpler than the singular chain complex.  For reasonably simple spaces, all of the groups will be finitely generated, whereas the singular chain groups are, in general, not even countably generated.

One drawback of this method is that one must prove that the geometric realization of the Δ-set is actually [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the topological space in question.  This can become a computational challenge as the Δ-set increases in complexity.

The '''density''', or more precisely, the '''volumetric mass density''', of a substance is its [[mass]] per unit [[volume]]. The symbol most often used for density is ''ρ'' (the lower case Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]]), although the Latin letter ''D'' can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/fluden.html | title =Gas Density Glenn research Center | author =''[[National Aeronautic and Space Administration|The National Aeronautic and Atmospheric Administration's]]'' ''[[Glenn Research Center]]'' | publisher =grc.nasa.gov | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130414132531/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/fluden.html | archivedate =April 14, 2013 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density, ''m'' is the mass, and ''V'' is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its [[weight]] per unit [[volume]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilgasglossary.com/density.html |title=Density definition in Oil Gas Glossary |publisher=Oilgasglossary.com |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805010226/http://oilgasglossary.com/density.html |archivedate=August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called [[specific weight]].

For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]].
Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to [[buoyancy]], purity and [[packaging]]. [[Osmium]] and [[iridium]] are the densest known elements at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] but certain chemical compounds may be denser.

To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the [[dimensionless]] quantity "[[relative density]]" or "[[specific gravity]]", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.

The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in [[convection]] of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material.

The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its [[specific volume]], a term sometimes used in [[thermodynamics]]. Density is an [[intensive property]] in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.

== History ==

In a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, [[Archimedes]] was given the task of determining whether [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero]]'s [[goldsmith]] was embezzling [[gold]] during the manufacture of a golden [[wreath]] dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another, cheaper [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/archimedes.htm Archimedes, A Gold Thief and Buoyancy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827113533/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/archimedes.htm |date=August 27, 2007 }} – by Larry "Harris" Taylor, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled, Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the [[Displacement (fluid)|displacement]] of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, "Eureka! Eureka!" (Εύρηκα! Greek "I have found it"). As a result, the term "[[Eureka (word)|eureka]]" entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.

The story first appeared in written form in [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura|books of architecture]]'', two centuries after it supposedly took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html Vitruvius on Architecture, Book IX], paragraphs 9–12, translated into English and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html in the original Latin].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.305.5688.1219e|title=EXHIBIT: The First Eureka Moment|year=2004|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5688|pages=1219e }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=5F1935E9-E7F2-99DF-3F1D1235AF1D2CD1 Fact or Fiction?: Archimedes Coined the Term "Eureka!" in the Bath], ''Scientific American'', December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the equation for density (''ρ'' = ''m''/''V''), mass density has units of mass divided by volume. As there are many units of mass and volume covering many different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use. The [[SI]] unit of [[kilogram]] per [[cubic metre]] (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and the [[cgs]] unit of [[gram]] per [[cubic centimetre]] (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are probably the most commonly used units for density. One g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to one thousand kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  One cubic centimetre (abbreviation cc) is equal to one millilitre. In industry, other larger or smaller units of mass and or volume are often more practical and [[US customary units]] may be used. See below for a list of some of the most common units of density.

== Measurement of density ==
A number of techniques as well as standards exist for the measurement of density of materials. Such techniques include the use of a hydrometer (a buoyancy method for liquids), Hydrostatic balance (a buoyancy method for liquids and solids), immersed body method (a buoyancy method for liquids), pycnometer (liquids and solids), air comparison pycnometer (solids), oscillating densitometer (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-109-density-of-liquids-and-solids_9789264123298-en|title=OECD Test Guideline 109 on measurement of density|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each individual method or technique measures different types of density (e.g. bulk density, skeletal density, etc.), and therefore it is necessary to have an understanding of the type of density  being measured as well as the type of material in question. 

===Homogeneous materials===
The density at all points of a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] object equals its total [[mass]] divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a [[weighing scale|scale or balance]]; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a [[hydrometer]], a [[dasymeter]] or a [[Coriolis flow meter]] may be used, respectively. Similarly, [[hydrostatic weighing]] uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.

===Heterogeneous materials===
If the body is not homogeneous, then its density varies between different regions of the object. In that case the density around any given location is determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location. In the limit of an infinitesimal volume the density of an inhomogeneous object at a point becomes: &lt;math&gt;\rho(\vec{r}) = dm/dV&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; is an elementary volume at position &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The mass of the body then can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;
 m = \int_V \rho(\vec{r})\,dV.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Non-compact materials ===
In practice, bulk materials such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. Many materials exist in nature as flakes, pellets, or granules.

Voids are regions which contain something other than the considered material.  Commonly the void is air, but it could also be vacuum,  liquid, solid, or a different gas or gaseous mixture.

The bulk volume of a material—inclusive of the void fraction—is often obtained by a simple measurement (e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup) or geometrically from known dimensions.

Mass divided by ''bulk'' volume determines [[bulk density]].  This is not the same thing as volumetric mass density.

To determine volumetric mass density, one must first discount the volume of the void fraction. Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning.  For the [[close-packing of equal spheres]] the non-void fraction can be at most about 74%.  It can also be determined empirically.  Some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a ''variable'' void fraction which depends on how the material is agitated or poured. It might be loose or compact, with more or less air space depending on handling.

In practice, the void fraction is not necessarily air, or even gaseous.  In the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantageous for measurement as the void fraction for sand saturated in water—once any air bubbles are thoroughly driven out—is potentially more consistent than dry sand measured with an air void.

In the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample. If the material is under pressure (commonly ambient air pressure at the earth's surface) the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was conducted. In the case of dry sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyancy effect is commonly neglected (less than one part in one thousand).

Mass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction, if the difference in density of the two voids materials is reliably known.

== Changes of density ==
{{Main article|Compressibility|Thermal expansivity}}

In general, density can be changed by changing either the [[pressure]] or the [[temperature]]. Increasing the pressure always increases the density of a material. Increasing the temperature generally decreases the density, but there are notable exceptions to this generalization. For example, the density of [[water]] increases between its melting point at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 4&amp;nbsp;°C; similar behavior is observed in [[silicon]] at low temperatures.

The effect of pressure and temperature on the densities of liquids and solids is small. The [[compressibility]] for a typical liquid or solid is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1&amp;nbsp;bar = 0.1&amp;nbsp;MPa) and a typical [[thermal expansivity]] is 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This roughly translates into needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure to reduce the volume of a substance by one percent. (Although the pressures needed may be around a thousand times smaller for sandy soil and some clays.) A one percent expansion of volume typically requires a temperature increase on the order of thousands of degrees [[Celsius]].

In contrast, the density of gases is strongly affected by pressure. The density of an [[ideal gas]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac {MP}{RT},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|M}} is the [[molar mass]], {{math|P}} is the pressure, {{math|R}} is the [[Gas constant|universal gas constant]], and {{math|T}} is the [[absolute temperature]]. This means that the density of an ideal gas can be doubled by doubling the pressure, or by halving the absolute temperature.

In the case of volumic thermal expansion at constant pressure and small intervals of temperature the temperature dependence of density is :
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{\rho_{T_0}}{1 + \alpha \cdot \Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{T_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the density at a reference temperature, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material at temperatures close to &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Density of solutions ==
The density of a [[solution]] is the sum of [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass (massic) concentrations]] of the components of that solution.

Mass (massic) concentration of each given component ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in a solution sums to density of the solution.
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sum_i \varrho_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed as a function of the densities of pure components of the mixture and their [[volume concentration|volume participation]], it allows the determination of [[excess molar quantity|excess molar volumes]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sum_i \rho_i \frac{V_i}{V}\, = \sum_i \rho_i \varphi_i = \sum_i \rho_i \frac{V_i}{\sum_i V_i + \sum_i {V^E}_i}&lt;/math&gt;
provided that there is no interaction between the components.

Knowing the relation between excess volumes and activity coefficients of the  components, one can determine the activity coefficients.
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{V^E}_i = RT \frac{\partial\ln\gamma_i}{\partial P}&lt;/math&gt;

== Common units ==
The [[SI]] unit for density is:
* [[kilogram]] per [[cubic metre]] (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

The litre and metric tons are not part of the SI, but are acceptable for use with it, leading to the following units:
* [[kilogram]] per [[litre]] (kg/L)
* [[gram]] per [[millilitre]] (g/mL)
* [[metric ton]] per cubic metre (t/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

Densities using the following metric units all have exactly the same numerical value, one thousandth of the value in (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Liquid [[water]] has a density of about 1&amp;nbsp;kg/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, making any of these SI units numerically convenient to use as most [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s have densities between 0.1 and 20&amp;nbsp;kg/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* kilogram per cubic decimetre (kg/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
** 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* megagram (metric ton) per cubic metre (Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

In [[US customary units]] density can be stated in:
* [[Avoirdupois ounce]] per [[cubic inch]] (1 g/cc ≈ 0.578036672 oz/cu&amp;nbsp;in)
* [[Avoirdupois ounce]] per [[fluid ounce]] (1 g/cc ≈ 1.04317556 oz/fl. oz = 1.04317556 lbs/pint)
* [[Pound (mass)|Avoirdupois pound]] per cubic inch (1 g/cc ≈ 0.036127292 lb/cu&amp;nbsp;in)
* pound per [[cubic foot]] (1 g/cc ≈ 62.427961 lb/cu&amp;nbsp;ft)
* pound per [[cubic yard]] (1 g/cc ≈ 1685.5549 lb/cu&amp;nbsp;yd)
* pound per [[US liquid gallon]] (1 g/cc ≈ 8.34540445 lb/gal)
* pound per US [[bushel]] (1 g/cc ≈ 77.6888513 lb/bu)
* [[slug (unit)|slug]] per cubic foot

[[Imperial units]] differing from the above (as the Imperial gallon and bushel differ from the US units) in practice are rarely used, though found in older documents. The Imperial gallon was based on the concept that an [[Imperial fluid ounce]] of water would have a mass of one Avoirdupois ounce, and indeed 1&amp;nbsp;g/cc ≈ 1.00224129 ounces per Imperial fluid ounce = 10.0224129 pounds per Imperial gallon. The density of [[precious metal]]s could conceivably be based on [[Troy weight|Troy]] ounces and pounds, a possible cause of confusion.

'''Ecolon''' may refer either to recycled (ecologically-friendly nylon) mineral-glass reinforced [[Nylon 6]] (Perlon) engineering resins, or to a ceramic filled fused silica coating commonly used in cookware (Ecolon).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neoflam.co.nz/files/file/certification/Neoflam%20cookware%20with%20Ecolon%20coating%20(ceramic%20coating)%20FDA%20test%20report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellmaner.com/assets/files/MGR-Nylon6/EcoLon%202020-BK2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecolon cookware coatings are touted as highly resistant to scratches caused by utensils, metallic cleaning pads and abrasives, and withstand high temperatures, leading to great durability. [[Teflon]] coatings start breaking down at 240&amp;nbsp;°C, while Ecolon remains stable up to 450&amp;nbsp;°C. EcoLon engineering resin is produced by Wellman Engineering Resins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highel.com/EcolonCoating.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ecolon ceramic coatings are a trademark of Neoflam.

The '''Eklutna Power Plant''', also referred to as '''Old Eklutna Power Plant''', is a historic [[hydroelectric]] [[power plant]] on the [[Eklutna River]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]].  Located about {{convert|5|mi|km}} downstream of the more modern [[Eklutna Dam|new Eklutna Power Plant]], it was built in 1928-29 to provide electrical power to the growing city, and served as its primary power source until 1956. The facilities include two dams, a tunnel and [[penstock]], and a powerhouse. The main dam, [[Eklutna Dam]], located at the northwestern end of Eklutna Lake, was built in 1941 to replace a series of temporary structures built after an earthen dam failed before the plant began operation. The diversion dam, a concrete [[arch dam]], is located {{convert|7|mi|km}} downstream from the lake, and provides facilities for diverting water into the tunnel.  The tunnel is {{convert|1900|ft|m}} long, and is terminated in a penstock, a structure designed to raise the water pressure.  The powerhouse is a concrete-and-steel structure completed in 1929.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=80000746}}|title=NRHP nomination for Eklutna Power Plant|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power plant was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

''' Electromagnetic acoustic transducer''' ('''EMAT''') is a transducer for non-contact sound generation and reception using electromagnetic mechanisms. EMAT is an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT) method which does not require contact or couplant, because the sound is directly generated within the material adjacent to the transducer. Due to this couplant-free feature, EMAT is particularly useful for automated inspection, and hot, cold, clean, or dry environments. EMAT is an ideal transducer to generate Shear Horizontal (SH) bulk wave mode, Surface Wave, [[Lamb waves]] and all sorts of other guided-wave modes in metallic and/or ferromagnetic materials.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Thompson, Physical Principles of Measurements with EMAT Transducers,''Ultrasonic Measurement Methods, Physical Acoustics'' Vol XIX, Edited by R.N. Thurston and Allan D. Pierce, Academic Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Innerspec&gt;http://www.innerspec.com&lt;/ref&gt; As an emerging [[ultrasonic testing]] (UT) technique, EMAT can be used for thickness measurement, flaw detection, and material property characterization. After decades of research and development, EMAT has found its applications in many industries such as primary metal manufacturing and processing, automotive, railroad, pipeline, [[boiler]] and [[pressure vessel]] industries.&lt;ref name= email. /&gt;T

==Basic components==

There are two basic components in an EMAT transducer. One is a magnet and the other is an electric coil. The magnet can be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which produces a static or a quasi-static magnetic field. In EMAT terminology, this field is called bias magnetic field. The electric coil is driven with an alternating current (AC) electric signal at ultrasonic frequency, typically in the range from 20&amp;nbsp;kHz to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz. Based on the application needs, the signal can be a continuous wave, a spike pulse, or a tone-burst signal. The electric coil with AC current also generates an AC magnetic field. When the test material is close to the EMAT, ultrasonic waves are generated in the test material through the interaction of the two magnetic fields.

== Transduction mechanism ==

There are two mechanisms to generate waves through magnetic field interaction. One is Lorentz force when the material is conductive. The other is magnetostriction when the material is ferromagnetic.

=== Lorentz force ===
The AC current in the electric coil generates eddy current on the surface of the material. According to theory of electromagnetic induction, the distribution of the eddy current is only at a very thin layer of the material, called skin depth. This depth reduces with the increase of AC frequency, the material conductivity, and permeability. Typically for 1&amp;nbsp;MHz AC excitation, the skin depth is only a fraction of a millimeter for primary metals like steel, copper and aluminum. The eddy current in the magnetic field experiences [[Lorentz force]]. In a microscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the electrons in the eddy current. In a macroscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the surface region of the material due to interaction between electrons and atoms. The distribution of Lorentz force is controlled by the design of magnet, and design of the electric coil, the properties of the test material, relative position between the transducer and the test part, and the excitation signal for the transducer.

=== Magnetostriction ===
A ferromagnetic material will have a dimensional change when an external magnetic field is applied. This effect is called [[magnetostriction]]. The flux field of a magnet expands or collapses depends on the arrangement of ferromagnetic material having inducing voltage in a coil and the amount of change is affected by the magnitude and direction of the field.&lt;ref name=HiraoBook&gt;Masahiko Hirao and Hirotsugu Ogi, EMATS For Science and Industry, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The AC current in the electric coil induces an AC magnetic field and thus produces magnetostriction at ultrasonic frequency in the material. The disturbances caused by magnetostriction then propagate in the material as an ultrasound wave.

In polycrystalline material, the magnetostriction response is very complicated. It is affected by direction of the bias field, direction of the field from AC electric coil, the strength of bias field, and the amplitude of the AC current. In some cases, one or two peak response may be observed with the increase of bias field. In some cases, the response can be improved significantly with the change of relative direction between bias magnetic field and AC magnetic field. Quantitatively, the magnetostriction may be described in a similar mathematical format as piezoelectric constants.&lt;ref name=HiraoBook /&gt; Empirically, a lot of experience is needed to fully understand the magnetostriction phenomenon.

Magnetostriction effect has been used to generate both SH-type and Lamb type waves in steel products. Recently, due to the stronger magnetostriction effect in nickel than steel, magnetostriction sensors using nickel patches are also developed for nondestructive testing of steel products.

==Comparison with piezoelectric transducers==

As an ultrasonic testing (UT) method, EMAT has all the advantages of UT compared to other NDT methods. Just like piezoelectric UT probes, EMAT probes can be used in pulse echo, pitch-catch, and through-transmission configurations. EMAT probes can also be assembled into phased array probes, delivering focusing and beam steering capabilities.&lt;ref name=GaoAustenitic&gt;Gao, H., and B. Lopez, "Development of Single-Channel and Phased Array EMATs for Austenitic Weld Inspection", Materials Evaluation (ME), Vol. 68(7), 821-827,(2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
Compared to piezoelectric transducers, EMAT probes have the following advantages:

# No couplant is needed. Based on the transduction mechanism of EMAT, couplant is not required. This makes EMAT ideal for inspections at temperatures below the freezing point and above the evaporation point of liquid couplants. It also makes it convenient for situations where couplant handling would be impractical.
# EMAT is a non-contact method. Although proximity is preferred, a physical contact between the transducer and the specimen under test is not required.
# Dry Inspection. Since no couplant is needed, the EMAT inspection can be performed in a dry environment.
# Less sensitive to surface condition. With contact-based piezoelectric transducers, the test surface has to be machined smoothly to ensure coupling. Using EMAT, the requirements to surface smoothness are less stringent; the only requirement is to remove loose scale and the like.
# Easier for sensor deployment. Using piezoelectric transducer, the wave propagation angle in the test part is affected by Snell’s law. As a result, a small variation in sensor deployment may cause a significant change in the refracted angle.
# Easier to generate SH-type waves. Using piezoelectric transducers, SH wave is difficult to couple to the test part. EMAT provide a convenient means of generating SH bulk wave and SH guided waves.

===Challenges and disadvantages===
The disadvantages of EMAT compared to piezoelectric UT can be summaried as follows:

# Low transduction efficiency. EMAT transducers typically produce raw signal of lower power than piezoelectric transducers. As a result, more sophisticated signal processing techniques are needed to isolate signal from noise.
# Limited to metallic or magnetic products. NDT of plastic and ceramic material is not suitable or at least not convenient using EMAT.
# Size constraints. Although there are EMAT transducers as small as a penny, commonly used transducers are large in size. Low-profile EMAT problems are still under research and development. Due to the size constraints, EMAT phased array is also difficult to be made from very small elements.
# Caution must be taken when handling magnets around steel products.

==Applications==

EMAT has been used in a broad range of applications and has potential to be used in many other applications. A brief and incomplete list is as follows.

==Etching==
An [[Etching (microfabrication)|etch solution]] is applied on the surface of the wafer where the etch [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] is increased at [[dislocation]]s of the [[crystal]] resulting in [[wikt:pit|pits]]. For [[GaAs]] one uses typically molten [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] at 450 degrees Celsius for about 40 minutes in a [[zirconium]] [[crucible]].  The [[density]] of the pits can be determined by [[Microscopy#Light Microscopy: the contrast issue|optical contrast microscopy]]. [[Silicon]] wafers have usually a very low density of &lt; 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; while semi-insulating GaAs wafers have a density on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. 

==Germanium detectors==
High-purity [[Semiconductor_detector#Semiconductor_particle_detectors|Germanium detectors]] require the Ge crystals to be grown with a controlled range of dislocation density to reduce impurities. The etch pitch density requirement is typically within the range 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

The name '''gowk stane''' ({{lang-en|cukoo stone or fool's stone}}) has been applied to certain [[standing stones]] and [[glacial erratic]]s in Scotland, often found in prominent geographical situations. Other spelling variants, such as gowke, gouk, gouke, goilk, goik, gok, goke, gook are found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/ Scots Dictionary. Accessed : 2010-04-03]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:NevernCross.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Brynach's cross in Nevern, Wales.]]
Gowk in [[Scots language|Scots]] means a [[common cuckoo]] (''Cuculus canorus''), but also a stupid person or fool. The word derives from the [[Old Norse]] 'gaukr', a cuckoo. Other explanations and origins for the term are also found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gowk Gowk definition. Accessed : 2010-04-02.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The word derives from Anglo-Saxon (Old English) 'gouk' and was replaced in the south and central England by the French loan word 'coucou' after the Norman Conquest.
The [[cuckoo]] family gets its English and scientific names from the call of the bird.

The Scottish Gaelic names are Coi: Cuach: Cuachag (poetical name): Cuthag.&lt;ref&gt;Harvie-Brown, Page 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh for cuckoo is cog.

==Cuckoo folklore==
[[Celtic mythology]] in particular is rich in references to cuckoos and the surviving folklore gives clues as to why some stones were given the ''gowk'' name.

The term ''gowk'' is perhaps best known in the context of the old [[Gowk's Day]], the Scottish [[April Fools' Day]], originally held on April 13 when the cuckoo begins to call, and when children were sent on a ''gowk hunt'', a harmless prank involving pointless errands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paghat.com/campanula3.html ''Campanula rotundifolia''. Accessed : 2010-04-02.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gowk meant both cuckoo and fool, the latter were thought to be fairy-touched. The call of the cuckoo was believed to beckon the souls of the dead, and the cuckoo was thought to be able to travel back and forth between the worlds of the living and the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paghat.com/campanula3.html ''Campanula rotundifolia''. Accessed : 2010-04-02.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once commonly thought that the first appearance of a cuckoo also brought about a "gowk storm", a furious spring storm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=BH18890412.2.31&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-all Paperspast - Gowk. Accessed : 2010-04-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuckoos were said to have the power of prophesy and could foretell a person's lifespan, the number of their children and when they would marry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=BH18890412.2.31&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-all Paperspast - Gowk. Accessed : 2010-04-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the ''gowk'' or ''fool'' originated in the Dark Ages as a name for the Britons, given by the Saxons invaders, and carried some of the meaning of the ''Devil'' in the context of an arch foe, who is likened to the fool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paghat.com/campanula3.html ''Campanula rotundifolia''. Accessed : 2010-04-02.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Outer Hebrides a cuckoo's call heard when a person was hungry was bad luck, however the opposite was true if the person had recently eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Harvie-Brown, Page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gowk stones==
The use of the term ''gowk'' at these sites suggests a link with springtime and some of the surviving legends associated with standing stones do have a link with the heralding of spring by the first cuckoo of that season to arrive. In the churchyard at [[Nevern]] in Wales is an old stone cross, carved with intricate knotwork. Villagers of Nevern would wait for their "harbinger of spring" and on 7 April, [[Saint Brynach|St Brynach's feast day]], the first cuckoo of the year would arrive from Africa, alighting on the cross and singing to announce the arrival of spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pembrokeshirevirtualmuseum.co.uk/main_menu/places_to_visit/churches/churches_and_chapels/st_brynachs_church_nevern.html Pembrokeshire Virtual Museum. Accessed : 2010-04-03]&lt;/ref&gt;

A local belief of the Gaelic-speaking community on the [[Isle of Lewis]] was that when the sun rose on midsummer morn, the "shining one" walked along the stone avenue at [[Callanish]], his arrival heralded by the cuckoo's call.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/scotland/callanish.html Stones of Scotland. Accessed : 2010-04-03.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cuckoo traditionally sends forth its first call in spring from the gowk stone at Lisdivin in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breadyancestry.com/index.php?id=32 Bready Ancestry. Accessed : 2010-04-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few cuckoo stones are present at sites in England and Cornwall.

==Other uses==
The various gowk stones often had other functions, such as acting as boundary markers or meeting places in what may have sometimes featureless landscapes. The gowk stone at Whitelee may have been used as a pulpit of sorts by ministers preaching at conventicles held on this remote spot in [[Covenanter|Covenanting]] times.&lt;ref&gt;Tittensor, Page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Sphinx is one of the world's largest and oldest statues, but basic facts about it are still subject to debate, such as when it was built, by whom and for what purpose.

=== Names ===
It is impossible to identify what name the creators called their statue, as the Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and there are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the [[New Kingdom]], the Sphinx was called ''[[Horus|Hor]]-em-[[akhet (hieroglyph and season)|akhet]]'' ({{lang-en|[[Horus]] of the Horizon}}; {{Lang-cop|ϩⲁⲣⲙⲁϣⲓ}}; [[Hellenization|Hellenized]]: ''Harmachis''), and the pharaoh [[Thutmose&amp;nbsp;IV]] (1401–1391 or 1397–1388&amp;nbsp;BC)&lt;ref&gt;See [[Thutmose IV#Dates and length of reign]]&lt;/ref&gt; specifically referred to it as such in his "[[Dream Stele]]."

The commonly used name "[[Sphinx]]" was given to it in [[classical antiquity]], about 2000 years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a [[Sphinx#Greece|Greek mythological beast]] with a [[lion]]'s body, a woman's head and the wings of an [[eagle]] (although, like most [[Sphinx#Egypt|Egyptian sphinxes]], the Great Sphinx has a man's head and no wings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/sphinx|title=sphinx {{!}} mythology|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''sphinx'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] Σφίγξ (&lt;small&gt;[[Romanization of Greek|transliterated]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{transl|grc|sphinx}}) apparently from the verb σφίγγω (&lt;small&gt;[[Romanization of Greek|transliterated]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{transl|grc|sphingo}} / {{lang-en|to squeeze}}), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer [[The Riddle of the Sphinx|her riddle]].

The name may alternatively be a [[Corruption (linguistics)|linguistic corruption]] of the [[phonetically]] different [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] word ''Ssp-anx'' (in [[Manuel de Codage]]).  This name is given to royal statues of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty of ancient Egypt]] (2575–2467&amp;nbsp;BC) and later in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] ({{circa|1570–1070 BC}}) to the Great Sphinx more specifically.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

Medieval [[Arab]] writers, including [[Al-Maqrizi|al-Maqrīzī]], call the Sphinx ''balhib'' and ''bilhaw'', which suggest a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] influence. The modern [[Egyptian Arabic]] name is [[:ar:بو الهول|أبو الهول]] ({{transl|ar|''Abū al Hūl''}}, {{lang-en|The Terrifying One}}).

=== Builder and timeframe ===
Though there have been conflicting evidence and viewpoints over the years, the view held by modern [[Egyptology]] at large remains that the Great Sphinx was built in approximately 2500&amp;nbsp;BC for the pharaoh [[Khafra]], the builder of the [[Pyramid of Khafre|Second Pyramid]] at Giza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sphinx Project: Why Sequence is Important | url=http://www.aeraweb.org/khafre_seq.asp | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726101013/http://www.aeraweb.org/khafre_seq.asp | archivedate=July 26, 2010 | date=2007 | accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selim Hassan]], writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, summed up the problem:
{{quote|Taking all things into consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this, the world's most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this reservation: that there is not one single contemporary inscription which connects the Sphinx with Khafre; so, sound as it may appear, we must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as a lucky turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a definite reference to the erection of the Sphinx.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Selim (1949). ''The Sphinx: Its history in the light of recent excavations''. Cairo: Government Press, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "circumstantial" evidence mentioned by Hassan includes the Sphinx's location in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which is traditionally connected with Khafra.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark (Spring 2002). [http://www.aeraweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/aeragram5_2_2002.pdf "Giza As Is:Unfinished Business Reveals the Human Hand"] in ''Aeragram'', '''5''':2 (Spring 2002), 10–14. Retrieved {{Nowrap|23 December}} 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Causeway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple, both of which display similar design of their inner courts. The Sphinx Temple was built using blocks cut from the Sphinx enclosure, while those of the Valley Temple were quarried from the plateau, some of the largest weighing upwards of 100 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeraweb.org/sphinx-project/khafres-monuments/|title=Sphinx - Khafre's Giza Monuments as a Unit - Mark Lehner - Ancient Egypt Research Associates|website=www.aeraweb.org|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[diorite]] statue of Khafre, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafra theory.

The [[Dream Stele]], erected much later by the pharaoh [[Thutmose&amp;nbsp;IV]] (1401–1391 or 1397–1388&amp;nbsp;BC), associates the Sphinx with Khafra. When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete, and only referred to ''Khaf'', not Khafra. An extract was translated:
{{quote|which we bring for him: oxen&amp;nbsp;... and all the young vegetables; and we shall give praise to ''Wenofer'' ... ''Khaf'' ... the statue made for ''[[Atum]]-Hor-em-[[Akhet (hieroglyph and season)|Akhet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Colavito, Jason (2001). [http://jcolavito.tripod.com/lostcivilizations/id17.html "Who Built the Sphinx?"] at [http://jcolavito.tripod.com/lostcivilizations/index.html Lost Civilizations Discovered]. Retrieved {{Nowrap|19 December}} 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Egyptologist [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], finding the ''Khaf'' [[hieroglyph]]s in a damaged [[cartouche]] used to surround a royal name, inserted the glyph ''ra'' to complete Khafra's name. When the Stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to ''Khaf'' flaked off and were destroyed.

=== Dissenting hypotheses ===
Theories held by academic [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] regarding the builder of the Sphinx and the date of its construction are not universally accepted, and various persons have proposed alternative hypotheses about both the builder and dating.

==== Early Egyptologists ====
Some early [[Egyptologist]]s and excavators of the [[Giza pyramid complex]] believed the Great Sphinx and associated temples to predate the fourth dynasty rule of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. Petrie wrote in 1883 regarding the state of opinion regarding the age of the nearby temples, and by extension the Sphinx: "The date of the Granite Temple [Valley Temple] has been so positively asserted to be earlier than the fourth dynasty, that it may seem rash to dispute the point".&lt;ref&gt;The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, Flinders Petrie London 1883, p133&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, [[Auguste Mariette]], founder of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, unearthed the much later [[Inventory Stela]] (estimated [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty&amp;nbsp;XXVI]], c.&amp;nbsp;678–525&amp;nbsp;BC), which tells how [[Khufu]] came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the Stela are considered good evidence,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zahi Hawass|Hawass, Zahi]]. ([http://guardians.net/hawass/khufu.htm ''The Khufu''] at [http://guardians.net/hawass/ The Plateau]. Retrieved {{Nowrap|6 January}} 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; this passage is widely dismissed as [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Period]] [[historical revisionism]],&lt;ref name="Reader (2002)"&gt;{{cite book | first=Reader | last=Colin | chapter-url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=93 | chapter=Giza Before the Fourth Dynasty | title=Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum | volume=9 | date=2002 | pages=5–21 | deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210134155/http://www.thehallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=93 |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |df= | accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a purposeful fake, created by the local priests with the attempt to certify the contemporary Isis temple an ancient history it never had. Such an act became common when religious institutions such as [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s and priest's domains were fighting for political attention and for financial and economic donations.&lt;ref name="MVTP"&gt;{{cite book|first=Miroslav |last=Verner|title=The Pyramids: The Mystery, Culture, and Science of Egypt's Great Monuments|publisher= Grove/Atlantic Inc.|year= 2007|isbn= 0802198635|page= 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PJDP"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Jánosi|title=Die Pyramidenanlagen der Königinnen (= ''Denkschriften der Gesamtakademie, Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften'', volume 13|year= 1996|isbn= 3700122071| pages= 11, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaston Maspero]], the French Egyptologist and second director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, conducted a survey of the Sphinx in 1886. He concluded that because the Dream stela showed the cartouche of Khafre in line thirteen, it was he who was responsible for the excavation and therefore the Sphinx must predate Khafre and his predecessors—possibly [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty&amp;nbsp;IV]], {{circa|2575–2467 BC}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/egypt/articles/phototr3.html |title=Giza Sphinx &amp; Temples Page 3 - The Great Sphinx - Spirit &amp; Stone |publisher=Theglobaleducationproject.org |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; English Egyptologist [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] agreed that the Sphinx predated Khafre's reign, writing in ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' (1914): "This marvelous object [the Great Sphinx] was in existence in the days of Khafre, or Khephren,{{efn|Early Egyptologists were inconsistent in their transliteration of pharaonic names: ''Khafre'' and ''Khephren'' are both references to Khafra.}} and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|archaic period]] [{{circa|2686 BC}}]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis Budge|first= E. A. |authorlink=E. A. Wallis Budge|year=1904|title= The Gods of the Egyptians: Studies in Egyptian Mythology|publisher=[[Dover Publications|Courier Dover Publications]]|isbn= 0-486-22055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maspero believed the Sphinx to be "the most ancient monument in Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;The Sphinx Its History in the Light of Recent Excavations, Selim Hassan Government Press Cairo 1949, p17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern dissenting hypotheses ====
[[Rainer Stadelmann]], former director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] in Cairo, examined the distinct [[iconography]] of the ''[[nemes]]'' (headdress) and [[#Missing nose and beard|the now-detached beard]] of the Sphinx and concluded the style is more indicative of the Pharaoh [[Khufu]] (2589–2566&amp;nbsp;BC), known to the Greeks as Cheops, builder of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] and Khafra's father.&lt;ref name="Fleming (2004)"/&gt; He supports this by suggesting Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.&lt;ref name="Reader (2002)"/&gt;

[[Colin Reader]], an English [[geologist]] who independently conducted a more recent survey of the enclosure, agrees the various quarries on the site have been excavated around the Causeway. Because these quarries are known to have been used by Khufu, Reader concludes that the Causeway (and the temples on either end thereof) must predate Khufu, thereby casting doubt on the [[conventional Egyptian chronology]].&lt;ref name="Reader (2002)"/&gt;

Frank Domingo, a [[forensic science|forensic scientist]] in the [[New York City Police Department]] and an expert [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologist]],&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Karen T., [http://www.theiai.org/disciplines/art/history.php ''History of the IAI Forensic Art Discipline''] at the [[International Association for Identification]]. Retrieved {{Nowrap|5 January}} 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; used detailed measurements of the Sphinx, [[forensic arts|forensic drawings]] and [[computer graphics|computer imaging]] to conclude the face depicted on the Sphinx is not the same face as is depicted on a statue attributed to Khafra.&lt;ref&gt;West, John Anthony (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0S1qpP7By9IC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232 ''Serpent in the Sky: The High Wisdom of Ancient Egypt''], 232. [[Wheaton, Illinois|Wheaton]]: [[Quest Books#Publications|Quest Books]], 1993. {{ISBN|0-8356-0691-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale]] in Cairo announced he had uncovered new evidence the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known Pharaoh [[Djedefre]] (2528–2520&amp;nbsp;BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu.&lt;ref name="Riddle of the Sphinx"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/history-archaeology/riddle-of-the-sphinx/ Riddle of the Sphinx] Retrieved {{Nowrap|6 November}} 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god [[Ra]] in order to restore respect for [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|their dynasty]]. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx, suggesting it was already in existence at the time.&lt;ref name="Fleming (2004)"&gt;Fleming, Nic (2004-12-14).

==== Water erosion hypothesis ====
{{main|Sphinx water erosion hypothesis}}
The Sphinx water erosion hypothesis contends that the main type of [[weathering]] evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive [[rainfall]],&lt;ref name="Schoch (1992)"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schoch | first=Robert M. | date=1992 | url=http://www.robertschoch.net/Redating%20the%20Great%20Sphinx%20of%20Giza.htm | title=Redating the Great Sphinx of Giza | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204134600/http://www.robertschoch.net/Redating%20the%20Great%20Sphinx%20of%20Giza.htm |archivedate=2016-02-04| accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and must therefore predate the time of the pharaoh Khafra.

The hypothesis is championed by [[R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz|René Schwaller de Lubicz]] (1887–1961), who lived and studied Egyptology for 12 years in Egypt, and by [[Robert M. Schoch]], a [[geologist]] and associate professor of [[natural science]] at the College of General Studies at [[Boston University]], as well as by [[John Anthony West]], an author and alternative Egyptologist.

Colin Reader, a British geologist, studied the erosion patterns and noticed that they are found predominantly on the western enclosure wall and not on the Sphinx itself.  He proposed the rainfall water runoff hypothesis, which also recognizes climate change transitions in the area.&lt;ref&gt;White, Chris "The Age of the Sphinx?

==== The Great Sphinx as Anubis ====
Author [[Robert K. G. Temple]] proposes that the Sphinx was originally a statue of the Jackal-Dog [[Anubis]], the God of the Necropolis, and that its face was recarved in the likeness of a Middle Kingdom pharaoh, [[Amenemhet II]]. Temple bases his identification on the style of the eye make-up and style of the pleats on the headdress.&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. G. Temple, ''The Sphinx Mystery: The Forgotten Origins of The Sanctuary of Anubis'' (Rochester, Vermont: Inner Traditions, 2009). {{ISBN|978-1-59477-271-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Racial characteristics ====
Over the years several authors have commented on what they perceive as "Negroid" characteristics in the face of the Sphinx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regier|first=Willis G.

== Restoration ==
At some unknown time the Giza Necropolis was abandoned, and the Sphinx was eventually buried up to its shoulders in sand. The first documented attempt at an excavation dates to {{circa|1400 BC}}, when the young [[Thutmose&amp;nbsp;IV]] (1401–1391 or 1397–1388&amp;nbsp;BC) gathered a team and, after much effort, managed to dig out the front paws, between which he placed a [[granite]] slab, known as the [[Dream Stele]], inscribed with the following excerpt:
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sphinx in 1925.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Sphinx undergoing restoration, 26&amp;nbsp;December 1925]] --&gt;

{{quote|... the royal son, Thothmos, being arrived, while walking at midday and seating himself under the shadow of this mighty god, was overcome by slumber and slept at the very moment when Ra is at the summit [of heaven]. He found that the Majesty of this august god spoke to him with his own mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: Look upon me, contemplate me, O my son Thothmos; I am thy father, Harmakhis-[[Khepri|Khopri]]-[[Ra]]-[[Atum|Tum]]; I bestow upon thee the sovereignty over my domain, the supremacy over the living&amp;nbsp;...

Retrieved {{Nowrap|3 January}} 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, [[Ramesses II|Ramesses II the Great]] (1279–1213&amp;nbsp;BC) may have undertaken a second excavation.

[[Mark Lehner]], an [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who has excavated and mapped the Giza plateau, originally asserted that there had been a far earlier renovation during the [[Old Kingdom]] (c.&amp;nbsp;2686–2184&amp;nbsp;BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13 |title=The ARCE Sphinx Project—A Preliminary Report |publisher=Hall of Maat |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he has subsequently recanted this viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianlawton.com/as1.htm |title='Khufu Knew the Sphinx' by Colin Reader |publisher=Ianlawton.com |accessdate=May 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802024916/http://www.ianlawton.com/as1.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 1817 the first modern [[Archaeology|archaeological]] dig, supervised by the Italian [[Giovanni Battista Caviglia]], uncovered the Sphinx's chest completely.

One of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was [[Eugène Grébaut]], a French Director of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Antiquities Service]]&lt;ref name="SCAHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA): 1858 to present|url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/sca_history.htm|website=SCA - Egypt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017043511/http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/SCA_History.htm|archivedate=2016-10-17|df=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|In the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible.

Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of [[Thutmose IV|Thûtmosis IV]] was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx.&lt;ref name="HistoryofEgypt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappoport|first1=S.|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of History Of Egypt From 330 B.C.

The entire Sphinx was finally excavated in 1925 to 1936, in digs led by [[Émile Baraize]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1931 engineers of the Egyptian government repaired the head of the Sphinx. Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science Monthly'', July 1931, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; This questionable repair was by the addition of a concrete collar between the headdress and the neck, creating an altered profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancient-code.com/filmed-1897-oldest-footage-great-sphinx-giza/|title=Filmed in 1897, THIS is the OLDEST footage of the Great Sphinx of Giza - Ancient Code|website=www.ancient-code.com|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many renovations to the stone base and raw rock body were done in the 1980s, and then redone in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardians.net/hawass/sphinx2.htm|title=HISTORY OF THE CONSERVATION OF THE SPHINX| first=Zahi | last=Hawass|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missing nose and beard ==
[[File:Sphinx of Giza 9059.jpg|thumb|left|The Sphinx profile in 2010]]

The one-metre-wide nose on the face is missing. Examination of the Sphinx's face shows that long rods or [[chisels]] were hammered into the nose, one down from the bridge and one beneath the nostril, then used to pry the nose off towards the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lehner | first = Mark | authorlink = | title = The Complete Pyramids | publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson | year = 1997 | location = | page = 41 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-05084-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab historian [[Al-Maqrizi|al-Maqrīzī]], writing in the 15th century, attributes the loss of the nose to [[iconoclasm]] by Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr—a [[Sufi]] Muslim from the [[khanqah]] of Sa'id al-Su'ada—in AD&amp;nbsp;1378, upon finding the local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest. Enraged, he destroyed the nose, and was later hanged for [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/faq/c_sphinx.html |title=Faq#11: Who shot off the nose of the Sphinx? |publisher=napoleon-series.org |accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Maqrīzī describes the Sphinx as the "[[talisman]] of the Nile" on which the locals believed the [[Season of the Inundation|flood cycle]] depended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arabic Humanities, Islamic Thought: Essays in Honor of Everett K.

[[File:Beard of the sphinx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Limestone]] fragments of the Sphinx's beard in the [[British Museum]], 14th Century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/f/fragment_of_the_beard_of_the_g.aspx|title=British Museum - Fragment of the beard of the Great Sphinx|work=britishmuseum.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027041754/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/f/fragment_of_the_beard_of_the_g.aspx|archivedate=2015-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is a story that the nose was broken off by a cannonball fired by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s soldiers. Other variants indict British troops, the [[Mamluk]]s, and others. Sketches of the Sphinx by the Dane [[Frederic Louis Norden]], made in 1738 and published in 1757, show the Sphinx missing its nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/image/37200|title=F.L. Norden. Travels in Egypt and Nubia, 1757. Plate 47, Profil de la tête colossale du Sphinx|accessdate=January 24, 2014|website=Brooklyn Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; This predates Napoleon's birth in 1769.

In addition to the lost nose, a [[Pharaoh#Regalia|ceremonial pharaonic beard]] is thought to have been attached, although this may have been added in later periods after the original construction. Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev has suggested that had the beard been an original part of the Sphinx, it would have damaged the chin of the statue upon falling.&lt;ref name="Fleming (2004)"/&gt; The lack of visible damage supports his theory that the beard was a later addition.

Residues of red pigment are visible on areas of the Sphinx's face. Traces of yellow and blue pigment have been found elsewhere on the Sphinx, leading [[Mark Lehner]] to suggest that the monument "was once decked out in gaudy comic book colors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/uncovering-secrets-of-the-sphinx-5053442/?no-ist=&amp;page=2|title=Uncovering Secrets of the Sphinx|work=Smithsonian Magazine|author=Evan Hadingham|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Colin Reader has proposed that the Sphinx was probably the focus of solar worship in the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]], before the Giza Plateau became a necropolis in the [[Old Kingdom]] ({{circa|2686–2134 BC}}).&lt;ref name="Reader (2000)"&gt;Reader, Colin (2000-03-17). [http://www.ianlawton.com/as4.htm ''Further considerations on the Age of the Sphinx''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010615/http://www.ianlawton.com/as4.htm |date=2015-06-02 }} at [http://www.ianlawton.com/ Rational Spirituality]. Retrieved {{Nowrap|6 January}} 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ties this in with his conclusions that the Sphinx, the Sphinx temple, the Causeway and the Khafra mortuary temple are all part of a complex which predates Dynasty&amp;nbsp;IV ({{circa|2613–2494 BC}}). The lion has long been a symbol associated with the sun in [[ancient Near East]]ern civilizations. Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies date as far back as the Early Dynastic Period.

In the [[New Kingdom]], the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the god ''Hor-em-akhet'' ([[Hellenization|Hellenized]]: ''Harmachis'') or "Horus-at-the-Horizon", which represented the [[pharaoh]] in his role as the ''Shesep-ankh'' (English: ''Living Image'') of the god [[Atum]]. Pharaoh [[Amenhotep&amp;nbsp;II]] (1427–1401 or 1397&amp;nbsp;BC) built a temple to the north east of the Sphinx nearly 1000 years after its construction, and dedicated it to the cult of ''Hor-em-akhet''.

==Reception==
In the last 700 years, there has been a proliferation of travellers and reports from [[Lower Egypt]], unlike [[Upper Egypt]], which was seldom reported from prior to the mid-18th century. [[Alexandria]], [[Rosetta]], [[Damietta]], [[Cairo]] and the Giza Pyramids are described repeatedly, but not necessarily comprehensively.  Many accounts were published and widely read.  These include those of [[George Sandys]], [[André Thévet]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Balthasar de Monconys]], [[Jean de Thévenot]], [[John Greaves]], [[Johann Michael Vansleb]], [[Benoît de Maillet]], [[Cornelis de Bruijn]], [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], [[Richard Pococke]], [[Frederic Louis Norden]] and others. But there is an even larger set of more anonymous people who wrote obscure and little-read works, sometimes only unpublished manuscripts in libraries or private collections, including Henry Castela, Hans Ludwig von Lichtenstein, Michael Heberer von Bretten, [[Wilhelm von Boldensele]], [[Pierre Belon du Mans]], [[Vincent Stochove]], [[Kryštof Harant|Christophe Harant]], Gilles Fermanel, Robert Fauvel, Jean Palerne Foresien, Willian Lithgow, [[Joos van Ghistele]], etc.

Over the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx.  The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A typical description of the Sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the 19th and 20th century was made by [[John Lawson Stoddard]]:
{{quotation|It is the antiquity of the Sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it, for in itself it has no charms. The desert's waves have risen to its breast, as if to wrap the monster in a winding-sheet of gold. The face and head have been mutilated by Moslem fanatics. The mouth, the beauty of whose lips was once admired, is now expressionless. Yet grand in its loneliness, – veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages, – the relic of Egyptian antiquity stands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert&amp;nbsp;– symbol of eternity. Here it disputes with Time the empire of the past; forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we, like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=John L. Stoddard's Lectures | date=1898 | volume=2 | page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the 16th century far into the 19th century, observers repeatedly noted that the Sphinx has the face, neck and breast of a woman.  Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), [[George Sandys]] (1615), [[Johann Michael Vansleb]] (1677), [[Benoît de Maillet]] (1735) and [[Elliot Warburton]] (1844).

Most early Western images were book illustrations in [[printmaking|print]] form, elaborated by a professional [[engraver]] from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost.  Seven years after visiting Giza, André Thévet (''Cosmographie de Levant'', 1556) described the Sphinx as "the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue, reflecting his ability to conceptualize (''Turris Babel'', 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Thévet is that the hair suggests the flaring lappets of the headdress. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a [[harlot]]; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, while [[François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz]]'s Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar.

Richard Pococke's Sphinx was an adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous.  The print versions of Norden's careful drawings for his ''[[Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie]]'', 1755 are the first to clearly show that the nose was missing.  However, from the time of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt onwards, a number of accurate images were widely available in Europe, and copied by others.

===Legacy===
''Mystery of the Sphinx'', narrated by [[Charlton Heston]], a documentary presenting the theories of [[John Anthony West]], was shown as an [[NBC]] Special on 10 November 1993 (winning an [[Emmy]] award for Best Research{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}) A 95-minute DVD, ''Mystery of the Sphinx: Expanded Edition'', was released in 2007. ''Age of the Sphinx'', a [[BBC Two]] [[Timewatch]] documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West and critical to both sides of the argument, was shown on 27 November 1994. In [[2008 in film|2008]], the film ''[[10,000 BC (film)|10,000&amp;nbsp;BC]]'' showed a supposed original Sphinx with a lion's head. Before this film, this lion head theory had been published in [[documentary film]]s about the origin of the Sphinx.

The '''Gulf Refinery''' at Milford Haven was an [[oil refinery]] situated on the Pembrokeshire coast in [[Wales]]. The refinery, originally owned by [[Gulf Oil]], was opened in August 1968 by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pembrokeshirefishweek.co.uk/objview.asp?Language=&amp;object_id=4024 |title=The Oil Industry in Pembrokeshire: Topic List |page=7 |publisher=Pembrokeshire County Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to {{convert|119000|oilbbl}} of oil could be processed a day at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHEVRON TO SELL BRITISH REFINERY AND STATIONS TO SHELL |date=1997-08-22 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/22/business/chevron-to-sell-british-refinery-and-stations-to-shell.html |publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Milford Haven Line}}

The refinery closed down in December 1997, as part of plans by the [[Chevron Corporation]], by then the owners of Gulf Oil, to withdraw from the downstream oil business in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/company/cne83681.htm |title=Petroplus wants to buy Milford Haven from Chevron}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the site is occupied by the SemLogistics oil depot and the [[Dragon LNG terminal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dragon LNG Company History |url=http://www.dragonlng.co.uk/companyhistory.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2115">'''InSinkErator''' is a company and brand name known for producing instant hot water dispensers and [[food waste]] disposal systems, generally called "[[garbage disposal]]s" or "garbage disposers". The company was founded in [[Racine, Wisconsin]] by '''John W. Hammes''', who was working as an [[architect]] there. Hammes is credited with inventing the "in-sink" food waste disposal in 1927, for his wife. It works by grinding and shredding solid food waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/22/AR2007082200724.html | title=Grist for the Daily Grind | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | author=Denise DiFulco | date=August 23, 2007 | accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent ten years improving the design and  went into business selling the appliance. His company was called the In-Sink-Erator Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/kstartinventions/a/kitchen.htm Kitchen appliance inventions] About.com&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a play on the word "[[incinerator]]" and refers to the fact that the mouth of the disposal unit is located "in" the "[[sink]]".

The company was acquired in 1968 and is now a division of Emerson Appliance Solutions, part of [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] (NYSE: EMR), a global technology and engineering company which serves industrial, commercial, and consumer markets.

In 2006 In-Sink-Erator changed their name to InSinkErator, and redesigned the company logo. They also released a re-engineered line of high technology disposers branded as the Evolution Series.

InSinkErator is headquartered in [[Racine, Wisconsin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2346">'''Intel Display Power Saving Technology '''or '''Intel DPST '''is an [[Intel]] [[backlight]] control technology. Intel claims that [[Flat panel display|display]] take up most power in mobile devices and reducing [[backlight]] linearly affects energy footprint. Intel DPST technology aims to adaptively reduce [[backlight]] brightness while maintaining satisfactory visual performance. The Intel DPST subsystem analyzes the image to be displayed and it uses a set of algorithms to change the [[Colorfulness|chroma value]] of [[pixels]] while reducing the [[brightness]] of backlight simultaneously such that there is minimum perceived visual degradation. When the frame to be projected and the frame being projected has considerable difference a [[software interrupt]] is asserted and new chroma values for pixels and brightness values are calculated. The current version is Intel DPST 6.0. Intel claims that the current DPST version reduces [[backlight]] power by 70% for [[DVD]] workloads.

The '''Jebel al Zayt oil spill''' occurred north of the [[Red Sea]] on June 16, 2010. It is considered to be the largest offshore spill in Egyptian history. The spill polluted around 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) of coastline including tourist beach resorts.&lt;ref name=israel /&gt; Oil company officials in the port city of [[Suez Canal|Suez]] said the spill was caused by a leak from an offshore oil platform in Jebel al-Zayt north of Hurghada owned by the Egyptian government's state-owned oil company, Geisum Oil.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Probes Source of Red Sea Resort Oil Spill, May Limit Rigs|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-22/egypt-investigates-the-source-of-red-sea-resort-oil-spill-may-limit-rigs.html|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=22 June 2010|author=Galal, Ola|author2=Williams, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impacts==

The [[oil spill]] occurred in [[Egypt]], north of the Red Sea. It polluted several tourist areas along the coastline of the Red Sea. The spill damaged areas that are home to popular diving sites with extensive underwater [[coral reef]]s.&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Jon|title=Red Sea: the other oil spill|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/egypt/100715/red-sea-the-other-oil-spill?page=0,1|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Globalpost|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of beaches and resorts along the coast were affected greatly. Marine life in the [[Hurghada]] area was at risk of heavy damage but it was later discovered that there was very little damage to the marine life. Scientists believe that the environmental damage was limited due to strong currents and winds that pushed the oil quickly away from the underwater coral reefs, and towards the shoreline of Hurghada.&lt;ref name=jensen /&gt; The affected areas have rich [[biodiversity]] that has a fragile [[ecosystem]]. Although it was unaffected environmentalist are still worried about disasters in the future and the potential danger it could inflict to the marine life.

==Clean-up==

An extensive cleaning initiative was implemented for the areas affected and damaged by the oil companies. Within 5 days of the spill over 90% of the impacted beaches and mainland had been cleaned.&lt;ref name=bloom /&gt; Although damage to wild life was still evident with [[turtle]]s and [[sea bird]]s covered in oil. Small oil spills are frequent in the area due to a number of offshore drilling sites. There are over 180 oil rigs operating in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez which accounts for a large percentage of the economy.&lt;ref name=bloom /&gt;

==Government cover up accusations ==

The Egyptian government has been accused of trying to cover up this disaster. [[Environmentalist]]s in the area believe the government wanted to release as little information as possible in order to keep resorts in the area open for business.&lt;ref name=israel&gt;{{cite news|last=Julian|first=Hana|title=Egyptian Oil Spill Befouls Red Sea Resorts|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138250#.UgsEWNK-ods|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Israel National News|date=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also wanted tourists who had arrived for diving to continue visiting the area. These popular sites account for a large percentage of the tourism industry in Egypt. The tourism industry is one of the most important sectors in [[Economy of Egypt|Egypt’s economy]]. The initial leak was first reported on June 18, 2010 but many believe it began days before.&lt;ref name=jensen /&gt; Although damage has been reported to be minimal an environmental group in the area reported the leak had restarted once the statement was released, damaging the surrounding areas even further. The [[Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association]] (HEPA) reported that hundreds of birds, turtles, and other wild life had been killed, but the government reported almost no deaths of wild life.&lt;ref name=Picow&gt;{{cite news|last=Picow|first=Maurice|title=Red Sea Oil Spill Cover-Up Worse than Reported|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2010/06/red-sea-oil-spill/|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=The Green Prophet|date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of oil that had leaked is still unknown, this has critics asking the government further questions as to why they have released such little information. Also the government is unable to determine the source of the spill or how it began.

Few media outlets reported on this oil spill due to the [[BP oil spill]] which overshadowed this issue. The [[BP oil spill]] which was one of the largest accidental oil spills in history. It happened weeks before the Egypt oil spill had occurred.

Laughlin|Robert Laughlin]] for the [[ground state]] of a [[two-dimensional electron gas]] placed in a uniform background [[magnetic field]] in the presence of a uniform [[jellium]] background when the [[filling factor (Quantum Hall effect)]] of the [[lowest Landau level]] is &lt;math&gt;\nu=1/n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an odd positive integer. It was constructed to explain the observation of the &lt;math&gt;\nu=1/3&lt;/math&gt;  [[fractional quantum Hall effect]], and predicted the existence of additional &lt;math&gt;\nu = 1/n&lt;/math&gt; states as well as quasiparticle excitations with fractional electric charge &lt;math&gt;e/n&lt;/math&gt;, both of which were later experimentally observed. Laughlin received one third of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1998 for this discovery. Being a trial wavefunction, it is not exact, but qualitatively, it reproduces many features of the exact solution and quantitatively, it has very high overlaps with the exact ground state for small systems.

If we ignore the jellium and mutual [[Coulomb repulsion]] between the electrons as a zeroth order approximation, we have an infinitely degenerate lowest Landau level (LLL) and with a filling factor of 1/n, we'd expect that all of the electrons would lie in the LLL. Turning on the interactions, we can make the approximation that all of the electrons lie in the LLL. If &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the single particle wavefunction of the LLL state with the lowest [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]], then the Laughlin ansatz for the multiparticle wavefunction is

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle z_1,z_2,z_3,\ldots , z_N \mid n,N\rangle
=
\psi_{n,N}(z_1,z_2, z_3, \ldots, z_N ) 
=
D \left[ \prod_{N \geqslant i &gt; j \geqslant 1}\left( z_i-z_j \right)^n \right] \prod^N_{k=1}\exp\left( - \mid z_k \mid^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where position is denoted by

:&lt;math&gt;z={1 \over 2 \mathit l_B} \left( x + iy\right) &lt;/math&gt;

in ([[Gaussian units]])

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit l_B = \sqrt{\hbar c\over e B} &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; are coordinates in the xy plane. Here &lt;math&gt; \hbar &lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]], &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the total  number of particles, and &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic field]], which is perpendicular to the xy plane. The subscripts on z identify the particle. In order for the wavefunction to describe [[fermion]]s, n must be an odd integer. This forces the wavefunction to be antisymmetric under particle interchange. The angular momentum for this state is &lt;math&gt; n\hbar &lt;/math&gt;.

==Energy of interaction for two particles==
[[Image:101017 Expectation value vs l.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1. Interaction energy vs. &lt;math&gt;{\mathit l}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=7&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_Br_B=20&lt;/math&gt;. The energy is in units of &lt;math&gt;{e^2 \over L_B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the minima occur for &lt;math&gt;{\mathit l} =3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathit l} =4&lt;/math&gt;. In general the minima occur at &lt;math&gt;{\mathit l \over n} = {1\over 2} \pm {1\over 2n}&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The Laughlin wavefunction is the multiparticle wavefunction for [[quasiparticle]]s. The [[expectation value]] of the interaction energy for a pair of quasiparticles is 

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle V \rangle
=
\langle  n, N \mid V \mid n, N\rangle, \; \; \; N=2

&lt;/math&gt;

where the screened potential is (see [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange#Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field|Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field]])

:&lt;math&gt;
 V\left( r_{12}\right)
=
\left( { 2 e^2 \over  L_B}\right)  \int_0^{\infty}  {{k\;dk \;} \over 
 k^2 + k_B^2 r_{B}^2  }
\; M \left ( \mathit l + 1, 1, -{k^2 \over 4} \right) \;M \left ( \mathit l^{\prime} + 1, 1, -{k^2 \over 4} \right) \;\mathcal J_0 \left ( k{r_{12}\over r_{B}} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[confluent hypergeometric function]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal J_0&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bessel function]] of the first kind. Here, &lt;math&gt;r_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the centers of two current loops, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt;r_{B}= \sqrt{2} \mathit l_B&lt;/math&gt; is the quantum version of the [[Larmor radius]], and &lt;math&gt;L_B&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the electron gas in the direction of the magnetic field. The [[angular momentum|angular momenta]] of the two individual current loops are &lt;math&gt;\mathit l \hbar&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit l^{\prime} \hbar&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathit l + \mathit l^{\prime} = n&lt;/math&gt;. The inverse screening length is given by ([[Gaussian units]])

:&lt;math&gt;
 k_B^2  = {4 \pi e^2 \over \hbar \omega_c A L_B}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_c &lt;/math&gt; is the [[cyclotron frequency]], and &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is the area of the electron gas in the xy plane.

The interaction energy evaluates to:
::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|
:&lt;math&gt;
 E=
 
\left( { 2 e^2 \over  L_B}\right)  \int_0^{\infty}  {{k\;dk \;} \over 
 k^2 + k_B^2 r_{B}^2  }
\; M \left ( \mathit l + 1, 1, -{k^2 \over 4} \right) \;M \left ( \mathit l^{\prime} + 1, 1, -{k^2 \over 4} \right) \;M \left ( n + 1, 1, -{k^2 \over 2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
[[Image:101021 energy vs n.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Figure 2. Interaction energy vs. &lt;math&gt;{n}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; {\mathit l\over n}={1\over 2} \pm {1\over 2n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_Br_B=0.1,1.0,10&lt;/math&gt;. The energy is in units of &lt;math&gt;{e^2 \over L_B}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

To obtain this result we have made the change of integration variables 

:&lt;math&gt;
u_{12} = {z_1 - z_2 \over \sqrt{2} }
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
v_{12} = {z_1 + z_2 \over \sqrt{2} }
&lt;/math&gt;

and noted (see [[Common integrals in quantum field theory#Integration over a magnetic wave function|Common integrals in quantum field theory]])

:&lt;math&gt;
{1 \over \left( 2 \pi\right)^2\; 2^{2n} \; n! }
\int d^2z_1 \; d^2z_2 \; \mid z_1 - z_2 \mid^{2n} \; \exp \left[ - 2 \left( \mid z_1 \mid^2 + \mid z_2\mid^2 \right) \right] \;\mathcal J_0 \left ( \sqrt{2}\; { k\mid z_1 - z_2 \mid  } \right)
=
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{1 \over \left( 2 \pi\right)^2\; 2^{n} \; n! }
\int d^2u_{12} \; d^2v_{12} \; \mid u_{12}\mid^{2n} \; \exp \left[ - 2 \left( \mid u_{12}\mid^2 + \mid v_{12}\mid^2 \right) \right] \;\mathcal J_0 \left ( {2} k\mid u_{12} \mid \right)
=
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
M \left ( n + 1, 1, -{k^2 \over 2 } \right)
.&lt;/math&gt;

The interaction energy has minima for (Figure 1)

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathit l \over n} ={1\over 3}, {2\over 5}, {3\over 7}, \mbox{etc.,} &lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathit l \over n} ={2\over3}, {3\over 5}, {4\over 7}, \mbox{etc.} &lt;/math&gt;

For these values of the ratio of angular momenta, the energy is plotted in Figure 2 as a function of &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Lignoceric acid''', or '''tetracosanoic acid''', is the [[Fatty_acid#Saturated_fatty_acids|saturated fatty acid]] with formula C&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;47&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. It is found in [[wood tar]], various [[cerebroside]]s, and in small amounts in most natural [[fat]]s. The fatty acids of [[peanut oil]] contain small amounts of lignoceric acid (1.1% – 2.2%).&lt;ref name="lexicon" /&gt; This fatty acid is also a byproduct of [[lignin]] production.

Reduction of lignoceric acid yields [[lignoceryl alcohol]].

'''Magnetic pressure''' is an [[energy density]] associated with a [[magnetic field]]. Any magnetic field has an associated magnetic pressure contained by the boundary conditions on the field. It is identical to any other physical [[pressure]] except that it is carried by the magnetic field rather than (in the case of a [[gas]]) by the [[kinetic energy]] of gas molecules. A gradient in field strength causes a force due to the magnetic [[pressure gradient]] called the '''magnetic pressure force'''.

The magnetic pressure force is readily observed in an unsupported loop of [[wire]]. If an [[electric current]] passes through the loop, the wire serves as an [[electromagnet]], such that the magnetic field strength inside the loop is much greater than the field strength just outside the loop.  This gradient in field strength gives rise to a magnetic pressure force that tends to stretch the wire uniformly outward.  If enough current travels through the wire, the loop of wire will form a [[circle]]. At even higher currents, the magnetic pressure can create [[tensile stress]] that exceeds the [[tensile strength]] of the wire, causing it to fracture, or even explosively fragment. Thus, management of magnetic pressure is a significant challenge in the design of ultrastrong electromagnets.

The force (in [[Centimeter gram second system of units|cgs]]) {{math|'''F'''}} exerted on a coil by its own current is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garren|1994|p=3425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 \mathbf{F} =\dfrac{I^2}{c^2R} \left[\ln\left(\dfrac{8R}{a}\right) - 1 + Y\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''Y'' is the internal inductance of the coil, defined by the distribution of current. ''Y'' is 0 for high frequency currents carried mostly by the outer surface of the conductor, and 0.25 for DC currents distributed evenly throughout the conductor. See [[inductance]] for more information.

Interplay between magnetic pressure and ordinary gas pressure is important to [[magnetohydrodynamics]] and [[plasma physics]]. Magnetic pressure can also be used to propel [[projectiles]]; this is the operating principle of a [[railgun]].

If any currents present are parallel to a magnetic field, the field lines follow shapes in which the magnetic pressure gradient is balanced by the [[magnetic tension force]]. Such a field configuration is called [[force-free magnetic field|force-free]] because there is no [[Lorentz force]] (&lt;math&gt;j\times B=0&lt;/math&gt;).  The familiar [[potential magnetic field]] is a special case of a force-free field: potential field configurations occupy space that contains no electric current at all.

The magnetic pressure &lt;math&gt;P_B&lt;/math&gt; is given in [[International System of Units|SI]] units (''P'' in [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]], ''B'' in [[Tesla (unit)|T]], [[Permeability constant|μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[Henry (unit)|H]]/m) by

:&lt;math&gt;P_B = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;

and in [[Centimeter gram second system of units|cgs]] units (''P'' in [[Barye|dyn/cm²]], ''B'' in [[Gauss (unit)|G]]) by

:&lt;math&gt;P_B = \frac{B^2}{8\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.
In practical units,
::&lt;math&gt;P_B \mathrm{[bar]} = \left(\frac{B\mathrm{[T]}}{0.501} \right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Great-plate-count-anomaly.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The great plate count anomaly. Counts of cells obtained via cultivation are orders of magnitude lower than those directly observed under the microscope. This is because microbiologists are able to cultivate only a minority of naturally occurring microbes using current laboratory techniques, depending on the environment.&lt;ref name="hugenholz2002" /&gt;]]
'''Microbial ecology''' (or '''environmental microbiology''') is the [[ecology]] of [[microorganism]]s: their relationship with one another and with their environment. It concerns the three major [[domain (biology)|domains]] of life—[[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]], [[Archaea]], and [[Bacteria]]—as well as [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name="BartonNorthup2011" /&gt;

Microorganisms, by their omnipresence, impact the entire [[biosphere]]. Microbial life plays a primary role in regulating [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] systems in virtually all of our planet's environments, including some of the most [[extremophiles|extreme]], from [[Antarctica|frozen environments]] and acidic lakes, to [[hydrothermal vents]] at the bottom of deepest oceans, and some of the most familiar, such as the human [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name="bowler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="konopka"/&gt;  As a consequence of the quantitative magnitude of microbial life (Whitman and coworkers calculated {{val|5.0|e=30}} cells, eight orders of magnitude greater than the number of stars in the observable universe&lt;ref name="whitman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfram"/&gt;) microbes, by virtue of their [[biomass]] alone, constitute a significant [[carbon sink]].&lt;ref name="ReddyDeLaune2004"/&gt; Aside from carbon fixation, microorganisms' key collective metabolic processes (including [[nitrogen fixation]], [[Methanogenesis|methane metabolism]], and [[sulfur metabolism]]) control global biogeochemical cycling.&lt;ref name="delong"/&gt; The immensity of microorganisms' production is such that, even in the total absence of eukaryotic life, these processes would likely continue unchanged.&lt;ref name="Lupp"/&gt;

== History ==
While microbes have been studied since the seventeenth-century, this research was from a primarily physiological perspective rather than an ecological one.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt; For instance, [[Louis Pasteur]] and his disciples were interested in the problem of microbial distribution both on land and in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Antony|last2=Dücker|first2=Erik|date=2017-04-05|title=When Pasteurian Science Went to Sea: The Birth of Marine Microbiology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|language=en|pages=1–27|doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8|issn=0022-5010|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martinus Beijerinck]] invented the [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying [[microbe]]s from the environment.  He is often incorrectly credited with framing the [[microbial biogeography|microbial biogeographic]] idea that "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects", which was stated by [[Lourens Baas Becking]].&lt;ref name="deWit2006"/&gt; [[Sergei Winogradsky]] was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand [[microorganisms]] outside of the medical context—making him among the first students of microbial ecology and environmental microbiology—discovering [[chemosynthesis]], and developing the [[Winogradsky column]] in the process.&lt;ref name="brock"/&gt;{{rp|644}}

Beijerinck and Windogradsky, however, were focused on the physiology of microorganisms, not the microbial [[habitat]] or their ecological interactions.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt; Modern microbial ecology was launched by [[Robert Hungate]] and coworkers, who investigated the [[rumen]] ecosystem. The study of the rumen required Hungate to develop techniques for culturing anaerobic microbes, and he also pioneered a quantitative approach to the study of microbes and their ecological activities that differentiated the relative contributions of species and [[catabolic pathway]]s.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt;

==Roles==
Microorganisms are the backbone of all [[ecosystem]]s, but even more so in the zones where photosynthesis is unable to take place because of the absence of light. In such zones, [[chemosynthetic]] microbes provide energy and [[carbon]] to the other organisms.

Other microbes are [[decomposer]]s, with the ability to recycle [[nutrient]]s from other organisms' waste products.  These microbes play a vital role in biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name="FenchelBlackburn2012" /&gt; The [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[phosphorus cycle]], the [[sulphur cycle]] and the [[carbon cycle]] all depend on microorganisms in one way or another. For example, the [[nitrogen gas]] which makes up 78% of the earth's atmosphere is unavailable to most organisms, until it is converted to a biologically available form by the microbial process of [[nitrogen fixation]].

Due to the high level of [[horizontal gene transfer]] among microbial communities,&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"/&gt; microbial ecology is also of importance to studies of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="smets"/&gt;

== Symbiosis ==
Microbes, especially bacteria, often engage in [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships (either [[Mutualism (biology)|positive]] or [[Parasitism|negative]]) with other microorganisms or larger organisms. Although physically small, symbiotic relationships amongst microbes are significant in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] processes and their evolution.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/777261246 |title=Processes in microbial ecology |last=L. |first=Kirchman, David |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199586936 |location=Oxford |oclc=777261246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=López-García |first=Purificación |last2=Eme |first2=Laura |last3=Moreira |first3=David |date=2017-12-07 |title=Symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317300954 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |series=The origin of mitosing cells: 50th anniversary of a classic paper by Lynn Sagan (Margulis) |volume=434 |issue=Supplement C |pages=20–33 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of symbiotic relationship that microbes participate in include [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]], [[parasitism]],&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317664342 |title=The microbial challenge : science, disease, and public health |last=I. |first=Krasner, Robert |date=2010 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |isbn=978-0763756895 |edition=2nd |location=Sudbury, Mass. |oclc=317664342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amensalism,&lt;ref name="Microbial interactions2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Faust |first1=Karoline |last2=Raes |first2=Jeroen |date=16 July 2012 |title=Microbial interactions: from networks to models |journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=538–550 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro2832 |pmid=22796884}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these relationships affect the ecosystem in many ways.

=== Mutualism ===
Mutualism in microbial ecology is a relationship between microbial species and between microbial species and humans that allow for both sides to benefit.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53231924 |title=Understanding bacteria |last=Sheela. |first=Srivastava, |date=2003 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |others=Srivastava, P. S. (Prem S.) |isbn=1402016336 |location=Dordrecht |oclc=53231924}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such example would be [[syntrophy]], also known as cross-feeding,&lt;ref name="Microbial interactions2"/&gt; which is clearly shown in Methanobacterium omelianskii. Although initially thought of as one microbial species, this system is actually two species - an S organism and Methabacterium bryantii. The S organism provides the bacterium with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which the bacterium needs in order to grow and produce methane.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=López-García |first=Purificación |last2=Eme |first2=Laura |last3=Moreira |first3=David |date=December 2017 |title=Symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317300954 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |series=The origin of mitosing cells: 50th anniversary of a classic paper by Lynn Sagan (Margulis) |volume=434 |issue=Supplement C |pages=20–33 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reaction used by the S organism for the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Endergonic reaction|endergonic]] (and so thermodynamically unfavored) however, when coupled to the reaction used by Methabacterium bryantii in its production of methane, the overall reaction becomes [[Exergonic process|exergonic]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;Thus the two organisms are in a mutualistic relationship which allows them to grow and thrive in an environment, deadly for either species alone. [[Lichen]] is an example of a symbiotic organism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Amensalism ===
Amensalism (also commonly known as antagonism) is a type of symbiotic relationship where one species/organism is harmed while the other remains unaffected.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; One example of such a relationship that takes place in microbial ecology is between the microbial species [[Lactobacillus casei]] and [[Pseudomonas taetrolens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=García |first=Cristina |last2=Rendueles |first2=Manuel |last3=Díaz |first3=Mario |date=September 2017 |title=Synbiotic Fermentation for the Co-Production of Lactic and Lactobionic Acids from Residual Dairy Whey |journal=Biotechnology Progress |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1250–1256 |doi=10.1002/btpr.2507 |pmid=28556559}}&lt;/ref&gt; When co-existing in an environment, ''Pseudomonas taetrolens'' shows inhibited growth and decreased production of lactobionic acid (its main product) most likely due to the byproducts created by Lactobacillus casei during its production of lactic acid.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317664342 |title=The microbial challenge : science, disease, and public heatlh |last=I. |first=Krasner, Robert |date=2010 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |isbn=9780763756895 |edition=2nd |location=Sudbury, Mass. |oclc=317664342}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lactobacillus casei shows no difference in its behaviour, and such this relationship can be defined as amensalism.

== Microbial resource management ==
[[Biotechnology]] may be used alongside microbial ecology to address a number of environmental and [[economic]] challenges. For example, molecular techniques such as [[Community Fingerprinting|community fingerprinting]] can be used to track changes in microbial communities over time or assess their [[biodiversity]]. Managing the carbon cycle to sequester [[carbon dioxide]] and prevent excess [[methanogenesis]] is important in mitigating [[global warming]], and the prospects of [[bioenergy]] are being expanded by the development of [[microbial fuel cell]]s. Microbial resource management advocates a more progressive attitude towards [[disease]], whereby [[biological control agent]]s are favoured over attempts at eradication. Fluxes in [[microbial communities]] has to be better characterized for this field's potential to be realised.&lt;ref name="verstraete"/&gt; In addition, there are also clinical implications, as marine microbial symbioses are a valuable source of existing and novel antimicrobial agents, and thus offer another line of inquiry in the evolutionary arms race of [[antibiotic resistance]], a pressing concern for researchers.&lt;ref name="Ott"/&gt;

== In built environment and human interaction ==
{{Main|Human microbiota}}
Microbes exist in all areas, including homes, offices, commercial centers, and hospitals. In 2016, the journal ''Microbiome'' published a collection of various works studying the microbial ecology of the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/builtenvironment|title=Microbiology of the Built Environment|website=www.biomedcentral.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study of pathogenic bacteria in hospitals found that their ability to survive varied by the type, with some surviving for only a few days while others survived for months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kramer |first=Axel |last2=Schwebke |first2=Ingeborg |last3=Kampf |first3=Günter |date=2006-08-16 |title=How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-6-130 |journal=BMC Infectious Diseases |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-130 |pmc=1564025 |pmid=16914034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifespan of microbes in the home varies similarly. Generally bacteria and viruses require a wet environment with a humidity of over 10 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-08/how-long-do-microbes-bacteria-and-viruses-live-surfaces-home-normal-room-tem|title=How long do microbes like bacteria and viruses live on surfaces in the home at normal room temperatures?|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[E. Coli|E. coli]]'' can survive for a few hours to a day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bacteria which form spores can survive longer, with ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' surviving potentially for weeks or, in the case of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the home, pets can be carriers of bacteria; for example, reptiles are commonly carriers of salmonella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/November-2012/Raw-Diets-Linked-To-Salmonella/|title=Raw Diets Linked To Salmonella|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''S. aureus'' is particularly common, and asymptomatically colonizes about 30% of the human population;&lt;ref name="Tong2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 2015|title=Staphylococcus aureus infections: epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=28|issue=3|pages=603–661 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00134-14 |pmc=4451395|pmid=26016486|author1=Tong SY|author2=Davis JS|author3=Eichenberger E |author4=Holland TL |author5=Fowler VG}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to decolonize carriers have met with limited success&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healio.com/pediatrics/emerging-diseases/news/print/infectious-diseases-in-children/%257B10db19d3-8aa4-4323-99ce-258fd81b609f%257D/many-factors-involved-in-decolonization-of-s-aureus|title=Many factors involved in decolonization of S. aureus |website=www.healio.com |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally involve [[mupirocin]] nasally and [[chlorhexidine]] washing, potentially along with vancomycin and cotrimoxazole to address intestinal and urinary tract infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Buehlmann|first=M. |last2=Frei|first2=R. |last3=Fenner |first3=L. |last4=Dangel |first4=M. |last5=Fluckiger |first5=U. |last6=Widmer |first6=A.

=== Antimicrobials ===
Some metals, particularly copper and silver, have antimicrobial properties. Using [[antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces]] is a technique which has begun to be used in the 21st century to prevent transmission of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-bacteria-fighting-super-element-making-a-return-to-hospitals-copper/2015/09/20/19251704-5beb-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|title=The bacteria-fighting super element making a return to hospitals: Copper|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver nanoparticle]]s have also begun to be incorporated into building surfaces and fabrics, although concerns have been raised about the potential side-effects of the tiny particles on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-16/health/ct-nanosilver-met-20140216_1_consumer-products-other-antibiotic-drugs-germs |title=Silver nanoparticles kill germs, raise health concerns |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Moving Mountains: How One Woman and Her Community Won Justice From Big Coal''''' is a 2007 book published by the [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loeb |first=Penny |date=2007 |title=Moving Mountains: How One Woman and Her Community Won Justice from Big Coal |location=Lexington, KY |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813124414 |jstor=j.ctt130jn7c}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award-winning book is written by [[Virginia]] resident Penny Loeb, a former senior editor at [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] and a former [[investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] for ''[[Newsday]]''.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=2008-07-27 |title='Moving Mountains' wins Foreword's prize for best environmental book |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/entertainment/outdoors/x2038882668/Moving-Mountains-wins-Forewords-prize-for-best-environmental-book |work=The Herald-Dispatch |location=Huntington, WV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite news |last=Quigley |first=Joan |date=2007-09-26 |title=Digging Into a Coal Controversy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/25/AR2007092502059.html |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loeb spent nine years chronicling the difficult situation of Trish Bragg and other inhabitants of the [[West Virginia]] coalfields.  In Loeb's analysis, these people are "caught between the economic opportunities provided by coal and the detriments to health and to quality of life that are so often the by-products of the coal industry". ''Moving Mountains'' is an account of the human and environmental costs of coal extraction, and the grassroots movement to mitigate those costs.&lt;ref name=award/&gt;&lt;ref name=wash/&gt;

Loeb has received many awards for journalism, and was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1988 and for a [[National Magazine Award]] in 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref name=award/&gt;

'''New Energy for America''' was a plan led by [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]] to invest in [[renewable energy]] sources, reduce reliance on [[North American energy independence|foreign oil]], address [[global warming]] issues, and create jobs for [[Americans]].

The plan was presented in the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008]].

President Barack Obama in his [[inaugural address]] called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12194 |title=EERE News: President Obama Calls for Greater Use of Renewable Energy |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8921">The '''nitridoborates''' are chemical compounds of boron and nitrogen with metals. These compounds are typically produced at high temperature by reacting hexagonal [[boron nitride]] (α -BN) with metal [[nitride]]s or by [[metathesis reaction]]s involving nitridoborates.  A wide range of these compounds have been made involving [[lithium]], [[alkaline earth]] metals and [[lanthanide]]s, and their structures determined using crystallographic techniques such as [[X-ray crystallography]]. Structurally one of their interesting features is the presence of [[polyatomic ion|polyatomic anions]] of boron and nitrogen where the geometry and the B–N bond length have been interpreted in terms of [[pi bond|π-bonding]].

Many of the compounds produced  can be described as ternary compounds of metal boron and nitrogen and examples of these are Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, La&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Housecroft2d"/&gt; However there are examples of compounds with more than one metal, for example La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="BlaschkowskiMeyer2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaschkowski|first1=Björn|last2=Meyer|first2=H.-Jürgen|title=X-Ray Single Crystal Refinement and Superconductivity of La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie|volume=629|issue=1|year=2003|pages=129–132|issn=0044-2313|doi=10.1002/zaac.200390004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compounds containing anions such as [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], for example Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl.&lt;ref name="SomerKütükcü2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Somer|first1=Mehmet|last2=Kütükcü|first2=Mehmet Nuri|last3=Gil|first3=Raul Cardoso|last4=Borrmann|first4=Horst|last5=Carrillo-Cabrera|first5=Wilder|title=Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl and Mg&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I: Novel Magnesium Nitridoborate Halides — Syntheses, Crystal Structures, and Vibrational Spectra|journal=Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie|volume=630|issue=7|year=2004|pages=1015–1021|issn=0044-2313|doi=10.1002/zaac.200400055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures and bonding==
Examination of the crystallographic data shows the presence of polyatomic units consisting of boron and nitrogen. These units have structures similar to those of isoelectronic anions, which have π-bonded structures.  The bonding in some of these compounds is ionic in character, such as Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, other compounds have metallic characteristics, where the bonding has been described in terms of π-bonded anions with extra electrons in anti-bonding orbitals that not only cause a lengthening of the B–N bonds but also form  part of the conduction band of the solid.&lt;ref name = "Meyer Inorg Chem Focus3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=H. Jurgen |editor1-last= Meyer|editor1-first= Gerd|editor2-last=Naumann |editor2-first= Dieter|editor3-last=Wesemann |editor3-first= Lars|title=Inorganic Chemistry in Focus III |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |pages=121–138 |chapter=Chapter 8: Current State on (B,C,N) compounds of Calcium and Lanthanum|isbn=978-3-527-31510-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest ion BN&lt;sup&gt;''n''−&lt;/sup&gt; is comparable to the {{chem|C|2|2−}} ion, but attempts to prepare the compound CaBN analogous to CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[calcium carbide]] failed. The bonding of compounds containing the diatomic BN anion have been explained in terms of electrons entering anti-bonding orbitals and reducing the B–N bond order from 3 (triple bond) in BN&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; to 2 (double bond) in BN&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="BlaschkowskiMeyer2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaschkowski|first1=Björn|last2=Meyer|first2=H.-Jürgen|title=Electronic Conditions of Diatomic (BN) Anions in the Structure of CaNiBN|journal=Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie|volume=628|issue=6|year=2002|pages=1249|issn=0044-2313|doi=10.1002/1521-3749(200206)628:6&lt;1249::AID-ZAAC1249&gt;3.0.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nitridoborates are salt-like such as Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, LiCa&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; others have a metallic lustre, such as LiEu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Bonding calculations  show that the energy of the valence orbitals of metal atoms of group 2 and lanthanide elements are higher than those of the bonding orbitals in BN&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ions which indicates an ionic like interaction between a metal atom and a BN&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ion. With lanthanide compounds where extra electrons enter the anti-bonding orbitals of an ion there can be a smaller band gap giving the compounds metal like properties such as lustre. With transition metals the d orbitals can be similar in energy to bonding orbitals in the BN anions suggesting covalent interactions.&lt;ref name = "Meyer Inorg Chem Focus3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3839">In [[physics]], a '''perfect gas''' is a theoretical gas that differs from real gases in a way that makes certain calculations easier to handle. Its behavior is more simplified compared to an [[ideal gas]] (also a theoretical gas). In particular, intermolecular forces are neglected, which means that one can use the ideal gas law without restriction and neglect many complications that may arise from the [[Van der Waals force]]s.

== Perfect gas nomenclature ==
The terms ''perfect gas'' and ''ideal gas'' are sometimes used interchangeably, depending on the particular field of physics and engineering. Sometimes, other distinctions are made, such as between ''thermally perfect gas'' and ''calorically perfect gas'', or between imperfect, semi-perfect, perfect, and ideal gases. Two of the common sets of nomenclatures are summarized in the following table.

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! Nomenclature 1&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;|| Nomenclature 2 &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;|| Heat capacity at &lt;br&gt;constant ''V'', &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt; or constant ''P'', &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt;.
! Ideal-gas law&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;pV=nRT&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_p-C_V= n R&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Calorically perfect || Perfect || {{Yes|Constant}} || {{Yes}}
|-
| Thermally perfect || Semi-perfect || {{Partial|''T''-dependent}} || {{Yes}} 
|-
| N/A || Ideal  || {{No|May be ''T'' and/or ''p''-dependent}} || {{Yes}}
|-
| N/A || Imperfect  || {{No|''T'' and ''p''-dependent}} || {{No}}
|}

=== Thermally and calorically perfect gas ===
Along with the definition of a perfect gas, there are also two more simplifications that can be made although various textbooks either omit or combine the following simplifications into a general "perfect gas" definition.

A '''thermally perfect gas'''
* is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]
* is not chemically reacting
* has [[internal energy]] ''e'', [[enthalpy]] ''h'', and [[Heat capacity|heat capacities]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'',''C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;'' that are functions of temperature ''only'' and not of pressure, i.e., &lt;math&gt;e = e(T)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h = h(T)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;de = C_v (T) dT&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dh = C_p (T) dT&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be proved that an ideal gas (i.e. satisfying the ideal gas equation of state) is thermally perfect.&lt;ref name="temperature-depedence"&gt;{http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node18.html}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This type of approximation is useful for modeling, for example, an [[axial compressor]] where temperature fluctuations are usually not large enough to cause any significant deviations from the ''thermally perfect'' gas model. Heat capacity is still allowed to vary, though only with temperature, and molecules are not permitted to dissociate. The latter implies temperature limited to 2500 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anderson, J D |title= Fundamentals of Aerodynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more restricted is the '''calorically perfect gas''' for which, in addition, the heat capacity is assumed to be constant:  &lt;math&gt;e = C_vT&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h = C_pT&lt;/math&gt;.

Although this may be the most restrictive model from a temperature perspective, it is accurate enough to make reasonable predictions within the limits specified. A comparison of calculations for one compression stage of an [[axial compressor]] (one with variable ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', and one with constant ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'') produces a deviation small enough to support this approach. As it turns out, other factors come into play and dominate during this compression cycle. These other effects would have a greater impact on the final calculated result than whether or not ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' was held constant. (examples of these real gas effects include compressor tip-clearance, separation, and boundary layer/frictional losses, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15005">'''Power-system protection''' is a branch of electrical [[power engineering]] that deals with the protection of electrical power systems from [[Fault (power engineering)|faults]] through the isolation of faulted parts from the rest of the [[Grid (electricity)|electrical network]]. The objective of a protection scheme is to keep the power system stable by isolating only the components that are under fault, whilst leaving as much of the network as possible still in operation. Thus, protection schemes must apply a very [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] and pessimistic approach to clearing system faults. The devices that are used to protect the power systems from faults are called '''protection devices'''.

==Components==
Protection systems usually comprise five components:
*[[Transformer#Current Transformers|Current]] and [[Transformer#Voltage Transformers|voltage transformers]] to step down the high voltages and currents of the electrical power system to convenient levels for the relays to deal with
*[[Protective relay]]s to sense the fault and initiate a trip, or disconnection, order
*[[Circuit breaker]]s to open/close the system based on relay and autorecloser commands
*[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]] to provide power in case of power disconnection in the system
*Communication channels to allow analysis of current and voltage at remote terminals of a line and to allow remote tripping of equipment.
For parts of a distribution system, [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] are capable of both sensing and disconnecting [[electrical faults|fault]]s

Failures may occur in each part, such as insulation failure, fallen or broken transmission lines, incorrect operation of circuit breakers, short circuits and open circuits. Protection devices are installed with the aims of protection of assets and ensuring continued supply of energy.

Switchgear is a combination of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switches are safe to open under normal load current, while protective devices are safe to open under fault current.
&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Von Meier (2013). Electrical Engineer 137A: Electric Power Systems. Lecture 14:Introduction to Protection Systems, Slide 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective device==
[[File:Protective relay.jpg|thumb|A digital (numeric) multifunction protective relay for distribution networks. A single such device can replace many single-function electromechanical relays, and provides self-testing and communication functions.]]
*[[Protective relay]]s control the tripping of the circuit breakers surrounding the faulted part of the network
*Automatic operation, such as auto-re-closing or system restart
*Monitoring equipment which collects data on the system for post event analysis

While the operating quality of these devices, and especially of protective relays, is always critical, different strategies are considered for protecting the different parts of the system. Very important equipment may have completely redundant and independent protective systems, while a minor branch distribution line may have very simple low-cost protection.

There are three parts to protective devices:
:*[[Instrument transformer]]: current (CT) or potential (VT)	
:*[[Relay]]
:*[[Circuit breaker]]

Advantages of protected devices with these three basic components include safety, economy, and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Von Meier (2013). Electrical Engineer 137A: Electric Power Systems. Lecture 14:Introduction to Protection Systems, Slide 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glover J. D., Sarma M. S., Overbye T. J. (2010) Power System and Analysis 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. Pg 525.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Safety: Instrument transformers create electrical isolation from the power system, and thus establishing a safer environment for personnel working with the relays.
:*Economy: Relays are able to be simpler, smaller, and cheaper given lower-level relay inputs.
:*Accuracy: Power system voltages and currents are accurately reproduced by instrument transformers over large operating ranges.

==Types of protection==

===High-voltage transmission network===
Protection on the transmission and distribution system serves two functions: protection of plant and protection of the public (including employees). At a basic level, protection disconnects equipment which experiences an overload or a short to earth. Some items in substations such as transformers might require additional protection based on temperature or gas pressure, among others.

===Generator sets===  
In a power plant, the protective relays  are intended to prevent damage to [[alternator]]s or to the [[transformer]]s in case of abnormal conditions of operation, due to internal failures, as well as insulating failures or regulation malfunctions. Such failures are unusual, so the protective relays have to operate very rarely. If a protective relay fails to detect a fault, the resulting damage to the alternator or to the transformer might require costly equipment repairs or replacement, as well as income loss from the inability to produce and sell energy.

===Overload and back-up for distance (overcurrent)===
Overload protection requires a current transformer which simply measures the current in a circuit.  There are two types of overload protection: instantaneous overcurrent (IOC) and time overcurrent (TOC). Instantaneous overcurrent requires that the current exceeds a predetermined level for the circuit breaker to operate. Time overcurrent protection operates based on a current vs time curve. Based on this curve, if the measured current exceeds a given level for the preset amount of time, the circuit breaker or fuse will operate. The function of both types is explained in {{YouTube|id=zc_Dj5JNInc|title="Non-Directional Overcurrent Protection"}}.

===Earth fault ("ground fault" in the United States)===
Earth fault protection also requires current transformers and senses an imbalance in a three-phase circuit.  Normally the three phase currents are in balance, i.e. roughly equal in magnitude. If one or two phases become connected to earth via a low impedance path, their magnitudes will increase dramatically, as will current imbalance. If this imbalance exceeds a pre-determined value, a circuit breaker should operate. Restricted earth fault protection is a type of earth fault protection which looks for earth fault between two sets of current transformers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restricted Earth Fault Protection|url=http://myelectrical.com/notes/entryid/150/restricted-earth-fault-protection|publisher=myElectrical.com|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (hence restricted to that zone).

===Distance (impedance relay)===
Distance protection detects both voltage and current. A fault on a circuit will generally create a sag in the voltage level. If the ratio of voltage to current measured at the relay terminals, which equates to an impedance, lands within a predetermined level the circuit breaker will operate. This is useful for reasonably long lines, lines longer than 10 miles, because their operating characteristics are based on the line characteristics.  This means that when a fault appears on the line the impedance setting in the relay is compared to the apparent impedance of the line from the relay terminals to the fault. If the relay setting is determined to be below the apparent impedance it is determined that the fault is within the zone of protection. When the transmission line length is too short, less than 10 miles, distance protection becomes more difficult to coordinate. In these instances the best choice of protection is current differential protection.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=July 2016}}

===Back-up===
The objective of protection is to remove only the affected portion of plant and nothing else. A circuit breaker or protection relay may fail to operate. In important systems, a failure of primary protection will usually result in the operation of back-up protection. Remote back-up protection will generally remove both the affected and unaffected items of plant to clear the fault.  Local back-up protection will remove the affected items of the plant to clear the fault.

===Low-voltage networks===
The [[low-voltage network]] generally relies upon fuses or low-voltage circuit breakers to remove both overload and earth faults.

==Coordination==
Protective device coordination is the process of determining the "best fit" timing of current interruption when abnormal electrical conditions occur.  The goal is to minimize an outage to the greatest extent possible. Historically, protective device coordination was done on translucent log–log paper.  Modern methods normally include detailed computer based analysis and reporting.

Protection coordination is also handled through dividing the power system into protective zones. If a fault were to occur in a given zone, necessary actions will be executed to isolate that zone from the entire system. Zone definitions account for [[Electric generator|generators]], buses, [[transformer]]s, [[Transmission line|transmission and distribution lines]], and [[Electric motor|motors]]. Additionally, zones possess the following features: zones overlap, overlap regions denote circuit breakers, and all circuit breakers in a given zone with a fault will open in order to isolate the fault. Overlapped regions are created by two sets of instrument transformers and relays for each circuit breaker. They are designed for redundancy to eliminate unprotected areas; however, overlapped regions are devised to remain as small as possible such that when a fault occurs in an overlap region and the two zones which encompass the fault are isolated, the sector of the power system which is lost from service is still small despite two zones being isolated.&lt;ref&gt;Glover J. D., Sarma M. S., Overbye T. J. (2010) Power System and Analysis 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. Pg 548-549.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disturbance-monitoring equipment==
Disturbance-monitoring equipment (DME) monitors and records system data pertaining to a [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]]. DME accomplish three main purposes:
* model validation,
*disturbance investigation, and
*assessment of system protection performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/documents/manuals/operations/System_Protection_Manual.pdf|title=System Protection Manual|publisher=[[New York energy law|New York Independent System Operator]]|accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DME devices include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.com/files/Glossary_12Feb08.pdf|title= Glossary of Terms Used in Reliability Standards|publisher=[[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]]|accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
*Sequence of event recorders, which record equipment response to the event
*Fault recorders, which record actual waveform data of the system primary voltages and currents
*Dynamic disturbance recorders (DDRs), which record incidents that portray power system behavior during dynamic events such as low frequency (0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz – 3&amp;nbsp;Hz) oscillations and abnormal frequency or voltage excursions

==Performance measures==
Protection engineers define dependability as the tendency of the protection system to operate correctly for in-zone faults. They define security as the tendency not to operate for out-of-zone faults. Both dependability and security are reliability issues. Fault tree analysis is one tool with which a protection engineer can compare the relative reliability of proposed protection schemes. Quantifying protection reliability is important for making the best decisions on improving a protection system, managing dependability versus security tradeoffs, and getting the best results for the least money. A quantitative understanding is essential in the competitive utility industry.

1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Kumm. E.O. Schweitzer, and D. Hou, “Assessing the Effectiveness of Self-Tests and Other
Monitoring Means in Protective Relays,” 21st Annual Western Protective Relay Conference,
Spokane, WA. Oct. 18-20, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance and design criteria for system-protection devices include reliability, selectivity, speed, cost, and simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Glover J. D., Sarma M. S., Overbye T. J. (2010) Power System and Analysis 5th Edition. Cengage Learning. Pg 526.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Reliability: Devices must function consistently when fault conditions occur, regardless of possibly being idle for months or years. Without this reliability, systems may cause costly damages.
*Selectivity: Devices must avoid unwarranted, false trips.
*Speed: Devices must function quickly to reduce equipment damage and fault duration, with only very precise intentional time delays.
*Economy: Devices must provide maximum protection at minimum cost.
*Simplicity: Devices must minimize protection circuitry and equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4556">In mathematics, '''set inversion''' is the problem of characterizing the [[Inverse image|preimage]] ''X'' of a set ''Y'' by a function ''f'', i.e., ''X'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y'') = {''x'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''f''(''x'') ∈ ''Y''}. It can also be viewed as the problem of describing the solution set of the quantified constraint "Y(f(x))", where Y(y) is a constraint, for example, an inequality, describing the set Y.

In most applications, ''f'' is a function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; and the set ''Y'' is a box of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. a Cartesian product of ''p'' intervals of '''R'''). 

When ''f'' is nonlinear the set inversion problem can be solved

&lt;/ref&gt; 
using [[interval analysis]] combined with a [[branch and bound|branch-and-bound]] algorithm.

{{cite book|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Kieffer|first2=M.|last3=Didrit|first3=O.|last4=Walter|first4=E.|
title=Applied Interval Analysis|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=1-85233-219-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The main idea consists in building a paving of R&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; made with non-overlapping boxes. For each box [''x''], we perform the following tests:
# if ''f''([''x'']) ⊂ ''Y'' we conclude that [''x''] ⊂ ''X'';
# if ''f''([''x'']) ∩ ''Y'' = ∅ we conclude that [''x''] ∩ ''X'' = ∅;
# Otherwise, the box [''x''] the box is bisected except if its width is smaller than a given precision.

To check the two first tests, we need an [[Interval arithmetic|interval extension]] (or an inclusion function) [''f''] for ''f''. Classified boxes are stored into [[subpaving]]s, i.e., union of non overlapping boxes. 
The algorithm can be made more efficient by replacing the inclusion tests by [[interval contractor|contractors]].

==Example==

The set ''X'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;([4,9]) where ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''x''{{su|b=2|p=2}} is represented on the figure. 

For instance, since [−2,1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + [4,5]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [0,4] + [16,25] = [16,29] does not intersect the interval [4,9], we conclude that the box [-2,1] × [4,5] is outside ''X''. Since [−1,1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + [2,{{sqrt|5}}]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [0,1] + [4,5] = [4,6] is inside [4,9], we conclude that the whole box [-1,1] × [2,{{sqrt|5}}] is inside ''X''.

'''The Oval Gasholders''' is the unofficial name given to the [[gas holder]] (gasometer) located near [[The Oval]] in London, England.

==History==
The Phoenix Gas Light &amp; Coke Company bought the site north of the Oval in 1845 from the Southwark &amp; Vauxhall Waterworks Company, who had laid out the site in 1807 as a waterworks with an engine house and two circular brick-lined reservoirs. The Phoenix Gas Company adapted the circular reservoirs for gasholder tanks and erected five gasometers between 1847 and 1874. 

The first iron gasholder was installed on the site in 1847 to service a gasworks next to [[Vauxhall Bridge]].  The [[Phoenix Gas Light and Coke Company]] replaced it in 1877–79 to designs by Sir [[Corbet Woodall (gas engineer)|Corbet Woodall]], with two lifts holding 3 million cubic ft, making it the largest gasholder in the world.  It was enlarged again by [[Frank Livesey]] in 1891–92 for the [[South Metropolitan Gas Company]], by modifying the guides to increase their height by 50%, and adding two more lifts, including a "flying lift" rising above the guides, doubling its capacity to 6 million cubic ft.  It is an early use of [[wrought iron]] in a frame.&lt;ref&gt;[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1427396 Historic England]&lt;/ref&gt;  This structure, Gasholder 1, is Grade II listed by virtue of it: a) being the world's largest gasholder at the time, b) its famous designers Frank and George Livesey and c) it being an internationally renowned backdrop to matches at the adjacent Oval Cricket Ground. The cylindrical wrought iron guide frame is about {{convert|135|ft}} high, with 24 t-section lattice standards, rising in three tiers and connected by three rows of horizontal lattice girders, with a rising "bell" of four tiers, including the top "flying lift" rising above the standards.  It would have topped {{convert|180|ft}} when full.

A second gasholder, No.2, was constructed in 1854-5 and converted to a spiral-guided holder in 1950, which does not require a frame.  No.3 was constructed in 1869 but demolished c.1975. 

The conjoined pair of Gasholders No. 4 &amp; 5 erected in 1874 and 1876 were designed by Sir Corbet Woodall and are locally listed. They have elegant neo-classical style frames and Tuscan columns. The gasometers were decommissioned in 2014 and the site is due for redevelopment, there are concerns that only the nationally listed No.1 gasometer will be preserved.

==Cricket ground==
The gasholders overlook The Oval at the Vauxhall End of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/photo_galleries/3961435.stm |title=The Oval in pictures |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 July 2005 |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered part of the background of The Oval&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10485918/Test-Match-Special-Blowers-devastated-The-Oval-cricket-ground-skyline-is-under-threat.html |title=Test Match Special 'Blowers' devastated The Oval cricket ground skyline is under threat |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite being newer than The Oval, which was established in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/cricket/news/16327/8769111/the-oval |title=The Oval |publisher=Sky Sports |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[England cricket team]] matches advertising banners hang from the gas holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thephoenixpartners.com/latest-news/agencys-banner-design-hits-the-mark-at-the-oval/ |title=Agency’s banner design hits the mark at the Oval! |publisher=The Phoenix Partners |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are regularly referred to in [[Test Match Special]] broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.smh.com.au/business/world-business/stumps-drawn-on-oval-icon-20140126-31h0u.html |title=Stumps drawn on oval icon |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 January 2014 |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Surrey County Cricket Club]], tenants of The Oval, announced plans to redevelop it along the side nearest the gas holders. However, their redevelopment plans were objected to by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] because of the proximity to the gas holders and amid fears that they might explode despite not cracking or leaking since construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/352645.html |title=Oval held hostage by Health and Safety |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was supported by [[London Fire Brigade]], who listed the gas holders as a hazardous site.&lt;ref name=fire /&gt; As a result, Surrey considered buying the gas holders and decommissioning them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-190071291.html |title=Surrey are concerned enough |work=Daily Mail (archived at Highbeam) |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objection of the Health and Safety Executive was rejected by the Secretary of State and planning inspector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary of State's decision on planning application at the Oval Cricket Ground: HSE statement|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/landuseplanning/ovalcricket.htm|publisher=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
In 1999, plans were announced to dismantle all of the United Kingdom's gasholders due to being made largely redundant due to improvements in [[natural gas storage|gas storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/264609.stm |title=Condemned: The great gasometer |publisher=BBC News |date=28 January 1999 |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended to include the Oval Gas Holders. Regeneration of these contaminated brownfield sites can help deliver London with much needed homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UK house-building crisis – and how to solve it|url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/savills-warns-uk-housing-crisis-shortage-new-homes|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-09-30|first = Hilary|last = Osborne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley Homes and Lambeth Council are working together cooperatively to prepare a Masterplan for an area surrounding the Oval Gas Holders. This is known as the Oval and Kennington Development Area (OAKDA). A preliminary consultation with the local community occurred in January and February 2015 to discover local aspirations. Draft Masterplan proposals will be released to a second consultation towards the end of the year where comments will be welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OAKDA – Consultation – Oval and Kennington Development Area|url = http://www.oakda.co.uk/consultation|website = www.oakda.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 Lambeth Council locally listed the three gas holders of 1874, 1876 and 1892 (No.4, No.5 and No.1). In 2015, Lawrence D'Silva, a 26 year old local resident, presented a case to Historic England to make the gasholders listed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.archaeologyuk.org/iconic-victorian-gasholder-saved-from-destruction|title=Council for British Archaeology {{!}} Iconic Victorian gasholder saved from destruction|last=Jepson|first=Ledgard|website=new.archaeologyuk.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theheritagealliance.org.uk/update/industrial-heritage-recent-listings/|title=Industrial heritage: recent listings|date=2016-03-11|work=Heritage Update|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Historic England assessed them all for national listing and in March 2016 decided to grant Grade II listed status to just one of the Oval Gasholders – No.1 dating from 1892. The national listing designation supersedes the local listing status of this gasometer so Gasholder No. 1 was subsequently removed from the Local list by Lambeth – Nos. 4 &amp; 5 remain locally listed. There is a strong presumption in the planning decision-making process against the demolition of a nationally listed heritage asset.&lt;Ref name=listed /&gt;

'''Transmission line measurement''' or '''Transfer Length Measurement''' is a technique used in [[semiconductor]] [[physics]] and [[engineering]] to determine the [[ohmic contact|contact resistance]] between a [[metal]] and a semiconductor. The technique involves making a series of metal-semiconductor contacts separated by various distances. Probes are applied to pairs of contacts, and the resistance between them is measured by applying a voltage across the contacts and measuring the resulting [[Current (electricity)|current]]. The current flows from the first probe, into the metal contact, across the [[metal-semiconductor junction]], through the sheet of semiconductor, across the metal-semiconductor junction again (except this time in the other direction), into the second contact, and from there into the second probe and into the external circuit to be measured by an [[ammeter]]. The resistance measured is a linear combination (sum) of the [[contact resistance]] of the first contact, the contact resistance of the second contact, and the sheet resistance of the semiconductor in-between the contacts.

If several such measurements are made between pairs of contacts that are separated by different distances, a [[Graph of a function|plot]] of [[electrical resistance|resistance]] versus contact separation can be obtained. If the contact separation is expressed in terms of the ratio L/W - where L and W are the length and width of the area between the contacts - such a plot should be [[linear]], with the [[slope]] of the [[line (mathematics)|line]] being the [[sheet resistance]]. The [[y-intercept|intercept]] of the line with the [[y-axis]], is two times the contact resistance. Thus the sheet resistance as well as the contact resistance can be determined from this technique.

'''Valeric acid''', or  '''pentanoic acid''', is a straight-chain [[alkyl]] [[carboxylic acid]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem2|CH3(CH2)3COOH}}.  Like other low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids, it has a very [[unpleasant odor]].  It is found naturally in the perennial flowering plant [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]] (''Valeriana officinalis''), from which it gets its name.  Its primary use is in the synthesis of its [[ester]]s. [[Salt (chemistry)|Salt]]s and [[ester]]s of valeric acid are known as '''valerates''' or '''pentanoates'''. Volatile esters of valeric acid tend to have pleasant odors and are used in perfumes and cosmetics.  [[Ethyl valerate]] and [[pentyl pentanoate|pentyl valerate]] are used as food additives because of their fruity flavors.

Valeric acid appears similar in structure to [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] and the neurotransmitter [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] in that it is a short-chain carboxylic acid, although it lacks the alcohol and amine functional groups that contribute to the biological activities of GHB and GABA, respectively. It differs from [[valproic acid]] simply by lacking a 3-carbon side-chain. [[Mevalonic acid]] is derived from valeric acid by [[methylation]] and [[hydroxylation]].

==Safety==
Valeric acid can cause irritation if it comes into contact with the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes.

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[List of thermodynamic properties|System properties]]}}
In [[thermodynamics]], '''vapour quality''' is the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] in a saturated mixture that is [[vapour]];&lt;ref name=boles&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Cengel | first1 = Yunus A. | last2 = Boles | first2 = Michael A. | title = Thermodynamics: an engineering approach | year = 2002 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = [[Boston, Massachusetts]]  | isbn = 0-07-121688-X | pages = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|saturated vapour]] has a "quality" of 100%, and saturated liquid has a "quality" of 0%.  Vapour quality is an [[intensive property]] which can be used in conjunction with other independent intensive properties to specify the [[thermodynamic state]] of the working fluid of a [[thermodynamic system]]. It has no meaning for substances which are not [[saturated fluid|saturated mixture]]s (for example, [[Compressed liquid|compressed liquids]] or [[Superheated water|superheated fluids]]).
Vapor quality is an important quantity during the adiabatic expansion step in various thermodynamic cycles (like [[Organic Rankine Cycle|Organic Rankine cycle]], [[Rankine cycle|Rankine cycle]], etc.).  [[working fluids|Working fluids can be classified]] by using the appearance of droplets in the vapour suring the expansion step.

Quality &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by dividing the mass of the vapour by the mass of the total mixture:
:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \frac{m_{vapour}}{m_{total}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; indicates mass.

Another definition used by chemical engineers defines quality (q) of a fluid as the fraction that is saturated liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wankat|first=Philip C.|title=Equilibrium Staged Separations|publisher=Prentice Hall|place=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|year=1988|pages=119–121|isbn=0-13-500968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, a saturated vapour has q = 1. A saturated liquid has q = 0.&lt;ref&gt;Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook (7th Edition), p 13-29&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative definition is the 'equilibrium thermodynamic quality'. It can be used only for single-component mixtures (e.g. water with steam), and can take values &lt;0 (for sub-cooled fluids) and &gt;1 (for super-saturated vapours):

&lt;math&gt;\chi_{eq} = \frac{h-h_{f}}{h_{fg}}&lt;/math&gt;; where h is the mixture specific enthalpy, defined as:

&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{m_{f}.h_{f}+m_{g}.h_{g}}{m_{f}+m_{g}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Subscripts f and g refer to saturated liquid and saturated gas respectively, and fg refers to vaporisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghiaasiaan|first1=S. Mostafa|title=Two-phase flow, boiling and condensation in conventional and miniature systems|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-88276-7|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
The above expression for vapour quality can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \frac{y - y_f}{y_g - y_f}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is equal to either [[specific enthalpy]], specific [[entropy]], [[specific volume]] or [[specific internal energy]], &lt;math&gt;y_f&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the specific property of saturated liquid state and &lt;math&gt;y_{g}-y_{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the specific property of the substance in dome zone, which we can find both liquid &lt;math&gt;y_{f}&lt;/math&gt; and vapor &lt;math&gt;y_{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another expression of the same concept is:
:&lt;math&gt;\chi=\frac{m_v}{m_l + m_v}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_v&lt;/math&gt; is the vapour mass and &lt;math&gt;m_l&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid mass.

==Steam quality and work==
{{Further|Work energy|Work (physics)|Outline of energy|
Index of energy articles}}
The origin of the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of [[thermodynamics]], where an important application was the [[steam engine]]. Low quality steam would contain a high [[moisture]] percentage and therefore damage components more easily.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} High quality steam would not [[corrode]] the steam engine. [[Steam engine]]s use water vapour ([[steam]]) to push pistons or turbines, and that movement creates [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. The  quantitatively described ''steam quality'' (steam dryness) is the proportion of saturated steam in a saturated water/steam mixture. In other words, a steam quality of 0 indicates 100% water while a steam quality of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% steam.

The quality of steam on which [[steam whistle]]s are blown is variable and may affect [[frequency]]. Steam quality determines the [[velocity of sound]], which declines with decreasing dryness due to the [[inertia]] of the [[liquid phase]]. Also, the [[specific volume]] of steam for a given temperature decreases with decreasing dryness.&lt;ref&gt;Soo, Shao L. (1989). Particulates and Continuum: A Multiphase Fluid Dynamics. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menon, E. Sashi. (2005). Piping Calculations Manual. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam quality is very useful in determining [[enthalpy]] of saturated water/steam mixtures since the enthalpy of steam (gaseous state) is many orders of magnitude higher than enthalpy of water (liquid state).

'''Waste''' (or '''wastes''') are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use.

Examples include [[municipal solid waste]] (household trash/refuse), [[hazardous waste]], [[wastewater]] (such as [[sewage]], which contains bodily wastes ([[feces]] and [[urine]]) and [[surface runoff]]), [[radioactive waste]], and others.

==Definitions==

===United Nations Environment Program===

According to the [[Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal]] of 1989, Art. 2(1), "'Wastes' are substance or objects, which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law".&lt;ref name="Basel Convention"&gt;“Basel Convention.” 1989. {{cite web |url=http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/Basel%20Convention/docs/text/con-e-rev.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516135747/http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/Basel%20Convention/docs/text/con-e-rev.pdf |archivedate=2017-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:European legal definition of waste.png|thumb|230px|Schematic illustration of the [[European Union|EU]] Legal definition of waste {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}]]

===United Nations Statistics Division===

The UNSD ''Glossary of Environment Statistics''&lt;ref name="UNSD Glossary of Environment Statistics"&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environmentgl ''Glossary of Environment Statistics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104045644/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environmentgl/ |date=2013-01-04 }}. 1997. UNSD. Updated web version 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; describes waste as "materials that are not prime products (that is, products produced for the market) for which the generator has no further use in terms of his/her own purposes of production, transformation or consumption, and of which he/she wants to dispose. Wastes may be generated during the extraction of raw materials, the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products, the consumption of final products, and other human activities. Residuals recycled or reused at the place of generation are excluded."

===European  Union===

Under the [[Waste framework directive|Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC]], Art. 3(1), the [[European Union]] defines waste as "an object the holder discards, intends to discard or is required to discard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2008/98/oj/eng|title=Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (Text with EEA relevance)|author=|date=22 November 2008|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a more structural description of the Waste Directive, see the [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm European Commission's summary].

==Types==
{{Main|List of waste types}}
There are many waste types defined by modern systems of [[waste management]], notably including:
* Municipal waste includes [[household waste]], [[commercial waste]], and [[demolition waste]]
* Hazardous waste includes [[industrial waste]]
* [[Biomedical waste]] includes clinical waste
* Special [[hazardous waste]] includes [[radioactive waste]], explosive waste, and [[electronic waste]] (e-waste)

==Reporting==
There are many issues that surround reporting waste. It is most commonly measured by size or weight, and there is a stark difference between the two. For example, [[organic waste]] is much heavier when it is wet, and plastic or glass bottles can have different weights but be the same size.&lt;ref name="Solid Waste Management"&gt;"Solid Waste Management." 2005. United Nations Environment Programme. Chapter III: Waste Quantities and Characteristics, 31-38. [http://www.unep.or.jp/Ietc/Publications/spc/Solid_Waste_Management/index.asp unep.or.jp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022033521/http://www.unep.or.jp/ietc/Publications/spc/Solid_Waste_Management/index.asp |date=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a global scale it is difficult to report waste because countries have different definitions of waste and what falls into waste categories, as well as different ways of reporting. Based on incomplete reports from its parties, the [[Basel Convention]] estimated 338 million tonnes of waste was generated in 2001.&lt;ref name="International Waste Activities"&gt;“International Waste Activities.” 2003. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 12 Oct 2009. [http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/international/index.htm epa.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016141651/http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/international/index.htm |date=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same year, OECD estimated 4 billion tonnes from its member countries.&lt;ref name="Improving Recycling Markets"&gt;"Improving Recycling Markets." OECD Environment Program. Paris: OECD, 2006. [http://www.oecd.org/document/14/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37757966_1_1_1_1,00.html oecd.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924123639/http://www.oecd.org/document/14/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37757966_1_1_1_1,00.html |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these inconsistencies, waste reporting is still useful on a small and large scale to determine key causes and locations, and to find ways of preventing, minimizing, recovering, treating, and disposing waste.

==Costs==
{{anchor|Cultural dynamics of waste}}
===Environmental costs===
[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|300px|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]
Inappropriately managed waste can attract rodents and insects, which  can harbour gastrointestinal parasites, yellow fever, worms, the plague and other conditions for humans, and exposure to hazardous wastes, particularly when they are burned, can cause various other diseases including cancers. [[Toxic waste]] materials can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and air which causes more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;Diaz, L. et al. ''Solid Waste Management, Volume 2.'' UNEP/Earthprint, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Waste treatment and disposal produces significant green house gas (GHG) emissions, notably methane, which are contributing significantly to [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="International Waste Activities" /&gt;

===Social costs===
Waste management is a significant [[environmental justice]] issue. Many of the environmental burdens cited above are more often borne by marginalized groups, such as racial minorities, women, and residents of developing nations. [[NIMBY]] (not in my back yard) is the opposition of residents to a proposal for a new development because it is close to them.&lt;ref&gt;Wolsink, M. "Entanglement of interests and motives: Assumptions behind the NIMBY-theory on Facility Siting." ''Urban Studies'' 31.6 (1994): 851-866.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the need for expansion and siting of waste treatment and disposal facilities is increasing worldwide. There is now a growing market in the transboundary movement of waste, and although most waste that flows between countries goes between developed nations, a significant amount of waste is moved from developed to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, A. "Waste management in developing Asia: Can trade and cooperation help?" ''The Journal of Environment &amp; Development'' 17.1 (2008): 3-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic costs===
The economic costs of managing waste are high, and are often paid for by municipal governments;&lt;ref&gt;“Muck and brass: The waste business smells of money.” '' The Economist.'' 2009 02 28. pp. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; money can often be saved with more efficiently designed collection routes, modifying vehicles, and with public education. Environmental policies such as [[pay as you throw]] can reduce the cost of management and reduce waste quantities. Waste recovery (that is, [[recycling]], [[reuse]]) can curb economic costs because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation costs. "Economic assessment of municipal waste management systems – case studies using a combination of [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA) and [[life-cycle costing]] (LCC)".&lt;ref&gt;'' Journal of Cleaner Production'' 13 (2005): 253-263.&lt;/ref&gt; The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and negative stigma. The informal waste sector consists mostly of [[waste picker]]s who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system, but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D.C.; Velis, C.; Cheeseman, C. "Role of informal sector recycling in waste management in developing countries." ''Habitat International'' 30 (2006): 797-808.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource recovery==
{{Main|Resource recovery}}

Resource recovery is the retrieval of recyclable waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=USEPA (2012)|title=Frequent Questions|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084329/http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.  This process is carried out at a resource recovery facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Government of Montana (2012)|title=Resource Recovery|url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085052/http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resource recovery is not only important to the environment, but it can be cost effective by decreasing the amount of waste sent to the disposal stream, reduce the amount of space needed for landfills, and protect limited natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grand Traverse County (2006)|title=What is Resource Recovery?|url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095910/http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy recovery==

[[Energy recovery]] from waste is using non-recyclable waste materials and extracting from it heat, electricity, or energy through a variety of processes, including [[combustion]], [[gasification]], [[pyrolyzation]], and [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref name=IGD&gt;{{cite web|last=IGD (2007)|title=Energy Recovery and Disposal|url=http://www.igd.com/our-expertise/Sustainability/Packaging-waste/3517/Energy-Recovery-and-Disposal/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407135136/http://www.igd.com/our-expertise/Sustainability/Packaging-waste/3517/Energy-Recovery-and-Disposal/|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is referred to as [[waste-to-energy]].

There are several ways to recover energy from waste. Anaerobic digestion is a naturally occurring process of [[decomposition]] where organic matter is reduced to a simpler chemical component in the absence of oxygen.&lt;ref name=IGD/&gt;  [[Incineration]] or direct controlled burning of municipal [[solid waste]] to reduce waste and make energy.  Secondary recovered fuel is the energy recovery from waste that cannot be reused or recycled from mechanical and biological treatment activities.&lt;ref name=IGD/&gt;  Pyrolysis involves heating of waste, with the absence of oxygen, to high temperatures to break down any carbon content into a mixture of gaseous and liquid fuels and solid residue.&lt;ref name=IGD/&gt; Gasification is the conversion of carbon rich material through high temperature with partial oxidation into a gas stream.&lt;ref name=IGD/&gt;  [[Plasma arc]] heating is the very high heating of municipal solid waste to temperatures ranging from 3,000-10,000&amp;nbsp;°C, where energy is released by an electrical discharge in an [[inert atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=IGD/&gt;

Using waste as fuel can offer important environmental benefits.  It can provide a safe and [[cost-effective]] option for wastes that would normally have to be dealt with through disposal.&lt;ref name=IGD/&gt; It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels, while also generating energy and using waste as fuel can reduce the [[methane emissions]] generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills.&lt;ref name=IGD/&gt;

There is some debate in the classification of certain biomass feedstock as wastes. Crude Tall Oil (CTO), a co-product of the [[pulp and paper]]making process, is  defined as a waste or residue in some European countries when in fact it is produced “on purpose” and has significant value add potential in industrial applications. Several companies use CTO to produce fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1bf7a80c-b430-11e3-a102-00144feabdc0.html#axzz369ioC1n1| title= Biofuels: Wasted Energy |publisher= Oliver, Christian, Financial Times|date= April 15, 2014|accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the pine chemicals industry maximizes it as a feedstock “producing  low-carbon, bio-based chemicals” through cascading use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/06cd4164-cefa-11e3-9165-00144feabdc0.html#axzz36K0AYbyL| title= Crude tall oil feed stocks cannot be considered ‘waste’|publisher= Moran, Kevin, Financial Times|date= April 30, 2014|accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and awareness==
[[Education]] and [[awareness]] in the area of waste and [[waste management]] is increasingly important from a global perspective of [[resource management]]. The [[Talloires Declaration]] is a declaration for [[sustainability]] concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental [[pollution]] and [[Environmental degradation|degradation]], and the [[Resource depletion|depletion]] of [[natural resources]]. Local, regional, and global [[air]] pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, [[soil]], and [[water]]; depletion of the [[ozone layer]] and emission of "green house" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its [[biodiversity]], the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing [[environmental management]] and waste management programs, e.g. the waste management university project. [[University]] and [[vocational]] education are promoted by various organizations, e.g. [[WAMITAB]] and [[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]].

'''Weigh-in-motion''' or weighing-in-motion (WIM) devices are designed to capture and record the [[axle]] weights and gross vehicle weights as vehicles drive over a measurement site. Unlike static scales, WIM&amp;nbsp;systems are capable of measuring vehicles traveling at a reduced or normal traffic speed and do not require the vehicle to come to a stop. This makes the weighing process more efficient, and, in the case of commercial vehicles, allows for trucks under the weight limit to bypass static scales or inspection.

==Road applications==
Especially for [[truck]]s gross vehicle and axle weight monitoring is useful in an array of applications including:
* [[Pavement (roads)|Pavement]] design, monitoring, and research
* [[Bridge]] design, monitoring, and research
* Size and weight enforcement, cameras integrated for automated vehicle identification
* Toll by weight
* Legislation and regulation
* Administration and planning


Weigh in motion scales are often used for size and weight enforcement, such as the [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]]'s Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks program. Weigh-in-motion systems can be used as part of traditional roadside inspection stations, or as part of virtual inspection stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/cvisn/expanded-CVISN.htm|title=Expanded CVISN capabilities|accessdate=Feb 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen the rise of several "specialty" Weigh-in-Motion systems. One popular example is the front fork garbage truck scale. In this application, a container is weighed—while it is full—as the driver lifts, and again—while it is empty—as the container is returned to the ground. The difference between the full and empty weights is equal to the weight of the contents.

Weigh-in-free-flow is system which can accurately weigh vehicles in full road width independently of the instantaneous position of the wheel during crossing. This system solves the limitations of current weigh-in-motion technologies on the roads as for example not sufficient measurement on the road ends. This free-flow solution is possible thanks to usage of optical weighing sensors which covers the full width of the road and are installed in one or two lines for the highest possible accuracy. This system is not possible to circumvent and therefore could be called the new generation of weigh-in-motion. 

===System basics&lt;ref&gt;WIM on road traffic use. [http://www.invicom.com/products/weigh-in-motion.html "Weigh in Motion Systems"]&lt;/ref&gt;===

====Sensors====
WIM systems can employ various types of sensors for measurement. The most important quantity to measure is the vertical force (z component) without any influence of forces in other directions or speed of the vehicle that passes by. Force sensors with quartz crystals are the most rigid and measure only in one direction along the vertical axis. When a force is applied to the top surface of the sensor, quartz crystals produce an electric charge proportional to the applied force. The signal is a very high impedance electric charge, which is not susceptible to electrical interference.

====Charge amplifiers====
High impedance charge signals are amplified with MOSFET based charge amplifiers and converted to a voltage output, which is connected to analysis system..

====Inductive loops====
Inductive loops define the vehicle entry and exit from the WIM station. These signals are used as triggering inputs to start and stop the measurement to initiate totaling gross vehicle weight of each vehicle. For toll gate or low speed applications, inductive loops may be replaced by other types of vehicle sensors such as light curtains, axle sensors or piezocables.

====Measurement system====
The high speed measurement system is programmed to perform calculations of the following parameters:

Axle distances,
Individual axle weights,
Gross Vehicle Weight, 
Vehicle Speed,
Distance between vehicles,
and the GPS synchronized time stamp for each vehicle measurement

The measurement system should be environmentally protected, should have a wide operating temperature range and withstand condensation.

====Communications====
Variety of communication methods need to be installed on the measurement system.  A modem or cellular modem can be provided. If no communication infrastructure exists, WIM systems can be self-operating while saving the data, to later physically retrieve it.

====Data archiving====
A WIM system connected with any available communication means can be connected to a central monitoring server. Automatic data archiving software is required to retrieve the data from many remote WIM stations to be available for any further processing. A central database can be built to link many WIMs to a server for variety of monitoring and enforcement purposes.

==Rail applications==
Weighing in motion is also a common application in rail transport. 
Known applications are&lt;ref&gt;Buurman, Gerlof and Zoeteman, Arjen. [http://www.europeanrailwayreview.com/category/err-magazine/past-issues/issue-3-2005/page/2 "A vital instrument in asset management"], ''[[European Railway Review]]'', Issue 3, 23 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Asset protection (imbalances, overloading)
* Asset management 
* Maintenance planning
* Legislation and regulation
* Administration and planning

===System basics===
There are two main parts to the measurement system: the track-side component, which contains hardware for communication, power, computation, and data acquisition, and the rail-mounted component, which consists of sensors and cabling. Known sensor principles include:
* [[strain gauge]]s: measuring the strain usually in the hub of the rail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/temtermp/2012_2nd_Expert_Group_Meeting_Ankara/TEM_March_2012_Hbm_Argos_Ankara.pdf|title = ARGOS® – a high accurate wayside train monitoring system|date = 2012|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Unece|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[fiber optic]]al sensors: measuring a change of light intensity caused by the bending of the rail&lt;ref&gt;Gotcha Monitoring Systems [http://eurailmag.com/mag/22.htm?page=107 "Longer life for track and rollingstock"], ''[[EurailMag]]'', Issue 22, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[load cell]]s: Measuring the strain change in the load cell rather than directly on the rail itself. 
* [[laser]] based systems: measuring the displacement of the rail

=== Yards and main line ===
Trains are weighed, either on the main line or at yards. 
Weighing in Motion systems installed on the [[Main line (railway)|main lines]] measure the complete weight (distribution) of the trains as they pass by at the designated line speed. Weighing in motion on the mainline is therefore also referred to as "coupled-in-motion weighing": all of the railcars are coupled.  
Weighing in motion at [[Rail yard|yards]] often measure individual wagons. It requires that the railcar are uncoupled on both ends in order to weigh. Weighing in motion at yards is therefore also referred to as "uncoupled-in-motion weighing". Systems installed at yards usually works at lower speeds and are capable of higher accuracies.

==Air applications==
Some airports use airplane weighing, whereby the plane taxis across the scale bed, and its weight is measured. The weight may then be used to correlate with the pilot's log entry, to ensure there is just enough fuel, with a little margin for safety. This has been used for some time to conserve jet fuel.

Also, the main difference in these platforms, which are basically a "transmission of weight" application, there are [[checkweigher]]s, also known as dynamic scales or in-motion scales.

The {{nihongo|'''Ōma Nuclear Power Plant'''|大間原子力発電所|Ōma genshiryoku hatsudensho}} is a nuclear plant under construction in [[Ōma, Aomori]], Japan. 
It will be operated by the [[Electric Power Development Company]] (J-Power). 
The reactor would be unique for Japan in that it would be capable of using a 100% [[MOX fuel]] core, as requested by the 1995 decision by the [[Japanese Atomic Energy Commission]]. 
The fuel would utilize surplus plutonium by blending it with natural uranium, reducing the total radioactivity of nuclear waste and dramatically reducing the waste's lifetime.

In 2008, J-Power announced a 2.5-year delay to allow for additional work to make the plant resistant to a strong earthquake, making the operation start date in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid=a5hlasWtsTT4|title=J-Power Delays Oma Nuclear Plant Start by 2½ Years (Update2)|last=Nakayama|first=Michio|author2=Sato, Shigeru |date=November 11, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-J_Power_reschedules_Ohma_start_up-1111084.html|title=J-Power reschedules Ohma start-up|date=November 11, 2008|work=[[World Nuclear News]]|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] of March 2011 construction at Oma was suspended for 18 months. 
Work was resumed on October 2012. 
On March 2013, the main reactor building was at its full height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/03/12/national/work-resumes-on-aomoris-new-oma-nuclear-plant/|title=Work resumes on Aomori’s new Oma nuclear plant|date=March 12, 2013|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
