According to [[Amikam Nachmani]], lecturer at the [[Bar-Ilan University]] in Israel, Öcalan did not know [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] when he met him in 1991.

After graduating from a vocational high school in Ankara ({{lang-tr|Ankara Tapu-Kadastro Meslek Lisesi}}), Öcalan started working at the Diyarbakir Title Deeds Office. He was relocated one month later to [[Bakırköy]], Istanbul. Later, he entered the [[Istanbul University|Istanbul Law Faculty]] but transferred after the first year to [[Ankara University]] to study political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-513250 |accessdate=22 December 2008 |title=Too many questions, but not enough answers |publisher=[[Hürriyet]] |date=8 June 1999 |work=[[Turkish Daily News]] |first=Fehmi |last=Koru |authorlink=Fehmi Koru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213080434/http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-513250 |archivedate=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His return to Ankara (normally impossible given his situation&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Normally, students can only transfer between like departments, otherwise the student must retake the university entrance exam. Moreover, Öcalan was awarded a scholarship by the Ministry of Finance, despite being ineligible due to his age, and the fact that he had participated in political demonstrations. He had also been tried and acquitted by a [[martial law]] court. The public prosecutor had asked for the harshest possible sentence.&lt;/ref&gt;) was facilitated by the state in order to divide a militant group, [[Dev-Genç]] (Revolutionary Youth Federation of Turkey), of which Öcalan at the time was a member of. President [[Süleyman Demirel]] later regretted this decision, since the PKK was to become a much greater threat to the state than Dev-Genç.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber.asp?id=13608|accessdate=4 January 2009|title='Pilot Necati' sivil istihbaratçıymış|work=[[Taraf]]|author=Nevzat Cicek|date=31 July 2008|language=tr|quote=Abdullah Öcalan'ın İstanbul'dan Ankara'ya gelmesine keşke izin verilmeseydi.

In 1978, in the midst of the right- and left-wing conflicts which culminated in the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]], Öcalan founded the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK), which launched a war against the Turkish government in order to set up an independent Kurdish state.&lt;ref name="BIRTH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-apology"&gt;{{cite news|url=//www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9905/31/ocalan.02/ |archivedate=9 December 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011209065557/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9905/31/ocalan.02/ |title=Kurdish leader Ocalan apologizes during trial |work=CNN |date=31 May 1999 |accessdate=11 January 2008 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1979 he fled to Syria, where he remained until October 1998, when the Syrian government expelled him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Mango|title=Turkey and the War on Terror: For Forty Years We Fought Alone (Contemporary Security Studies)|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35002-0|page=34|url=http://bookzz.org/ireader/889212|accessdate=24 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925130201/http://bookzz.org/ireader/889212|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Öcalan attempted in early 2004 to arrange a meeting with [[Murray Bookchin]] through his lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin's "student" eager to adapt his thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to accept the request. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message "My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan's talents to guide them". When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as "one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century", and vowed to put his theory into practice.&lt;ref name="biehl dialectics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-öcalan-and-dialectics-democracy|title=Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=16 February 2012|publisher=New Compass|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Öcalan went to Russia first and from there moved to various countries, including Italy and [[Greece]]. In 1998 the Turkish government requested the extradition of Öcalan from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Italian diplomacy tries to free herself from the tangle in which it is located, between Turks and Kurds, " internationalizing " the crisis:{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title=Ocalan: la suggestiva strategia turca per legittimare la pena capitale|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia Edizione Online|date=2000|url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89262141}} {{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at that time defended by [[Britta Böhler]], a high-profile German attorney who argued that he fought a legitimate struggle against the oppression of ethnic Kurds.

Speaking to [[Can Dündar]] on [[NTV Turkey]], the Deputy Undersecretary of the Turkish [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]], Cevat Öneş, said that Öcalan impeded American aspirations of establishing a separate Kurdish state. The Americans transferred him to the Turkish authorities, who flew him back to Turkey for trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://haber.vatanim.com.tr/haberdetay.asp?detay=Kurt_sorununun_cozumu_teroru_bitirir_203724_1&amp;Newsid=203724|accessdate=15 October 2008|title=Öcalan bağımsız devlete engeldi|date=15 October 2008|work=[[Vatan]]|quote=Öcalan yakalandığında ABD, bağımsız bir devlet kurma isteğindeydi.

Kurds living in Germany have been threatened with deportation if they continue to hold demonstrations in support of Öcalan. The warning came after three Kurds were killed and 16 injured during the [[1999 attack on Israeli Consulate in Berlin|1999 attack]] on the Israeli [[List of diplomatic missions of Israel|consulate]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=PROTESTS&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9902/17/ocalan.protest.01/ "Kurds seize embassies, wage violent protests across Europe"], CNN.com, 17 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PROTESTS-ATHENS&gt;[[Yannis Kontos]], [http://www.akakurdistan.com/kurds/stories/kontos/ "Kurd Akar Sehard Azir, 33, sets himself on fire during a demonstration outside the Greek parliament in central Athens, Greece, on Monday, 15 February 1999"], ''Photostory'', July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

After his capture, Öcalan was held in solitary confinement as the only prisoner on [[İmralı]] island in the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Although former prisoners at [[İmralı]] were transferred to other prisons, more than 1,000 Turkish military personnel were stationed on the island to guard him. A state security court consisting of three military judges was convened on the island to try him. Öcalan was charged with and convicted of treason and separatism, and sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&amp;dat=19990629&amp;id=uEYiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pKwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1200,5352234&amp;hl=en|title=The Argus-Press – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentence was commuted to [[life imprisonment]] upon the abolition of the death penalty in Turkey in August 2002.&lt;ref name="bbcnews-verdict"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/380845.stm|title=Text of the Ocalan verdict|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 June 1999|accessdate=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one had been executed in Turkey since 1984.&lt;ref name="cnn-excecutiondelay"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/01/12/ocalan.01/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526031932/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/01/12/ocalan.01/|archivedate=26 May 2006|title=Turkey delays execution of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan|publisher=CNN|date=12 January 2000|accessdate=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kurdish Human Rights Project]] (KHRP) may have aided this case's decision.&lt;ref name="KHRP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of justice, equality and the rule of law|url=http://www.khrp.org/ |work=Kurdish advocacy|publisher=Kurdish Human Rights Project|accessdate=27 November 2010|location=London|date=21 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202190819/http://www.khrp.org/|archivedate= 2 December 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the commutation, Öcalan remained imprisoned on [[İmralı]], and was the sole inmate there. In November 2009, Turkish authorities announced that Öcalan would be relocated to a new prison on the island and that they were ending his solitary confinement by transferring several other PKK prisoners to İmralı. They said that Öcalan would be allowed to see them for ten hours a week. The new prison was built after the Council of Europe's [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] visited the island and objected to the conditions in which he was being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/world/Company-at-last-for-Kurdish.5833050.jp |accessdate=27 November 2009 |title=Company at last for Kurdish inmate alone for ten years |date=18 November 2009 |work=The Scotsman |first=Ibon |last=Villelabeitia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813195513/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/world/Company-at-last-for-Kurdish.5833050.jp |archivedate=13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2009/11/10/feature-02|accessdate=27 November 2009|title=CoTurkey building new prison for PKK members|date=10 November 2009|work=Southeast European Times|first=Esra|last=Erduran|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119150253/http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2009/11/10/feature-02|archivedate=19 November 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that Turkey had violated articles 3, 5 and 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights by granting Öcalan no effective remedy to appeal his arrest and sentencing him to death without a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=773602&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=HUDOC Search Page|publisher=|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Öcalan's request for a retrial was refused by the Turkish court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=871381&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=HUDOC Search Page|publisher=|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 27 July 2011 his lawyers have not been allowed to see Abdullah Öcalan anymore. The lawyers have appealed 700 times for visits, but all were rejected. The last time Abdullah Öcalan was visited was on 11 September 2016 by his brother Mehmet Öcalan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anfenglish.com/human-rights/lawyers-appeal-to-visit-Oecalan-rejected-for-the-710th-time-23510|title=Lawyers' appeal to visit Öcalan rejected for the 710th time|work=ANF News|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal for political solution ==
{{Turkey–PKK peace process}}
Abandoning his precapture policy, which involved violence targeting civilians as well as military personnel, Öcalan has advocated a relatively peaceful solution to the Kurdish conflict inside the borders of Turkey.&lt;ref name=PEACEFUL&gt;[http://www.freedom-for-ocalan.com/english/download/REPORT%20AND%20RECOMMENDATIONS%20ON%20THE%20KURDISH%20QUESTION%20IN%20TURKEY,%20%20BY%20THE%20INTERNATIONAL%20%20DELEGATION%20OF%20HUMAN%20RIGHTS%20LAWYERS_%20JANUARY%202005.pdf REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE KURDISH QUESTION IN TURKEY] by the international delegation of human rights lawyers, January 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DIPLOMACY&gt;[http://www.etext.org/Politics/Arm.The.Spirit/Kurdistan/PKK.ERNK.ARGK/ocalan-interview-january-1999.txt Interview with Abdullah Ocalan "Our First Priority Is Diplomacy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208150820/http://www.etext.org/Politics/Arm.The.Spirit/Kurdistan/PKK.ERNK.ARGK/ocalan-interview-january-1999.txt |date=8 December 2008 }} ''Middle East Insight'' magazine, January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MYTH&gt;[http://chris-kutschera.com/A/Ocalan%20myth.htm Kurdistan Turkey: Abdullah Ocalan, The End of a Myth?] ''The Middle East'' magazine, February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PLAN&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kicadam/pers/oud/propose.html Abdullah Öcalan proposes 7-point peace plan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206081617/http://www.xs4all.nl/~kicadam/pers/oud/propose.html |date=6 December 2008 }} Kurdistan Informatie Centrum Nederland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TEK&gt;van Bruinessen, Martin.

In this zone, three bodies of law would be implemented: EU law, Turkish/Syrian/Iraqi/Iranian law and Kurdish law. This perspective was included in the PKK programme following the "Refoundation Congress" in April 2005.&lt;ref name=REFOUNDATION&gt;[http://www.pkk-info.com/tr/eskisite/pkktarihi/PKK.ilk.bildirgesi.html PKK Yeniden İnşa Bildirgesi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206200234/http://www.pkk-info.com/tr/eskisite/pkktarihi/PKK.ilk.bildirgesi.html |date=6 February 2009 }} PKK web site, 20 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Öcalan had his lawyer, Ibrahim Bilmez,&lt;ref name=LAWYER&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf?/base/international-34/1159461581252960.xml&amp;storylist=international Kurdish leader calls for cease-fire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324121340/http://www.syracuse.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Finternational-34%2F1159461581252960.xml&amp;storylist=international |date=24 March 2007 }} NewsFlash&lt;/ref&gt; release a statement 28 September 2006, calling on the PKK to declare a ceasefire and seek peace with Turkey. Öcalan's statement said, "The PKK should not use weapons unless it is attacked with the aim of annihilation," and that it is "very important to build a democratic union between Turks and Kurds. With this process, the way to democratic dialogue will be also opened".&lt;ref name=CEASE&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5389746.stm Kurdish rebel boss in truce plea], ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2010, however, Öcalan said he was abandoning an ongoing dialogue between him and Turkey saying that "this process is no longer meaningful or useful". Turkey ignored his three protocols for negotiation that included (a) his terms of health and security (b) his release and (c) a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish issue in Turkey. Though the Turkish government received these protocols, they were never published. Öcalan stated that he would leave the top PKK commanders in charge of the conflict. However, he also said that his comments should not be misinterpreted as a call for the PKK to intensify its armed conflict with the Turkish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=pkk-steps-up-attacks-in-turkey-2010-05-30|title=TURKEY – PKK steps up attacks in Turkey|publisher=|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haber.ekolay.net/haber/3/1007462/Kandil-kabul-etti-Ankara-reddetti.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426185907/http://haber.ekolay.net/haber/3/1007462/Kandil-kabul-etti-Ankara-reddetti.aspx |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Öcalan has shown renewed cooperation with the Turkish government and hope for a peaceful resolution to three decades of conflict. On 21 March 2013, Öcalan declared a ceasefire between the PKK and the Turkish state. Öcalan's statement was read to hundreds of thousands of Kurds gathered to celebrate the Kurdish New Year and it states, "Let guns be silenced and politics dominate... a new door is being opened from the process of armed conflict to democratization and democratic politics. It's not the end. It's the start of a new era." Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the statement and hope for a peaceful settlement has been raised on both sides.

Soon after Öcalan's declaration was read, the functional head of the PKK, [[Murat Karayılan]] responded by promising to implement the ceasefire, stating, "Everyone should know the PKK is as ready for peace as it is for war".

=== Democratic confederalism ===

Since his incarceration, Öcalan has significantly changed his ideology, reading Western [[social theorist]]s such as [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Fernand Braudel]],&lt;ref name=DES&gt;[http://www.pwdnerin.com/modules.php?name=Content7&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=97 Tarihli Görüşme Notları] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316140439/http://www.pwdnerin.com/modules.php?name=Content7&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=97 |date=16 March 2012 }} PWD-Kurdistan, 16 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; fashioned his ideal society as "Democratic Confederalism" (drawing heavily on Bookchin's [[libertarian socialist]] idea of "[[Communalism (political philosophy)|Communalism]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-öcalan-and-dialectics-democracy|title=Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=16 February 2012|publisher=New Compass|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as "a prophet".&lt;ref name=PROPHET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firatnews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=9119 |title=Öcalan: Diyarbakır olayları boşanmanın ilanıdır |accessdate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091938/http://www.firatnews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=9119 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }} ANF News Agency, 20 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote books&lt;ref name=BOOKS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdullah-ocalan.com/index1.htm |title=abdullah-ocalan.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106181415/http://www.abdullah-ocalan.com/index1.htm |archivedate=6 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and articles&lt;ref name=MEZOPOTAMYA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denge-mezopotamya.com/besataybet/news_detail.asp?newsid=-769564977&amp;pg=1 |title=Rayedarên tirk mafên Rêberê KCK'ê Abdullah Ocalan gasp dikin |publisher= |date= |accessdate=11 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317005939/http://www.denge-mezopotamya.com/besataybet/news_detail.asp?newsid=-769564977&amp;pg=1 |archivedate=17 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the history of pre-capitalist [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Abrahamic religions]].

With his 2005 "Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan", Öcalan advocated for a Kurdish implementation of Bookchin's ''[[The Ecology of Freedom]]'' via municipal assemblies as a democratic confederation of Kurdish communities beyond the state borders of Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Öcalan promoted a platform of shared values: environmental defense, self-defense, gender equality, and pluralistic tolerance for religion, politics, and culture. While some of his followers questioned Öcalan's conversion from [[Marxism-Leninism]], the PKK adopted Öcalan's proposal and began to form assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Enzinna |first1=Wes |title=A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS’ Backyard |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-11-24 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Followers of Öcalan and members of the PKK are known, after his [[diminutive]] name, as ''Apocu'' (Apo-ites) under his movement, ''Apoculuk'' (Apoism).&lt;ref name="Mango2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Mango|title=Turkey and the War on Terror: For Forty Years We Fought Alone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9lfQvRL7J4C&amp;pg=PA32|year=2005|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-0-415-35002-0|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aggregation''' is a subtask of [[natural language generation]], which involves merging syntactic constituents (such as sentences and phrases) together.  Sometimes aggregation can be done at a conceptual level.

==Examples==
A simple example of syntactic aggregation is merging the two [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s ''John went to the shop'' and ''John bought an apple'' into the single sentence ''John went to the shop and bought an apple''.

Syntactic aggregation can be much more complex than this.  For example, aggregation can embed one of the constituents in the other; e.g., we can aggregate ''John went to the shop'' and ''The shop was closed'' into the sentence ''John went to the shop, which was closed''.

From a pragmatic perspective, aggregating sentences together often suggests to the reader that these sentences are related to each other.  If this is not the case, the reader may be confused.  For example, someone who reads ''John went to the shop and bought an apple'' may infer that the apple was bought in the shop; if this is not the case, then these sentences should not be aggregated.

==Algorithms and issues==
Aggregation algorithms must do two things:
* Decide when two constituents should be aggregated
* Decide how two constituents should be aggregated, and create the aggregated structure

The first issue, deciding when to aggregate, is poorly understood.  Aggegration decisions certainly depend on the [[semantics|semantic]] relations between the constituents, as mentioned above; they also depend on the [[genre]] (e.g., bureaucratic texts tend to be more aggregated than instruction manuals).  They probably should depend on rhetorical and discourse structure.&lt;ref&gt;D Scott and C de Souza (1990). Getting the Message Across in RST-based Text Generation. In Dale et al (eds)''Current Research in Natural Language Generation''. Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[literacy]] level of the reader is also probably important (poor readers need shorter sentences).&lt;ref&gt;S Williams and E Reiter (2008).  Generating basic skills reports for low-skilled readers. ''Natural Language Engineering'' 14:495-535&lt;/ref&gt;  But we have no integrated model which brings all these factors together into a single [[algorithm]].

With regard to the second issue, there have been some studies of different types of aggregation, and how they should be carried out.  Harbusch and Kempen describe several syntactic aggregation strategies.  In their terminology, ''John went to the shop and bought an apple'' is an example of [[forward conjunction]] Reduction &lt;ref&gt;K Harbusch and G Kempen (2009). Generating clausal coordinate ellipsis multilingually: A uniform approach based on postediting. In ''Proc of ENLG-2009'' 28:105-144. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0624.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
.
Much less is known about conceptual aggregation.  Di Eugenio ''et al.'' show how conceptual aggregation can be done in an intelligent tutoring system, and demonstrate that performing such aggregation makes the system more effective (and that conceptual aggregation make a bigger impact than syntactic aggregation).&lt;ref&gt;B Di Eugenio, D Fossati, D Yu (2005). Aggregation improves learning: experiments in natural language generation for intelligent tutoring systems. In ''Proc of ACL-2005'' pp 50–57. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P05-1007.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Unfortunately there is not much software available for performing aggregation.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  However the simplenlg system&lt;ref&gt;A Gatt and E Reiter (2009). SimpleNLG: A realisation engine for practical applications.  ''Proceedings of ENLG09'' [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0613.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; does include limited support for basic aggregation.  For example, the following code causes simplenlg to print out ''The man is hungry and buys an apple''.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
SPhraseSpec s1 = nlgFactory.createClause("the man", "be", "hungry");
SPhraseSpec s2 = nlgFactory.createClause("the man", "buy", "an apple");
NLGElement result = new ClauseCoordinationRule().apply(s1, s2);
System.out.println(realiser.realiseSentence(result));
&lt;/source&gt;

"'''Alternative facts'''" was a phrase used by U.S. [[Counselor to the President]] [[Kellyanne Conway]] during a ''[[Meet the Press]]'' interview on January 22, 2017, in which she defended [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]]'s false statement about the attendance numbers of [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|Donald Trump's inauguration]] as President of the United States. When pressed during the interview with [[Chuck Todd]] to explain why Spicer would "utter a provable falsehood", Conway stated that Spicer was giving "alternative facts". Todd responded, "Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods."&lt;ref name ="WP2217"/&gt;

Conway's use of the phrase "alternative facts" for demonstrable falsehoods was widely mocked on social media and sharply criticized by journalists and media organizations, including [[Dan Rather]], [[Jill Abramson]], and the [[Public Relations Society of America]]. The phrase was extensively described as [[Orwellian]]. Within four days of the interview, sales of the book ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' had increased by 9,500%, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one [[bestseller]] on [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref name="Nineteen Eighty-Four"&gt;

On January 21, 2017, while [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] held his first [[press briefing]], he accused the media of deliberately underestimating the size of the crowd for [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|President Trump's inaugural ceremony]] and stated that the ceremony had drawn the "largest audience to ever witness an inauguration&amp;nbsp;– period&amp;nbsp;– both in person and around the globe".&lt;ref name="WaPo press conf"/&gt; According to [[Washington Metro|rapid transit]] ridership data and photographic evidence Spicer's claims and allegations were false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-first=Brian |author-last=Stelter |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/sean-spicer-press-secretary-statement/ |title=White House press secretary attacks media for accurately reporting inauguration crowds |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 21, 2017 |access-date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-first1=Tim |author-last1=Wallace |author-first2=Karen |author-last2=Yourish |author-first3=Troy |author-last3=Griggs |title=Trump's Inauguration vs. Obama's: Comparing the Crowds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-crowd.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/international/zuschauerzahl-bei-vereidigung-trump-beraterin-spricht-von-alternativen-fakten-zu-amtseinfuehrung-ld.141240 |title=Die Parallelwelt des Trump-Teams: "Alternative Fakten sind Lügen" |author-first=Ivo |author-last=Mijnssen |work=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] |language=de |date=January 23, 2017 |access-date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerial images showed that the turnout for Trump's inauguration was lower than the turnout for the 2009 [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]].

Spicer also gave incorrect information about the use of white ground coverings during the inauguration. He stated that they were used for the first time during the Trump inauguration and were to blame for a visual effect that made the audience look smaller. The white ground coverings, however, had been used in 2013 when Obama was sworn in for the second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/president-trumps-spokesman-just-lied-about-the-size-of-the-i |title=President Trump's Spokesman Just Lied About The Size Of The Inauguration Crowd |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |date=January 22, 2017 |access-date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spicer did not take questions from the media at the press briefing.&lt;ref name="WaPo press conf"&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Cillizza |author-first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Cillizza |title=Sean Spicer held a press conference.

[[File:Kellyanne Conway by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kellyanne Conway]], who originally used the phrase]]

Trump's campaign strategist and counselor, Kellyanne Conway, defended Spicer's statements in a ''[[Meet the Press]]'' interview. In response to a question from Todd about Trump's false claims and the loss of credibility, Conway said, "Our press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to [these claims], but the point remains that..." Todd interrupted her by saying "Wait a minute. Alternative facts? ... Alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods."&lt;ref name ="WP2217"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/22/kellyanne-conway-says-donald-trumps-team-has-alternate-facts-which-pretty-much-says-it-all/ | title=Kellyanne Conway says Donald Trump's team has 'alternative facts.'

Conway later defended her choice of words, defining "alternative facts" as "additional facts and alternative information".&lt;ref name="nuzzi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nuzzi|first1=Olivia|title=Kellyanne Conway Is the Real First Lady of Trump's America|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/kellyanne-conway-trumps-first-lady.html|work=Daily Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, Spicer corrected his statements concerning the [[WMATA]] ridership levels, stating that he had been relying on statistics "given to him". He stood by his widely disputed claim that the inauguration was the most-viewed, stating he also included online viewership in addition to in-person and television in his figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Grynbaum | first1=Michael M. | title=Sean Spicer, Trump's Press Secretary, Reboots His Relationship With the Press | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/business/media/sean-spicer-trump-press-secretary.html| date=January 23, 2017 | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Berger | first1=Judson | title=Spicer Changes Up Format at WH Briefings, Moves to Hit Reset with Press | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/23/spicer-changes-up-format-at-wh-briefings-moves-to-hit-reset-with-press.html | date=January 23, 2017 | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the week following Conway's comments, she discussed "alternative facts", substituting the phrases "alternative information" and "incomplete information".&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/a-conversation-kellyanne-conway-im-face-trumps-movement-968579 |title=A Conversation With Kellyanne Conway: "I'm the Face of Trump's Movement" |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=January 26, 2017 |access-date=January 27, 2017 |author-last=Wolff |author-first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the Todd interview she defended Trump's [[Executive Order 13769|travel restrictions]] by talking about a nonexistent "[[Bowling Green massacre]]" (she later said she was referring to the arrest of two Iraqis in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] for sending aid to insurgents in Iraq), and by falsely claiming that President Obama in 2011 had "banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/views-you-can-use/articles/2017-02-03/kellyanne-conway-gets-facts-wrong-on-bowling-green-massacre|title=Kellyanne Conway's 'Alternative Facts'|last=Hoefer|first=Hayley|date=February 3, 2017|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/02/03/trump-adviser-invents-bowling-green-massacre-defense-refugee-ban/97436748/|title=Kellyanne Conway on Bowling Green ‘massacre’: I meant ‘terrorists’|last=Hjelmgaard|first=Kim|date=February 3, 2017|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her false statements were described as having "taken 'alternative facts' to a new level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/03/kellyanne-conway-cites-bowling-green-massacre-that-never-happened-to-defend-travel-ban/ |last=Schmidt|first=Samantha| title=Kellyanne Conway cites ‘Bowling Green massacre’ that never happened to defend travel ban |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| date=February 3, 2017| accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "alternative facts" was claimed to be similar to a phrase used in Trump's 1987 book, ''[[Trump: The Art of the Deal]]''.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Micek |author-first=John L. |title=Memo to Kellyanne Conway, there is no such thing as 'alternative facts': John L.

The book claimed that "people want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular." The [[ghostwriter]] of the book, [[Tony Schwartz (author)|Tony Schwartz]], said he coined that phrase and claimed that Trump "loved it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Mayer |author-first=Jane |title=Donald Trump's Ghostwriter Tells All |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all |access-date=January 25, 2017 |work=The New Yorker |date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite news |title=Column: 'Alternative facts' play to Americans' fantasies |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/page/ct-alternative-facts-kellyanne-conway-trump-perspec-0125-20170124-story.html |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=January 24, 2017 |access-date=January 25, 2017 |author-last=Page |author-first=Clarence |authorlink=Clarence Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway later defended her remarks in an interview published in March 2017: "Two plus two is four. Three plus one is four. Partly cloudy, partly sunny. Glass half full, glass half empty. Those are alternative facts."&lt;ref name="nuzzi" /&gt; In a radio interview with Mark Simone that was described by Salon in February 2018, she claimed that professional fact-checkers tend to be political liberals and are "selecting what [they] think should be fact-checked...Americans are their own fact checkers. People know, they have their own facts and figures, in terms of meaning which facts and figures are important to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=May|first1=Charlie|title=Kellyanne Conway: The American people “have their own facts”|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/02/01/kellyanne-conway-the-american-people-have-their-own-set-of-facts/|accessdate=February 2, 2018|publisher=Salon|date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2017, the [[Public Relations Society of America]], a public relations trade group, put out a statement that said "Encouraging and perpetuating the use of alternative facts by a high-profile spokesperson reflects poorly on all communications professionals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PRSA Statement on "Alternative Facts"|url=http://media.prsa.org/news-releases/prsa-opinions-and-commentary/prsa-makes-statement-on-alternative-facts.htm|accessdate=January 25, 2017|work=The Public Relations Society of America|date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-alternative-facts-234138 | title=Public relations association rebukes Trump's White House on 'alternative facts' | work=[[Politico]] | date=January 2, 2017 | accessdate=January 25, 2017 | last=Conway | first=Madeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal usage===
In a [[Breitbart News]] article dated January 23, 2017, editor [[Joel Pollak]] defended Conway's use of "alternative facts" by arguing that it was a harmless and accurate [[Alternative pleading|term in a legal setting]], "where each side of a dispute will lay out its own version of the facts for the court to decide." ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that "[a] search of several online legal dictionaries, however, did not yield any results for the term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gabbatt|first1=Adam|title=Even rightwing sites call out Trump administration over 'alternative facts'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/23/rightwing-sites-trump-administration-alternative-facts|work=The Guardian|date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, the conservative daily magazine ''[[American Thinker]]'' argued that the "tidal wave of derision {{sic|hoisted|expected=foisted}} upon President Trump's senior adviser" had been rather shocking to observe because the derision had been "so spectacularly off base". The magazine asserted that the phrase "alternative facts" was in common use in law and that it was known to most lawyers, including Conway, with her George Washington University Law School degree, adding that, "it seems eminently possible that Ms. Conway knew exactly what it was she was saying." After giving examples of legal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |publisher=Mondaq Business Briefing |date=May 2003 |title=Statements of Truth - Alternative Facts.(Clarke v Marlborough Fine Art (London) Limited and Marlborough International Fine Art Establishment) |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-102965188.html}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-legal uses of the phrase "alternative facts", the article contended that when Chuck Todd upbraided Kellyanne Conway with the claim that "alternative facts are not facts; they're falsehoods", he was not only wrong, but "propagating an ignorance born out of lazy and shallow thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allison|first1=David|title='Alternative facts': A common legal term|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2017/02/alternative_facts_a_common_legal_term.html|website=American Thinker|accessdate=February 12, 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2017, fifteen professors of law, some of whom are themselves obliged to adhere to the [[District of Columbia]] [[Bar Association]]'s Rule of Professional Conduct, rule 8.4(a), filed a disciplinary complaint with the D.C. Bar's Office of Disciplinary Conduct. Their complaint applies against Conway, a lawyer in public office, on the grounds that under rule 8.4(c): "It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation",&lt;ref name=Rule8.4c&gt;Sari Horwitz, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/law-professors-file-misconduct-complaint-against-kellyanne-conway/2017/02/23/442b02c8-f9e3-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html "Law professors file misconduct complaint against Kellyanne Conway"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', retrieved February 23, 2017

===In popular culture===
The term alternative facts has become a mainstay in popular culture, from late night comedians to more serious news outlets. [[Jimmy Fallon]] created a segment "Two Truths and an Alternative Fact" on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/arts/television/jimmy-fallon-alternative-facts-colbert.html | title=Jimmy Fallon Offers His Own ‘Alternative Facts’}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Colbert]] criticized Conway for saying she was not [[Inspector Gadget]] or "in the job of having evidence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/03/13/conway-wiretapping-investigation-newday.cnn | title=Conway: I'm not Inspector Gadget}}&lt;/ref&gt; on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]'', claiming "Kellyanne Conway has only one move: 'Go, go, alternative facts!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3308373/stephen-colbert-mocks-kellyanne-conway-replaces-set-cameras-with-microwaves/ | title=Stephen Colbert mocks Kellyanne Conway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN]]'s ad campaign "Facts First" was a direct response to the concept of alternative facts and [[fake news]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vckz6EAn30Y | title=CNN - "This is an Apple" ad}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' listed it in their "Glossary of Trump terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/01/16/alternative-facts-witch-hunt-glossary-trump-terms/1029963001/ | title='Alternative facts' to 'witch hunt': A glossary of Trump terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] referenced alternative facts in their speech at The National Board of Review awards for the Spielberg film ''[[The Post (film)|The Post]]''. "We are in a fight and it's a fight not just about alternative facts but it's a fight for the objective truth" said Spielberg after accepting the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://popculture.com/movies/2018/01/10/robert-de-niro-bashes-donald-trump-nbr-awards/ | title=Robert De Niro Mocks President Trump in Profanity-Laced Tirade at NBR Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 [[short film]] ''Alternative Math'' is a satire about the absurdity of the concept of alternative facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2017/11/watch-three-subversive-comedies-for-free-online/ | title=Watch Three Subversive Comedies For Free Online |last1=Knecht |first1=Lyndsay |last2=Lester |first2=Demetria |date=November 24, 2017 |website=[[D Magazine]] |accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2018, German linguists declared the phrase "alternative facts" the [[Un-word of the year|non-word of the year 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/01/16/alternative-facts-witch-hunt-glossary-trump-terms/1029963001/ | title='Alternative Facts' Is 2017's Non-Word of the Year, German Linguists Declare}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also chosen by Austrian linguists as the non-word of the year in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/5334483/Vollholler-zum-rotweissroten-Wort-des-Jahres-gewaehlt|title="Vollholler" zum rot-weiß-roten Wort des Jahres gewählt|work=Die Presse|access-date=January 18, 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archiv für slavische Philologie, volume I, 1876.jpg|thumb|''Archiv für slavische Philologie'', volume I, 1876.]]
'''''Archiv für slavische Philologie''''' is the oldest [[Slavic studies|Slavic]] philological journal, generally considered as the best in the field at the time it was published. It was founded in 1875 by [[Vatroslav Jagić]] and published by [[Weidmannsche Buchhandlung]] in Berlin, and thanks to the historian [[Theodor Mommsen]] the journal received financial support from the [[Prussian Ministry of Education]]. Jagić edited the journal of since 1876 intermittently until 1920, when the 37th volume was published. After Jagić's death in 1923 it was issued irregularly by [[Erich Berneker]], but after 42 volumes it was finally shut down in 1929.&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=3605 |contribution=Archiv für slavische Philologie |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=May 20, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagić published papers about phonological, grammatical and syntactical structure of all [[Slavic languages]], descriptions of ancient Slavic literary monuments, oral literary tradition, culture, [[Slavic mythology|mythology]], bibliographies and other texts. He decided on [[German language|German]] as the language of the journal which sparked a backlash in Slavic countries, but it was due to this decision that the journal became a mediator between the Slavic and Western European science and Slavic studies reached the level of [[Germanic studies|Germanic]] and [[Romance studies]].&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

All of the prominent Slavic and many non-Slavic philologists contributed to the journal. Jagić himself was a prolific contributor, writing extensive studies and contributions in sections ''Anzeigen'' and ''Kleine Mitteilungen''.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

'''Audio mining''' is a technique by which the content of an audio signal can be automatically analysed and searched. It is most commonly used in the field of [[speech recognition|automatic speech recognition]], where the analysis tries to identify any speech within the audio. The audio will typically be processed by a speech recognition system in order to identify word or [[phoneme]] units that are likely to occur in the spoken content. This information may either be used immediately in pre-defined searches for keywords or phrases (a real-time "word spotting" system), or the output of the speech recogniser may be stored in an index file. One or more audio mining index files can then be loaded at a later date in order to run searches for keywords or phrases.

The results of a search will normally be in terms of hits, which are regions within files that are good matches for the chosen keywords. The user may then be able to listen to the audio corresponding to these hits in order to verify if a correct match was found.

Audio mining systems used in the field of speech recognition are often divided into two groups: those that use [[Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recogniser]]s (LVCSR) and those that use phonetic recognition. 

Musical audio mining (also known as [[music information retrieval]]) relates to the identification of perceptually important characteristics of a piece of music such as melodic, harmonic or rhythmic structure. Searches can then be carried out to find pieces of music that are similar in terms of their melodic, harmonic and/or rhythmic characteristics.

An '''author''' is the creator or originator of any written work such as a book or play, and is thus also a [[writer]]. More broadly defined, an author is "the person who originated or gave existence to anything" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magill |first1=Frank N.|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors|edition=revised  |volume=vols. I, II, III |year=1974 |publisher=Salem Press |location=Inglewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn= |pages=1–1973}} [A compilation of the bibliographies and short biographies of notable authors up to 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal significance of authorship==
[[File:Fermat Last Theorem "proof" registered by Ukraine officials.jpg|thumb|left|A copyright certificate certifying the authorship for a proof of the [[Fermat's Last Theorem|Fermat theorem]], issued by the State Department of Intellectual Property of [[Ukraine]].]]
Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the author. If more than one person created the work, then a case of [[joint authorship]] can be made provided some criteria are met. In the [[copyright law]]s of various jurisdictions, there is a necessity for little flexibility regarding what constitutes authorship. The [[United States Copyright Office]], for example, defines copyright as "a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of "original works of authorship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding the title of "author" over any "literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, [or] certain other intellectual works" gives rights to this person, the owner of the copyright, especially the exclusive right to engage in or authorize any production or distribution of their work. Any person or entity wishing to use [[intellectual property]] held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work, and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material. After a fixed amount of time, the copyright expires on intellectual work and it enters the public domain, where it can be used without limit. Copyright laws in many jurisdictions – mostly following the lead of the United States, in which the entertainment and publishing industries have very strong [[lobbying]] power – have been amended repeatedly since their inception, to extend the length of this fixed period where the work is exclusively controlled by the copyright holder. However, copyright is merely the legal reassurance that one owns his/her work. Technically, someone owns their work from the time it's created. An interesting aspect of authorship emerges with copyright in that, in many jurisdictions, it can be passed down to another upon one's death. The person who inherits the copyright is not the author, but enjoys the same legal benefits.

Questions arise as to the application of copyright law. How does it, for example, apply to the complex issue of [[fan fiction]]?  If the media agency responsible for the authorized production allows material from fans, what is the limit before legal constraints from actors, music, and other considerations, come into play? Additionally, how does copyright apply to fan-generated stories for books? What powers do the original authors, as well as the publishers, have in regulating or even stopping the fan fiction?  This particular sort of case also illustrates how complex intellectual property law can be, since such fiction may also involved [[trademark law]] (e.g. for names of characters in media franchises), [[likeness rights]] (such as for actors, or even entirely fictional entities), [[fair use]] rights held by the public (including the right to parody or satirize), and many other interacting complications.  Authors may portion out different rights they hold to different parties, at different times, and for different purposes or uses, such as the right to adapt a plot into a film, but only with different character names, because the characters have already been optioned by another company for a television series or a video game.  An author may also not have rights when working under contract that they would otherwise have, such as when creating a [[work for hire]] (e.g., hired to write a city tour guide by a municipal government that totally owns the copyright to the finished work), or when writing material using intellectual property owned by others (such as when writing a novel or screenplay that is a new installment in an already established media franchise).

==Philosophical views of the nature of authorship==
[[File:Mark Twain, Brady-Handy photo portrait, Feb 7, 1871, cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mark Twain]] was a prominent American author in multiple genres including fiction and journalism during the 19th century.]]
In literary theory, critics find complications in the term ''author'' beyond what constitutes authorship in a legal setting. In the wake of [[postmodern literature]], critics such as [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have examined the role and relevance of authorship to the meaning or interpretation of a text.

Barthes challenges the idea that a text can be attributed to any single author. He writes, in his essay "Death of the Author" (1968), that "it is language which speaks, not the author".&lt;ref name="barthes"&gt;{{Citation
| last = Barthes
|first = Roland |
chapter = The Death of the Author |
year = 1968 |
title = Image, Music, Text |
publication-date = 1997 | isbn = 0-00-686135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words and language of a text itself determine and expose meaning for Barthes, and not someone possessing legal responsibility for the process of its production. Every line of written text is a mere reflection of references from any of a multitude of traditions, or, as Barthes puts it, "the text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture"; it is never original.&lt;ref name="barthes"/&gt; With this, the perspective of the author is removed from the text, and the limits formerly imposed by the idea of one authorial voice, one ultimate and universal meaning, are destroyed. The explanation and meaning of a work does not have to be sought in the one who produced it, "as if it were always in the end, through the more or less transparent allegory of the fiction, the voice of a single person, the author 'confiding' in us".&lt;ref name="barthes"/&gt; The psyche, culture, fanaticism of an author can be disregarded when interpreting a text, because the words are rich enough themselves with all of the traditions of language. To expose meanings in a written work without appealing to the celebrity of an author, their tastes, passions, vices, is, to Barthes, to allow language to speak, rather than author.

Michel Foucault argues in his essay "What is an author?" (1969) that all authors are [[writer]]s, but not all writers are authors. He states that "a private letter may have a signatory—it does not have an author".&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;{{Citation |

publication-date = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a reader to assign the title of author upon any written work is to attribute certain standards upon the text which, for Foucault, are working in conjunction with the idea of "the author function".&lt;ref name="Foucault"/&gt; Foucault's author function is the idea that an author exists only as a function of a written work, a part of its structure, but not necessarily part of the interpretive process. The author's name "indicates the status of the discourse within a society and culture", and at one time was used as an anchor for interpreting a text, a practice which Barthes would argue is not a particularly relevant or valid endeavor.&lt;ref name="Foucault"/&gt;

Expanding upon Foucault's position, [[Alexander Nehamas]] writes that Foucault suggests "an author [...] is whoever can be understood to have produced a particular text as we interpret it", not necessarily who penned the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |

Foucault warns of the risks of keeping the author's name in mind during interpretation, because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation.

Literary critics Barthes and Foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work, because of the complications inherent with a writer's title of "author". They warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice. Instead, readers should allow a text to be interpreted in terms of the language as "author".

==Relationship with publisher==

===Self-publishing===
{{Main article|Self-publishing}}
Self-publishing, self-publishing, independent publishing, or artisanal publishing is the "publication of any book, album or other media by its author without the involvement of a traditional publisher. It is the modern equivalent to traditional publishing".

====Types====
Unless a book is to be sold directly from the author to the public, an [[ISBN]] is required to uniquely identify the title.  ISBN is a global standard used for all titles worldwide. Most self-publishing companies either provide their own ISBN to a title or can provide direction;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ ISBN us.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416211950/http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ |date=16 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be in the best interest of the self-published author to retain ownership of ISBN and copyright instead of using a number owned by a vanity press. A separate ISBN is needed for each edition of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/04/the-easiest-cheapest-fastest-way-to-self-publish-your-book097/|title=The Easiest, Cheapest, Fastest Way to Self-Publish Your Book – Mediashift – PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Electronic (e-book) publishing =====
{{Main article|E-book}}
There are a variety of e-book formats and tools that can be used to create them. Because it is possible to create e-books with no up-front or per-book costs, this is a popular option for self-publishers. E-book publishing platforms include Pronoun, Smashwords, Blurb, Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, [http://www.cinnamonteal.in CinnamonTeal Publishing], [http://www.papyruseditor.com Papyrus Editor], [http://www.ebookleap.com ebook leap], Bookbaby, Pubit, [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]], [[Llumina Press]], and CreateSpace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/09/how-to-self-publish-your-e-book259/|title=How to Self-Publish Your E-Book – Mediashift – PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.umn.edu/faq/22714 Lib.umn.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; E-book formats include e-pub, mobi, and PDF, among others.

=====Print-on-demand=====
{{Main article|Print-on-demand}}
Print-on-demand (POD) publishing refers to the ability to print high-quality books as needed. For self-published books, this is often a more economical option than conducting a print run of hundreds or thousands of books. Many companies, such as Createspace (owned by Amazon.com), [[Outskirts Press]], Blurb, Lulu, [[Llumina Press]], Readers Magnet, and iUniverse, allow printing single books at per-book costs not much higher than those paid by publishing companies for large print runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Motoko|title=Math of Publishing Meets the E-Book|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/business/media/01ebooks.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=9 May 2013|date=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Morris|title=Print on Demand Publishing|url=http://www.fonerbooks.com/pod.htm|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional publishing===
With commissioned publishing, the publisher makes all the publication arrangements and the author covers all expenses.

The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher {{according to whom|date=August 2016}}, versus a [[self-publishing]] author or an unpublished one.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The author of a work may receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price or a fixed amount on each book sold. Publishers, at times, reduced the risk of this type of arrangement, by agreeing only to pay this after a certain number of copies had sold. In Canada, this practice occurred during the 1890s, but was not commonplace until the 1920s. Established and successful authors may receive advance payments, set against future royalties, but this is no longer common practice. Most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts – how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher. Under this arrangement, the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication. The costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher, who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts. See Compensation for more.

===Vanity publishing===
This type of publisher normally charges a flat fee for arranging publication, offers a platform for selling, and then takes a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book. The author receives the rest of the money made.

==Relationship with editor==
[[File:Ezra Pound 2.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of Ezra H. Pound|[[Ezra Pound]] (pictured as a young man in 1913) made significant editing suggestions to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s "[[The Waste Land]]," helping transform the original drafts into the work known today.]]
The relationship between the author and the [[Book editor|editor]], often the author's only liaison to the publishing company, is often characterized as the site of tension. For the author to reach his or her audience, the work usually must attract the attention of the editor. The idea of the author as the sole meaning-maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher in order to engage the audience in writing as a social act. There are three principal areas covered by editors – Proofing (checking the Grammar and spelling, looking for typing errors), Story (potentially an area of deep angst for both author and publisher), and Layout (the setting of the final proof ready for publishing often requires minor text changes so a layout editor is required to ensure that these do not alter the sense of the text).

[[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s essay "The Field of Cultural Production" depicts the publishing industry as a "space of literary or artistic position-takings", also called the "field of struggles", which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed." The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu claims that the "field of position-takings [...] is not the product of coherence-seeking intention or objective consensus", meaning that an industry characterized by position-takings is not one of harmony and neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed." The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 34&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for the writer, their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity, and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity. However, it is the editor who has "the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed." The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 42&lt;/ref&gt; As "cultural investors," publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in "cultural capital" which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed." The Field of Cultural Product'''Bold text'''ion: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the studies of James Curran, the system of shared values among editors in Britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors' expectations, removing the focus from the reader-audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act. Even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readership's reception.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, James. "Literary Editors, Social Networks and Cultural Tradition." Media Organizations in Society. James Curran, ed. London: Arnold, 2000, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compensation ==
A standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties. An advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication. An advance must be earned out before royalties are payable. An advance may be paid in two lump sums: the first payment on contract signing, and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication.

An author's contract may specify, for example, that they will earn 10% of the retail price of each book sold. Some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable (for example, where royalties start at 10% for the first 10,000 sales, but then increase to a higher percentage rate at higher sale thresholds).

An author's book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid. For example, if an author is paid a modest advance of $2000, and their royalty rate is 10% of a book priced at $20 – that is, $2 per book – the book will need to sell 1000 copies before any further payment will be made. Publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns.

In some countries, authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the ELR (educational lending right) and PLR (public lending right) schemes in Australia. Under these schemes, authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and/or public libraries.

These days, many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements, school visits, residencies, grants, and teaching positions.

[[Ghostwriter]]s, technical writers, and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way: usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales.

The '''caret''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ær|ə|t}} is an inverted V-shaped [[grapheme]]. It is the spacing character '''^''' in [[ASCII]] (at [[code point]] 5E[[hexadecimal|&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and other [[character set]]s that may also be called a ''hat'', ''control'', ''uparrow'', or, less frequently, ''[[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]'', ''[[Exclusive or|xor]] sign'','' 'to the [[Exponentiation|power of]]' ''(exponent), ''pointer'' (in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]),&lt;ref name="Jargon File"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/ASCII.html | title = ASCII | work = The Jargon File 4.4.7 | publisher = Eric S. Raymond | date = 29 December 2003 | accessdate = 22 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''wedge''. Officially, this character is referred to as ''[[circumflex]] accent'' in both ASCII&lt;ref name="SWCS"/&gt; and [[Unicode]]&lt;ref name="Unicode Basic Latin"/&gt; terminology (because of its historical use in [[overstrike]]), whereas ''caret'' refers to a similar but lowered Unicode character: {{unichar|2038|caret}}. Additionally, there is a lowered variant with a stroke: {{unichar|2041|caret insertion point}}.&lt;ref name="Unicode General Punctuation"/&gt;

The caret and circumflex are not to be confused with other chevron-shaped characters, such as {{unichar|028C|Latin small letter turned v|nlink=Turned v}} or {{unichar|2227|logical and|nlink=}}, which may occasionally be called carets, too.&lt;ref name="Unicode IPA Extensions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisstein"/&gt;

==Origins==

===Proofreading mark===

The caret was originally and continues to be used in handwritten form as a [[proofreading]] mark to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document.&lt;ref name="MLA" /&gt; The term comes from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|caret}}, "it lacks", from {{lang|la|carēre}}, "to lack; to be separated from; to be free from".&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster" /&gt; The caret symbol is written below the line of text for a line-level punctuation mark, such as a [[comma]], or above the line as an inverted caret ([[cf.]] {{unichar|02C7|caron|nlink=}}) for a higher character, such as an [[apostrophe]];&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; the material to be inserted may be placed inside the caret, in the margin, or above the line.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Circumflex accent===

A raised variant of the symbol can be found on some [[typewriter]]s, where it is used to denote a [[circumflex]] in some languages, such as French and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It is typically a [[dead key]], which does not cause the carriage to advance and thus allows the following letter to strike the same spot (below the circumflex) on the paper.

As regards [[computer system]]s, the original 1963 version of the ASCII standard reserved the code point 5E&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; for an [[Arrow (symbol)|up-arrow (↑)]]. However, the 1965 [[ECMA-6]] standard replaced the up-arrow with a circumflex (^), which was applicable as a [[diacritic]] as well, and two years later, the second revision of ASCII followed suit.&lt;ref name="Jennings" /&gt; As the early [[mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[minicomputer]]s largely used [[teleprinter]]s as output devices, it was possible to print the circumflex above a letter when needed. With the proliferation of [[monochrome monitor|monitor]]s, however, this was seen insufficient, and [[precomposed character]]s, with the diacritic included, were instead introduced into appended character sets, such as [[Latin-1]]. The original circumflex character was left for other purposes, and as it did not need to fit above a letter anymore, it became larger in appearance.&lt;ref name="Korpela" /&gt;

==Uses==

===Programming languages===

The caret has many uses in [[programming language]]s. It can signify exponentiation, the bitwise [[XOR]] operator, [[string concatenation]], and [[control character]]s in [[caret notation]], among other uses. In [[regular expression]]s, the caret is used to match the beginning of a string or line; if it begins a character class, then the inverse of the class is to be matched.

[[ANSI C]] can transcribe the caret in the form of the [[C trigraph|trigraph]] &lt;code&gt;??'&lt;/code&gt;, as the character was originally not available in all character sets and keyboards. 
[[C++]] additionally supports tokens like &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; (for &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;xor_eq&lt;/code&gt; (for &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;) to avoid the character altogether. 
[[RFC 1345]] recommends to transcribe the character as [[Digraph (computing)|digraph]] &lt;code&gt;'&gt;&lt;/code&gt; when required.&lt;ref name="RFC1345"&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1345 RFC 1345]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] uses the caret for declaring and dereferencing [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s. 
In [[Smalltalk]], the caret is the method return statement.
In [[C++/CLI]], .NET reference types are accessed through a handle using the &lt;code&gt;ClassName^&lt;/code&gt; syntax.
In Apple's [[Blocks (C language extension)|C extensions]] for Mac OS X and iOS, carets are used to create [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]] and to denote block types.
[[Go (programming language)|Go]] uses it as a [[bitwise NOT]] operator.

===Surrogate symbol for superscript and exponentiation===

In [[mathematics]], the caret can signify [[exponentiation]] (&lt;code&gt;3^5&lt;/code&gt; for {{math|3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}), where the usual [[Subscript and superscript|superscript]] is not readily usable (as on some [[graphing calculator]]s). The caret is also now used to indicate a superscript in [[TeX]] typesetting. As [[Isaac Asimov]] described it in his 1974 "''Skewered!''" essay (on [[Skewes' number]]), "I make the exponent a figure of normal size and it is as though it is being held up by a lever, and its added weight when its size grows bends the lever down."&lt;ref name="Asimov" /&gt; The use of the caret for exponentiation can be traced back to [[ALGOL 60]],{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} which expressed the exponentiation operator as an upward-pointing arrow, intended to evoke the superscript notation common in mathematics. The upward-pointing arrow is now used as a form of [[Tetration|iterated exponentiation]] in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].

===Escape character===

The command-line interpreter, [[cmd.exe]], of Windows family of operating systems uses the caret (^) to [[escape character|escape]] reserved characters.

;Example:
 &lt;source lang="doscon" inline&gt;C:\&gt;ECHO Show greater than: ^&gt; pipe: ^| less than: ^&lt; caret: ^^ and  ^%TMP^% and ^&amp;&lt;/source&gt;
 Show greater than: &gt; pipe: | less than: &lt; caret: ^ and  %TMP% and &amp;

===Ordinal indicator===

In Italian, the caret is sometimes used in a similar manner to the [[ordinal indicator]], most noticeably on tickets from [[Trenitalia]], the primary operator of trains within Italy, and [[Rome|Rome's]] ATAC public transit system.  On Trenitalia tickets, the [[travel class]] is often written as 1^ or 2^, meaning [[First class travel|first class]] or second class respectively. This is due to the lack of the feminine [[Ordinal indicator#Galician, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish|ordinal indicator (&lt;sup&gt;−a&lt;/sup&gt;)]] used in Italian in the ASCII set (the masculine ordinal indicator is usually replaced by the [[degree sign]] when extended characters are not available or in less accurate typesetting).

===Signature tag===
In [[social network service]]s such as [[Twitter]], a caret placed before a word is used to tag that word as an individual's signature within a group account thus differentiating an individual's contribution from a group-authored contribution.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The caret is also a trademarked symbol for denoting a [[Single point of contact|Single Point of Contact]] or SPOC.

===Upwards-pointing arrow===

In [[internet forum]]s, [[social networking sites]] such as Facebook, or in [[online chat]]s, a caret or a series of carets may be used beneath or after the post of one user by another user. In this usage, the caret ^ represents an upwards-pointing arrow meaning for readers, [[Posting style|post]]ers or the [[original post]] (OP) to see the above line/post,&lt;ref name="Computer Hope" /&gt; and in addition to the arrow usage, can also mean that the user who posted the ^ agrees with the above post. Multiple carets may indicate the comment is replying to or relating to the post above that correlates with the number of carets used, or may simply be used for emphasis.

A similar use has been adopted by programming language [[compiler]]s such as Java compiler to point out where a [[compilation error]] has occurred. In addition to indicating the line number and column number of the error location, the compiler prints out the faulty line of code and uses a single caret on the next line, padded by spaces, to give a visual indication of the error location. The caret acts as an upwards-pointing arrow in the text-based print out of the error details.

===Estimator===
In statistics or other forms of estimation, [[estimator]]s of a parameter or dependent variable can be shown by use of a caret or hat symbol above the symbol for that parameter or dependent variable. For example, with observations of independent variable data &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and dependent variable data &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;, and assuming a model of &lt;math&gt;y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1 x_i+\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;, [[simple linear regression]] can lead to an estimated model of the form &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 x_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sum_i (y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2&lt;/math&gt; is minimised by finding optimal values of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_1&lt;/math&gt; for the observed data.

'''Ephrem the Syrian''' ({{lang-syc|ܡܪܝ ܐܦܪܝܡ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ}} ''Mār Ap̠rêm Suryāyâ'', {{IPA-syc|mɒr aɸˈrem surˈjɒˌjɒ}}; {{lang-grc-koi|Ἐφραίμ ὁ Σῦρος}}; {{lang-la|Ephraem Syrus}}, also known as ''Saint Ephraem'', ''Ephrem'', or ''Ephraim''; c. 306 – 373) was a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] deacon and a prolific Syriac-language hymnographer and [[Christian theology|theologian]] of the fourth century.

Ephrem is especially beloved in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], and counted as a Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted Monk) in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. His [[feast day]] is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers. He was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] in the [[Catholic Church]] in 1920.

Ephrem wrote a wide variety of hymns, poems, and sermons in verse, as well as prose [[exegesis]]. These were works of practical theology for the edification of the [[Christian Church|Church]] in troubled times. So popular were his works, that, for centuries after his death, Christian authors wrote hundreds of [[pseudepigrapha]]l works in his name. He has been called the most significant of all of the fathers of the Syriac-speaking church tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Parry (1999), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ephrem was born around the year 306 in the city of [[Nisibis]] (now Nusaybin in Turkey), in the contested border region between [[Asōristān|Sassanid Assyria]] and [[Roman Mesopotamia]], [[Peace of Nisibis (299)|then-recently]] acquired by Rome.&lt;ref name="Karim2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karim|first=Cyril Aphrem|title=Symbols of the cross in the writings of the early Syriac Fathers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUcx14_IlE4C&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=8 June 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-230-3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipiński2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipiński|first=Edward|title=The Aramaeans: their ancient history, culture, religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrMKKtiBBI4C&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=8 June 2011|year=2000|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0859-8|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Possekel1999"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZ3gGQuJUS4C&amp;pg=PA1|title=Evidence of Greek philosophical concepts in the writings of Ephrem the Syrian|last=Possekel|first=Ute|publisher=Peeters Publishers|year=1999|isbn=978-90-429-0759-1|page=1|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CameronKuhrt1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Averil|last2=Kuhrt|first2=Amélie|title=Images of women in antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96g-d90oDpwC&amp;pg=PA288|accessdate=8 June 2011|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-09095-7|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Internal evidence from Ephrem's hymnody suggests that both his parents were part of the growing Christian community in the city, although later [[hagiographer]]s wrote that his father was a pagan priest.&lt;ref name=Labourt&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05498a.htm Labourt, Jérôme. "St. Ephraem." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 8 Mar. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous languages were spoken in the Nisibis of Ephrem's day, mostly dialects of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The Christian community used the [[Syriac language|Syriac dialect]]. The culture included pagan religions, [[Judaism]] and early Christian sects.

[[Jacob of Nisibis|Jacob]], the second [[bishop]] of Nisibis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Nisibis|title= Nisibis|first= Siméon|last= Vailhé|work= Original Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher= [[Catholic Answers]]|location= [[El Cajon, California]]|accessdate= 2010-12-10|quote= The See of Nisibis was founded in 300 by Babu (d. 309).

Jacob of Nisibis is recorded as a signatory at the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325. Ephrem was baptized as a youth and almost certainly became a [[Members of the Covenant|son of the covenant]], an unusual form of syriac proto-[[monasticism]]. Jacob appointed Ephrem as a teacher (Syriac ''malp̄ānâ'', a title that still carries great respect for Syriac Christians). He was ordained as a [[deacon]] either at his baptism or later.&lt;ref&gt;Parry (1999), pp. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt; He began to compose hymns and write biblical commentaries as part of his educational office. In his hymns, he sometimes refers to himself as a "herdsman" ({{lang|syr|ܥܠܢܐ}}, ''‘allānâ''), to his bishop as the "shepherd" ({{lang|syr|ܪܥܝܐ}}, ''rā‘yâ''), and to his community as a 'fold' ({{lang|syr|ܕܝܪܐ}}, ''dayrâ''). Ephrem is popularly credited as the founder of the [[School of Nisibis]], which, in later centuries, was the centre of learning of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].

Seizing on this opportunity, [[Shapur II]] of Persia began a series of attacks into Roman North [[Mesopotamia]]. Nisibis was besieged in 338, 346 and 350. During the first siege, Ephrem credits Bishop Jacob as defending the city with his prayers.  In the third siege, of 350, Shapur rerouted the River Mygdonius to undermine the walls of Nisibis. The Nisibenes quickly repaired the walls while the Persian elephant cavalry became bogged down in the wet ground. Ephrem celebrated what he saw as the miraculous salvation of the city in a hymn that portrayed Nisibis as being like [[Noah's Ark]], floating to safety on the flood.

One important physical link to Ephrem's lifetime is the [[baptistery]] of Nisibis. The inscription tells that it was constructed under Bishop Vologeses in 359. In that year, Shapur attacked again. The cities around Nisibis were destroyed one by one, and their citizens killed or deported. [[Constantius II]] was unable to respond; the campaign of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in 363 ended with his death in battle.  His army elected [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] as the new emperor, and to rescue his army, he was forced to surrender Nisibis to Persia&lt;ref name=Labourt/&gt; (also in 363) and to permit the expulsion of the entire Christian population.

Ephrem, with the others, went first to Amida ([[Diyarbakır]]), eventually settling in [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]&lt;ref name=Labourt/&gt; (modern [[Şanlıurfa]]) in 363. Ephrem, in his late fifties, applied himself to ministry in his new church and seems to have continued his work as a teacher, perhaps in the [[School of Edessa]]. Edessa had always been at the heart of the Syriac-speaking world, and the city was full of rival philosophies and religions. Ephrem comments that orthodox Nicene Christians were simply called "Palutians" in Edessa, after a former bishop. [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Marcionism|Marcionites]], [[Manichaeism|Manichees]], [[Bardaisan]]ites and various [[Gnosticism|gnostic sects]] proclaimed themselves as the true church. In this confusion, Ephrem wrote a great number of hymns defending Nicene orthodoxy. A later Syriac writer, [[Jacob of Serugh]], wrote that Ephrem rehearsed all-female choirs to sing his hymns set to Syriac folk tunes in the forum of Edessa. After a ten-year residency in Edessa, in his sixties, Ephrem succumbed to the plague as he ministered to its victims. The most reliable date for his death is 9 June 373.

==Writings==

Over four hundred [[hymn]]s composed by Ephrem still exist. Granted that some have been lost, Ephrem's productivity is not in doubt. The church historian [[Sozomen]] credits Ephrem with having written over three million lines. Ephrem combines in his writing a threefold heritage: he draws on the models and methods of early [[Rabbinic Judaism]], he engages skillfully with Greek science and philosophy, and he delights in the Mesopotamian/Persian tradition of mystery symbolism.

The most important of his works are his lyric, teaching hymns ({{lang|syr|ܡܕܖ̈ܫܐ}}, ''madrāšê''). These hymns are full of rich, poetic imagery drawn from biblical sources, folk tradition, and other religions and philosophies. The madrāšê are written in stanzas of [[syllabic verse]] and employ over fifty different metrical schemes. Each madrāšâ had its ''qālâ'' ({{lang|syr|ܩܠܐ}}), a traditional tune identified by its opening line. All of these qālê are now lost. It seems that [[Bardaisan]] and [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] composed madrāšê, and Ephrem felt that the medium was a suitable tool to use against their claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1409 Foley, Leonard. "St. Ephrem", ''Saint of the Day'', Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt;  The madrāšê are gathered into various hymn cycles. Each group has a title — ''Carmina Nisibena'', ''On Faith'', ''On Paradise'', ''On Virginity'', ''Against Heresies'' — but some of these titles do not do justice to the entirety of the collection (for instance, only the first half of the ''Carmina Nisibena'' is about Nisibis). Each madrāšâ usually had a refrain ({{lang|syr|ܥܘܢܝܬܐ}}, ''‘ûnîṯâ''), which was repeated after each stanza. Later writers have suggested that the madrāšê were sung by all-women choirs with an accompanying lyre.

Particularly influential were his ''Hymns Against Heresies''.&lt;ref&gt;Mourachian, Mark. "Hymns Against Heresies: Comments on St. Ephrem the Syrian". ''Sophia'' 37:2, (Winter 2007), pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies that threatened to divide the early church. He lamented that the faithful were "tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles."&lt;ref&gt;Eph 4:14, as quoted in Mourachian (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He devised hymns laden with doctrinal details to inoculate right-thinking Christians against heresies such as [[docetism]]. The ''Hymns Against Heresies'' employ colourful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as fully human and divine. Ephrem asserts that Christ's unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christ's nature and, in doing so, rend and devalue Christ's followers with their false teachings.

Ephrem also wrote verse homilies ({{lang|syr|ܡܐܡܖ̈ܐ}}, ''mêmrê''). These sermons in poetry are far fewer in number than the madrāšê. The mêmrê were written in a heptosyllabic [[couplet]]s (pairs of lines of seven syllables each).

The third category of Ephrem's writings is his prose work. He wrote a biblical commentary on the [[Diatessaron]] (the single gospel harmony of the early Syriac church), the Syriac original of which was found in 1957. His ''Commentary on Genesis and Exodus'' is an exegesis of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. Some fragments exist in Armenian of his commentaries on the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and [[Pauline Epistles]].

He also wrote refutations against [[Bardaisan]], Mani, [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]] and others.

Ephrem is attributed with writing [[hagiography|hagiographies]] such as ''[[The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot]]'', though this credit is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Women of the Syrian Orient|last2=Harvey|first2=Susan Ashbrook|date=1987|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21366-1|location=Berkeley|last1=Brook|first1=Sebastian P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ephrem wrote exclusively in the [[Syriac language]], but translations of his writings exist in [[Classical Armenian language|Classical Armenian]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Old Georgian language|Old Georgian]], [[Koine Greek]] and other languages. Some of his works are only extant in translation (particularly in Armenian). Syriac churches still use many of Ephrem's hymns as part of the annual cycle of worship. However, most of these liturgical hymns are edited and conflated versions of the originals.

The most complete, critical text of authentic Ephrem was compiled between 1955 and 1979 by Dom Edmund Beck, OSB, as part of the ''Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium''.

As Chronologist, St. Ephrem the Syrian has composed the history of the Patriarchs and Kings from the Creation to the Crucifixion of Christ, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160810191441/http://www.filbluz.ca/resources/Book-of-the-cave-of-Treasure.pdf The Book of the Cave of Treasure]'', translated by W. Budge from the Syriac text of the British Museum Mss Add. 25875, published by The Religious Tract Society, 1927.

===Symbols and metaphors===
Ephrem's writings contain a rich variety of symbols and metaphors. Christopher Buck gives a summary of analysis of a selection of six key scenarios (the way, robe of glory, [[sons and daughters of the Covenant]], wedding feast, [[harrowing of hell]], [[Noah’s Ark]]/Mariner) and six root metaphors (physician, medicine of life, mirror, pearl, [[Tree of life]], [[paradise]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buck |first=Christopher |title=Paradise and Paradigm |year=1999 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |isbn=9780791497944 |url=http://bahai-library.com/buck_paradise_paradigm |pages= 77–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek Ephrem==
Ephrem's artful meditations on the symbols of Christian faith and his stand against heresy made him a popular source of inspiration throughout the church. This occurred to the extent that there is a huge corpus of Ephrem pseudepigraphy and legendary [[hagiography]]. Some of these compositions are in verse, often a version of Ephrem's heptosyllabic couplets. Most of these works are considerably later compositions in Greek. Students of Ephrem often refer to this corpus as having a single author called "Greek Ephrem", or ''Ephraem Graecus'' (as opposed to the real Ephrem the Syrian). This is not to say that all texts ascribed to Ephrem in Greek are by others, but many are. Although Greek compositions are the main source of pseudepigraphal material, there are also works in [[Latin]], [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. There has been very little critical examination of these works, and many are still treasured by some churches as authentic.

The best known of these writings is the ''[[Prayer of Saint Ephrem]]'', which is recited at every service during [[Great Lent]] and other fasting periods in [[Eastern Christianity]].

==Veneration as a saint==
[[File:George John Ephraim Triptychon fragment Sinai 14th century.jpg|thumb|Saints Ephrem (right) [[St. George|George]] (top) and [[St. John Damascene|John Damascene]] on a 14th-century triptych]]
[[File:Icône Ephrem le Syrien.jpg|thumb|Contemporary Romanian icon (2005)]]
Soon after Ephrem's death, legendary accounts of his life began to circulate. One of the earlier "modifications" is the statement that Ephrem's father was a pagan priest of Abnil or Abizal. However, internal evidence from his authentic writings suggest that he was raised by Christian parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oca.org/saints/lives/2018/01/28/100328-venerable-ephraim-the-syrian "Venerable Ephraim the Syrian", Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second legend attached to Ephrem is that he was a monk. In Ephrem's day, monasticism was in its infancy in Egypt. He seems to have been a part of the [[members of the covenant]], a close-knit, urban community of Christians that had "covenanted" themselves to service and had [[sexual abstinence|refrained from sexual activity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Some of the Syriac terms that Ephrem used to describe his community were later used to describe monastic communities, but the assertion that he was monk is anachronistic.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Later hagiographers often painted a picture of Ephrem as an extreme ascetic, but the internal evidence of his authentic writings show him to have had a very active role, both within his church community and through witness to those outside of it.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Ephrem is venerated as an example of monastic discipline in [[Eastern Christianity]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] scheme of hagiography, Ephrem is counted as a Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted Monk). His [[feast day]] is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers ([[Cheesefare]] Saturday), which is the Saturday before the beginning of [[Great Lent]].

Ephrem is popularly believed to have taken legendary journeys.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In one of these he visits [[Basil of Caesarea]]. This links the Syrian Ephrem with the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and is an important theological bridge between the spiritual view of the two, who held much in common. Ephrem is also supposed to have visited [[Saint Pishoy]] in the monasteries of [[Scetes]] in [[Egypt]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As with the legendary visit with Basil, this visit is a theological bridge between the origins of monasticism and its spread throughout the church.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

On 5 October 1920, Pope [[Benedict XV]] proclaimed Ephrem a [[Doctor of the Church]] ("Doctor of the Syrians").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_05101920_principi-apostolorum-petro_en.html PRINCIPI APOSTOLORUM PETRO] at Vatican.va&lt;/ref&gt; This proclamation was made before critical editions of Ephrem's authentic writings were available.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The most popular title for Ephrem is ''Harp of the Spirit'' (Syriac: {{lang|syr|ܟܢܪܐ ܕܪܘܚܐ}}, ''Kenārâ d-Rûḥâ''). He is also referred to as the Deacon of Edessa, the Sun of the Syrians and a Pillar of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05498a.htm New Advent] at newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt;

His Roman Catholic feast day of 9 June conforms to his date of death. For 48 years (1920–1969), it was on 18 June, and this date is still observed in the Extraordinary Form.

Ephrem is honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on June 10.

{{for|the molding defect|Flow marks}}

A '''flow line''', used on a drilling rig, is a large diameter pipe (typically a section of [[Casing (borehole)|casing]]) that is connected to the [[bell nipple]] (under the [[drill floor]]) and extends to the [[possum belly]] (on the [[mud tank]]s) and acts as a return line, (for the [[drilling fluid]] as it comes out of the hole), to the [[mud tank]]s.

==Flow Line Components==

The flow line will typically have equipment attached to it, such as a [[flow show]], [[possum belly]] and the [[sample box]]

===Flow Show===

The [[flow show]] ''shows'' whether [[drilling fluid]] is flowing down the flow line or not and any changes in that flow. High-pressure jets are typically attached along its length to dislodge any obstructions (such as [[drill cuttings]] collecting in one spot) that may occur. 

===Possum Belly===

The [[possum belly]] is used to slow the flow of returning [[drilling fluid]] before it hits the [[shale shakers]]. This enables the shale shaker to clean the cuttings out of the drilling fluid before it is returned to the pits for circulation.

===Sample Box===

Another common add on is the sample box. This is a heavy duty rubber hose that is inserted at the end of the flow line and at the other end emplaced into the sample box itself. The sample box is used to capture samples of drill cuttings for geological logging. The box is typically equipped with a raising door that allows the water and cuttings to escape after a sample is collected.

==Stinger Line==

A stinger line is similar to a flow line, but unlike a flow line is not used to maintain circulation. The stinger line is attached to the [[blowout preventer]] to allow for the pressure from a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] to be released. The stinger line usually will run parallel to the flow line.

[[Image:Frame lines.svg|thumb|Frame lines shown in red on a "full-frame" negative, and on a "hard-matted" 1.85:1 projection print, both on [[35 mm]] film.]]
A '''frame line''' is the unused space that separates two adjacent images, or [[film frame]]s, on the [[release print]] of a [[film|motion picture]]. They can vary in width; a [[35 mm film]] with a [[aspect ratio (image)|1.85:1]] [[Matte (filmmaking)#Mattes and widescreen filming|hard matte]] has a frame line approximately 8 millimeters (0.3&amp;nbsp;inches) high, whereas both a [[full frame]] negative and the [[anamorphic format]] have very narrow frame lines, with the frames very close together. When a film is properly projected, the frame lines should not be visible to the audience and are typically cropped out in [[movie projector|projection]] with an aperture mask.

'''Frederick Barbarossa Memorial''' is a monument dedicated to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I located in [[Mersin Province]], southern [[Turkey]].
[[File:Gustave dore crusades death of frederick of germany.jpg|thumb|"Death of Frederick of Germany" by [[Gustave Doré]]. ]]

==Location==
It is at {{coord|36|24|00|N|33|51|36|E|display=inline,title}} about {{cvt|9|km}} west of [[Silifke]] and by the state highway {{TUR-D|715}}. It overlooks the [[Göksu River]].

==History==
[[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] ({{lang-de|Friedrich Barbarossa}}) (reigned 1155–1190) participated in the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–1192). After having left much of [[Anatolia]] behind, he drowned on 10 June 1190 in the Saleph River, what is [[Göksu River]] today. While crossing the river, his horse slipped and threw him against the rocks.

==Memorial==
An inscription was placed close to the point of Frederick's demise by the Embassy of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stauferstelen.net/texts/staufergraeber-d.htm#silifke  Gedenkstein (1971) {{de icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the highway was widened by the [[General Directorate of Highways (Turkey)|General Directorate of Highways]], a larger monument with a larger than life statue of the emperor was inaugurated at the present place on 11 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edebiyatvesanatakademisi.com/Forum/Detay/gezelim-gorelim/frederic-barbarossa-aniti-silifke-33844.aspx Literature and art academy periodical {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haberler.com/alman-imparatorunun-heykeli-yeni-yerinde-3614536-haberi/ Haberler page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The new location was determined by the German ambassador Prof. Pascal Hector. The bilingual ([[German language|German]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) inscription is identical to that of 1971 and reads: 

:''Holy Roman-German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who was in friendly agreement with the Seljukid Sultan Kılıçarslan II for a free passage, drowned in Göksu River around this place while going to Palestine with his army.'' 
 
The text, although not in perfect accord with the historical fact, conveys a peaceful message.
 
The statue disappeared a year after the inauguration. Only the base of the monument is left.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stauferstelen.net/texts/staufergraeber-d.htm#2012 Neues Monumentaldenkmal (2012) {{de icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Suggestions==
According to local historian Dr. Mustafa Erim, Silifke citizens ask for a statue of [[Kılıçarslan II]], who was the [[Seljuks of Anatolia|Seljukid]] sultan in 1190, next to that of Frederick Barbarossa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anamurhaber.com/mobil/kose-yazisi/26/silifke-mut-karayolu-uzerindeki-friedrich-barbarossa-aniti.html Anamur newspaper {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sun ripened dates (80320).jpg|thumb|"Use this card to order - it requires no postage" c.1949]]

'''Freepost''' is a postal service provided by various [[postal administration]]s, whereby a person sends [[mail]] without affixing [[postage]], and the recipient pays the postage when collecting the mail.  Freepost differs from [[self-addressed stamped envelope]]s, [[courtesy reply mail]], and [[metered reply mail]] in that the recipient of the freepost pays only for those items that are actually received, rather than for all that are distributed.

==Uses==
In one typical use of freepost, a business sends [[bulk mail]] to potential customers, the bulk mail including [[envelope]]s or [[postcard]]s that potential customers can return to the business by freepost.  In another typical use, [[magazine]]s include subscription cards that potential subscribers can return by freepost.  In yet another typical use, a seller can provide a merchandise return [[label]] bearing the appropriate freepost [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] (as described below) to a customer so that the customer can return the item to the seller by freepost upon issuance of a [[Return Merchandise Authorization]].

A non-commercial usecase would be to return lost items belonging to some business: the item will have printed on the back "if found please return by freepost to &lt;address&gt;". For example, UK's [[National Health Service|NHS]] worker's [[RFID]] access cards can be returned by freepost if lost &amp; found.

==By country==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], freepost is called '''Reply Paid'''. Specially printed envelopes are used, with the permit holder's address, the words "Reply Paid" with an authorization number. The stamp is replaced by three black stripes. The permit holder pays the postage plus a fee to the postal authority. The customer may write the Reply Paid envelope out by hand.

:Centrelink Australia,
:REPLY PAID# 7800,
:CANBERRA BC, ACT, 2610,
:AUSTRALIA

An important customer like the Taxation Office would have an RP number the same as the post code, to minimize errors even more.

:Reply Paid 1435 
:Wherever NSW 1435

===Canada===
To coordinate service with the United States, [[Canada Post]] uses the same terminology and the same standards as the USPS (as explained below), with the exception of the use of Canadian [[Postal codes]].

===United States===
[[Image:Business Reply Mail.svg|thumb|200px|right|Business Reply Mail]]
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Postal Service]] refers to freepost as '''business reply mail'''.  A mailer wishing to receive mail by freepost must obtain a '''business reply permit''' and design the envelopes, postcards, or labels according to the standards specified by the USPS, including the use of an appropriate [[Facing Identification Mark|FIM]] B or C code.  The [[Address (geography)|address]] on the envelope, postcard, or label is the same as the address for regular mail, except that the [[ZIP code|ZIP+4 code]] is different.  In some large cities, business reply mail has its own five-digit ZIP code or codes (e.g., 20077 and 20078 in [[Washington, D.C.]]).  The envelope or postcard also includes space for the business reply permit number.

===United Kingdom and New Zealand===
In the UK and NZ, freepost envelopes can be hand addressed by the sender; this simply requires including the word ‘FREEPOST’ and the recipient’s permit number as part of the address.  (This technique can not be used to send mail to merely anyone, who would then have to pay for it; the permit number and the recipient address must match for the recipient to be billed.)  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Freepost rules|url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/content3?catId=600016&amp;mediaId=52300701|publisher=UK Royal Mail|accessdate=22 March 2011}}{{deadlink|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, freepost is addressed exactly the same as normal mail. The recipient needs a special address: an answering number (antwoordnummer in Dutch). The sender can distinguish these addresses because they include the word 'antwoordnummer' and may choose whether or not to use a stamp. When no stamp is used, the recipient pays the costs plus a fee, but when the sender uses a stamp, no extra costs are made.

===Finland===
In Finland, there are two types of freepost. In the first one, that is used on order that company has sent and customer wants to return it (for example, an order from an e-commerce store), the customer can use the same envelope the company sent and simply write ‘PALAUTUS’ or ‘ASIAKASPALAUTUS’ (‘RETURN’ or ‘CUSTOMER RETURN’ in English). The company must have a contract with the Finnish postal service [[Itella]]. 

The other option is to use following form:

:Company name
:Tunnus: 12345
:00003 VASTAUSLÄHETYS

Where ''‘tunnus’'' means ‘code’ and ''‘vastauslähetys’'' means ‘return delivery’. Postal code is always same for these deliveries. There is usually some text indicating that postage is paid on the upper-right corner. (where stamp would be located) Companies can, however design this text, or image, themselves to match the company logo instead of using the standard one. The company must also have contract with Itella. The address may be handwritten by the customer.

===More generally===
Other countries use freepost as well, although the envelope designs required by those countries' postal authorities differ widely from that described above.  A freepost address may have a special '''freepost number''' for use along with, or instead of, the address for regular mail.

==International Business Reply Service (IBRS)==
[[File:International Business Reply Service.jpg|thumb|Example of an International Business Reply Service envelope that would be accepted by the United States Postal Service for free delivery to addresses outside the USA.&lt;ref name="usps"/&gt;]]
International freepost also exists and is known variously as ‘International Business Reply Service’, ‘International Business Reply Mail’, 'International Business Response Service', 'IBRS' and, in French, "Correspondance Commerciale-Réponse Internationale" (CCRI).  Like USPS business reply mail, international business reply mail must conform to certain format requirements, including the prominent notice "REPONSE PAYEE" (French for "reply paid"), and a number indicating the account that will pay for the postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=USPS|title=International Mail Manual|year=2010|url=http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc3_025.htm|accessdate=September 2, 2011|postscript=,}} §382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc3_021.htm#ep28826 |title=International Business Reply Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
International Business Reply Service is a convenient way for international customers to reply to the sender with pre-paid cards and envelopes, at no cost to them.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intellectually, it was based on the close relationship between the library and the teaching departments.  The library at UCL rejected the major published classification schemes because "none of them would generally acceptable to the teaching departments without such major modifications as would have destroyed its essential character."&lt;ref name="Garside1955" /&gt;
instead, it was modeled around the "subject reading rooms" into which the collection had been divided.  The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme.

==Main outline==

The principles of the scheme were "To provide the optimum arrangement of books in each subject; to permit the revision of the classification to meet a changing academic approach to a subject without disturbing in any way other parts of the scheme; and to provide as simple a shelf mark as possible to help the reader find the book he wants with the minimum mental effort." &lt;ref name=Folklore&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article ''The basic principles of the new library classification at University College London''&lt;ref name="Garside1955" /&gt; Garside set out the generic structure of the system.  The library would be divided into subject based reading rooms such as, in the below example, a dedicated space for biology related materials. These would then be subdivided according to the below table, using alphabetical characters:
{|border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|A
|The subject generally
|-
|B-W
|Main sections of the subject
|-
|X-Y
|Subsidiary works studied in conjunction with the main topic
|-
|Z
|Works not properly belonging to the subject but required to be shelved with it
|}

The alphabetical sub-divisions were designed in consultation with the teaching department.&lt;ref name=Folklore /&gt;
These subsections would then be divided by numbers:
{|border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|1
|Bibliographies
|-
|2
|Reference works
|-
|3
|Periodicals and series
|-

|Miscellanies
|-
|7
|Monographs
|-
|8
|History of the subject
|-
|9
|Methodology
|-
|10 &gt;
|Special topics
|}

The completed shelf mark would then include the first three letters of the author's surname.

==Subject sequence==

In order to provide for a single subject card catalogue, Garside added a further table to which the top reading room divisions could be mapped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14203">The [[orthography]] of the [[Greek language]] ultimately has its roots in the adoption of the [[Greek alphabet]] in the 9th century BC. Some time prior to that, one early form of Greek, [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean]], was written in [[Linear B]], although there was a lapse of several centuries (the [[Greek Dark Ages]]) between the time Mycenaean stopped being written and the time when the Greek alphabet came into use.

Early Greek writing in the Greek alphabet was [[Phonemic orthographic|phonemic]], different in each [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialect]].  Since the adoption of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant for [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403 BC, however, Greek orthography has been largely conservative and historical.

Given the [[History of Greek|phonetic development of Greek]], especially in the [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic period]], certain modern vowel phonemes have multiple orthographic realizations:
*{{IPA|/i/}} can be spelled η, ι, υ, ει, οι, or υι (see [[Iotacism]]);
*{{IPA|/e/}} can be spelled either ε or αι;
*{{IPA|/o/}} can be spelled either ο or ω.
This affects not only lexical items but also inflectional affixes, so correct orthography requires mastery of formal grammar, ''e.g.'' {{lang|el|η καλή}} {{IPA|/i kaˈli/}} 'the good one ([[feminine gender|fem]]. [[Grammatical number|sing]].)' ''vs.'' {{lang|el|οι καλοί}} {{IPA|/i kaˈli/}} 'the good ones ([[masculine gender|masc]]. [[plural|pl]].)'; {{lang|el|καλώ}} {{IPA|/kaˈlo/}} 'I call' ''vs.'' {{lang|el|καλό}} {{IPA|/kaˈlo/}} 'good ([[neuter gender|neut]]. [[Grammatical number|sing]].)'.&lt;!-- Please don't disambiguate the [[~~ gender]] links, for clarity --&gt;

Similarly, the orthography preserves ancient doubled consonants, though these are now pronounced the same as single consonants, except in [[Cypriot Greek]].

== Digraphs and diphthongs ==
A [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] is a pair of letters used to write one sound or a combination of sounds that does not correspond to the written letters in sequence. The orthography of Greek includes several digraphs, including various pairs of vowel letters that used to be pronounced as [[diphthong]]s but have been shortened to [[monophthong]]s in pronunciation. Many of these are characteristic developments of modern Greek, but some were already present in Classical Greek. None of them is regarded as a letter of the alphabet.

During the [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine period]], it became customary to write the [[silent letter|silent]] iota in digraphs as an [[iota subscript]].

==Diacritics==
{{main|Greek diacritics}}

Polytonic [[spelling]] uses a variety of [[diacritic]]s to represent aspects of the pronunciation of [[ancient Greek]]. Polytonic, along with [[lowercase]] letters, became standard in [[Byzantine Greek]], although the ancient distinctions had disappeared, replaced by a simple stress accent. The [[orthography|orthographies]] of modern Greek, both ''[[katharevousa]]'' and [[Demotic Greek|''dhimotiki'']], used the polytonic system until 1982, when monotonic spelling was introduced.  In some conservative contexts, such as the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Church]], polytonic spellings are still used.

Monotonic orthography, adopted in 1982, replaces the ancient diacritics with just two: the [[acute accent]] (''tónos'', e.g. {{lang|grc|ί}}), used to mark the stressed syllable in polysyllabic words, and the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''dialytiká'', e.g. {{lang|grc|ϊ}}), which indicates that the vowel is not part of a digraph.

==Punctuation==
[[Ancient Greek]] was written as {{lang|la|[[scripta continua]]}} without [[space (typography)|spacing]] or [[interpunct]]s. Over time, a variety of symbols appeared. A system of dots credited to [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] was developed in the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC: a [[hypostigme|low dot]] {{angle bracket|.}} marked an occasion for a short breath after a short phrase, a [[stigme mese|middot]] {{angle bracket|·}} marked an occasion for a longer breath after a longer passage, and a [[stigme teleia|high dot]] {{angle bracket|˙}} marked a full stop at the end of a completed thought. Other writers employed [[two dot punctuation]] {{angle bracket|⁚}} to mark the ends of sentences or changing speakers. Less often, arrangements of three {{angle bracket|⁝}}, four {{angle bracket|⁞}} and {{angle bracket|⁘}}, and five dots {{angle bracket|⁙}} appeared. Such interline punctuation could be noted or replaced by a variety of {{lang|el-Latn|[[paragraphoi]]}}, long marks which trailed between lines of text; these might also mark changes of speakers. Blank lines or various {{lang|el-Latn|[[editorial coronis|coronides]]}} marked the ends of sections. (A separate {{lang|el-Latn|[[coronis (diacritic)|coronis]]}} was used to mark [[crasis|contractions]]; its early forms looked like an apostrophe between the two elided words.) Over time, the main punctuation came to be a [[full stop]] marked by a single dot at varying heights, a [[semicolon|partial stop]] marked by various forms of [[comma]]s, and the {{lang|el-Latn|[[hypodiastole]]}} {{angle bracket|⸒}} and [[papyrological hyphen]] {{angle bracket|‿}} or {{angle bracket| ͜ }}. These served to show whether an ambiguous series of letters should be read as (respectively) a single word or as a pair of words.&lt;ref name=nicky&gt;{{cite web |last= Nicolas |first= Nick |date=2005 |title=Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation |url= http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.htm |work= Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  |location= University of California, Irvine |access-date= 2014-10-07 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010180952/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html | archivedate= 2014-10-10 | dead-url= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref&gt;Nicolas, Nick.

Accessed 7 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref--&gt; Later [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] modified this system (see: [[Aristarchian symbols]]).

Following the [[printing#History|advent of printing]], most Greek punctuation was gradually standardized with [[French punctuation|French]]: the {{lang|el-Latn|[[hypodiastole]]}} was fully unified with the comma, the [[comma]] serves as the [[decimal point]] (and in this use is called the {{lang|el-Latn|hypodiastole}}) and it also functions as a [[silent letter]] in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing {{wikt-lang|el|ό,τι}} ({{lang|el-Latn|ó,ti}}, "whatever") from {{wikt-lang|el|ότι}} ({{lang|el-Latn|óti}}, "that").&lt;ref name="nicky"/&gt; The [[full stop]] serves as the [[thousands separator]], and [[guillemet]]s ({{lang|el|εισαγωγικά}}) and [[em dash|em-length]] [[quotation dash]]es ({{lang|el|παύλα}}) typically serve to indicate direct speech.{{refn|In informal writing, English-style [[quotation mark]]s have also become quite common.&lt;ref name="lookgreek"/&gt;}} The principal difference is the [[Greek question mark]] {{angle bracket|;}}, which developed a shape so similar to the [[Latin script|Latinate]] [[semicolon]] {{angle bracket|;}} that [[Unicode]] decomposes its separate code point identically.&lt;ref name="nicky"/&gt; The {{lang|el-Latn|[[ano teleia]]}} middot serves as the Greek semicolon but is so uncommon that it has often been left off of Greek [[computer keyboard|keyboards]].&lt;ref name="lookgreek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greek.kanlis.com/script.html |title=The Look of Greek |accessdate=8 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[exclamation mark#Greek|exclamation mark]] ({{lang|el|Θαυμαστικό}}) is mostly used as in English. The [[hyphen]], the [[brackets]], the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], the [[ellipsis]] and the [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] are also in use. The slash has the additional function of forming common abbreviations like {{lang|el|α/φοί}} for {{lang|el|αδελφοί}} 'brothers'. The [[Greek ligatures|ligature]] [[Kai (conjunction)|kai]] (ϗ) is sometimes used for the same function as the English [[ampersand]].

There are special rules for how to write [[Greek numerals]]. In [[modern Greek]], a number of changes have been made. Instead of extending an [[overline]] over an entire number (like {{overline|χξϛ}}), a '''{{lang|el-Latn|keraia}}'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{lang|el|κεραία}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"hornlike projection") is placed to its upper right, a development of the short marks formerly used for single numbers and fractions. The modern {{lang|el-Latn|keraia}} is a symbol (&lt;big&gt;ʹ&lt;/big&gt;) similar to the [[acute accent]] (´), but has its own [[Unicode]] character, encoded as U+0374. [[Alexander the Great]]'s father [[Philip II of Macedon]] is thus known as {{lang|el|Φίλιππος Βʹ}} in modern Greek. A lower left {{lang|el-Latn|keraia}} (Unicode: U+0375, "Greek Lower Numeral Sign") is now standard for distinguishing thousands: 2015 is represented as ͵ΒΙΕʹ (2000 + 10 + 5).

'''Haruai''' (less commonly '''Harway''') is one of two languages of the Piawi family of New Guinea. The language has borrowings from [[Kalam language|Kalam]]. Young men are likely to know [[Kobon language|Kobon]] and [[Tok Pisin]], but many Haruai are monolingual. Commonly known as Waibuk, also Wiyaw, Wovan, Taman. Dialects are North Waibuk (Hamil), Central Waibuk (Mambar), South Waibuk (Arama); [[word taboo]] is practiced but does not impede communication.

'''Jean Marigny''' (born 9 April 1939 in [[Cherbourg]]) is a French [[emeritus professor]] of [[Stendhal University]] in [[Grenoble]], where he taught [[English literature|English]] and [[American literature]]. He is a specialist on [[vampires]], from ancient [[Vampire folklore|folklore]] to modern vampire myth.

== Career ==
Jean Marigny has devoted much of his career to the myth of vampires, he is the founder of the research centre for studies in fantasy and horror in English and American literature: the {{lang|fr|Groupe d’Études et de Recherches sur le Fantastique}} (GERF, lit. ‘Group of Studies and Research on Fantasy’) which he directed several years at Stendhal University. He is also a member of the Canadian branch of the [[Transylvanian Society of Dracula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clefdargent.free.fr/marigny.php |title=Jean Marigny |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=[[La Clef d'Argent]] |publisher= |accessdate=2018-01-25 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his [[doctoral dissertation]] in 1985, {{lang|fr|Le Vampire dans la littérature anglo-saxonne}}, he has published a number of essays and translated novels and short stories about the vampire theme. He published two anthologies, {{lang|fr|Histoires anglo-saxonnes de Vampires}} in 1978 and {{lang|fr|Les Vampires : Dracula et les siens}} (in collaboration with [[Roger Bozzetto]]) in 1997. He is the author of {{lang|fr|Sang pour sang : Le réveil des vampires}} (1992), a copiously illustrated [[Pocket edition|pocket book]] that has been translated into eight languages (including English) and was a reaction to [[Francis Coppola]]’s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula|Dracula]]''.&lt;ref name=HVC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brunogerelli.info/Histoires-de-vampires-a-Claix.html |title=Histoires de vampires à Claix |last=Gerelli |first=Bruno |date=17 July 2011 |website=brunogerelli.info |access-date=25 January 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also directed a collective work on [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] for the collection ‘{{lang|fr|Figures mythiques|italic=no}}’ published by {{ill|Éditions Autrement|fr}}. Marigny is considered one of the greatest vampire specialists around the world, particularly with regard to Anglo-Saxon fiction on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vampirisme.com/auteur/jean-marigny/ |title=Jean Marigny |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=vampirisme.com |publisher= |accessdate=2018-01-25 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What fascinates Marigny about vampire is the character: a paradoxical being. As he explains, ‘No fictional character is more emblematic of the fantasy than the vampire. If it is true that […] fantasy is based on paradox, the vampire is the best illustration, since it is both dead and alive.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marigny |first=Jean |date=2003 |title=Le vampire dans la littérature du XXᵉ siècle |trans-title=Vampire in the 20th-century Literature |url= |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher={{ill|Éditions Honoré Champion|fr}} |page=10 |isbn=9782745308184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vampires – Restless Creatures of the Night &amp; Vampires – The World of the Undead.jpg|thumb|left|300px|US edition (left) and UK edition.]]
{{lang|fr|Sang pour sang, le réveil des vampires}} (lit. "Blood for Blood: The Reawakening of the Vampires"; UK edition – ''Vampires: The World of the Undead''; US edition – ''Vampires: Restless Creatures of the Night'') is a pocket-sized book on [[vampirology]] published by [[Éditions Gallimard]] in 1992 in the {{lang|fr|Traditions}} series of their {{lang|fr|[[Découvertes Gallimard|Découvertes]]}} collection. Jean Marigny traces in four chapters the history and evolution of this creature in [[Vampire folklore by region|legends]] and [[Vampire literature|literature]], from antiquity to the gaslit streets of London: the origins of the myth, the reference to Greek mythology in particular, confusion with the undead, fears related to the plague in Medieval times… (chap. Ⅰ, "Blood Lust"); the Church recognised the existence of the living dead (chap. Ⅱ, "The Consecrated Vampire"). The golden age of the vampire was in the [[Enlightenment era]] where such beliefs should have been banned (chap. Ⅲ, "The Golden Age of Vampirism"). Then in the [[Victorian era]] the vampire became an indisputable character of theatres and nightlife (chap. Ⅳ, "The Reawakening of the Vampire"). It is not [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', but the ''[[The Vampyre|vampyre]]'' of [[John William Polidori]] is the first published modern vampire story, the book is dedicated to this [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writer. Marigny explains in the book that Stoker was inspired by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s ''[[Carmilla]]'' for his own novel. The book addresses, among other topics, the cult of blood, [[Vlad the Impaler]], [[Elizabeth Báthory|Countess Báthory]], the superstitions, the reaction of the Church to vampirism and [[Vampire films|vampires in cinema]].

At the back of the book is the "Documents" section containing a compilation of excerpts which is divided into seven parts: 1, Dracula, the tyrant; 2, Vampirism through the centuries; 3, The rationalist response; 4, The vampire in poetry; 5, The vampire in prose; 6, A night in Count Dracula's castle; 7, The vampire in film. These are followed by a filmography, further reading, list of illustrations and an index.

{{lang|fr|Sang pour sang}} was originally a reaction to [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula|Dracula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ricochet-jeunes.org/articles/decouvertes-gallimard-ou-la-culture-encyclopedique-la-francaise |title=Découvertes Gallimard ou la culture encyclopédique à la française : Une encyclopédie en quatre cent quinze volumes |language=fr |last=Hache-Bissette |first=Françoise |date=2002 |website=ricochet-jeunes.org |publisher= |access-date=25 October 2018 |quote=[…] une grande réactivité par rapport à l'actualité, par exemple : […] ''Sang pour sang, le réveil des vampires'' (nº 161) pour la sortie du film ''Dracula'' de Coppola en 1992 […]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film, media coverage around vampires was in full swing, therefore, Gallimard was looking for an author to write a book about vampires for their {{lang|fr|Découvertes}} collection. It was Jean Marigny, noticed by his dissertation on vampires in the Anglo-Saxon literature, whom would be chosen. After a few weeks of intensive work to match the release of the book with the release of the film, {{lang|fr|Sang pour sang}} was born. It was an immediate success that the book has sold 130,000 copies and was reprinted several times.&lt;ref name=HVC /&gt; It has been translated into [[American English|American]] and [[British English]], Japanese, Korean, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]]. A revised and updated French edition came out in 2010, driven by the success of the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series.&lt;ref name=HVC /&gt;

The '''Kven language''' (''kvääni'' or ''kväänin kieli''; ''kainu'' or ''kainun kieli''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Söderholm |first=Eira |date=2017 |title=Kvensk grammatikk |trans-title=A Grammar of Kven |url=https://press.nordicopenaccess.no/index.php/noasp/catalog/book/24 |language=Norwegian |publisher=Cappelen Damm Akademisk |isbn=9788202569655}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Finnish language|Finnish dialect]] spoken in northern [[Norway]] by the [[Kven people]]. For political and historical reasons, it received the status of a minority language in 2005 within the framework of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. [[linguistics|Linguistically]], however, it is seen as a [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] [[dialect]] of the [[Finnish language]], and grouped together with the [[Peräpohjola dialects]] such as [[Meänkieli]], spoken in [[Meänmaa|Torne Valley]] in [[Sweden]].

Contrary to popular belief, the dialects spoken by the Kvens and [[Kainuu]] peoples are not closely related. The Kainuu dialect is one of the [[Savo Finnish|Savonian dialects]] that was formed from the 16th century onwards, when immigrants from [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] started to settle in the northern wastelands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian [[loanword]]s, such as ''tyskäläinen'' (from the Norwegian word ''tysk'', meaning ''German'') instead of standard Finnish ''saksalainen''. The Kven language also uses some old Finnish words that are no longer used in [[Finland]].

There are about 1,500 to 10,000 known native speakers of this language, most of whom are over the age of 60. This population uses it as their main way of communicating and speaks no other language. This is a growing concern because as this population ages and soon passes away, there is fear that the Kven language will die out as well. Middle aged speakers tend to have a passing knowledge of the language. They use it occasionally, but not frequently enough to keep it off the endangered list. People under the age of 30 are barely seen to speak or know the language. However, children in the community of [[Børselv]] can learn Kven in their primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4147|title=Did you know Kven Finnish is severely endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There is no complete grammar for the language and scarce material, making it hard for this language to be learned. The Kven Assembly was formed in 2007 and plans to standardize a Kven written language. The term "Kven" first appeared in Othere's tales from the 800's along with the term "Finn" and "Norwegian". The area that the Kvens lived in was called Kvenland. They originally settled in Kvenland, which also expanded into the flat areas of the Bay of Bothnia. As the Kven community continued to grow and develop a long standing culture, the Norwegian state deemed the Kvens taxpayers and the term "Kven" soon became an ethical term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kvener.no/kven-language-and-culture-english/|title=Kven language and culture (En) {{!}}        Norske Kveners Forbund|website=kvener.no|access-date=2017-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318034727/http://kvener.no/kven-language-and-culture-english/|archive-date=2017-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, The European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages was set into place. This charter was set in place to protect regional and minority languages, the agreement included Kven as a minority language. The Kven language, however protected under the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, is only considered a Level I. This means that the culture and language are barely protected under this charter and with the language dying out it is important that the language be moved up to a level III.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/european-charter-regional-or-minority-languages|title=The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is the European convention for the protection and promotion of languages used by traditional minorities.|website=European Charter for Regional &lt;br&gt;or Minority Languages|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
The Norwegian Kven Organization was established in 1987. The organization currently has about 700 members and about 8 different local branches.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The duties of this organization include many different tasks. The members report to the government about the history and rights of the Kven people. The members also try and highlight Kven news by advancing Kvens media coverage. The organization has also been pushing the Norwegian government to establish a state secretary for Kven issues. Moving the language of Kven into kindergarten classrooms, as well as all other education levels is also a forefront issue that the organization is aiming to tackle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pietikäinen|first=Sari|last2=Huss|first2=Leena|last3=Laihiala-Kankainen|first3=Sirkka|last4=Aikio-Puoskari|first4=Ulla|last5=Lane|first5=Pia|date=2010-06-01|title=Regulating Multilingualism in the North Calotte: The Case of Kven, Meänkieli and Sámi Languages|journal=Acta Borealia|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/08003831.2010.486923|issn=0800-3831}}&lt;/ref&gt; All advances made by the Norwegian Kven Organization is to promote the growth and conservation of the Kven language and culture.

== Official status ==
From the 1860s onwards the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian government]] attempted to assimilate the Kvens. For example, the use of the Kven language became forbidden in schools and government offices, and Kven town names were replaced by Norwegian names. From the 1970s onwards, the [[Kven people|Kvens]] and the [[Sami people|Sami]] in [[Norway]] have openly been allowed to use their original native languages, the Kven language and the [[Sami languages]], respectively, and to teach them to their children in schools. Despite its recent gain of status as a [[minority language]], there is still a major discussion among the Kven about whether the [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish orthography]] should be applied to the language or if a new [[orthography]] should be devised.

Since 2006, it has been possible to study the Kven culture and language at the [[University of Tromsø]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://uit.no/ University of Tromsø]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 the [[Kven people#Kven Language Board|Kven language board]] was formed at the [[Kainun institutti|Kven institute]], a national centre for Kven language and culture in [[Børselv]], [[Norway]]. The council will work out a written Kven language, but use Finnish orthography to maintain inter-Finnish language understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvenskinstitutt.no/sprak/spraknemnd/et-nytt-skriftsprak Andreassen, Irene: Et nytt skriftspråk blir til]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Today, most speakers of Kven are found in two Norwegian communities, [[Storfjord]] and [[Porsanger]]. A few speakers can be found other places, such as [[Bugøynes]], [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]], [[Vestre Jakobselv]], [[Vadsø]], and Nordreisa.

In northeastern Norway, mainly around [[Varanger Fjord]], the spoken language is quite similar to standard [[Finnish language|Finnish]], whereas the Kven spoken west of [[Alta, Norway|Alta]], due to the area's close ties to the Torne Valley area along the border between Finland and Sweden, is more closely related to the [[Meänkieli]] Finnish spoken there.

In government report from 2005, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used. However, there are very few young people who speak it, making it an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref name="kven_institute" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
The [[phonology]] of Kven is basically the same as [[Finnish phonology|that of Finnish]]. It is however worth noting that while Standard Finnish has been replacing {{IPA|/ð/}} by {{IPA|/d/}}, it is retained in Kven. For instance, the word ''meiđän'' ('our') in Kven is ''meidän'' in Standard Finnish.

The following is a '''list of ethnic slurs''' ('''ethnophaulisms''') that are, or have been, used as [[insinuation]]s or [[allegation]]s about members of a given [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], or to refer to them in a derogatory (that is, critical or disrespectful), [[pejorative]] (disapproving or contemptuous), or otherwise [[insult]]ing manner.

Some of the terms listed below (such as "Gringo", "Yank", etc.) are used by many people all over the world as part of their ordinary speech or thinking without any intention of causing offence.

For the purposes of this list, an ''ethnic slur'' is a term designed to insult others on the basis of [[racism|race]], [[ethnicity]], or [[nationality]]. Each term is listed followed by its country or region of usage, a definition, and a reference to that term.

Ethnic slurs may also be produced as a racial [[epithet]] by combining a general-purpose insult with the name of ethnicity, such as "dirty Jew", "Russian pig", etc. Other common insulting modifiers include "dog", "filthy", etc. Such terms are not included in this list.

;Abbie, Abe, Abie: ([[North America]]) a [[Jewish]] man. From the proper name ''Abraham''. Originated before the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spears|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[American-born Chinese|ABC]]: ([[East Asia]]) ''American-born Chinese'', [[Han Chinese|Han]] or other [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (including [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]]) born and raised in the [[United States]]. The term implies an otherness or lack of connection to their Chinese identity and (usually) Chinese language; however, it has been [[Reappropriation|reappropriated]] by many [[Chinese American]]s and used to convey positive connotations.&lt;ref name="ABC and FOB"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woo|first= Emma|title=Chinese American Names: Tradition and Transition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGAClRACrsYC&amp;pg=PA66|page=66|quote=[Translated Electronically] Not surprisingly, Chinese Americans who do not speak Chinese may be told that they are 'not really Chinese'. This message is found in the term ABC which stands for 'American-born Chinese'. It implies that the native-born who cannot speak Chinese has either rejected or lost his Chinese heritage. Yet many native-born Chinese Americans cheerfully use this term in describing themselves.|publisher=McFarland|year=2008|access-date=15 July 2013|isbn= 9780786438778}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;ABCD: ([[Indian subcontinent|South Asians]] in the [[United States|US]]) ''[[American-Born Confused Desi]]'', [[Indian American]]s or other [[South Asian Americans]], ([[desi]]) who were born in the [[United States]]. Used chiefly by South Asian immigrants to imply confusion about cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Radhakrishnan |first1=Rajagopalan |author-link1=R.

;Abo/Abbo: (AUS) [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] person. Originally, this was simply an informal term for ''[[Indigenous Australians|Aborigine]]'', and was in fact used by Aboriginal people themselves until it started to be considered offensive in the 1950s. In more remote areas, Aboriginal people still often refer to themselves (quite neutrally) as ''Blackfellas'' (and whites as ''Whitefellas''). Although ''Abo'' is still considered quite offensive by many, the pejorative ''[[#B|boong]]'' is now more commonly used when the intent is deliberately to offend, as that word's status as an insult is unequivocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Alligator]] bait / Gator bait: (U.S.) a black person, especially a black child. More commonly used in states where alligators are found, particularly [[Florida]].

;Ann: (North America) a white woman to a black person—or a black woman who acts "like a white woman".

'''Mark Markovich Warshawsky (Varshavsky)''' ({{lang-ru|Марк Маркович Варшавский}}, {{lang-yi|מאַרק וואַרשאַווסקי}}; 26 November 1848&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marq Waršawsqi (1848-1907) - Author - Resources from the BnF|url=http://data.bnf.fr/14541450/marq_wars_awsqi/|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In contrast to more recent scholarship, Noach Prilutski (1882-1941), in an article translated into English and adapted by Shura Vaisman, as "[http://www.ibiblio.org/yiddish/songs/pripetshek/mw.html Mark Warshavsky]", via ibiblio.org, states (evidently in error) that Warshawsky was born in Zhitomir in 1845.&lt;/ref&gt; – 1907) was a [[Yiddish]]-language folk poet and composer.&lt;ref name="Mlotek"&gt;Mlotek, Chana (February&amp;nbsp;18, 2011). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Varshavski_Mark Varshavski, Mark]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. yivoencyclopedia.org. Retrieved 2017-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewinsky"&gt;Lewinsky, Tamar; Shulman, Elias (2007). "Mark Warshawski." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''.  2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 2017-06-26. Also available online via [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/warshawski-mark Jewish Virtual Library].&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Odessa]] into an [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jewish]] family, he moved with his family as a child to [[Zhytomyr|Zhitomir]], where he later attended the four-year state rabbinical school.&lt;ref name="Mlotek"/&gt; After that he studied law at [[Odessa University]] for one year, then completed his studies at [[Kiev University]],&lt;ref name="Mlotek"/&gt; and went on to practice law in Kiev.&lt;ref name="Lewinsky"/&gt; He practiced law throughout his life, barely managing to make a living.&lt;ref name="Mlotek"/&gt; In 1903 he moved to Belgium to work as a legal adviser for a firm there; upon falling ill in 1905, he returned to Kiev, where he died two years later.&lt;ref name="Mlotek"/&gt;

By the influence of [[Abraham Goldfaden]] Warshawsky started to write songs and sing them in his circle of friends accompanied by a [[fortepiano]]. He did not take seriously his musical work and never recorded those songs, relying on his memory. Many of his works in this way were spread throughout the Jewish community of the Ukrainian region of the Russian Empire and most of them were simply adopted as folk songs.

In 1890 Warshawsky met with [[Sholem Aleichem]]. After listening to his songs, Sholem Aleichem wrote "I simply hugged him and kissed him!" And then, {{cquote|Villain! Why do not you print such songs? If I would not know that those are your own songs, I would swear that I heard them sometime performed by my mother!}} 
Later, by Aleichem's full cooperation, Warshavsky published his first collection, ''Yiddishe Volkslider'' (''Jewish People's songs'', Kiev, 1900) with a heartily foreword from the great classic. That book was republished not only in Russia, but abroad as well. The collection included such songs as ''Der Alef-Beis'' (commonly known as [[Oyfn Pripetshik]]), ''A Brif fun Amerike'', ''Der Zeide mit der Babe''. The songs described the everyday life of Jews in the [[Russian Empire]].

Together Sholem Aleichem and Warshawsky started to tour around Russia performing their own repertoire. They also had plans to travel to the [[United States]], however those plans were left unfulfilled as Warshawsky suddenly became ill and died on November 26. The second edition of the Warshawsky's songs was published in [[Odessa]] in 1914, with the following exclusively abroad: New York (1948) and Buenos-Aires (1958).

According to Prilutsky, Warshawsky spoke in the authentic dialect spoken in [[Volyn]].

'''Max Black''' (24 February 1909 – 27 August 1988) was a British-American philosopher, who was a leading figure in [[analytic philosophy]] in the years after World War II. He made contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science|science]], and the [[philosophy of art]], also publishing studies of the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. His translation (with [[Peter Geach]]) of Frege's published philosophical writing is a classic text.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], of [[Jewish]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Black grew up in [[London]], where his family had moved in 1912. He studied mathematics at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] where he developed an interest in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930 and was awarded a fellowship to study at [[Göttingen]] for a year.

From 1931–36, he was mathematics master at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]].

His first book was ''The Nature of Mathematics'' (1933), an exposition of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and of current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.

Black had made notable contributions to the metaphysics of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. In his "The Identity of Indiscernibles", Black presents an objection to [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz' Law]] by means of a hypothetical scenario in which he conceives two distinct spheres having exactly the same properties, thereby contradicting Leibniz' second principle in his formulation of "The Identity of Indiscernibles". By virtue of there being two objects, albeit with identical properties, the existence of two objects, even in a void, denies their identicality.

He lectured in mathematics at the [[Institute of Education]] in London from 1936 to 1940. In 1940 he moved to the [[United States]] and joined the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. In 1946 he accepted a professorship in philosophy at [[Cornell University]]. In 1948, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Black advised the philosophy dissertation of American novelist [[William H. Gass]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black died in [[Ithaca, New York]] age 79. His younger brother was the architect Sir [[Misha Black]].

'''Mopan''' (or '''Mopan Maya''') is a language that belongs to the Yucatecan branch of the [[Mayan languages]]. It is spoken by the [[Mopan people]] who live in the [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]] and in the [[Maya Mountains]] region of [[Belize]]. There are between three and four thousand Mopan speakers in Guatemala and six to eight thousand in Belize.&lt;ref name=Hofling1&gt;Hofling, [[#Hofling|''Mopan Maya–Spanish–English Dictionary'']], 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other Yucatecan languages are [[Yucatec]], [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]], and [[Itza’ language|Itza']]. Mopan began to diverge from the other Yucatecan languages at least one thousand years ago.&lt;ref name=Hofling1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Terrence|title=Archaeological and Linguistic Correlations in Mayaland and Associated Areas of Mesoamerica|journal=World Archaeology|year=1976|volume=8|issue=1|pages=101–118|doi=10.1080/00438243.1976.9979655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Towns where Mopan is prominently spoken include [[San Luis, El Petén|San Luis]], [[Poptún]], [[Melchor de Mencos]], and [[Dolores, El Petén|Dolores]] in Guatemala,&lt;ref name=Kaufman65&gt;Kaufman, [[#Kaufman|''Proyecto de Alfabetos y Ortografías'']], 65.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[San Antonio, Toledo|San Antonio]] in the [[Toledo District]] of Belize.&lt;ref&gt;Mwakikagile, [[#Mwakikagile|''Belize and Its People'']], 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
===Word order===
The word order in Mopan is [[verb-object-subject]] (VOS),&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mop Mopan Maya] at Ethnologue (17th ed., 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; although [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) is also common.&lt;ref name=Hofling20&gt;Hofling, [[#Hofling|''Mopan Maya-Spanish-English Dictionary'']], 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerals and numeral classifiers===
Numerals in Mopan always include a numeral [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] which is added as a suffix. These classifiers indicate qualities about the referent. For example, round objects are indicated by the suffix ''-kuul'', while long, thin objects are indicated by the suffix ''-tz'iit''. The most commonly used numeral classifiers are ''-p'eel'', for inanimate objects, and ''-tuul'', for people and animals. In all, there are over 70 numeral classifiers used in Mopan Maya.&lt;ref name=Hofling25&gt;Hofling, [[#Hofling|''Mopan Maya-Spanish-English Dictionary'']], 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some sources list [ŋ] (the [[velar nasal]]) as a consonant sound in Mopan Maya.&lt;ref name="Dienhart171"&gt;Dienhart, [[#Dienhart|''The Mayan Languages'']], 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The sounds [g] and [f] are used for Spanish loan words and do not correspond to sounds native to Mopan Maya.

==Orthography==
Since the colonial period, Mopan Maya has been written with the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt; Historically, a wide range of orthographies have been used to represent the language,&lt;ref name="Dienhart171"/&gt; although recently, the orthography has been standardized by the [[Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages]] (ALMG).&lt;ref name="Hofling3"/&gt; The following table shows some of the orthographies that have been used to represent Mopan Maya:

'''OmegaT''' is a [[computer-assisted translation]] tool written in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]]. It is [[free software]] originally developed by Keith Godfrey in 2000, and is currently developed by a team led by Didier Briel.

OmegaT is intended for professional translators. Its features include customisable segmentation using [[regular expressions]], [[translation memory]] with fuzzy matching and match propagation, glossary matching, dictionary matching, translation memory and reference material searching, and inline spell-checking using [[Hunspell]] spelling dictionaries.

OmegaT runs on [[Linux]], [[macOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] 98 SE or higher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.java.com/en/download/help/5000011000.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322232054/http://java.com/en/download/help/5000011000.xml |archivedate=2010-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and requires Java 1.5. It is available in 27 languages.  According to a survey in 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.translationtribulations.com/2010/07/results-of-june-translation-tools.html&lt;/ref&gt; among 458 professional [[translators]], OmegaT is used 1/3 as much as [[Wordfast]], [[Déjà Vu (software)|Déjà Vu]] and [[MemoQ]], and 1/8 as much as the market leader [[Trados]].

== History ==
OmegaT was first developed by Keith Godfrey in 2000. It was originally written in C++.

The first public release in February 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://translationjournal.net/journal/23linux.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was written in Java. This version used a proprietary translation memory format. It could translate unformatted [[Plain text|text]] files, and HTML, and perform only block-level segmentation (i.e. paragraphs instead of sentences).

== Development and software releases ==

The development of OmegaT is hosted on SourceForge. The development team is led by Didier Briel. As with many opensource projects, new versions of OmegaT are released frequently, usually with 2-3 bugfixes and feature updates each. There is a "standard" version, which always has a complete user manual and a "latest" version which includes features that are not yet documented in the user manual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/files/] OmegaT's "standard" and "latest" versions&lt;/ref&gt; The updated sources are always available from the SourceForge code repository.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omegat.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/omegat/trunk/] The latest source files are always available from the SourceForge code repository&lt;/ref&gt;

== How OmegaT works ==

OmegaT handles a translation job as a project, a hierarchy of folders with specific names. The user copies non-translated documents into one named /source/ (or subfolders thereof). The Editor pane displays the source documents as individual “segments” for translation one segment at a time. OmegaT, when directed, generates the (partially) translated versions in the /target/ subfolder.

Other named folders include ones for automatic consultation within the program: /tm/ for existing translation pairs in .tmx format, /tm/auto/ for automatic translation of 100% matches, /glossary/ for glossaries, /dictionary/ for StarDict (and .tbx) dictionaries.

When the user goes to translate a segment in the Editor pane, OmegaT automatically searches the .tmx files in the /tm/ hierarchy for previous translation pairs with similar source sentences and displays them in the Fuzzy Matches pane for insertion into the Editor pane with a keyboard shortcut. The Glossary and Dictionary panes provide similar automatic look-up functions for any glossaries and dictionaries in the corresponding named folders in the project. The optional Machine Translation pane shows machine translations from Google Translate and similar services.

When the user leaves a segment, OmegaT normally first adds the source-target pair to its database in memory. It subsequently saves that database to disk in Translation Memory eXchange (.tmx) format for use another day, in other projects, by other translators, and even with other CAT tools. No change, naturally enough, means no such update. Version 3.1 added a setting for blocking targets equal to their sources, a common slip, plus a keyboard shortcut for overriding it—numbers, source code in programming manuals, etc.

At any point, the user can create partially translated versions of the source files. Note that OmegaT copies source segments verbatim if they have yet to be translated. Before doing so, however, the user is advised to use the Validate menu command to check for tag and other errors. Version 3.1 added a menu command (and keyboard shortcut) for limiting operation to the current file—for partial delivery or quick update, for example.

== Features of OmegaT ==

OmegaT shares many features with mainstream CAT tools. These include creating, importing and exporting translation memories, fuzzy matching from translation memories, glossary look-up, and reference and concordance searching.

OmegaT also has additional features that are not always available in other CAT tools. These include:

*OmegaT starts by displaying a short tutorial called "Instant Start.".
*OmegaT can translate multiple files in multiple file formats in multiple subfolders simultaneously, and consult multiple translation memories, glossaries and dictionaries (limited only by available computer memory).
*With regard to supported file types, OmegaT allows the user to customise file extensions and file encodings. For a number of document types, the user can choose selectively which elements must be translated (e.g. in OpenOffice.org Writer files, choose whether to include bookmarks; in Microsoft Office 2007/2010 files, choose whether to translate footnotes; or in HTML, choose whether to translate ALT text for images). The user can also choose how non-standard elements in third-party translation memories should be handled.
*OmegaT's segmentation rules are based on regular expressions. Segmentation can be configured based on language or based on file format, and successive segmentation rules inherit values from each other.
*In the edit window, the user can jump directly to the next untranslated segment, or go forward or backwards in history. Users can use undo and redo, copy and paste, and switch between uppercase and lowercase in the same way as one would in an advanced text editor. The user can choose to see the source text of segments that have already been translated. The edit pane also has inline spell-checking using Hunspell dictionaries, and interactive spell-checking is done using the mouse.
*Users can insert fuzzy matches using a keyboard shortcut or using the mouse. OmegaT shows the degree of similarity in fuzzy matches using colours. OmegaT can also display the date, time and the name of the user who translated any given segment. Glossary matches can be inserted using the mouse. The user can choose to have the source text copied into the target text field, or to have the highest fuzzy match automatically inserted.
*In the search window, the user can choose to search the current files' source text, target text, other translation memories, and reference files. Searches can be case sensitive, and regular expressions can also be used. Double-clicking a search result takes the user directly to that segment in the edit window.
*After translation, OmegaT can perform tag validation to ensure that there are no accidental tag errors. OmegaT can calculate statistics for the project files and translation memories before the project starts, or during the translation to show the progress of the translation job.
*OmegaT can get machine translations from [[Apertium]], [[Belazar]] and [[Google Translate]], and display it in a separate window.
*The various windows in OmegaT's user interface can be moved around, maximised, tiled, tabbed and minimised.

== Document formats support ==

Several file types can be translated directly in OmegaT. OmegaT determines the file type by the file extension. The file extension handling and preferred encoding can be customised to override default settings.

OmegaT handles formatted documents by converting formatting to tags, similar to other commercial CAT tools.

=== Indirectly supported formats ===

There are two processes that allow OmegaT to handle unsupported formats:

* register the format file extension into the preferred file filter (typically all plain text based formats)
* convert the format to a directly supported format

==== Support for XLIFF ====

The program Rainbow from the [[Okapi Framework]] can convert certain file formats to an XLIFF format that OmegaT does support. Rainbow can also create complete OmegaT project folders from such documents, for easier handling in OmegaT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://okapi.sourceforge.net/Release/Shared/Help/tutorial_02.htm Okapi Framework] – Text Extraction utility can create an OmegaT project folder tree&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Support for Gettext PO ====

A number of file formats can be converted to Gettext Portable Object (PO) files, which can be translated in OmegaT. The [[Debian]] program po4a can convert formats such as [[LaTeX]], [[TeX]] and [[Plain Old Documentation|POD]] to Gettext PO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/ po4a] – A conversion utility to and from the [[Gettext|Portable Object]] format, perl application packaged under Debian&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Translate Toolkit]] can convert Mozilla .properties and dtd files, CSV files, certain Qt .ts files, and certain XLIFF files to Gettext PO.

==== Support for Office Open XML and ODF ====

Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents from version 97 to 2003 can be converted to Office Open XML (Microsoft Office 2007/2010) or ODF (OpenOffice.org) format. Conversion is not entirely lossless and may lead to loss of formatting.

==== Support for Trados® .ttx files ====
Trados® .ttx files can be treated using the [http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=TTX_Filter Okapi TTX Filter].

== Supported memory and glossary formats ==

=== Translation memories in TMX format ===

OmegaT's internal translation memory format is not visible to the user, but every time it autosaves the [[translation project]], all new or updated translation units are automatically exported and added to three external TMX memories: a native OmegaT TMX, a level 1 TMX and a level 2 TMX.

* The native TMX file is for use in OmegaT projects.
* The level 1 TMX file preserves textual information and can be used with TMX level 1 and 2 supporting CAT tools.
* The level 2 file preserves textual information as well as inline tag information and can be used with TMX level 2 supporting CAT tools.

Exported level 2 files include OmegaT's internal tags encapsulated in TMX tags which allows such TMX files to generate matches in TMX level 2 supporting CAT tools. Tests have been positive in Trados and SDLX.

OmegaT can import TMX files up to version 1.4b level 1 as well as level 2. Level 2 files imported in OmegaT will generate matches of the same level since OmegaT converts the TMX level 2 tags of the foreign TMX. Here again, tests have been positive with TMX files created by Transit.

=== Glossaries ===

For glossaries, OmegaT mainly uses tab-delimited plain text files in UTF-8 encoding with the .txt extension. The structure of a glossary file is extremely simple: the first column contains the source language word, the second column contains the corresponding target language words, the third column (optional) can contain anything including comments on context etc. Such glossaries can easily be created in a text editor.

Similarly structured files in standard CSV format are also supported, as well as TBX files.

== Involvement by community of users ==

=== The OmegaT Project ===

OmegaT is open-source software and benefits from the help of volunteers.  Programming is certainly the most important function, but it would benefit from greater support from volunteers in almost all areas.  If you feel so inclined, you may also modify OmegaT to suit your own requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omegat.org/en/involved.html The OmegaT project and You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523083120/http://www.omegat.org/en/involved.html |date=2011-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Localization of OmegaT ===

OmegaT's user interface and documentation have been translated into about 30 languages. Volunteer translators can translate either the user interface, the "Instant Start" short tutorial, or the entire user manual (or all three components). All the language files and all translations of the user manual are included in the standard distribution of OmegaT.

=== User-created programs ===

A characteristic of the OmegaT user community is that deficiencies in OmegaT often prompt users to create macros, scripts and programs that perform those functions, although sometimes those features later become available in OmegaT itself. When OmegaT offered only paragraph segmentation, a user created OpenOffice.org macros for segmenting by sentence. When automatic leveraging of TMs in OmegaT still required TMs to be merged, a user created a TMX merging script. When OmegaT offered no spell-checking support, several users created scripts or found solutions to provide spell-checking as part of an OmegaT based translation process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omegat.org/en/resources.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other software built on OmegaT ==

=== Autshumato translation suite ===
Autshumato consists of a CAT tool, an aligner, a PDF extractor, a TMX editor, and a public TM based on crawled data. The finished version will include a terminology manager and a machine translator. The CAT tool element is built upon OmegaT, and requires OpenOffice.org to run. Development is funded by the South African government's Department of Arts and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autshumato.sourceforge.net/ Autshumato]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benten ===
Benten is an Eclipse-based XLIFF editor. It uses OmegaT code to handle the TM matching process. It is partly funded by the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.jp/projects/benten/ Benten]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boltran ===
Boltran is a web-based tool that mimicks the workflow of an OmegaT project. It is built upon the source code of OmegaT and can export OmegaT projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/boltran/ Boltran]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OmegaT+ ===
OmegaT+ is a CAT tool that was forked from OmegaT version 1.4.5 in 2005. OmegaT+ works in a way similar to OmegaT. It has developed its own features but projects are not compatible with OmegaT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omegatplus.sourceforge.net/ OmegaT+]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OmegaT in DGT ===
The Directorate-General for Translation of the European Commission (DGT) uses OmegaT as an alternative CAT tool alongside a mainstream commercial tool. DGT maintains a fork of OmegaT (DGT-OmegaT) with adaptations/improvements/new features that meet DGT-specific requirements as well as a number of helper-applications to integrate OmegaT in its workflow: a Wizard to automate the creation, updating, revision and delivery of projects, Tagwipe to clean useless tags in docx documents and TeamBase to allow the sharing of memories in real-time. Those applications are made available by DGT as free open source software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://185.13.37.79/ DGT-OmegaT]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1891">'''''{{Lang|fr|Opéra féerie}}''''' (plural: ''{{Lang|fr|opéras féeries}}'') is a French genre of [[opera]] or [[opéra-ballet]], often with elements of magic in their stories. Popular in the 18th century, from the time of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] onwards, the form reached its culmination with works such as ''[[La belle au bois dormant (opera)|La belle au bois dormant]]'' by [[Michele Carafa]] and ''[[Cendrillon (Isouard)|Cendrillon]]'' by [[Nicolas Isouard]] at the beginning of the 19th century.

Examples of the genre include:
*''[[Zémire et Azor]]'' (1771), music by [[André Grétry]]
*''[[Cendrillon (Isouard)|Cendrillon]]'' (1810) and ''Aladin ou la Lampe merveilleuse'' (1822), music by [[Nicolas Isouard]], [[libretto|libretti]] by [[Charles-Guillaume Étienne]]

'''Pa.Singaram''' ({{lang-ta|ப சிங்காரம்}}) was an important Tamil writer from Sivagangai district who lived most of his adult life is South east Asia – mainly Indonesia and Malaysia.

P Singaram is considered to be one of the greatest Tamil novelist of the modern era despite having authored only two novels. His Puyalile Oru Thoni is considered by many Tamil literary giants to be one of the very important Tamil fiction of all time.

== Early life ==

Singaram was born on 12 August 1920 to Ku.Pazhanivel Nadar and Unnamalai Ammal in a village called Singampunari in Sivagangai district in Tamil Nadu. He was third of brothers Subramanian and Bhaskaran and his family was involved in clothes business along with his grand father Kumarasamy Nadar.

He had his primary education at Singampunari Primary school and further education at St.Mary's higher secondary school Madurai. He went to [[Medan]], Indonesia when he was 18 years old to work there with S K Sinnamuthu Pillai.

He got married there but his wife and the baby died in pregnancy when he was 25. He came back to India after World War II and lived in Madurai

== Formative years and influences ==

He moved to [[Medan]] when he was 18 –  when the world slowly came together the second time for a great World War. The waters become treacherous and Singaram didn't get his share of [[Tamil-language]] magazines through ships. [[Penang]] library provided him solace and introduced [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] to him.

His influence of Hemingway was very evident in both his works and he considered [[A Farewell to Arms]] his favorite and masterpiece of Hemingway. He believed ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' an important milestone in American literature and rated ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' more than ''[[War and Peace]]''.

== Works ==

Singaram has written only 2 novels and he was so frustrated by the difficulties he faced in publishing his novels that he never wrote anything after that. He said he was not encouraged when he wanted to write and he lost motivation after publishing the 2 novels he wrote. He has more than once spoke of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s influence &lt;ref&gt;http://azhiyasudargal.blogspot.in/2011/01/blog-post_29.html&lt;/ref&gt; in his works and lists him as his favourite writer.

His knowledge on Tamil literature was limited to short stories of [[Pudhumaipithan]] and Mouni he read before travelling to Indonesia. In his later years when asked whether he is aware of the present Tamil writers and their works he commented it lacked depth and he couldn't read past two pages of [[Sujatha Rangarajan|Sujatha]] and [[Sivasankari]]

=== Kadalukku Appal ===

P Singaram wrote this novel in 1950 immediately after he returned to India. Though he sent the novel to many publishers the novel kept returning without getting published. A friend sent this novel to Kalaimagal publications for a novel contest. The novel won first prize in that novel contest. Finally, he was able to publish Kadalukku Appal in 1959 through Kalaimagal publications.

=== Puyalile Oru Thoni ===

This novel &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=H3dBGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Puyalile+oru+thoni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gqBbUt2dA8Wv7Aa6iIHwCA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; was written in 1962 and it didn't find any publishers -after continuous efforts by a friend, Puyalile Oru Thoni was published in 1972 by Kalaignan publications. Many modern Tamil writers consider this as an important literary work published in Tamil in this century. The story happens in Sumatra in the background of Second World War.

Several notable film-makers have expressed their desire &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamilcinema24.com/news.php?id=i-feel-i-cannot-do-it-vettrimaran-10-09-123576 Vetrimaran Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; to make this epic novel into a movie but conceding it's an impossible task to do justice to this book.

== Later years and death ==

Singaram returned to India in 1946 and had plans to go back to Indonesia. It was never materialized and in Madurai he joined Dinathandhi newspaper and worked there till he took voluntary retirement in 1987. He did not maintain close relationships with anybody and lived alone for 50 years in YMCA hostel in Madurai

Writers [[S.Ramakrishnan|Ramakrishnan]], Konangi and many others have met Singaram in his last years of life and told him in person how much they were moved by his works. They repeatedly told Singaram's his stronghold in Tamil literature but Singaram was stoic as ever. He refused to accept his place and no more wrote.

In 1997, he gave away his earnings to Social welfare trusts. In the same year his health condition deteriorated and on 30 December 1997, he died in ambulance while being taken to hospital. He had told not to inform about his death to anyone.

* As a term for classification. The "perforation gauge" of a stamp specifies the number of perforation holes that appear in a two-centimeter span along its edge.&lt;ref name="find"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.findyourstampsvalue.com/phil_terms/perforation.htm |title=Stamp Perforation and Print method |publisher=Find your stamp’s value |date= | accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finest gauge ever used is 18 on stamps of the Malay States in the early 1950s, and the coarsest is 2, seen on the 1891 stamps of Bhopal. Modern stamp perforations tend to range from 11 to 14. Many stamps are produced with "compound perforations" ''i. e.'', the vertical and horizontal perforations will be of different gauges.  Many U. S. stamps have been perforated 10½ x 11.
* As the name for a philatelic tool used to measure perforations.&lt;ref name="find"/&gt; Invented in 1866 by [[Jacques Legrand (philatelist)|Jacques Legrand]], the typical "perf gauge" (sometimes called an odontometer) is a metal or plastic tile on which perforations of gauges ranging from 7 and 7½ to 16 and 16½ are pictured (the pictures sometimes appear at the edges of the tile).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The APS Hall of Fame 2000-2004|url=http://stamps.org/HOF-2000|website=American Philatelic Society|publisher=American Philatelic Society|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philatelist places each of these depictions beside a stamp until one is found that exactly matches the stamp’s perforations. Such a gauge is an indispensable tool for identifying stamps that present identical images but have been issued with perforations of several different sizes. An extreme example is the U. S. [[Washington-Franklin Issues]], some of which are found with perforations of gauges 8½, 10, 11, 12, and 12½.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Snee |first=Charles (editor) |title=Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers 2013 |publisher=Scott Publishing Co |year=2012 |location= |pages=63–77|OCLC=781677423 |isbn=0894874756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Presstitute''' is a term that applies to [[journalism]] that is misleadingly tailored to fit a particular partisan, financial or business agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=David|first1=Supriti|title=#Presstitute: The Online War Against Women With An Opinion SUPRITI DAVID|url=http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/NewsDetail/index/7/10942/Presstitute-The-Online-War-Against-Women-With-An-Opinion|publisher=TheCitizen|date=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valderama|first1=Tita|title=Who’s the real “presstitute?”|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/whos-the-real-presstitute/287885/|publisher=[[The Manila Times]]|date=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coined by [[Gerald Celente]], the word is a [[portmanteau]] of '[[news media|press]]' and '[[prostitute]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gerald Celente: Meet the man who coined the term presstitute; VK Singh made it famous|url=http://archive.news18.com/news/bihar/gerald-celente-meet-the-man-who-coined-the-term-presstitute-vk-singh-made-it-famous-714955.html|publisher=[[News18 India]]|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Printed matter''' is a term to describe printed material.
==Conception==
[[File:1925toHungary.jpg|thumb|right|222px|1925 Printed Matter Registered Airmail Letter from [[Denmark]] to [[Hungary]].]]
Printed matter was produced by printers or publishers, such as [[book]]s, [[magazine]]s, booklets, brochures and other publicity materials and in some cases, [[newspaper]]s. Because much of this material is mailed, it is also a category of [[mail]], accepted for delivery by a [[postal administration]], that is not considered to be first-class mail and therefore qualifies for a special reduced printed matter postal rate. Depending on the specific postal regulations of the country, it is usually non-personal correspondence and printed in multiple quantities. Most postal authorities do not permit additional services, like [[Registered mail|registration]] or [[Express mail|express]] services, to be added to items mailed as printed matter.

In the Postal Convention between the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Republic of Mexico]], proclaimed on June 20, 1862, terms were specified relating to the rates for printed matter between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Postal Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of Mexico; December 11, 1861 | work =The Avalon Project | publisher =Yale Law School | url =http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/mx1861b.asp | accessdate =2007-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate was one cent for every ounce or fraction of an ounce.
==By country==
===China===
Printed matter was called as ''Chūbǎn-wù'' ({{zh|出版物}}) or ''Yìnshuā-pǐn'' (印刷品) what had the thousand-years history.
===United States===
As of June 2007, the [[USPS]] has a printed matter classification known as "Bound Printed Matter", BPM, defined as, advertising, promotional, directory, or editorial material that is securely bound and at least 90% is imprinted by a process other than handwriting or typewriting and is only available for user with an imprint permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Postage Payment for Bound Printed Matter Limited to Permit Imprint | work = | publisher =USPS | date =2008-09-11 | url =http://pe.usps.com/Bound_Printed_Matter.txt | accessdate =2008-11-27 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130627004256/http://pe.usps.com/Bound_Printed_Matter.txt | archivedate =2013-06-27 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For international shipment of printed matter, the USPS provides a discount [[M-bag]] service;&lt;ref name="IMM260"&gt;Postal Explorer &gt; IMM Issue 37 - International Mail Manual &gt; 2 Conditions for Mailing &gt; [http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc2_022.htm 260 Direct Sacks of Printed Matter to One Addressee (M–bags)]&lt;/ref&gt; following the 2007 elimination of [[surface mail]], only [[airmail]] M-bag remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/international/mbags.htm Airmail M-Bags]&lt;/ref&gt;
===United Kingdom===
The term is Printed Papers as used by the Royal Mail. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/RM_International_Stamps_Franking_Wallchart_Mar2014b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''prosodic unit''', often called an '''intonation unit''' or '''intonational phrase''', is a segment of speech that occurs with a single [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic contour]] ([[Pitch contour|pitch]] and [[rhythm]] contour). The abbreviation '''IU''' is used and therefore the full form is often found as ''intonation unit,'' despite the fact that technically it is a unit of prosody rather than [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], which is only one element of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].

Prosodic units occur at a [[Phonological hierarchy|hierarchy of levels]], from the [[Foot (prosody)|metrical foot]] and [[phonological word]] to a complete [[utterance]]. However, the term is generally restricted to intermediate levels which do not have a dedicated terminology. Prosodic units do not generally correspond to syntactic units, such as [[phrase]]s and [[clause]]s; it is thought that they reflect different aspects of how the brain processes speech, with prosodic units being generated through on-line interaction and processing, and with morphosyntactic units being more automated.

==Defining characteristics==
Prosodic units are characterized by several phonetic cues, such as a coherent [[pitch contour]]. Breathing, both inhalation and exhalation, only occurs at the boundaries ([[pausa]]) between higher units. Several short contours may carry an additional overall gradual decline in pitch and slowing of tempo; this larger unit is termed a ''declination unit'' (DU). At the boundaries ([[pausa|pauses]]) between declination units, the pitch and tempo [[pitch reset|reset]]; for this reason the final one of the shorter internal contours is said to have ''final'' prosody, whereas the others are said to have ''continuing'' prosody.

These two levels of the [[phonological hierarchy|hierarchy]] may be schematized as follows:

::{| class=wikitable
! colspan=4 | Declination unit
|-
| continuing IU, || continuing IU, || continuing IU, || final IU.
|}

==Transcription==
In English orthography, a ''continuing'' prosodic boundary may be marked with a comma (assuming the writer is using commas to represent prosody rather than grammatical structure), while ''final'' prosodic boundaries may be marked with a full stop (period).

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] has symbols (single and double pipes) for "minor" and "major" prosodic breaks. Since there are more than two levels of prosodic units, the use of these symbols depends on the structure of the language and which information the transcriber is attempting to capture. Very often, each prosodic unit will be placed in a separate line of the transcription. Using the single and double pipes to mark continuing and final prosodic boundaries, we might have American English,

:''Jack,''
:''preparing the way,''
:''went on.''
:{{IPA|[ˈdʒæk {{!}} pɹəˌpɛəɹɪŋ ðə ˈweɪ {{!}} wɛnt ˈɒn ‖ ]}}
or French,
:''Jacques,''
:''préparant le sol,''
:''tomba.''
:{{IPA|[ˈʒak {{!}} pʁepaʁɑ̃ lɵ ˈsɔl {{!}} tɔ̃ˈba ‖ ]}}

Note that the last syllable with a full vowel in a [[French language|French]] prosodic unit is stressed, and that the last stressed syllable in an [[English language|English]] prosodic unit has [[Stress (linguistics)|primary stress]]. This shows that stress is not phonemic in French, and that the difference between primary and secondary stress is not phonemic in English; they are both elements of prosody rather than inherent in the words.

The pipe symbols{{spaced ndash}}the [[vertical bar]]s {{IPA|{{!}}}} and {{IPA|‖}}{{spaced ndash}}used above are phonetic, and so will often disagree with English punctuation, which only partially correlates with prosody.

However, the pipes may also be used for [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] breaks{{spaced ndash}}a single pipe being used to mark metrical feet, and a double pipe to mark both continuing and final prosody, as their alternate IPA descriptions "foot group" and "intonation group" suggest. In such usage, each foot group would include one and only one [[heavy syllable]]. In English, this would mean one and only one stressed syllable:

:''Jack,''
:''preparing the way,''
:''went on.''
:{{IPA|[ˈdʒæk ‖ pɹəˌpɛəɹɪŋ {{!}} ðə ˈweɪ ‖ wɛnt ˈɒn ‖ ]}}

In many tone languages with [[downdrift]], such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]], the single pipe {{angle bracket|{{IPA|{{!}}}}}} may be used to represent a minor prosodic break that does not interrupt the overall decline in pitch of the utterance, while {{angle bracket|{{IPA|‖}}}} marks either continuing or final prosody that creates a [[pitch reset]]. In such cases, some linguists use only the single pipe, with continuing and final prosody marked by a comma and period, respectively.

In transcriptions of non-tonal languages, the three symbols pipe, comma, and period may also be used, with the pipe representing a break more minor than the comma, the so-called ''list prosody'' often used to separate items when reading lists, spelling words, or giving out telephone numbers.

==Cognitive implications==
While each prosodic unit may carry a large information load in rehearsed speech, in extemporaneous conversation the amount of information is much more limited. There is seldom more than a single [[lexical word|lexical]] noun in any one IU, and it is uncommon to have both a lexical noun and a lexical verb in the same IU. Indeed, many IUs are semantically empty, taken up by filler words such as ''um, well,'' or ''y'know.'' Chafe (1994) believes that this reflects the constraints of information processing by the brain during speech production, with chunks of speech (IUs) corresponding to chunks of cognitive output. It is also a possibility that the distribution of information across IUs is designed to maximize language comprehension by the other party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4243">'''Remote infrared audible signage''' (RIAS) was developed by [[Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ski.org/rerc/WCrandall/introts.html |title=Introduction to Talking Signs |publisher=Ski.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220122805/http://www.ski.org/rerc/WCrandall/introts.html |archive-date=2007-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as Talking Signs&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingsigns.com |title=talkingsigns.com |publisher=talkingsigns.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that print-handicapped people, such as those that are  [[Blindness|blind]] or have low-vision, or are illiterate, foreign, or [[visually impaired]], would be able to access the same type of information available through textual print signs within the built environment.

It consists of [[infrared]] [[transmitters]] repeatedly sending encoded spoken versions of the contents of the sign through [[wireless]] communication. An early version&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ski.org/rerc/WCrandall/General/LOUGH1.htmdeveloped ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979 called "Talking Lights" has been successfully upgraded/marketed commercially as "Talking Signs" which are being globally installed.

An associated handheld or glasses-mounted IR receiver is directionally sensitive to a direct, [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] infrared light beam and orients the person by giving more positive feedback when the sign is being pointed to directly and is close.

The system has been tested and works effectively in both interior and exterior settings and does not disturb those environments because the IR beams are invisible and silent.

The principle of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s [[photophone]] led to development of devices capable of transmitting/decoding infrared waves in systems ranging from military communications through remote control systems for televisions and computers.

==Standardization==
RIAS features in US building code 703.7.

[[File:Smart City.jpg|alt=smart city prototype rendering|thumb|A depiction of a smart city]]

A '''smart city''' is an [[urban area]] that uses different types of electronic [[data collection]] sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLaren|first1=Duncan|last2=Agyeman|first2=Julian|title=Sharing Cities: A Case for Truly Smart and Sustainable Cities|date=2015|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262029728|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KhvLCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=smart+cities+and+sustainability|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/21181336|title=Smart City Roadmap|author=Sam Musa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}} The smart city concept integrates [[information and communication technology ]] (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the network (the [[Internet of things]] or IoT) to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3047795/the-3-generations-of-smart-cities|title=The 3 Generations Of Smart Cities|date=10 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peris-Ortiz|first1=Marta|last2=Bennett|first2=Dag R.|last3=Yábar|first3=Diana Pérez-Bustamante|title=Sustainable Smart Cities: Creating Spaces for Technological, Social and Business Development|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319408958|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AtQ0DQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=smart+cities+and+sustainability|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving.

ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to [[cost reduction|reduce costs]] and [[resource consumption]] and to increase contact between citizens and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/forward/innovations/smartnyc.page|title=Building a Smart City, Equitable City - NYC Forward|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, public authorities are seeking to reduce costs and raise performance by adopting similar approaches in the delivery of public services. However, the concept of a Smart City goes way beyond the transactional relationships between citizen and service provider. It is essentially enabling and encouraging the citizen to become a more active and participative member of the community"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Karin|title=What Is A ‘Smart City’?|url=https://www.expatriatelifestyle.com/life-and-style/What-Is-A-Smart-City|accessdate=23 January 2018|publisher=Expatriate Lifestyle|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the term itself remains unclear to its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://sciforum.net/conference/wsf-4/paper/2454|title=MDPI Sciforum  - The platform for open scholarly exchange|pages=f004|website=sciforum.net|access-date=2016-03-16|doi=10.3390/wsf-4-f004|chapter=Smart Cities: Contradicting Definitions and Unclear Measures|year=2014|last1=Hunt|first1=Dexter|last2=Rogers|first2=Christopher|last3=Cavada|first3=Marianna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Due to the breadth of technologies that have been implemented under the smart city label, it is difficult to distill a precise definition of a smart city. Deakin and Al Wear&lt;ref name=DeakinAl_jrnl&gt;{{cite journal |title=From Intelligent to Smart Cities |journal=Journal of Intelligent Buildings International: From Intelligent Cities to Smart Cities |last=Deakin |first=Mark |last2=Al Waer |first2=Husam |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=140–152 |doi=10.1080/17508975.2011.586671 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; list four factors that contribute to the definition of a smart city:

# The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to communities and cities
# The use of ICT to transform life and working environments within the region
# The embedding of such Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in government systems
# The territorialisation of practices that brings ICTs and people together to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer.

Deakin defines the smart city as one that utilises ICT to meet the demands of the market (the citizens of the city), and that community involvement in the process is necessary for a smart city.&lt;ref name=DeakinIntro&gt;{{cite book |last=Deakin |first1=Mark |title=Smart Cities: Governing, Modelling and Analysing the Transition |chapter=From intelligent to smart cities |editor-last=Deakin | editor-first=Mark |publisher=Taylor and Francis |date=2013-08-22 |page=15 |isbn=978-1135124144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A smart city would thus be a city that not only possesses ICT technology in particular areas, but has also implemented this technology in a manner that positively impacts the local community.

Alternative definitions include:
* Giffinger et al. 2007: "Regional competitiveness, transport and [[Information and Communication Technologies]] economics, natural resources, human and social capital, quality of life, and participation of citizens in the governance of cities."&lt;ref name=Giffinger&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smart-cities.eu/download/smart_cities_final_report.pdf  |title=Smart cities – Ranking of European medium-sized cities |last1=Giffinger |first1=Rudolf |author2=Christian Fertner |author3=Hans Kramar |author4=Robert Kalasek |author5=Nataša Pichler-Milanovic |author6=Evert Meijers |year=2007 |work=Smart Cities |publisher=Centre of Regional Science |location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
It has been suggested that a smart city (also community, [[business cluster]], [[urban agglomeration]] or region) uses [[information and communication technologies|information technologies]] to:
# Make more efficient use of physical infrastructure (roads, [[built environment]] and other physical assets) through [[artificial intelligence]] and [[data analytics]] to support a strong and healthy economic, social, cultural development.&lt;ref name=Hollands2008&gt;[[#Hollands2008|Hollands(2008)]] Pages 303–320&lt;/ref&gt;
# Engage effectively with local people in local governance and decision by use of [[open innovation]] processes and [[e-participation]], improving the collective intelligence of the city's institutions through [[e-governance]],&lt;ref name=Komninos_ch /&gt; with emphasis placed on citizen participation and [[co-design]].&lt;ref name=Deakin2007&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deakin, M|year=2007|title=From city of bits to e-topia: taking the thesis on digitally-inclusive regeneration full circle|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=131–143|url=http://markdeakin.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.85/prod.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeakinAllwinkle2007&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deakin, M|author2=Allwinkle, S |year=2007|title=Urban regeneration and sustainable communities: the role of networks, innovation and creativity in building successful partnerships|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|volume=14|issue=1|pages=77–91|doi=10.1080/10630730701260118|url=http://researchrepository.napier.ac.uk/id/eprint/1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reimagining the Role of Citizens in Smart City Projects|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers|date = 2015-01-01|location = New York, NY, US|isbn = 978-1-4503-3575-1|pages = 1587–1594|series = UbiComp '15|doi = 10.1145/2800835.2801622|first = Daniel|last = Gooch|first2 = Annika|last2 = Wolff|first3 = Gerd|last3 = Kortuem|first4 = Rebecca|last4 = Brown|url = http://oro.open.ac.uk/43770/1/citizenInnovation_ubicomp2015_cameraReady.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They evolve towards a strong integration of all dimensions of [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], [[collective intelligence]], and also artificial intelligence within the [[city]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Komninos2008|Komninos(2008)]] Pages 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Atlee, T.  |author2=Pór, George |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |url=http://www.evolutionarynexus.org/wiki/collective_intelligence_tom_atlee_and_george_p%C3%B3r |title=Evolutionary Nexus: connecting communities for emergence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligence of cities "resides in the increasingly effective combination of digital [[telecommunication network]]s (the nerves), ubiquitously [[embedded intelligence]] (the brains), sensors and [[Smart label|tags]] (the sensory organs), and [[software]] (the knowledge and cognitive competence)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uoc.edu/uocpapers/5/dt/eng/mitchell.html|title=Intelligent cities|journal=e-Journal on the Knowledge Society|year=2007|author=Mitchell, W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms of intelligence in smart cities have been demonstrated in three ways:
[[File:Bletchley Park - Draco2008.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bletchley Park often considered to be the first smart community.]]
# '''Orchestration intelligence''':&lt;ref name=Komninos_ch /&gt; Where cities establish institutions and community-based problem solving and collaborations, such as in [[Bletchley Park]], where the Nazi Enigma cypher was decoded by a team led by [[Alan Turing]]. This has been referred to as the first example of a smart city or an intelligent community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Komninos |first1=Nicos |title=From Intelligent to Smart Cities |journal=Journal of Intelligent Buildings International: From Intelligent Cities to Smart Cities |chapter=Intelligent cities: Variable geometries of spatial intelligence. |editor-last=Deakin |editor-first=Mark |editor-last2=Al Waer |editor-first2=Husam |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=140–152 |doi=10.1080/17508975.2011.586671 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Empowerment intelligence''': Cities provide [[open platform]]s, experimental facilities and smart city infrastructure in order to cluster innovation in certain districts. These are seen in the Kista Science City in Stockholm and the Cyberport Zone in Hong Kong. Similar facilities have also been established in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nre.vic.gov.au/melbourne2030online/content/implementation_plans/03b_actions.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530120605/http://www.nre.vic.gov.au/melbourne2030online/content/implementation_plans/03b_actions.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-05-30 |title=Melbourne 2030 |author=Department of Sustainability and Environment |publisher=State Government of Victoria |date=2005 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:C1&amp;C2look.jpg|thumbnail|right|Hong Kong Cyberport 1 and Cyberport 2 Buildings]]
# '''Instrumentation intelligence''': Where city infrastructure is made smart through [[real-time data]] collection, with analysis and [[predictive modelling]] across city districts. There is much controversy surrounding this, particularly with regards to [[surveillance issues in smart cities]]. Examples of Instrumentation intelligence have been implemented in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=Amsterdam /&gt; This is implemented through:&lt;ref name=Komninos_ch /&gt;
## A common [[internet protocol|IP]] infrastructure that is open to researchers to develop applications.
## Wireless meters and devices transmit information at the point in time.
## A number of homes being provided with [[smart energy meter]]s to become aware of energy consumption and reduce energy usage
## [[Solar power]] [[garbage compactor]]s, [[Charging station|car recharging stations]] and [[energy saving lamp]]s.

According to David K. Owens, the former executive vice president of the [[Edison Electric Institute]], two key elements that a smart city must have are an integrated communications platform and a "dynamic resilient grid." Both are large investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/9120-america-needs-smart-grid-investments-pronto-stakeholders-say-naruc-event/|title=America needs smart grid investments pronto, stakeholders say at NARUC event|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-11-16|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frameworks ==
In order to achieve an accurate description and explanation of the concept of Smart City it is needed to first analyse the topic through a specific framework. The framework is divided into 4 main dimensions:

=== Technology framework ===
Several concepts of the Smart city rely heavily on the use of technology; a technological Smart City is not just one concept but there are different combinations of technological infrastructure that build a concept of smart city.
* '''Digital city''': it combines service oriented infrastructure, innovation services and communication infrastructure; Yovanof, G. S. &amp; Hazapis, G. N.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yovanof|first=Gregory S.|last2=Hazapis|first2=George N.|date=2009-03-19|title=An Architectural Framework and Enabling Wireless Technologies for Digital Cities &amp;amp; Intelligent Urban Environments|journal=Wireless Personal Communications|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=445–463|doi=10.1007/s11277-009-9693-4|issn=0929-6212}}&lt;/ref&gt; define a digital city “a connected community that combines broadband communications infrastructure; a flexible, service-oriented computing infrastructure based on open industry standards; and, innovative services to meet the needs of governments and their employees, citizens and businesses”.
: The main purpose is to create an environment in which citizens are interconnected and easily share information anywhere in the city.
* '''Virtual city''': In these kinds of cities functions are implemented in a cyberspace; it includes the notion of hybrid city, which consists of a reality with real citizens and entities and a parallel virtual city of real entities and people. Having a smart city that is virtual means that in some cities it is possible the coexistence between these two reality, however the issue of physical distance and location is still not easy to manage. The vision of the world without distance still remains unmet in many ways. In practice this idea is hold up through physical [[IT infrastructure]] of cables, data centers, and exchanges.
* '''Information city:''' It collects local information and delivered them to the public portal; In that city, many inhabitants are able to live and even work on the Internet because they could obtain every information through IT infrastructures, thanks to the sharing information method among citizens themselves. Using this approach, an information city could be an urban centre both economically and socially speaking; the most important thing is the linkage among civic services, people interactions and government institutions.
* '''Intelligent city:''' it involves function as research or technological innovation to support learning and innovation procedure. The notion emerges in a social context in which knowledge, learning process and creativity have great importance and the human capital is considered the most precious resource within this type of technological city. In particular one of the most significant feature of an intelligent city is that every infrastructure is up to date, that means have the latest technology in telecommunications, electronic and mechanical technology. According to Komninos and Sefertzi,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urenio.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/Intelligent-Cities-Shenzhen-2009-Komninos-Sefertzi.pdf|title=Intelligent Cities: R&amp;D offshoring, web 2.0 product development and globalization of innovation systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the attempt to build an “intelligent” Smart City is more a radical innovation rather than an incremental innovation owing to a big quantity of efforts to use IT trying to transform the daily life.
* '''Ubiquitous city''' (U-city): It creates an environment that connect citizens to any services through any device. According to Anthopoulos, L., &amp; Fitsilis, P.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Next Generation Society. Technological and Legal Issues|last=Anthopoulos|first=Leonidas|last2=Fitsilis|first2=Panos|date=2009-09-23|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642116292|editor-last=Sideridis|editor-first=Alexander B.|series=Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering|pages=360–372|language=en|editor-last2=Patrikakis|editor-first2=Charalampos Z.|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-11631-5_33}}&lt;/ref&gt; U-city is a further extension of digital city concept because of the facility in terms of accessibility to every infrastructure. This makes easier to the citizen the use of any available devices to interconnect them. Its goal is to create a city where any citizen can get any services anywhere and anytime through any kind of devices. It is important to highlights that the ubiquitous city is different from the above virtual city: while the virtual city creates another space by visualizing the real urban elements within the virtual space, U-city is given by the computer chips inserted to those urban elements.
* '''Cognitive Smart City:''' [[Cognitive smart city]] expands the concept of the smart city by referring to the convergence of the emerging [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) and smart city technologies, their generated [[big data]], and artificial intelligence techniques. Continuous learning through human interactions and consequently performing a dynamic and flexible behavior and actions based on the dynamic environment of the city are the core components of such framework.

=== Human framework ===
Human infrastructure (i.e., creative occupations and workforce, knowledge networks, voluntary organisations) is a crucial axis for city development.
* '''Creative city''': creativity is recognized as a key driver to smart city and it represents also a version of it. Social infrastructures, like for instance intellectual and social capital are indispensable factors to build a city that is smart according to the human framework. These infrastructures concern people and their relationship. Smart City benefits from social capital and it could be possible and easier to create a Smart city concept if there are mix of education and training, culture and arts, business and commerce as Bartlett, L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engagingcommunities2005.org/abstracts/Bartlet-%20Leo-final.pdf|title=engagingcommunities2005.org|website=www.engagingcommunities2005.org|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; said.
* '''Learning city''': according to Moser, M. A.,&lt;ref name="Brent"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/ejournal/archive/v10-11/v10-11n1Moser-browse.html|title=What is Smart about the Smart Communities Movement?|last=Moser|first=Mary Anne|website=www.ucalgary.ca|publisher=University of Calgary EJournal 10-11(1)|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; learning city is involved in building skilled workforce. This type of city in the human context improves the competitiveness in the global knowledge economy and Campbell [16] established a typology of cities that are learning to be smart: individually proactive city, city cluster, one-to-one link between cities, and city network. That lead a city to learn how it should be possible and realistic to be smart through learning process followed by city workforce.
* '''Humane city:''' It exploits human potential, in particular the knowledge workforce. Following this approach, it is possible focus on education and builds a center of higher education, which is the city, obtaining better-educated individuals. According to Glaeser, E. L., &amp; Berry, C. R,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Glaeser |first1=Edward L. |last2=Berry |first2=Christopher R. |title=Why Are Smart Places Getting Smarter? |url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/rappaport/files/brief_divergence.pdf |website=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt; this view moves a smart city concept in a city full of skilled workforces; the same reasoning could be make for those high tech knowledge-sensitive industries which want to migrate in a so dynamic and proactive community. As a consequence of the above movement, the difference between Smart City and not are getting wider; Smart places are getting smarter while other places getting less smart because such places act as a magnet for creative people and workers (Malanga, S. 2004 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malanga |first1=Steven |title=The Curse of the Creative Class |url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/curse-creative-class-12491.html |website=City Journal |language=en |date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
* '''Knowledge city:''' It is related to knowledge economy and innovation process; this type of Smart City is very similar to a learning city, the only difference refers to “a knowledge city is heavily related to knowledge economy, and its distinction is stress on innovation” (Dirks, S., Gurdgiev, C., &amp; Keeling, M.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zurich.ibm.com/pdf/isl/infoportal/IBV_SC3_report_GBE03348USEN.pdf|title=Smarter cities for smarter growth: How cities can optimize their systems for the talent-based economy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zurich.ibm.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
:The concept of knowledge city is linked with similar evolving concepts of Smart City such as intelligent city and educating city. The most important feature of this city is the fundamental concept of knowledge-based urban development, which has become an important and widespread mechanism for the development of knowledge cities.

=== Institutional framework ===
According to Moser, M. A.,&lt;ref name="Brent"/&gt; since 1990s the Smart Communities movement took shape as a strategy to broaden the base of users involved in IT. Members of these Communities are people that share their interest and work in a partnership with government and other institutional organizations to push the use of IT to improve the quality of daily life as a consequence of different worsening in daily actions. Eger, J. M. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eger |first1=John M. |title=Smart Growth, Smart Cities, and the Crisis at the Pump A Worldwide Phenomenon |issue=1 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1552016 |journal=Iways |volume=32 |pages=47–53 |date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;said that a smart community makes a conscious and agreed-upon decision to deploy technology as a catalyst to solving its social and business needs. It is very important to understand that this use of IT and the consequent improvement could be more demanding without the institutional help; indeed institutional involvement is essential to the success of smart community initiatives. Again Moser, M. A.&lt;ref name="Brent"/&gt; explained that “building and planning a smart community seeks for smart growth”; a smart growth is essential what the partnership between citizen and institutional organizations try to do that is a reaction to worsening trends in daily things, like for instance traffic congestion, school overcrowding and air pollution. However it is important noticed that technological propagation is not an end in itself, but only a means to reinventing cities for a new economy and society. To sum up, it could possible to assert that any Smart City initiatives necessitate the governance support for their success.

The importance of these three different dimensions consist that only a link, correlation among them make possible a development of a real concept of Smart City. According to the definition of Smart City given by Caragliu, A., Del Bo, C., &amp; Nijkamp, P.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caragliu |first1=A. |last2=Del Bo |first2=C. |last3=Nijkamp |first3=P. |title=Smart cities in Europe |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/vua/wpaper/2009-48.html |publisher=VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Econometrics |language=en |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a city is smart when investments in human/social capital and IT infrastructure fuel sustainable growth and enhance quality of life, through participatory governance.

=== Energy framework ===
Smart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies, improve sustainability, create economic development, and enhance quality of life factors for people living and working in the city. It also means that the city has a smarter energy infrastructure. A more formal definition is this: “… An urban area that has securely integrated technology across the information . . . and Internet of Things (IoT) sectors to better manage a city’s assets.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A smart city is powered by “smart connections” for various items such as street lighting, [[Building automation|smart buildings]], [[Distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER), [[Data analysis|data analytics]], and smart transportation. Amongst these things, energy is paramount; this is why utility companies play a key role in smart cities. Electric companies, working partnership with city officials, technology companies and a number of other institutions, are among the major players that helped accelerate the growth of America’s smart cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/5836-pittsburgh-san-diego-city-officials-put-utilities-major-players-smart-city-partnerships/|title=Pittsburgh, San Diego city officials put utilities as major players in smart-city partnerships|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-06-15|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data Management framework===
Smart city employs a combination of data collection, processing, and disseminating technologies in conjunction with networking and computing technologies and data security and privacy measures encouraging application innovation to promote the overall quality of life for its citizens and covering dimensions that include: utilities, health, transportation, entertainment and government services.&lt;ref&gt;Gharaibeh, A., Salahuddin, M. A., Hussini, S. J., Khreishah, A., Khalil, I., Guizani, M., &amp; Al-Fuqaha, A. (2017). Smart Cities: A Survey on Data Management, Security, and Enabling Technologies. IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials, 19(4), 2456-2501&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms and technologies==
New Internet technologies promoting [[Cloud computing|cloud-based services]],&lt;!-- public infrastructure is moving away from cloud-based services, and looking for cyber-secure storage and transmission to on-premises servers or SCADA systems. --&gt; the [[Internet of Things]] (IoT),&lt;ref name="SmartIoT2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiomax.com/smart-iot-in-transportation-and-logistics-is-the-key-tech-to-improve-cities-in-motion/ |title=Smart IoT in Transportation and Logistics is the Key Tech to Improve Cities in Motion |accessdate=8 November 2017|date=2016-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; real-world user interfaces, use of [[smart phone]]s &lt;ref name="MIST"&gt;MIST: Fog-based Data Analytics Scheme with Cost-Efficient Resource Provisioning for IoT Crowdsensing Applications ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2017.01.012]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[smart meter]]s, [[sensor network|networks of sensors]] and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFIDs]], and more accurate communication based on the [[semantic web]], open new ways to collective action and [[Collaborative problem-solving group|collaborative]] [[problem solving]].

Online collaborative sensor data management platforms are on-line database services that allow sensor owners to register and connect their devices to feed data into an on-line database for storage and allow developers to connect to the database and build their own applications based on that data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Boyle | first1 = D. | last2 = Yates | first2 = D. | last3 = Yeatman | first3 = E. | title = Urban Sensor Data Streams: London 2013 | doi = 10.1109/MIC.2013.85 | journal = IEEE Internet Computing | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 1 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=WikiSensing: An Online Collaborative Approach for Sensor Data Management|journal=Sensors|volume=12|issue=10|pages=13295–13332|doi=10.3390/s121013295|pmid=23201997|pmc=3545568|year=2012|last1=Silva|first1=Dilshan|last2=Ghanem|first2=Moustafa|last3=Guo|first3=Yike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, a traffic management system known as SCOOT optimises green light time at traffic intersections by feeding back magnetometer and inductive loop data to a supercomputer, which can co-ordinate traffic lights across the city to improve traffic throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9AiDAAAQBAJ|title=Science and the City: The Mechanics Behind the Metropolis|last=Winkless|first=Laurie|date=2016-08-11|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472913227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] in [[Cantabria]], northern [[Spain]], has 20,000 sensors connecting buildings, infrastructure, transport, networks and utilities, offers a physical space for experimentation and validation of the IoT functions, such as interaction and management protocols, device technologies, and support services such as discovery, [[identity management]] and security&lt;ref name= Schaffers&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9783642208973|authors=Schaffers, H., Komninos, N., Pallot, M., Trousse, B., and Nilsson M. |year=2011 |title= Smart Cities and the Future Internet: Towards Cooperation Frameworks for Open Innovation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=Vol. 6656 |series= ''The Future Internet'' |pages= 431–446}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Santander, the sensors monitor the levels of [[pollution]], [[noise]], [[traffic]] and parking.

Electronic cards (known as [[smart card]]s) are another common platform in smart city contexts. These cards possess a unique encrypted identifier that allows the owner to log into a range of government provided services (or [[e-service]]s) without setting up multiple accounts. The single identifier allows governments to aggregate [[big data|data]] [[Mass surveillance|about citizens]] and their preferences to improve the provision of services and to determine common interests of groups. This technology has been implemented in Southampton.&lt;ref name=DeakinAl_jrnl /&gt;

==Roadmap==
{{One source|section|date=October 2017}}
A smart city roadmap consists of four/three (the first is a preliminary check) major components:&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;
# Define exactly what is the community: maybe that definition can condition what you are doing in the subsequent steps; it relates to geography, links between cities and countryside and flows of people between them; maybe – even – that in some Countries the definition of City/community that is stated does not correspond effectively to what – in fact – happens in the real life
# Study the Community: Before deciding to build a smart city, first we need to know why.  This can be done by determining the benefits of such an initiative.  Study the community to know the citizens, the business's needs –  know the citizens and the community's unique attributes, such as the age of the citizens, their education, hobbies, and attractions of the city.
# Develop a Smart City Policy: Develop a [[policy]] to drive the initiatives, where roles, responsibilities, objective, and goals, can be defined.  Create plans and strategies on how the goals will be achieved.
# Engage The Citizens: This can be done by engaging the citizens through the use of [[e-government]] initiatives, [[open data]], sport events, etc.
In short, People, Processes, and Technology (PPT) are the three principles of the success of a smart city initiative.  Cities must study their citizens and communities, know the processes, business drivers, create policies, and objectives to meet the citizens' needs.  Then, technology can be implemented to meet the citizens' need, in order to improve the quality of life and create real economic opportunities.This requires a holistic customized approach that accounts for city cultures, long-term city planning, and local regulations.&lt;blockquote&gt;“Whether to improve security, resiliency, sustainability, traffic congestion, public safety, or city services, each community may have different reasons for wanting to be smart. But all smart communities share common attributes—and they all are powered by smart connections and by our industry’s smarter energy infrastructure. A [[smart grid]] is the foundational piece in building a smart community.” — Pat Vincent-Collawn, chairman of the [[Edison Electric Institute]] and president and CEO of [[PNM Resources]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/8322-eei-chairman-pledges-collaborate-communities-powering-technology-support-smart-cities/|title=EEI chairman pledges to collaborate with communities on powering technology to support smart cities|last=Carey|first=Liz|date=2017-10-06|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Research==
University research labs developed prototypes for intelligent cities. IGLUS is an [[action research]] project led by [[EPFL]]  focused on developing [[governance]] systems for urban [[infrastructures]]. IGLUS  announced a  [[MOOC]] through [[Coursera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iglus.org/smart-cities-mooc|title=Smart cities MOOC – IGLUS|website=iglus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[MIT]] Smart Cities Lab''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.media.mit.edu/|title=MIT Cities|publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses upon intelligent, sustainable buildings, mobility systems (GreenWheel [[Electric bicycle|Electric Bicycle]], Mobility-on-Demand, [[CityCar]], [[Robot locomotion|Wheel Robots]]); the ''IntelCities''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelcities.iti.gr/intelcities|title=IntelCities|work=Intelcities project}}&lt;/ref&gt; research consortium for electronic government, planning systems and citizen participation; [[URENIO]] developed intelligent city platforms for the [[innovation economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urenio.org/platforms/index.html|title=Intelligent City Platforms|publisher=URENIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on strategic intelligence, [[technology transfer]], collaborative innovation, and incubation, while it promotes intelligent cities research and planning;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urenio.org|title=Home|publisher=URENIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Smart Cities Academic Network''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcities.info/aim|title=AIM|work=Smart Cities project}}&lt;/ref&gt; is working on e-governance and e-services in the North Sea region.

==Commercialisation==
Large IT, telecommunication and energy management companies such as [[Cisco]], [[Schneider Electric]], [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] market initiatives for intelligent cities. Cisco, launched the ''Global Intelligent Urbanization'' initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2009/prod_021209c.html|title=Network as the Next Utility for "Intelligent Urbanisation"|publisher=CISCO|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215022011/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2009/prod_021209c.html|archivedate=2014-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help cities using the network as the fourth utility for integrated city management, better [[quality of life]] for citizens, and economic development. IBM announced its ''SmarterCities''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/smartplanet/topics/cities/20090309/index.shtml?&amp;re=spfprogram|title=About IBM|publisher=IBM|date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to stimulate [[economic growth]] and quality of life in cities and metropolitan areas with the activation of new approaches of thinking and acting in the [[urban ecosystem]]. Sensor developers and startup companies are continually developing new smart city applications.

Smart city technological companies exist in [[Israel]], with [[Tel Aviv]] getting an award in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu-smartcities.eu/content/best-smart-city-istel-aviv|title=The Best Smart City Is...Tel Aviv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224232353/http://eu-smartcities.eu/content/best-smart-city-istel-aviv|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 December 2014|website=eu-smartcities.eu|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Tech/Tel-Aviv-to-help-India-build-smart-cities-435161|title=Tel Aviv to help India devlope smart cities|website=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-companies-to-build-smart-city-in-brazil/|title=Israeli companies to build smart city in Brazil|website=Times of Israel|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/chinese-tech-giant-kuang-chi-harnesses-israeli-tech-to-build-smart-cities-in-china/|title=Chinese tech giant Kuang-Chi harnesses Israeli tech to build smart cities in China|website=Techcrunch|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major strategies and achievements related to the spatial intelligence of cities are listed in the [[Intelligent Community Forum]] awards from 1999 to 2010, in the cities of [[Songdo International Business District|Songdo]] and [[Suwon]] (South Korea), [[Stockholm]] (Sweden), [[Gangnam District]] of Seoul (South Korea), [[Waterloo, Ontario]] (Canada), [[Taipei]] (Taiwan), [[Mitaka, Tokyo|Mitaka]] (Japan), [[Glasgow]] (Scotland, UK), [[Calgary]] (Alberta, Canada), [[Seoul]] (South Korea), [[New York City]] (US), [[LaGrange, Georgia]] (US), and [[Singapore]], which were recognized for their efforts in developing broadband networks and e-services sustaining innovation ecosystems, growth, and inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Intelligent Communities of the Year 1999-2010|url=https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?submenu=Awards&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=ICF_Awards&amp;category=Events&amp;link=ICF_Awards|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722103131/https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?submenu=Awards&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=ICF_Awards&amp;category=Events&amp;link=ICF_Awards|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a number of cities actively pursuing a smart city strategy:

=== Amsterdam ===
[[File:KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg|thumbnail|right|Street lamps in [[Amsterdam]] have been upgraded to allow municipal councils to dim the lights based on pedestrian usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/9/slug/climate-street |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Climate Street |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The [[Amsterdam]] Smart City initiative&lt;ref name=Amsterdam /&gt; which began in 2009 currently includes 170+ projects collaboratively developed by local residents, government and businesses.&lt;ref name=DeakinIntro /&gt; These projects run on an interconnected platform through [[wireless device]]s to enhance the city's real time decision making abilities. The City of Amsterdam ('''City''') claims the purpose of the projects is to reduce traffic, [[energy saving|save energy]] and improve [[public safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/about-asc |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ About ASC |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote efforts from local residents, the City runs the Amsterdam Smart City Challenge annually, accepting proposals for applications and developments that fit within the City's framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/news/detail/id/577/slug/do-you-have-smart-solutions-for-your-city |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Do you have smart solutions for your city? |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a resident developed app is Mobypark, which allows owners of parking spaces to rent them out to people for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/news/detail/id/576/slug/smart-spotlight-manuel-cayr |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Smart Spotlight: Manuel Cayre |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The data generated from this app can then be used by the City to determine [[parking]] demand and traffic flows in Amsterdam. A number of homes have also been provided with smart energy meters, with incentives provided to those that actively reduce energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Komninos_ch /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/55/slug/the-smart-home |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ The smart home |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other initiatives include flexible [[street lighting]] ([[smart lighting]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/62/slug/flexible-street-lighting |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Flexible street lighting |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows municipalities to control the brightness of street lights, and smart traffic management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamsmartcity.com/projects/detail/id/58/slug/smart-traffic-management |title=Amsterdam Smart City ~ Smart traffic management |author=Amsterdam Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where traffic is monitored in real time by the City and information about current travel time on certain roads is broadcast to allow motorists to determine the best routes to take.

=== Barcelona ===
[[File:Bus Articulat Barcelona.JPG|thumbnail|left|A new bus network was implemented in Barcelona due to smart city data analytics.]]
[[Barcelona]] has established a number of projects that can be considered 'smart city' applications within its "CityOS" strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibarcelona.bcn.cat/en/o-government/city-os|title=iBarcelona|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sensor technology has been implemented in the irrigation system in Parc del Centre de Poblenou, where real time data is transmitted to gardening crews about the level of water required for the plants.&lt;ref name=Barcelona /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Laursen |first=Lucas |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532511/barcelonas-smart-city-ecosystem/ |title=Barcelona's Smart City Ecosystem |work=MIT Technology Review |date=2014-11-18 |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona has also designed a new bus network based on data analysis of the most common traffic flows in Barcelona, utilising primarily vertical, horizontal and diagonal routes with a number of interchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/new-bus-network.html |title=New bus network |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration of multiple smart city technologies can be seen through the implementation of smart traffic lights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/smart-traffic-lights.html |title=Smart traffic lights |author=BCN Smart City |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as buses run on routes designed to optimise the number of green lights. In addition, where an emergency is reported in Barcelona, the approximate route of the emergency vehicle is entered into the traffic light system, setting all the lights to green as the vehicle approaches through a mix of GPS and traffic management software, allowing emergency services to reach the incident without delay. Much of this data is managed by the [[Sentilo Platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.22barcelona.com/content/blogcategory/50/281/ |title=Urban Innovation |author=Ajuntament de Barcelona |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://connecta.bcn.cat |title=Sentilo BCN:Platform Sensors and Actuators Barcelona |date=|website=|publisher=|access-date= 26 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Columbus, Ohio ===
{{Commons category|Smart Columbus Experience Center}}

In the summer of 2017, the [[Columbus, Ohio|City of Columbus]], Ohio began its pursuit of a smart city initiative. It partnered with [[American Electric Power|American Electric Power Ohio]] to create a group of new [[Charging station|electric vehicle charging stations]]. Many smart cities such as Columbus are using agreements such as this one to prepare for climate change, expand electric infrastructure, convert existing public vehicle fleets to electric cars, and create incentives for people to [[Carpool|share rides when commuting]]. For doing this, the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] gave the City of Columbus a $40 million grant. The city also received $10 million from [[Vulcan Inc.]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/7711-aep-ohio-build-car-charging-stations-part-columbus-smart-city-initiative/|title=AEP Ohio to build car charging stations as part of Columbus Smart City initiative|last=Galford|first=Chris|date=2017-09-08|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One key reason why the utility was involved in the picking of locations for new electric vehicle charging stations was to gather data. According to ''Daily Energy Insider'', the group Infrastructure and Business Continuity for AEP said, "You don’t want to put infrastructure where it won’t be used or maintained. The data we collect will help us build a much bigger market in the future."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Because autonomous vehicles are currently seeing "an increased industrial research and legislative push globally", building routes and connections for them is another important part of the Columbus Smart City initiative.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Dubai===
Shaikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] vice president of [[UAE]] and a Ruler of [[Dubai]] has initiate the Smart Dubai project that contains more than 100 initiatives in 2013, this project will lead Dubai to be the world smartest city by 2030. As his highness says this project is going to facilitate and enhance the quality of life of Dubai's citizens by integrating the private and public sectors and enabling citizens to have an access to these sectors through their smartphones. One of the initiatives that has been launched is Dubai Autonomous Transportation Strategy within this strategy Dubai will only have driverless transits. In addition, to save the environment by 2021 Dubai will be paper-free; all information and transactions of governments, businesses, and customers will be fully digitized.  As a part of the Smart Dubai project, citizens will have unlimited access to government applications by providing 5000 hotspots in different locations of the city by 2021.  &lt;ref&gt;Dubai - a new paradigm for smart cities - 2015.

It includes Dublinked- Dublin’s open data platform that hosts open source data to smart city applications.

=== Madrid ===
[[Madrid]], Spain's pioneering smart city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/we-cant-allow-the-tech-giants-to-rule-smart-cities|title=We can't allow the tech giants to rule smart cities|publisher=|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2015-10-25|last1=Mason|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; has adopted the MiNT Madrid Inteligente/Smarter Madrid platform to integrate the management of local services. These include the sustainable and computerized management of infrastructure, garbage collection and recycling, and public spaces and green areas, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/RelacionesInternacionales/Publicaciones/CatalogoBuenasPracticas/Economia/MiNT%20Madrid%20Inteligente%2014.pdf|title=Buenas Prácticas de la Ciudad de Madrid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is run in partnership with [[IBM]]s [[INSA]], making use of the latter's Big Data and analytics capabilities and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecitiescollective.com/global-site-plans-grid/316481/madrid-spain-launches-ibm-smarter-cities-project|title=Madrid, Spain Launches IBM Smarter Cities Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madrid is considered to have taken a bottom-up approach to smart cities, whereby social issues are first identified and individual technologies or networks are then identified to address these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban-hub.com/cities/fine-tuning-smart-in-madrid/|title=From Barcelona to Madrid, Spain's smart cities inspire change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach includes support and recognition for start ups through the Madrid Digital Start Up programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebn.be/index.php?lnk=K2tiZmlkaWp5MVZzVWF6SzFUWkpHNWh3Y0F3TFBHLzZmaFpxZWwxNVB2MD0=|title=MADRID DIGITAL START UP - CLEARCHANNEL 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
A document written in 2011 refers to 18th century [[Żejtun]] as the earliest "smart city" in Malta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of History Week|last=Vassallo|first=Carmel|date=2011|title=Żejtun: An Eighteenth-Century 'Smart City'|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2011/07s.pdf|volume=|issue=7|pages=105–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in the modern context of a smart city.  By the 21st century, [[SmartCity Malta]], a planned technology park, is partially operational while the rest is on construction, as a [[Foreign Direct Investment]].

=== Manchester ===
In December 2015, [[Manchester]]'s CityVerve project was chosen as the winner of a government-led technology competition and awarded £10m to develop an [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) smart cities demonstrator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/manchester-wins-10m-prize-to-become-world-leader-in-smart-city-technology], Manchester wins £10m prize to become world leader in 'smart city' technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in July 2016, the project is being carried out by a consortium of 22 public and private organisations, including [[Manchester City Council]], and is aligned with the city's on-going devolution commitment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester.gov.uk/news/article/7343/manchester_announced_as_uk_s_internet_of_things_iot_city_demonstrator_and_awarded_10m_investment], Manchester announced as UK's Internet of Things (IoT) City Demonstrator and awarded £10m investment.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has a two-year remit to demonstrate the capability of IoT applications and address barriers to deploying smart cities, such as city governance, network security, user trust and adoption, interoperability, scalability and justifying investment.

CityVerve is based on an open data principle that incorporates a 'platform of platforms'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityverve.org.uk/platform-of-platforms/], Platform of Platforms.&lt;/ref&gt; which ties together applications for its four key themes: transport and travel; health and social care; energy and the environment; culture and the public realm. This will also ensure that the project is scalable and able to be redeployed to other locations worldwide.

=== Milton Keynes ===
[[Milton Keynes]] has a commitment to making itself a Smart City. Currently the mechanism through which this is approached is the MK:Smart initiative,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a collaboration of local government, businesses, academia and 3rd sector organisations. The focus of the initiative is on making energy use, water use and transport more [[sustainable]] whilst promoting [[economic growth]] in the city. Central to the project is the creation of a state-of-the-art 'MK [[Data Hub]]' which will support the acquisition and management of vast amounts of data relevant to city systems from a variety of data sources. These will include data about [[energy consumption|energy]] and [[water consumption]], transport data, data acquired through satellite technology, social and economic datasets, and [[crowdsource]]d data from [[social media]] or specialised apps.

The MK:Smart initiative has two aspects which extend our understanding of how Smart Cities should operate. The first, Our MK,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; is a scheme for promoting citizen-led sustainability issues in the city. The scheme provides funding and support to engage with citizens and help turn their ideas around sustainability into a reality.  The second aspect is in providing citizens with the skills to operate effectively in a Smart City. The Urban Data school&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; is an online platform to teach school students about data skills while the project has also produced a [[MOOC]]&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; to inform citizens about what a Smart City is.

=== New York City ===
New York City is developing a number of smart city initiatives. A notable example is the series of city service kiosks in the [[LinkNYC]] network. These provide services including free WiFi, phone calls, device charging stations, local wayfinding, and more, funded by advertising that plays on the kiosk’s screens{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== San Leandro ===
The city of [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], California is in the midst of transforming from an industrial center to a tech hub of the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT) (technology that lets devices communicate with each other over the Internet). California's utility company [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&amp;E]] is working with the city in this endeavor and on a smart energy pilot program that would develop a distributed energy network across the city that would be monitored by IoT sensors. The goal would be to give the city an energy system that has enough capacity to receive and redistribute electricity to and from multiple energy sources.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/5732-eeis-new-board-chairman-cites-smart-city-opportunities-convention-gets-way/|title=EEI’s new board chairman cites smart-city opportunities as convention gets under way|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-06-12|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Santa Cruz ===
An alternative use of smart city technology can be found in [[Santa Cruz, California]], where local authorities analyse historical crime data in order to [[Predictive policing|predict police requirements]] and maximise police presence where it is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baxter |first=Stephen |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/general-news/20120226/modest-gains-in-first-six-months-of-santa-cruzs-predictive-police-program |title=Modest gains in first six months of Santa Cruz's predictive police program |work=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=2012-02-26 |accessdate=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analytical tools generate a list of 10 places each day where [[property crime]]s are more likely to occur, and then placing police efforts on these regions when officers are not responding to any emergency. This use of ICT technology is different to the manner in which European cities utilise smart city technology, possibly highlighting the breadth of the smart city concept in different parts of the world.

===Smart cities in India===

[[Stockholm]]'s smart city technology is underpinned by the [[Stokab dark fibre system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stokab.se/In-english/ |title=This is stokab |author=Stockholm: the capital of Scandinavia |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed in 1994 to provide a universal fibre optic network across Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/toolkit/notes/PracticeNote/3244/ |title=Models for Infrastructure Sharing: Sweden's Stokab |author=ICT Regulation Toolkit |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private companies are able to lease fibre as service providers on equal terms. The company is owned by the City of Stockholm itself.&lt;ref name=Stockholm /&gt; Within this framework, Stockholm has created a Green IT strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://international.stockholm.se/globalassets/ovriga-bilder-och-filer/green-it-strategy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Green IT |author=Stockholm: the Capital of Scandinavia |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green IT program seeks to reduce the environmental impact of Stockholm through IT functions such as energy efficient buildings (minimising heating costs), traffic monitoring (minimising the time spent on the road) and development of e-services (minimising paper usage). The e-Stockholm platform is centred on the provision of e-services, including political announcements, parking space booking and snow clearance.&lt;ref name=esthlm&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://international.stockholm.se/globalassets/ovriga-bilder-och-filer/e-strategy-city-of-stockholm.pdf |format=PDF |title=e-sthlm |author=Stockholm: the Capital of Scandinavia |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further being developed through GPS analytics, allowing residents to plan their route through the city.&lt;ref name=esthlm /&gt; An example of district-specific smart city technology can be found in the Kista Science City region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kista.com/ |title=Kista Science City |author=Kista Science City Online |accessdate=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This region is based on the triple helix concept of smart cities,&lt;ref name=Hollands2008 /&gt; where university, industry and government work together to develop ICT applications for implementation in a smart city strategy.

==Criticism==
{{See also|Surveillance issues in smart cities}}
The criticisms of smart cities revolve around:&lt;ref name=Hollands2008/&gt;
* A bias in strategic interest may lead to ignoring alternative avenues of promising urban development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greenfield, A.|year=2013|title=Against the Smart City. |location=London|publisher=Verso|asin=B00FHQ5DBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A smart city, as a scientifically planned city, would defy the fact that real development in cities is often haphazard. In that line of criticism, the smart city is seen as unattractive for citizens as they "can deaden and stupefy the people who live in its all-efficient embrace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/04/smart-city-rio-songdo-masdar|title=No one likes a city that's too smart|last=Sennett|first=Richard|date=4 December 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, people would prefer cities they can participate to shape.
* The focus of the concept of smart city may lead to an underestimation of the possible negative effects of the development of the new technological and networked infrastructures needed for a city to be smart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham, S.|author2=Marvin, S. |year=1996|title=Telecommunications and the city: electronic spaces, urban place|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203430453}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a [[globalization|globalized]] [[business model]] is based on [[capital mobility]], following a business-oriented model may result in a losing long term strategy: "The 'spatial fix' inevitably means that mobile capital can often 'write its own deals' to come to town, only to move on when it receives a better deal elsewhere. This is no less true for the smart city than it was for the industrial, [or] manufacturing city."&lt;ref name=Hollands2008/&gt;
* The high level of [[big data]] collection and analytics has raised questions regarding [[surveillance issues in smart cities|surveillance in smart cities]], particularly as it relates to [[predictive policing]].
* As of August 2018, the discussion on smart cities centres around the usage and implementation of technology rather than on the inhabitants of the cities and how they can be involved in the process&lt;ref&gt;Marrone, M. &amp; Hammerle, M.  Bus Inf Syst Eng (2018). 60: 197. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-018-0535-3&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Especially in low-income countries, smart cities are irrelevant to the majority of the urban population, which lives in poverty with limited access to basic services. A focus on smart cities may worsen inequality and marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Vanessa|date=2013-12-06|title=African urban fantasies: dreams or nightmares?|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=215–231|doi=10.1177/0956247813513705|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish Wikipedia''' ({{lang-{{#property:P424}}|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Swedish language|Swedish-language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]] and was started on 23 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sv.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=history&amp;id=HomePage |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010608192645/sv.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=history&amp;id=HomePage |title=Wikipedia: History of HomePage |archivedate=8 June 2001 |accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the third largest Wikipedia by article-count with its {{formatnum:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|sv}}}} current articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias |title=List of Wikipedias - Meta |website=meta.wikimedia.org |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a majority are generated by a [[Internet bot|bot]], or software application,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/senastenytt/ttnyheter/inrikes/article22752344.ab |title=Kontroversiell robot bakom wikiväxt |work=Aftonbladet |language= sv |access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a [[:meta:Wikipedia article depth|''Wikipedia article depth'']] of 5.6.
The [[Wikipedia administrators|administrators]] on the Swedish Wikipedia (currently {{NUMBEROF|ADMINS|sv|N}}) are elected for a [[term of office|fixed-term period]] of one year and have to be re-elected after that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date= 18 October 2017 |title= Wikipedia:Administratörer |url=https://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrat%C3%B6rer&amp;oldid=41219804 |website=Wikipedia |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Sv-wp-svenska-2001.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Screenshot on 23 May 2001 of sv.wikipedia.com]]
Originally, Swedish Wikipedia rivalled [[susning.nu]], a [[wiki]] created by [[Lars Aronsson]] in 2001. Susning.nu was by 28 May 2003 the world's second largest wiki. Due to several controversies involving the authority of the founder, objections to Aronsson's decision to allow [[advertisement]] on the site, several prolific Susning writers switched over to Swedish Wikipedia in 2002, and later more followed. Two of its pioneers were Johan Dahlin and Dan Köhl, the latter one introduced "''Tinget''" in November 2002. This was the first conflict handling organ at Swedish Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/S%C3%A5_fungerar_Wikipedia/Wikipedias_historia#Tinget_och_skilkom |title=Så fungerar Wikipedia/Wikipedias historia |publisher=Lennart Guldbrandsson, sv.wikisource.org |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, Susning.nu's editing features were closed down to all but a handful of users, which further increased the flow to Swedish Wikipedia. On 14 January 2005, Wikipedia's article count surpassed that of Susning.nu.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In March 2006, the Swedish newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' published a comparative evaluation of Swedish Wikipedia, Susning.nu and the online version of [[Nationalencyklopedin]]. The evaluation was done by giving a selection of articles to independent subject matter experts for grading. While Nationalencyklopedin came out on top with respect to factuality and neutrality, Swedish Wikipedia received a good overall grade and came out on top with respect to being up to date and having a broad coverage, also including popular culture subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gratis nätlexikon får bra betyg |first=Ulrika |last=Nandra |url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/gratis-natlexikon-far-bra-betyg_305804.svd |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zc78dWm1 |archivedate=21 June 2011 |date=30 March 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2012 it reached 500,000 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Grattis Sverige - nu har vi en halv miljon Wikipedia-artiklar! |publisher=Wikimedia Sverige |date=27 September 2012 |url=http://nyheter.se.msn.com/photopage.aspx?cp-documentid=251471807 |language=Swedish |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June 2013 it reached 1,000,000 articles and rose from 8th to 5th place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Wikipedias&amp;oldid=5527567 "List of Wikipedias".] Meta.wikimedia.org, 2013-06-16. Retrieved 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that during 2012 and 2013 the number of articles on Swedish Wikipedia more than doubled. This is in large part due to a community project where [[Internet bot|bot]]s were used in producing articles for all existing species of plants and animals. When finished, this project alone created more than a million articles, most short and sourced through available online databases on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Användare:Lsjbot&amp;oldid=18990516 "Användare:Lsjbot".] Sv.wikipedia.org.

'''Virtual home staging''' is a type of [[home staging]]. The interior design is created in graphic editors. Virtual staging is especially popular among real estate brokers, photographers, and interior designers. The main goal of this kind of [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] is creating highly realistic images of properties (usually for sale). The major advantages of virtual staging over traditional home staging are time and cost.

Virtual staging is sometimes done to market a vacant home, as it can offer many of the benefits of traditional staging at a significantly lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/07/26/virtual-home-staging-is-new-wave-in-home-staging/|title=Virtual home staging is the new wave in home selling|last=Kurtz|first=Chaya Goodman|date=2012-07-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About five to ten percent of online real estate listings use virtual staging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/2016/06/23/lemontree-photography-is-pushing-the-boundaries-of-how-homes-are-marketed-in-london-by-offering-virtual-staging-and-360-degree-video|title=Image maker|last=nurun.com|website=The London Free Press|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithms of data analysis that scan millions of images on the Internet and evaluate them regarding to views and likes on social networks help to create interior and decor models for the virtual staging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hasten.me/about/|title=About|website=HASTEN|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual staging is more than 90% cheaper than physical staging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/market-insight/features/future-nyc/interview-hasten039s-ceo-aleksandr-lanin-gives-dish-virtual-staging/13764|title=Interview: Hasten's CEO Aleksandr Lanin Gives the Dish on Virtual Staging |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Auld''' (6 November 1924 – 11 September 2006) was a Scottish poet, author, translator and magazine editor who wrote chiefly in [[Esperanto]]. Auld was born at [[Erith]] in Kent, and then moved to Glasgow with his parents, attending [[Allan Glen's School]]. After wartime service in the Royal Armed Forces, he studied English Literature at [[Glasgow University]], and then qualified as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/obituaries.cfm?id=1361492006 Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210203805/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/obituaries.cfm?id=1361492006 |date=10 February 2007 }} ''[[The Scotsman]]''; accessed 4 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, he was appointed to a secondary school in [[Alloa]] and he remained there for the rest of his life. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1999, 2004, and 2006, making him the first person nominated for works in Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1529478/William-Auld.html|title=William Auld|date=22 September 2006|work=Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''La infana raso'' (''The Infant Race''), is a long poem that, in Auld's words, explores "the role of the human race in time and in the cosmos," and is based heavily on ''[[The Cantos]]'' by [[Ezra Pound]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Auld began to learn Esperanto in 1937 but only became active in the propagation of the language in 1947, and from then on wrote many works in Esperanto. He edited various magazines and [[review]]s, including ''[[Esperanto en Skotlando]]'' (1949–1955), ''[[Esperanto (review)|Esperanto]]'' (1955–1958, 1961–1962), ''[[Monda Kulturo]]'' (1962–1963), ''[[Norda Prismo]]'' (1968–1972), ''[[La Brita Esperantisto]]'' (1973–1999) and ''[[Fonto]]'' (1980–1987).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

He was Vice President of the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] (1977–1980), President of the [[Academy of Esperanto]] (1979–1983), and President of the Esperanto [[International PEN|PEN]] Centre (1999–2005). In 2001, he donated his large personal collection of [[Esperanto literature]] to the [[National Library of Scotland]], where it is now housed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The '''Xavante language''' is a [[Jê languages|Jê language]] spoken by the [[Xavante people]] in the area surrounding Eastern [[Mato Grosso]], [[Brazil]]. The Xavante language is unusual in its phonology, its [[wikt:ergative|ergative]] [[object–agent–verb]] word order, and its use of honorary and endearment terms in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].

The Xavante people are approximately 18,380 individuals in 170 villages as of 2014, but the language is spoken by 9600 people, of whom about 7000 are monolingual in Xavante alone.  The current speakers, made up of all ages, use the language vigorously, and hold positive attitudes towards Xavante.&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Nineteenth edition|last=Lewis|first=Paul|last2=Simons|first2=Gary F.|last3=Fennig|first3=Charles D.|date=2016|publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Xavante is a language in the Jê family, spoken in Mato Grosso, in the west part of Brazil.&lt;ref name="DeSouza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeSouza|first=.L.G.|last2=Santos|first2=R.V.|last3=Pagliaro|first3=H.|last4=Carvalho|first4=M.S.|last5=Flower|first5=N.M.|last6=Coimbra|first6=C.A.E.|date=2011|title=Demography and health of the Xavante Indians of central Brazil. |journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública|volume=27|pages=1891–1905|doi=10.1590/s0102-311x2011001000003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been orthographically rendered as Chavante and Shavante, and is also called Akuen, Akwen, A’uwe Uptabi, A’we, Crisca, Pusciti, and Tapuac.&lt;ref name="olac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.language-archives.org/language/xav.|title=OLAC resources in and about the Xavanté language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The [[Xavante people]] originate from the east of the [[Araguaia River]], in what was then called the province of Goias.&lt;ref name="Neel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neel|first=J.V.|last2=Salzana|first2=F.M.|last3=Junqueira|first3=P.C.|last4=Keiter|first4=F.|last5=Maybury Lewis|first5=D.date=1964|title=Studies on the Xavante Indians of the Brazilian Matto Grosso|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=16|pages=52–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 18th century, this area was heavily invaded by colonizers searching for gold, leading to the indigenous population in the area to suffer from epidemics and live in the residential settlements created by the government.&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfield|first=S.|date=2001|title=Indigenous Struggle at the Heart of Brazil: State Policy, Frontier Expansion, and the Xavante Indians, 1937-1988.|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, groups of indigenous people, now distinctly self-identifying as Xavante, settled in Mato Grosso; this area was relatively undisturbed until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/xavante/1645| last=Graham|first=S.|date=2008|title=Xavante – History of contact|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the government under [[Getulio Vargas]] initiated the ‘March to the West’ campaign within the National Integration Program, in which expansion to the interior of Brazil and ‘domestication of the Savage’ were heavily promoted.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=C.J.|last2=Purcell|first2=M.|date=2005|title=There's nothing inherent about scale: Political ecology, the local trap, and the politics of development in the Brazilian Amazon|journal=Geoforum|volume=36|pages=607–624|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2004.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xavante people were used in print media as illustrations of newly ‘pacified’ people who had decided to ‘join Brazilian society’.&lt;ref name="Garfield" /&gt; In the meantime, groups including [[missionaries]] had invaded the Mato Grosso to try to convert the Xavanate into [[Catholicism]]; the indigenous people, angry at the unsolicited invasion, attacked the group in return.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; However, following this period until the 1960s peaceful contacts, in which goods were exchanged, were established.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Xavante land was coveted for [[farming]] and agriculture purposes; deals to arrange transfers to white settlers were often fraudulent, and land used for monocultures, such as entire fields of rice, or grazing.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;  The people were transferred from Mato Grosso to southern Brazil, a less fertile region; however, the Xavante people then began the attempt to recover the land they had lived on prior to contact with settlers in the 1970s, with demands for territory being met with violence by large capitalist companies that now had hold of the areas.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;  In 1981, six areas were demarcated to the Xavante, and in 1991, the rights to extensions of some areas were won.&lt;ref name="Da Silva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Da Silva|first=A.L.|date=1999|title=The Akwe‐Xavante in history at the end of the 20th century|journal=Journal of Latin American Anthropology|volume=4|pages=212–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conflicts regarding the territories between the Xavante and Brazilian government continue today.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; Currently, there has been a Program of Documentation of Indigenous Cultures (PRODOCULT) devoted to Xavante, run by J.R. Welch and R. Costa; the permanent collection, containing images, text, cartography and more information on the Xavante people and language, is housed in the Museum of the Indian.

===Language Overview===
Xavante is a member of the Jê language family, itself a member of the Macro-Gê stock.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues"&gt;{{cite book|last =Rodrigues|first=A.D.|title=The Amazonian Languages|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stock is spoken in a wide distribution of non-central Brazil; Macro-Gê is also popular in the eastern, northern, and central, and southwestern parts of the country, as well as being distributed in nearby Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, but the Jê family is its only remaining large subgroup, with other languages remaining in isolates due to extinction. Within Jê, its 16 languages are distributed in four divisions; northern, north-eastern, central, and southern, and are better preserved than other languages in the stock due to its inland-inhabiting speakers. Xavante is classified in the central, alongside Xerente, Xaxriaba, and Akroa. The stock is marked by a large presence of [[nasal vowels]], this also being marked in the proto- Jê reconstructed language. [[Consonant]] inventories of the Macro-Ge stock are of medium size, with Xavante historically undergoing a phonological change from velar consonants to [[glottal stops]]. All are mildly synthetic, without complex [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and have SV constituent orders.

===Ethnographies===
The Xavante people have been studied in [[ethnographies]]; in 2010 and 2011, demographic information and ethnographic details were researched for the context of health among the Xavante by Basta, and [[tuberculosis]] specifically being examined alongside ethnographic information by DeSouza. Contemporary Xavante research by Lecena and colleagues in 2016 and Da Silva in 1999 has also investigated inactivity and [[socioeconomic status]] in the region and general information regarding the ways that Xavante people were living in the late 20th and early 21st century.

===Xavante in Linguistics===
The Xavante language was first referenced in the 19th century, in works of comparative philology which used word lists from the language and overviews of its structure.&lt;ref name="Latham"&gt;{{cite book|last =Latham|first =R.G.|title=Elements of Comparative Philology|date=1862|publisher=Walton and Maberly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="von Martius"&gt;{{cite book|last =Von Martius|first =C.F.P.|title=Wörtersammlung Brasilianischer Sprachen|date=1867|publisher=Friedrich Fleischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, Xavante has been studied academically since the 1960s by both Brazilian and foreign linguists, starting with a grammar;&lt;ref name= "MD"&gt;{{cite journal|last =McLeod|first =R.|title=Xavante grammar|journal=Arquivo Lingüístico|volume=97|date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; papers from this period examined the language’s phonemes,&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;{{cite journal|last =McLeod|first =R.|title=Fonemas Xavante|journal=Serie Linguistica|volume=3|date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; syllable structure,&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=E.|title=Duas análises das sílabas do xavánte|date=1971|publisher=Lingüístico de Verão}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as aspect and acquisition.&lt;ref name="MA"&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=R.|last2=Mitchell|first2=V.|title=Aspectos da língua Xavante|date=1977|publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, works on the syntax and semantics of Xavante were published, focusing on sentence initial devices&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimes|first=J.E.|title=Sentence initial devices|journal=Summer Institute of Linguistics Publications in Linguistics|volume=75|pages=233|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus;&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=E.|chapter= Focus and topic in Xavante|title=Sentence Initial Devices|date=1986|publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Xavante-Portuguese dictionary was also produced by Hall, McLeod, and Mitchell, all of whom had researched extensively in Xavante (1987). Since the 1990s, more specific properties of the language have been researched academically, namely with respect to acquisition,&lt;ref name="HA"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Harrison|first =A.|title=Language learning tips|journal=Notes on Linguistics|volume=50|pages=9–10|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite book|last =McLeod|first=R.|title=Learning Xavante monolingually|publisher=LinguaLinks Library|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; name agreement,&lt;ref name="dos Santos"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=dos Santos|first=J.P.|title= Marcas pessoais, concordância de número e alinhamento em Xavánte|date=2008|institution=Universidade de Brasilia}}&lt;/ref&gt; assimilation,&lt;ref name="Quintino"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quintino|first =W.|chapter=Assimilação dos traços Voz e Nas em posição de coda em Xavánte|title=Línguas Macro-Jê.

==Phonology==
The [[phonology]] of Xavante is described by McLeod (1974).

===Vowels===
Xavante has nine vowel qualities, long and short. Four occur [[nasalized]], long and short. 
{| class="wikitable"
! || [[Front vowel|Front]] || [[Central vowel|Central]] || [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- style="text-align: center;"
! [[High vowel|High]]
| {{IPA|i}}, {{IPA|ĩ}} || {{IPA|ɨ}} || {{IPA|u}}
|- style="text-align: center;"
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|e}} || {{IPA|ə}} || {{IPA|o}}
|- style="text-align: center;"
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
| {{IPA|ɛ}}, {{IPA|ɛ̃}} || {{IPA|a}}, {{IPA|ã}} || {{IPA|ɔ}}, {{IPA|ɔ̃}}
|}

{{IPA|/i/}} is {{IPA|[iː]}} when long and {{IPA|[ɪ]}} when short. {{IPA|/e/}} is raised after {{IPA|/r/}} in a non-initial syllable. {{IPA|/a/}} is a central vowel. It is a rounded {{IPA|[ɐ̹]}} in certain stylistic conventions. {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is a mid vowel {{IPA|[ɔ̝ː]}} when long, and a more open {{IPA|[ɔ]}} when short. {{IPA|/u/}} is {{IPA|[uː]}} when long and {{IPA|[u]}} or {{IPA|[ʊ]}} when short. {{IPA|/o/, /ɨ/,}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} do not vary much. {{IPA|/ə/}} is written {{angle bracket|ë}} in the orthography.

===Consonants===
Xavante has ten consonants, {{IPA|/p t c ʔ b d j r w h/}}. They are realized as,
{| border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="wikitable"
! rowspan=2 colspan="2"|
! rowspan=2|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]

! rowspan="2"| [[Obstruent]]s
! &lt;small&gt;[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiceless]]&lt;/small&gt;
|{{IPA|pʰ}}
|{{IPA|tʰ}}
|{{IPA|s ~ tʃʰ}}
|{{IPA|ʔ}}
|- align="center"
! &lt;small&gt;[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]]&lt;/small&gt;
|{{IPA|b ~ m}}
|{{IPA|d ~ n}}
| rowspan=2|{{IPA|z ~ dʒ ~ ɲ ~ j}}
|
|- align="center"
! colspan="2"| [[Sonorant]]s
| {{IPA|w}}
| {{IPA|ɾ}}
|{{IPA|h}}
|}

({{IPA|/j/}} varies between obstruent and sonorant, alveolar and palatal.)

Xavante is highly unusual in lacking [[velar consonant]]s, except for the [[labio-velar approximant]] {{IPA|/w/}}. At a phonemic level, it arguably also lacks [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]], which is less unusual in the Amazon. The language however has a high degree of [[allophony]], and nasal stops {{IPA|[m n ɲ]}} appear before nasal vowels.&lt;ref&gt;It can be argued either that these are nasalized allophones of the voiced obstruents, that is, that {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/mb/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/ã/}}, or that the voiced obstruents are denasalized allophones of nasal stops before oral vowels, with {{IPA|/m/}} pronounced {{IPA|[mb]}} or {{IPA|[b]}} before {{IPA|/a/}}. The key point is that nasality is determined by the vowels, not by the consonants.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allophony====
With so few phonemic contrasts, Xavante allows wide latitude in [[allophone]]s of its consonants. 
* '''P''' and '''T''': {{IPA|/p/, /t/}} are [[Aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|[pʰ], [t̪ʰ]}} as [[syllable onset]]s (at the beginning of a word, between vowels, or before /r/), and unreleased {{IPA|[p̚], [t̪̚]}} as [[syllable coda]]s (at the end of a word or before a consonant other than /r/).
* '''C''': {{IPA|/c/}} [[free variation|freely varies]] among {{IPA|[tʃʰ, tsʰ, ʃ, s]}} as an onset, and {{IPA|[t̪ʲ, ʃ]}} as a coda (only preceding another {{IPA|/c/}}, as {{IPA|[tːʃ, ʃː]}}).
* '''’''': {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}.
* '''B''': In a C or CC syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/b/}} is pronounced as a plain voiced stop {{IPA|[b]}} at the beginning of a phonological word, and as either {{IPA|[b]}} or as a [[prenasalization|prenasalized]] voiced stop {{IPA|[ᵐb}} in the middle of a word. Before nasal vowels, as C or CC, it is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}}.

:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/b/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/h/}} regardless of the following vowel's nasality, and optionally also as {{IPA|[m]}} before the oral allophones of the other voiced obstruents, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}: {{IPA|[bd, bdʒ]}} or {{IPA|[md, mdʒ]}}. It is {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|[ɲ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;All voiced obstruents are presumably nasalized before all nasal allophones, though {{IPA|[mɲ]}} is the only sequence that is attested.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''D''': In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/d/}} is pronounced either as a plain voiced stop {{IPA|[d̪]}} or as prenasalized voiced stop {{IPA|[ⁿd̪]}}. Unlike {{IPA|/b/}}, it may be prenasalized at the beginning of a phonological word, not just as a syllable onset. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced {{IPA|[n̪]}}.

:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/d/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[d̪]}} before the oral allophone of a consonant, and as {{IPA|[n̪]}} before a nasal consonant.
* '''J''': In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/j/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[dz, z, dʒ, ʒ, j]}}, in [[free variation]]. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced {{IPA|[ɲ]}}.

:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/j/}} is generally pronounced {{IPA|[j]}}, and is nasalized to {{IPA|[ȷ̃]}} or {{IPA|[ɲ]}} ''after'' a nasal vowel.&lt;ref&gt;It is not yet clear when it is {{IPA|[ȷ̃]}} and when {{IPA|[ɲ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also nasalized to {{IPA|[ȷ̃]}} before a prenasalized stop allophone. Between oral vowels, the sequence {{IPA|/jb/}} optionally takes an epenthetic {{IPA|[d]}}: {{IPA|[jb]}} or {{IPA|[jdb]}}. When {{IPA|[ɲ]}} is followed by an {{IPA|/h/}}, a nasalized [[epenthetic]] [[schwa]] separates them.
* '''R''': {{IPA|/r/}} is an [[alveolar flap]], {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, which is nasalized {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} between nasal vowels.
* '''W''': {{IPA|/w/}} is similar to English ''w,'' but [[roundedness|not rounded]] before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;ref&gt;As McLeod &amp; Mitchell (2003:11) describe it,
:''antes da letra ‘i’ é pronunciado como o ‘w’ inglês, sem arredondamento dos lábios e com um pouco de fricção. Em outros ambientes não há fricção e os lábios se arredondam mais''

:"before the letter 'i' it's pronounced as the English 'w', without rounding of the lips and with a bit of friction. In other environments it doesn't have friction and the lips are more rounded"

This would appear to mean that {{IPA|/w/}} is a more-or-less typical [[labio-velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}} in most situations, with an unrounded semi-fricative allophone, approximately {{IPA|[ɣ˕]}}, before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, though possibly a [[roundedness|labially compressed]] velar {{IPA|[β̞ɣ˕]}} in that environment.

McLeod (1974:4) had covered only the unrounded allophone:

:''O fonema /w/ é um vocóide oral assilábico, não-arredondado posterior fechado alto sonoro.''

:"The phoneme {{IPA|/w/}} is an oral semivowel, unrounded high back [and] voiced."&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''H''': {{IPA|/h/}} has no place of articulation, but is a voiceless transition between vowels.

Vowels do not become nasalized because of nasalized consonants, so the only consonants that become nasal are those in a cluster preceding a nasal vowel (and coda {{IPA|/j/}} after a nasal vowel); a preceding oral vowel blocks the nasality from spreading to preceding syllables.

===Phonotactics===
Xavante syllables are of the forms [[Consonant|C]][[Vowel|V]], CCV, CVC, CCVC, CV:, and CCV:; that is, all syllables begin with a consonant, sometimes two; they may optionally either end with a consonant or have a long vowel. Although a ''syllable'' may end in a consonant, a phonological ''word'' may not, apart from a few cases of word-final {{IPA|/j/}}.

The attested initial CC [[consonant cluster]]s are: 
:{{IPA|/pr br ʔr ʔb ʔw/}}.
All seven obstruents occur in final position, but in a maximal CCVC syllable only {{IPA|/p b j/}} are attested. Across two syllables, the following CC sequences are attested: 
:{{IPA|/pp, pt, pc, pʔ/}}
:{{IPA|/tt/}}
:{{IPA|/cc/}}
:{{IPA|/ʔʔ ʔb/}}
:{{IPA|/bb, bd, bj, br, bh/}}
:{{IPA|/dd/}}
:{{IPA|/jp, jt, jʔ, jb, jj, jw, jr, jh/}}.
There are also CCC sequences such as {{IPA|/pʔr/}} (coda {{IPA|/p/}} followed by onset {{IPA|/ʔr/}}).

The vowels {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɨ/}} are rare, and not attested in maximal CCVC syllables.

==Morphology==
In Xavante, morphological variations of words are a significant aspect of generating new constructions within the language.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; For example, morphology reflects [[honorific]] status, in that morphemes are used to denote relationships of intimacy and kinship. Similarly, social positions and situations of individuals are marked using morphological constructions; for instance, a’ama, a group of Xavante men trained in new forms of pre-existing words, are referred to by other members of the clan using a specific set of morphological forms. Xavante also uses a reflexive prefix, tsi-, in situations requiring this grammatical construction to be denoted; for instance, ʔmadə (to look at) becomes tsi-ʔmadə (to look at oneself). Finally, the postverbal morpheme ni appears when referring to a generic or unknown subject, as in ‘ma ø-wæræ ni’ (or ‘someone (unknown) killed him. Morphological changes are important in generating meaning in Xavante, and reflect the possibilities of showing meaning using set morphemes.

As previously discussed, Xavante expresses relationships between people in its morphology. This is particularly reflected in familial connections; a child must use the respectful grammatical forms when growing older in reference to their parents and grandparents, and are scolded if they do not do so (Harrison, 2001). For example, the morpheme a is added to refer to a second person singular; a boy asking his grandfather to give a favour to his grandmother is generated thus:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Ï''||'''radare''||''ãhã''||''õme''||''a-te||''sãræ -re''||''na''||''apâsi''||''da-te''||''råne''||''da''
|-
| ||1SG||gr.father.ENDR ||here||there||2.RES-LTR||put.down-DIM||IMP||later||GEN-LTR||eat||PURP 
|}
:"Grandfather, here, put this over there for (grandmother) to eat later."

Conversation between men and their father-in-laws is also marked by use of honorific grammatical variants, used by both parties. Finally, a couple that has been arranged to be married also enter a specific relationship, known as dasiwasini, and must use grammatical forms denoting respect. In all, morphological variation in Xavante is critical to displaying intimacy and closeness between people, and in marking where such a relationship exists through the way they refer to one another, with more personal relationships being denoted by special grammatical forms. Also previously discussed was the use of the post-verbal morpheme ni whe referring to unknown subjects. This is formally known as a ‘non-referential subject’, in that the subject does not refer to immediate entity in the world; for instance in saying ‘people’ as a collective instead of ‘my uncle’. This morpheme is added in both transitive and intransitive clauses, for instance when saying both ‘people love me’ and ‘people run’. Ni is also commonly used with another morpheme, da, as a person prefix referring to a generic entity; for example, to use both transitive and intransitive sentences as examples:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Ma''||''tô''||''da-siwi''||''ø-azâri''||''ni''
|-
| ||N1.PST||CERT||GEN-COLL||3-hit||NREF.S 
|}
:"People (unspecified group) collectively beat him up."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Da-'ahâ''||''na''||''te''||''ta13 -'ry'ry''||''ni''
|-
| ||GEN-a.lot||REF||N1||GEN-mourn||NREF.S|| 
|}
:"Lots of people are mourning."

In these ways, Xavante uses morphological variation to express concepts relating to abstract individuals that exist in a different way than concrete, specific people. By extension, the language uses morphology in general to conceptualize a variety of concepts, including closeness in relationships as well as personal prefixes.

==Syntax==

===Case===

The [[syntax]] of Xavante utilizes several types of case markings in its structures, marking the intransitive subject (S), transitive subject or agent (A), and transitive object or patient (O) in different ways.&lt;ref name="Dias de Oliveira Santos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dias de Oliveira Santos|first=V.|date=2008|title=Languages of the World and Their Case Marking|publisher=Belo Horizonte Faculdade de Letras da UFMG.}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, it distinguishes between a number marking system and a person marking system, with both containing several subsystems. The former uses a neutral subsystem when arguments fulfill certain criteria. It also includes a Nominative-Accusative subsystem when the (O) of a transitive argument falls under a specified category. Finally, the person marking system of Xavante is notable for having multiple subsystems. As a consequence, examining these case systems is vital to understanding the syntax of Xavante.

Xavante’s case systems emphasise the lexicalization of number systems. Particles in the language depend on whether it is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person; whether the referent is in the subject, object, possessor, or complement position; and if the predicate is a noun (nominal) or a verb (verbal). Xavante also uses a singular, dual, and plural, and the number of the referent also dictate which number particle will be used. Within this number marking system, verbal clauses use a neutral marking subsystem, in which the marking of (A), (S), and (O) is identical whenever these arguments are singular or when (O) is definite and all three arguments are non-singular. A neutral system is marked for having the three arguments marked identically, and is common across languages. In Xavante, this situation is referred to as neutral because, in the first case, none of the three core arguments get marked, and in the second all get the same marking. An example is seen here:

The number system in Xavante also contains a nominative-accusative subsystem, found when (O) is non-singular and indefinite, when (O) is 1st person dual, or (O) is 2nd person dual and (A) 1st person plural simultaneously. A nominative-accusative system is marked when (S) and (A) are treated equally, while (O) differs, with the first two obtaining nominative marking and the third getting accusative. In Xavante, the nominative-accusative subsystem most commonly marks (O) for number while the other two do not get marking, although the reverse is also true. This is seen in the following example:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''∅''||''te''||''ti-ʔaʔa''||''dzahu:re''

A nominative-accusative system is marked when (S) and (A) are treated equally, while (O) differs, with the first two obtaining nominative marking and the third getting accusative. In Xavante, the nominative-accusative subsystem most commonly marks (O) for number while the other two do not get marking, although the reverse is also true. This is seen in the following example:

|-
| ||3||ERG||3-make-NZR||DUAL||basket||EMP
|}
:"It was made by both of them, the basket."

Xavante also uses a person-marking system, in which subjects and objects are marked differently depending on a number of criteria. The absolutive series marks both intransitive subjects and transitive objects; the accusative series marks 1st person dual, plural object, 3rd person singular, or dual or plural object when the subject is 2nd person singular, dual, or plural; the nominative series marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive clauses; and am emphatic series that marks pronouns to form emphatic pronominal expressions with both transitive and intransitive clauses. The person-marking system has more subsystems that the number one, with three variations of ergative-absolutive case markings. Ergative-Absolutive is marked as (S) and (O) being equal, with (A) being different, and the first two being assigned as ergative and the third assigned as absolutive. In Xavante, Ergative-Absolutive I uses cross-referencing on (S) and (O) only, with (A) receiving no marking. Ergative-Absolutive II is marked when (O) is in 3rd person indefinite and (A) is 2nd person plural. Ergative-Absolutive III is marked with the use of a particle or adposition after the noun, with (A) receiving a mark and (S) and (O) not receiving one, and is only used relative and subordinate transitive clauses or negated independent transitive clauses:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔwa''||''∅''||''ʔwa - ʔaʔa''||''dĩ''

|-
| ||1||POT||2-bite-NZR||DUAL
|}
:"We both bit you."

Xavante’s person marking system also contains a tripartite subsystem, in which (A), (S), and (O) are all treated differently. In Xavante, this specifically occurs as all arguments receiving different arguments from the different series previously discussed. This is seen here:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔwa''||''∅''||''ʔi:-wawa''||''∅''
|-
| ||1||POT||1-cry||sing
|}
:"I cry."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''∅''||''bã''||''te''||''ʔiwa – tsa''
|-
| ||2||PERF||POT||1-        bite
|}
:"We both hit you."

Xavante’s person-marking system also has a variation of a Nominative-Accusative system, in which (S) and (A) are marked differently from (O)

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔwa''||''∅''||''ʔi:-wawa''||''∅''
|-
| ||1||POT||1-cry||sing
|}
:"I cry."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''∅''||''bã''||''te''||''ʔiwa – tsa''
|-
| ||2||PERF||POT||1-        bite||
|}
:"We both hit you."

Finally, Xavante has two Split subsystems; the first, Split-S, is found in the subjects of nominal predicates. The second, Split-O, occurs in relative clauses. Overall, the person marking system in Xavante contains multiple subsystems depending on the situations in which they appear.

In all, Xavante uses a number of case marking systems in its clauses, varying based on number and person markings. It provides examples of a neutral system, Nominative-Accusative subsystems, Ergative-Absolutive subsystems, and split subsystems, varying based on different triggers.

==Semantics==

===Plurals===

In the Xavante language, [[plurals]] as well as [[duals]] are used to mark arguments in a clause.&lt;ref name="Dias de Oliveira Santos" /&gt;  The language differentiates between singular nouns and dual, of which there is a quantity of two, and plural, in which the argument contains more than two items. These are expressed using morphological methods, including units that are used in a variety of contexts, including in different combinations. These markings appear to be used particularly for human subjects, and overall are vital to the structure of a clause in Xavante.

Dual arguments in Xavante, particularly those referring to people, use one of several possible morphological units. In order to describe a pair of human arguments, it is first important to distinguish between the first, second, and third person. For using the dual in the first person as a subject, such as in ‘We both’, the morpheme ʔwa is used in the beginning of the [[clause]], with dĩ at the end of the clause; in combination they produce the first person dual. This is seen here:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔwa''||''∅''||''ʔa-tsa-ri''||''dĩ''
|-
| ||1||POT||2-bite-NZR||DUAL
|}
:"We both bite you."

When using the dual first person as an object, however, a different morpheme, ʔĩwa, is attached to the main verb, for instance as here:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''∅''||''bã''||''te''||''ʔĩwa – tsa'' 
|-
| ||2||PERF||POT||   1-       bite|| 
|}
:"You bit both of us."

When using the dual in the second person, for instance in saying ‘You both’, reduplication is used to denote optionality in the clause. In the first case, when ‘both’ is implied, ʔwa alone is used at the end of the clause, with the reduplicated ʔwaʔwa occurring earlier as follows:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔwa''||''dõrĩ''||''ʔwaʔwa''||''hã''||''bĩtsi''||''peʔa''||''∅''||''te''||''ʔĭ - rẽ - dĕ''||''ʔwa''
|-
| ||2||SN||DUAL||EMP||one||fish||2||POT||3 – eat – NZR||DUAL
|}
:"You (both) eat one fish."

However, when the dual is not optional in the clause, only the reduplicated ʔwaʔwa occurs, at the end of the clause, as here:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''∅''||''te''||''ʔai - wawa - j''||''ʔwaːʔwa''
|-
| ||2||POT||2 -   cry -    NZR||DUAL
|}
:"You are both crying."

Finally, third person dual is also denoted similarly depending on whether the argument is in the subject or object position. For the former, the morpheme dzahurɛ is placed clause-finally, and denotes ‘They both’, as seen here:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔõ''||''dõrĩ''||''ʔi-ts-i-       oto''||''dzahurɛ'' 
|-
| ||3||NS||3-R-MED-bent||DUAL
|}
:"They are both bent."

However, when the third person dual is in the object position, the same morpheme, dzahurɛ, is also used, as in the following example:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔõ''||''dõrĩ''||''hã''||''∅''||''te''||''dza''||''∅- ʔatsabrõ''||''dzahurɛ''
|-
| ||3||NS||EMP||3||POT||PROJ||3-run||DUAL
|}
:"Both of them will run."

In all, the dual marks all arguments in Xavante, and differentiates between first, second, and third person in subject and object positions.

Plurals in Xavante, in which more than two arguments are described, is expressed using its own variations of morphemes. In the first person and third person, dzaʔra is used clause-finally, as here:

 {|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔwa''||''dõrĩ''||''ʔiwa - dz -      ĩ - oto''||''dzaʔra''
|-
| ||1||NS||1-   R||MED- bent||PLURAL
|}
:"We are all bent."

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔõ''||''dõrĩ''||''ʔi-ts-i-       oto''||''dzaʔra'' 
| ||3||NS||3-R-MED- bent||PLURAL
|}
:"They are all bent."

However, the second person plural is expressed differently, with the previous morpheme, dzaʔra, being combined with ʔwaʔwa in two positions, clause-medially after the initial person marker and clause-finally, as here:

{|border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''ʔa''||''dõrĩ''||''ʔwaʔwa''||''ʔaj -rare''||''dzaʔra''||''ʔwaʔwa''
|-
| ||2||NS||DUAL||2-   small||PLURAL||DUAL
|}
:"They are all small."

In all, the plural in Xavante is expressed with less variation than in the dual, but nonetheless is always important to marking quantity of human subjects in the first, second, and third person.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[extremophile|extremophilic]] organism that can grow and reproduce in conditions with a low availability of water, also known as [[water activity]]. Water activity (a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured as the humidity above a substance relative to the humidity above pure water (Aw = 1.0). Xerophiles are "xerotolerant", meaning tolerant of dry conditions. They often can survive in environments with [[water activity]] below 0.8. Typically xerotolerance is used with respect to matric drying, where a substance has a low water concentration.  These environments include arid desert soils.  The term [[osmotolerance]] is typically applied to organisms that can grow in solutions with high solute concentrations (salts, sugars), such as [[halophiles]].

The common [[Food preservation#Drying|food preservation]] method of reducing water activities may not prevent the growth of xerophilic organisms, often resulting in food spoilage. Some [[mold]] and [[yeast]] species are xerophilic. Mold growth on bread is an example of food spoilage by xerophilic organisms.

Examples of xerophiles include ''[[Trichosporonoides nigrescens]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
