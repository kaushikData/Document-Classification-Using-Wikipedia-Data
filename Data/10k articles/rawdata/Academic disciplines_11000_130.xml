      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10888">'''African Consensus''' is an [[Economics|economic]] [[paradigm]] proposed in 2011 for [[sustainable development]] in [[Africa]]. It is built on practical experiences across the African continent together with shared experiences from other regions facing similar challenges. It merges existing efforts of [[civil society]] in such areas as [[renewable energy]], community finance and empowerment, [[Organic farming|organic agriculture]] and [[water resource management]], [[Environmental protection|environmental]] and [[endangered species]] protection. It couples these with the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] experiences of business and finance in an attempt to scale these efforts into viable [[economic model]]s. Seeking a pragmatic path for development, it emphasizes the importance of heritage, cultural and identity protection with the need for economic advancement.&lt;ref name="Rio20"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFRICA CONSENSUS STATEMENT TO RIO+20 |url=http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |website=The Africa Regional Preparatory Conference for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) |publisher=The New Partnership For Africa's Development |accessdate=15 November 2014 |location=Addis Ababa, Ethiopia |date=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127144827/http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the misspelling is embedded in the document filename only--&gt;

==African Consensus Forum==
The African Consensus Forum is proposed as an annual event, chaired by [[Tanzania]]'s president [[Jakaya Kikwete]], to convene stakeholders from civil society, government, business and finance. It is intended to address major challenges of development and present a range of concrete experiences, as well as to outline practical solutions that are economically viable and scalable. The annual meeting will initially be held in [[Dar Es Salaam]] with plans for breakout meetings alternating in the five regional zones during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forum Charter|url=http://africanconsensus.org/foundation-documents/forum-charter/|website=African Consensus|publisher=African Consensus Forum|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center==
The African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center is an anticipated outcome of the Africa Consensus Forum to address crises of violence, which may arise over allocation of resources and resource benefits. African Consensus Forum will seek to anticipate crisis situations and offer a [[Track II diplomacy|second track dialogue process]] toward economic solutions to prevent crisis. The center's work will be hosted by the secretariat. It should coordinate efforts with those initiatives ongoing in the [[African Union]], and other initiatives active on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onuoha|first1=B|title=Power, conflict and consensus building in Africa: Ideology revisited|journal=African Journal on Conflict Resolution|date=2011|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajcr/article/view/69829|accessdate=15 November 2014|issn=1562-6997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The African Consensus concept emerged during the 2011 [[World Social Forum]] held in [[Dakar]], Senegal. Drafting of the African Consensus Resolution was undertaken by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] leaders working throughout the event (late January and throughout February 2011). Key spokespersons of the process were West African celebrity rapper [[Didier Awadi]] who is known for his outspoken activism, and Alioune Tine who has been a peace mediator in both [[Darfur]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. Leaders of the African branch of the World Social Forum were also deeply involved in the process.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"&gt;{{cite web|title=African Consensus Resolution|url=http://www.himalayanconsensus.org/african+resolution|website=Action for Ethnic Diversity and Cultural Sustainable Development|publisher=Himalayan Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurence Brahm]] was invited by these activists to help articulate the concepts and draft the original African Consensus Declaration that was tabled before the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) NGO Forum two months later. The African Consensus Declaration was adopted by the ACHPR Forum in [[Gambia]], in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|url=http://www.achpr.org|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] picked up on the ideas in the declaration and held a drafting session in October 2011 to draft a document called "African Consensus Statement to Rio+20". It was presented at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20) during the conference summer 2012, incorporating the vision into the ideas of inclusive sustainability promoted by the UN system. The two documents – ''African Consensus Declaration'' and the ''African Consensus Statement to Rio+20''&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt; – underpin the economic paradigm by building a body of internationally recognized documentation.

In summer 2014, Tanzania's president Jakaya Kikwete summoned Laurence Brahm (the original drafter of the African Consensus Declaration) together with John Masuka (Tanzania's "father of inclusive finance") to the northern State House in [[Dodoma]]. There President Kikwete explained his own intention to convene the African Consensus Forum as a multi-stakeholder process between civil society, business-finance and government. Kikwete was one of the original conveners of the Helsinki Process, in his previous role as Tanzania's foreign minister. The [[Helsinki Process on Globalisation and Democracy]] calls for multi-stakeholder participation in resolving political and leadership challenges. By convening the African Consensus Forum as an extension of the Helsinki Process, Kikwete extended that process from the realm of governance to economics. The Uongozi Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UONGOZI Institute|url=http://www.uongozi.or.tz/|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leadership organization that is an outcome of the original Helsinki Process, is the body where the African Consensus Institute is to be located. Expectations are for the African Consensus to convene each year in early December.

There is increasing recognition of the notion that Africa must have its own unique economic development paradigm created by Africans themselves. The view has increasingly shifted from the NGO and civil society networks to the mainstream. Books such as ''African Consensus'' by [[Ludger Kühnhardt]], published in 2014, and articles by Kwame Marfo in ''Neo-African Consensus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MARFO|first1=KWAME|title=DEAR GOD: Why are we so poor?|url=http://neoafricanconsensus.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/dear-god-why-are-we-so-poor/|website=Neo-African Consensus|publisher=Neo-African Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Towards a just and sustainable world'' by CIDSE further attest to a global paradigm shift in the development narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nnaemeka|first1=Abonyi Nichodemus|title=Towards an Alternative Development Paradigm for Africa|journal=J Soc Sci|date=2009|volume=21|issue=1|pages=39–48|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-21-0-000-09-Web/JSS-21-1-000-09-Abst-PDF/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N-Tt.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core principles and rights==
The African Consensus economic paradigm is based on three core principles:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#Protect [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]], [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous identity]], endangered species and environment; 
#Through community empowerment involving local financing for sustainable and [[socially responsible business]]es; 
#Prioritizing environmental protection and community advancement.

African Consensus seeks to protect three core [[rights]]:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#The right to ethnic diversity 
#The right to culturally sustainable development 
#The right to water, food security and the protection of our natural environment.

African Consensus can be a framework for preventing [[violence]] and [[terrorism]], which are often rooted in both economic and social marginalization of people from different identity groups.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;

==Core theme==
It is proposed that African Consensus will be built upon the pan-African visions articulated by Mwalimu [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shivji|first1=Issa G|title=Nyerere, nationalism and Pan-Africanism|url=http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category/features/71793|website=Pambazuka News|publisher=Fahamu|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the global context the challenges of [[global warming|climate change]] and [[Resource depletion|diminishing resources]] as they relate to [[Developing country|developing countries]]. It is intended that it will adopt the multi-stakeholder approach of the Helsinki Process, and hopefully extending that process from politics and governance into the realms of economics, business and finance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Foundation documents==
African Consensus is established as an economic paradigm based on two documents:
#''The African Consensus Declaration'' adopted by the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights NGO Forum convened in Banjul, Gambia, April 2011{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
#''The African Consensus Statement to Rio+20'' submitted by the Economic Commission on Africa jointly with the African Union, African Development Bank, UN ECOSOC, UNDEP and UNEP to the Rio+20 conference in Brazil, July 2012.&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt;

On the basis of these two documents African Consensus is intended to evolve during future African Consensus Forum meetings where stakeholders in the African continent – from civil society, business, finance, and government – will convene each year, with regional break-out meetings throughout the year, to define and articulate the aspirations and pathways to African development based on pragmatism, and experiences shared between stakeholders.

The African Consensus Forum "Green-print" will be the annual outcome document of each African Consensus Forum to serve as a [[green growth]] blueprint of development and a continuing reference of best practices articulated by the stakeholders each year.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20418">After nearly a century of endeavour and negotiation which had been led by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], a statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]] was formed under the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]. For the purposes of constituting the Board of Architectural Education the Act included a list of [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]] in the United Kingdom. The statutory Board was abolished in the 1990s, and when the [[Architects Act 1997]] repealed the 1931 Act the statutory list of Schools of Architecture went with it.

The 1931 Act had come to be passed at the end of a century of development in educational provision and in the method of qualifying by examination. The 1997 Act was passed in the period after the [[United Kingdom]] had become one of the Member States of the [[European Economic Community]], later named the [[European Union]], an organization which, among other things, has required Member States to remove obstacles to the freedom of movement and establishment in respect of professional practice, employment, trade and business within the territories of the Union.

The method of qualifying by passing an examination which the RIBA had recognized as allowing exemption continued in the period when the 1931 Act was in force, and remained available under the later legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx  RIBA Charter and Byelaws]&lt;/ref&gt;

By a further development, from 2007 a Chartered Member of the RIBA may apply for the registration of a Chartered Practice in respect of a business providing architectural services and comprising one or more Chartered Members meeting criteria for, and operating in accordance with, a prescribed scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx  RIBA Chartered Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

The historian will find some source material in the Archive which the RIBA has made accessible at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/vam-riba-collections administrative archive of RIBA at V&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; and in books, periodicals and other publications of the period which have been deposited and retained in the [[British Architectural Library]] (of the RIBA).&lt;ref&gt;[[British Architectural Library]] (of the RIBA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Mace and Robert Thorne ''The Royal Institute of British Architects: a guide to its archive and history'', Mansell Pub.,1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another contemporaneous source of information, upon which the following is largely based, is provided by two editions of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh]] of 1910&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourteenth of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|fourteenth]]&lt;/ref&gt; These editions contain articles which conveniently indicate how [[Test (assessment)|examination]], as a method of gaining recognition for the attainment of the specialist knowledge and skill required of a professional practitioner, had grown and had been thought of in the period leading up to the passing of the 1931 Act.

==19c Background==

The background to the developments in education and the method of attaining professional qualification had been the unprecedented development of industrial and commercial activity in the United Kingdom and other countries in the course of the nineteenth century. This, and the impact on the working and living conditions of the populations affected, had been making demands for the building of factories, warehouses, offices, educational establishments, hospitals, housing, places of recreation and entertainment and places for religious and other purposes. With that came demands upon architectural practitioners for designs for buildings of all kinds, qualities and standards, for the supervision of the construction of works, and in some cases for making planning schemes for area development or redevelopment, of greater or lesser extent; sometimes collaborating with other branches of the construction professions, notably [[Surveying|surveyors]], [[civil engineers]] and, as the period progressed, [[structural engineering|structural engineers]], and those engaged in
[[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The demand for architectural services, in respect of both traditional and newer materials and techniques, was coming from public bodies, commercial and industrial enterprises, private owners or investors, philanthropists, benefactors and others.
&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Town Extension Plan|The Town Extension Plan]], 1912 Warburton lecture, delivered by [[Raymond Unwin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional arrangements : RIBA==

As a result, institutional arrangements for architectural education became increasingly systematic, in respect of examinations for formal qualifications, and making qualifications a condition for granting some other form of distinguishing style or title (such as Fellow, Associate or Licentiate of a professional body), or for the right or expectation to be able to practise as an [[architect]], on one's own account or as a partner or as an assistant in another's office.

A leading participant in the development of those institutional arrangements was the society which had been formed in London in the 1830s and had petitioned for, and in 1837 had been granted, a charter of incorporation. This society was later granted the name Royal Institute of British Architects, and is for convenience referred to as the RIBA.

==Qualifying examinations==

The index of the eleventh edition offers users very little more about architectural education than a few words in an article on Examinations generally, which was attributed in part to Paul George Konody, Art Critic of ''[[The Observer]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', formerly Editor of ''[[The Artist and Journal of Home Culture]]'', author of ''the Art of [[Walter Crane]]''; ''[[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], Life and Work''; etc. (so described at the page of Wikisource for Paul George Konody&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Author:Paul George Konody]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and in part to Arthur Watson, Secretary in the Academic Department of the [[University of London]]. It began with the paragraph:

:''The term 'examination' (i.e., inspecting, weighing and testing; from Latin ''examen'', the tongue of a balance) is used ''[in the article which followed]'' to denote a systematic test of knowledge, and of either special or general capacity or fitness, carried out under the authority of some public body.''

There followed eight sections beginning with History and ending with a critical appraisal headed ''The Object and Efficiency of Examinations, and their Indirect Effects''. The second section was on Professional Examinations, followed by others on School-leaving Examinations, mentioning the "accrediting" system in the United States started by the [[University of Michigan]] in 1871; Methods of Examination: Written, Oral, Thesis and Practical; Competitive Examinations; The Organization and Conduct of Examinations; and Marking, Classification and Errors of Detail.

==Perspective==

The section on History began as follows:

:''The oldest known system of examinations in history is that used by China for the selection of officers for the public service (c.1115 B.C.), and the periodic tests which they undergo after entry (c.2200). The abolition of this system was announced in 1906, and, as a partial substitute, it was decided to hold an annual examination in Peking of Chinese educated abroad.''

:''The majority of examinations in western countries are derived from the university examinations of the middle ages. The first universities of Europe consisted of corporations of teachers and of students analogous to the trade gilds and merchant gilds of the time. In the trade gilds there were apprentices, companions and masters. No one was admitted to mastership until he had served his apprenticeship, nor, as a rule, until he had shown that he could accomplish a piece of work to the satisfaction of the gild.''

:''The object of the universities was to teach; and to the three classes established by the gild correspond roughly to the scholar, the bachelor or pupil-teacher, and the master or doctor (two terms at first equivalent) who, having first served his apprenticeship and passed a definite technical test, had received permission to teach...''

After a survey of the development of examination practice in the universities of western Europe up to the early 20c., the next section of professional examinations began with the remark "University examinations for degrees having ceased to be used as technical tests of teaching capacity, new examinations have been devised for this purpose". For examinations in Medicine, the article referred the reader to the article on Medical Education, and this section concluded with a single paragraph headed Other Professions, stating that a system of professional examinations carried on by other professional bodies, in some cases with legal sanction, was developed in England during the nineteenth century; and, in a list of subjects described as "the most important" mentioned "architecture (Royal Institute of British Architects )", along with: [[accountancy]], [[actuary|actuarial work]], music, [[pharmacy]], [[plumbing]], [[surveying]], [[veterinary medicine]], technical subjects, e.g. [[cotton-spinning]], [[dyeing]], [[motor manufacturing]], commercial subjects, [[shorthand]] and [[engineering]] (civil, mechanical and electrical).

==As at 1929==

Publication of the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1929 happened shortly before the Board of Architectural Education was constituted under the Act of 1931. In it there was an article three pages long on Architectural Education, attributed to [[Lionel Bailey Budden]], MA, ARIBA, Associate Professor of Architecture in the [[University of Liverpool]]. The opening sentence was:

:''Underlying the system of architectural education at present established in most Western countries is the assumption that architecture is one of the fine arts, and that the prime object of the training which the architect should receive is to equip him as a creative artist in building.''

That could be compared with the words of the charter which had been granted to the RIBA in 1837, in which the purpose of the Institute was described as:

:''... for the general advancement of Civil Architecture, and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith; it being an art esteemed and encouraged in all enlightened nations, as tending greatly to promote the domestic convenience of citizens, and the public improvement and embellishment of towns and cities...''

When the present supplemental charter was granted in 1971, part of the first charter was revoked but the words quoted were retained.

In the meantime Professor Budden's article of 1929 included the following:

:''... it is generally agreed that the study of architecture should be preceded by a [[liberal education]]. As one of the fine arts, historically associated with the arts of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], and as the background of [[civilized society]], it demands both for its practice and its appreciation some measure of general culture. The tendency today'' [1929] ''is, therefore, for schools of architecture in Europe, the [[British Empire]] and [[United States|America]] to require from candidates for admission evidence of a broad non-technical education... Today architectural education in all countries is in the hands of practising teachers. Direct connection between the instruction given in the school and the experience of actual practice is thereby assured ...''

The article then considered: [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Other European Countries, United States, and [[Mexico]]. It mentioned that the largest school of architecture in England was that of the [[Architectural Association]] (London) and the next that of Liverpool University, and explained the part played by the RIBA:

:''From its foundation in 1835 the Royal Institute of British Architects has been the supreme controlling authority of the profession throughout the empire. At no time, however, has the RIBA itself undertaken the teaching of architecture. But by setting up, in the latter half of the last century [19c.], a centralized system of examinations when no professional tests existed in the country, it performed a notable service in raising the general level of professional knowledge. Through its board of architectural education it has now delegated to certain approved schools the task of qualifying candidates for admission to the institute, only maintaining its own centralized examinations for students not seeking entry through scholastic channels.''

Schools of architecture which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA final examination (except in the subject of "Professional Practice") were named as:

:''[[Robert Gordon's College]]s, Aberdeen; [[Edinburgh College of Art]]; [[Royal College of Science and Technology|Royal Technical College, Glasgow]]; University of Liverpool; Architectural Association, London; [[University of London]]; [[University of Manchester]]; [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]]; and the [[University of Sydney]].''

Schools in certain institutions which were then recognized for exemption from the RIBA intermediate examination were named as:

:''[[Birmingham School of Art|School of Art, Birmingham]]; [[Royal West of England Academy]], Bristol; [[University of Cambridge]]; [[Bute Building|Technical College, Cardiff]]; [[Leeds College of Art]]s; [[Leicester College of Arts and Crafts]]; [[University of North London|Northern Polytechnic]], London; [[Colleges of Durham University#Colleges in Newcastle|Armstrong College]], [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]]; [[University of Sheffield]]; [[Birmingham School of Art|Municipal School of Arts and Crafts]], [[Southend-on-Sea]]; [[University of Toronto]]; and [[Sir J. J. School of Art]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]].''

It was mentioned that in both classes the maintenance of the requisite standard was assured by the periodic inspection of the visiting board, appointed by the RIBA board of architectural education, which reported to the institute on the work of the various schools granted or applying for exemption.

The system continued after the statutory Board of Architectural Education had been constituted, in connection with the provision in the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 making it the duty of the Board to recommend "the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board, to qualify persons for registration" under the Act (subsection 5(2)(a)).

Consonant with Professor Budden's remarks at that time, the objects of the RIBA are declared in its charter to be:

:''The advancement of architecture and the promotion of the acquirement of the knowledge of the [[Arts]] and [[Sciences]] connected therewith'';

and the next paragraph in the charter expresses the power of the RIBA to grant [[diplomas]], [[Academic certificate|certificates]] or other forms of recognition.

==Later developments==

The former division of the membership of the RIBA into the two classes of Fellows and Associates ceased under the supplemental charter and byelaws of 1971, but the method of qualifying by passing an examination which the RIBA has recognized as allowing exemption remains available. To be eligible for election to the now undivided class of Chartered Members a candidate is still required to have undertaken courses of study and passed examinations which have been prescribed or recognized by the Council, or to be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council having had a proper training in architecture.

As the field in which architecture is practised has continued to change, so has the RIBA Chartered Membership been keeping pace. In recent years a [[Byelaw]] was introduced to the effect that practising members are responsible for undertaking continuing professional development, defined in the Byelaws as:

:''The systematic improvement and broadening of knowledge and skill and the development of personal qualities necessary for the execution of professional and technical duties in the course of a Chartered Member's working life.''

A further and more recent development has been the passing of a Byelaw allowing a Chartered Member to apply for the registration of a Chartered Practice, defined in the Byelaws as:

:''a formally-established business providing architectural services and comprising one or more Chartered Members which meets criteria for, and operates in accordance with, a scheme prescribed by the Council, or a board to which the Council has devolved responsibility.''

==Further information==

Professor Budden's article in the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1929) was published shortly before the passing of the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 of the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]]. His School, Liverpool, was one of those listed in the Act for the purpose of constituting the statutory [[Board of Architectural Education]]. When he contributed the article he was Associate Professor in Architecture in the Liverpool University School of Architecture, becoming Roscoe Professor from 1933. He retired in 1952. He had entered the School in 1905, graduated BA in 1909 and MA in 1910, teaching there from 1911 and becoming Associate Professor in 1924. He had been University of Liverpool travelling Scholar in Architecture in 1909, and a student at the British School at Athens 1909-1912. He was first an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA), later becoming a Fellow (FRIBA). His architectural work included extensions to Liverpool University Students’ Union.

For further details of the development, in that period, of the policy of the RIBA for architectural education and qualification see  'Statutory Registration – chronology of key events' in [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]], and for opposition to the system of registration which was proposed and promoted by successive Bills in Parliament see [[William H. White (architect)|William H. White]],  [[Thomas Graham Jackson]]  and [[John Alfred Gotch]].

'''Arte Povera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈarte ˈpɔːvera|pron}}; literally ''poor art'') is a [[contemporary art]] movement. The Arte Povera movement took place between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s in major cities throughout Italy and above all in [[Turin]]. Other cities where the movement was also important are [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Naples]] and [[Bologna]]. The term was coined by Italian art critic [[Germano Celant]] in 1967&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=J.U-S.|title=Arte Povera’s radical simplicity|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/10/post-war-art|work=[[The Economist]]|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in [[Italy]] during the period of upheaval at the end of the 1960s, when artists were taking a [[Political radicalism|radical]] stance.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Arte Povera|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10454|work=MoMA: The Collection|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists began attacking the values of established institutions of government, industry, and culture.

The exhibition "Im Spazio" (The Space of Thoughts), curated by Celant and held at the Galleria La Bertesca in Genoa, Italy, from September through October 1967, is often considered to be the official starting point of Arte Povera.&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt; Celant, who became one of Arte Povera's major proponents, organized two exhibitions in 1967 and 1968, followed by an influential book published by Electa in 1985 called ''Arte Povera Storie e protagonisti/Arte Povera. Histories and Protagonists'', promoting the notion of a revolutionary art, free of convention, the power of structure, and the market place.

Although Celant attempted to encompass the radical elements of the entire international scene, the term properly centered on a group of Italian artists who attacked the corporate mentality with an art of unconventional materials and style. Key figures closely associated with the movement are [[Giovanni Anselmo]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Enrico Castellani]], [[Pier Paolo Calzolari]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Marisa Merz]], [[Giulio Paolini]], [[Pino Pascali]], [[Giuseppe Penone]],  [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Emilio Prini]], and [[Gilberto Zorio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christov-Bakargiev|first=Carolyn|title=Arte Povera|year=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-4556-6|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often used [[found object]]s in their works. Other early exponents of radical change in the visual arts include proto Arte Povera artists: [[Antoni Tàpies]] and the [[Dau al Set]] movement, [[Alberto Burri]], [[Piero Manzoni]], and [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Spatialism]]. Art dealer [[Ileana Sonnabend]] was a champion of the movement.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;

==Trends and concepts==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
* A return to simple objects and messages
* The body and behavior are art
* The everyday becomes meaningful
* Traces of nature and industry appear
* Dynamism and energy are embodied in the work
* Nature can be documented in its physical and chemical transformation
* Explore the notion of space and language
* Complex and symbolic signs lose meaning
* Ground Zero, no culture, no art system, Art = Life

==Artists==
[[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] began painting on mirrors in 1962, connecting painting with the constantly changing realities in which the work finds itself. In the later 1960s he began bringing together rags with casts of omnipresent classical statuary of Italy to break down the hierarchies of "art" and common things. An art of impoverished materials is certainly one aspect of the definition of ''Arte Povera''. In his 1967 ''Muretto di straci'' (''Rag Wall'') Pistoletto makes an exotic and opulent tapestry wrapping common bricks in discarded scraps of fabric.

[[Jannis Kounellis]] and [[Mario Merz]] attempted to make the experience of art more immediately real while also more closely connecting the individual to nature. In his ''(Untitled /Twelve Horses)'', Kounellis brings the real, natural life into the gallery setting, by showing twelve horses racked-up on the gallery walls. Recalling the [[Dada]] movement and [[Marcel Duchamp]], his aim was to challenge what could be defined as art, but unlike Duchamp, maintains the objects real and alive, redefining the notion of life and art, while keeping both entities independent.{{Quote | text=The 'reality effect' is not secondary but constitutive.(...)Kounellis shifts the frontier of what can be defined as art, but there is never the idea that art should be dissolved into life. On the contrary, art is given a new message as a rite of initiation through which to re-experience life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumley|first=Robert|title=Movements in Modern Art, Povera Arte|year=2004|publisher=Tate|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Piero Gilardi]], much like the aim of Arte Povera itself, was concerned with bridging the natural and the artificial. In his ''(Nature Carpets)'', 1965, which gained him recognition and assimilation into the Arte Povera movement, Gilardi built three-dimensional carpets out of [[polyurethane]] which used "natural" leaves, rocks, and soil as decoration, design and art meshed together to question societal sensibilities towards what is real and natural and how artificiality was being engrained into the contemporary commercialized world.

'''''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''''' ('''''A&amp;G''''') is a [[scientific journal]] and [[trade magazine]] published on behalf of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (RAS) by [[Oxford University Press]]. It publishes a mixture of content of interest to [[astronomers]] and [[geophysicists]]: news reports, interviews, topical reviews, historical investigations, obituaries, meeting reports and updates on the activities of the RAS. Full-length articles are [[peer reviewed]].

A&amp;G was formed in 1997 as a 'glossy' replacement for the ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'' (QJRAS; 1960–1996); it continues the same volume numbering from QJRAS. Since it’s inception and as of 2018 the editor is Sue Bowler of the [[University of Leeds]].

==Scope==
The journal covers [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], [[cosmology]], [[planetary science]], solar-terrestrial physics, global and regional [[geophysics]], and the [[history of astronomy|history]] of these subjects. It also publishes thematic articles regarding [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research, [[science policy]], news, [[editorial|opinions]], correspondence, and book and software reviews. Royal Astronomical Society communications about events and people and obituaries are also within this journal's purview.&lt;ref name = RAS-home/&gt;&lt;ref name = AG-page/&gt;&lt;ref name = wb-home/&gt;&lt;ref name = guidelines&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wiley.com/bw/submit.asp?ref=1366-8781&amp;site=1 |title = Astronomy &amp; Geophysics - Journal Information |publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |accessdate = 2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in keeping with the tradition of the ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', it publishes discussions of fundamental science and scientific debates. The journal also functions as a channel of communication between the membership, the Council, and the Society's Officers.&lt;ref name = RAS-home/&gt;&lt;ref name = AG-page/&gt;&lt;ref name = wb-home/&gt;

'''''The Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society ''''' (''Q. J. R. Astron. Soc'', {{ISSN|0035-8738}}) was published by 
the Royal Astronomical Society from September 1960 to December 1996, and was produced by [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Science]] in its later period. During that time 37 volumes were issued. The journal included articles reviewing modern astronomy or geophysics, discussions about research topics, meeting reports, contributions about the history of science, and reports of astronomical research groups and institutes. It gave less emphasis to detailed scientific research papers, which instead were published in the society's [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|Monthly Notices]].

Before 1960 the Royal Astronomical Society had published proceedings of its activities in its ''Monthly Notices'' alongside research papers, and published research reviews in its ''Occasional Notes''. The ''Quarterly Journal'' was established in 1960 to free the ''Monthly Notices'' to concentrate on original research, and the ''Occasional Notes'' were discontinued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6587">[[Image:Bembine Table of Isis.png|thumb|300px|right|The '''Bembine Table of Isis'''.]]
The '''Bembine Tablet''', the '''Bembine Table of Isis''' or the '''''Mensa Isiaca''''' ('''Isiac Tablet''') is an elaborate tablet of bronze with enamel and silver inlay, most probably of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin but imitating the [[ancient Egypt]]ian style. It was named in the [[Renaissance]] after [[Cardinal Bembo]], a celebrated antiquarian who acquired it after the 1527 [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]]. Thereafter it was used by antiquarians to penetrate the meaning of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], which were not authentically deciphered [[Jean-François Champollion|until the 19th century]]. Owing to these prior misconceptions, the tablet became of importance to western esoteric traditions.

==Origin and construction==
The ''Tablet'' is now regarded as of Roman rather than Egyptian origin, dating to some time in the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.museoegizio.it/en/the-museum|title=The Museum - Museo Egizio di Torino|work=Museo Egizio di Torino|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of its subsequent history until after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]], when Cardinal Bembo acquired it from a certain locksmith or ironworker into whose hands it had fallen. After Bembo's death in 1547, the ''Tablet'' was acquired by the [[Duke of Mantua|Gonzaga rulers of Mantua]], remaining in their museum until the capture of the city in 1630 by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]'s troops. It then passed through various hands until the French conquest of Italy in 1797. [[Alexandre Lenoir]] mentioned in 1809 that it was on exhibition in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]. After Napoleon's downfall it was returned to [[Italy]] to become a central exhibit in what is now the [[Museo Egizio]] at Turin, where it has remained.&lt;ref&gt;William Bates, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/oddnotes/bembo.html The Brazen Table of Bembo &amp; Hieroglyphics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet was made of bronze with enamel and silver inlay, the figures cut very shallow and the contours of most of them delineated with thin silver wire. The bases on which the figures sat were covered with silver, later torn away, and these sections are left blank in the engraved reproduction above.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Dudley Fosbroke]], ''Encyclopædia of Antiquities''&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important example of ancient [[metallurgy]], its surface being decorated with a variety of metals including silver, gold, copper-gold alloy and various base metals. One of the metals employed is black, made by alloying copper and tin with small amounts of gold and silver, and then "pickling" it in organic [[acid]]. This black metal is possibly a variety of the "[[Corinthian bronze]]" described by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Plutarch]].

==Interpretations==
[[Image:Bembine Levi.png|thumb|right|[[Eliphas Levi]]'s key to the Bembine Tablet]]

Although the scenes are Egyptianising, they do not depict Egyptian rites. Figures are shown with non-customary attributes, making it unclear which are divinities and which kings or queens. Egyptian motifs are used without rhyme or reason. However, the central figure is recognisable as Isis, suggesting that the ''Tablet'' originated in some Roman centre of her worship.

One of the earliest scholars to study the tablet was [[Pierio Valeriano Bolzani]], who may have seen it before it became generally known after the sack of 1527. His ''Hieroglyphica sive de sacris Aegyptiorum litteris commentarii'' seems to have been composed earlier than that, although it was published much later. The work covered the whole field of the meaning of hieroglyphics, but lacked the scholarly rigour of the antiquarian Laurentius Pignorius (1571–1631), whose ''Characteres Aegyptii, hoc est Sacrorum, quibus Aegyptii utuntur, simulachrorum accurata delineatio et explicatio'' of 1608 investigates the origin of the tablet as an archaeological object. Avoiding interpretation of the meaning, the author expressed doubt as to whether the images  were at all meaningful, in which he was subsequently proven right.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Raybould, ''Emblemata: Symbolic Literature of the Renaissance'', Grollier Club, New York 2009, pp. 92–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 17th century, the [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]&lt;ref&gt; Kircher is described as "probably the supreme representative of Hermeticism within the post-Reformation Church" on p. 235 of Baigent, M. &amp; Leigh, R. ''The Elixir and The Stone'', Penguin 1997 (reprinted 2005). See also ''Athanasius Kircher: The Last Man Who Knew Eeverything'', ed. Paula Findlen, Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652) used the tablet as a primary source for developing his translations of hieroglyphics, which are now known to be incorrect. His book was the source for the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]], who, in his discourse ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'' (1658) alludes to "the figures of Isis and Osyris, and the Tutelary spirits in the Bembine Table". Seventeenth century scholars of comparative religion such as Kircher and Browne attempted to reconcile the wisdom of antiquity with Christianity, the Bembine Tablet was interpreted as a vehicle for such syncretic thought; thus Browne proposes in his discourse: 

"Though he that considereth........ the crosse erected upon a pitcher diffusing streams of water into two basins, with sprinkling branches in them, and all described upon a two-footed altar, as in the Hieroglyphicks of the brazen Table of ''Bembus'' will hardly decline all thought of Christian signality in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden1.html|title=The Garden of Cyrus: Chapter I|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Kircher's speculations were used by several occultists, including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[William Wynn Westcott]] and [[Manly P. Hall]], as a key to interpreting the "[[Book of Thoth]]" or [[Tarot]]. Platonistic writer [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] even claimed that this tablet formed the altar before which [[Plato]] stood as he received initiation within a subterranean hall in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].&lt;ref&gt;Manly Palmer Hall, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta13.htm ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages''], 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7940">In [[statistics]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], and [[medical research]], '''censoring''' is a condition in which the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of a [[measurement]] or [[observation]] is only partially known.
 
For example, suppose a study is conducted to measure the impact of a drug on [[mortality rate]].  In such a study, it may be known that an individual's age at death is ''at least'' 75 years (but may be more).  Such a situation could occur if the individual withdrew from the study at age 75, or if the individual is currently alive at the age of 75.

Censoring also occurs when a value occurs outside the range of a [[measuring instrument]].  For example, a bathroom scale might only measure up to {{convert|300|lb}}.  If a {{convert|350|lb|abbr=on}} individual is weighed using the scale, the observer would only know that the individual's weight is at least {{convert|300|lb}}.

The problem of censored data, in which the observed value of some variable is partially known, is related to the problem of [[missing data]], where the observed value of some variable is unknown.

Censoring should not be confused with the related idea [[truncation (statistics)|truncation]]. With censoring, observations result either in knowing the exact value that applies, or in knowing that the value lies within an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]. With truncation, observations never result in values outside a given range: values in the population outside the range are never seen or never recorded if they are seen. Note that in statistics, truncation is not the same as [[rounding]].

==Types ==

* ''Left censoring'' &amp;ndash; a data point is below a certain value but it is unknown by how much.
* ''Interval censoring'' &amp;ndash; a data point is somewhere on an interval between two values.
* ''Right censoring'' &amp;ndash; a data point is above a certain value but it is unknown by how much.
* ''Type I censoring'' occurs if an experiment has a set number of subjects or items and stops the experiment at a predetermined time, at which point any subjects remaining are right-censored.
* ''Type II censoring'' occurs if an experiment has a set number of subjects or items and stops the experiment when a predetermined number are observed to have failed; the remaining subjects are then right-censored.
* ''Random'' (or ''non-informative'') ''censoring'' is when each subject has a censoring time that is [[statistically independent]] of their failure time. The observed value is the minimum of the censoring and failure times; subjects whose failure time is greater than their censoring time are right-censored.

Interval censoring can occur when observing a value requires follow-ups or inspections. Left and right censoring are special cases of interval censoring, with the beginning of the interval at zero or the end at infinity, respectively.

[[estimator|Estimation methods]] for using left-censored data vary, and not all methods of estimation may be applicable to, or the most reliable, for all data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Helsel, D. ''Much ado about next to Nothing: Incorporating Nondetects in Science,'' Ann. Occup. Hyg., Vol. 54, No. 3, pp. 257-262, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misconception with time interval data is to class as ''left censored'' intervals where the start time is unknown. In these cases we have a lower bound on the time ''interval'', thus the data is ''right censored'' (despite the fact that the missing start point is to the left of the known interval when viewed as a timeline!).

==Analysis==

Special techniques may be used to handle censored data. Tests with specific failure times are coded as actual failures; censored data are coded for the type of censoring and the known interval or limit. Special software programs (often [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] oriented) can conduct a [[maximum likelihood]] estimation for summary statistics, confidence intervals, etc.

===Epidemiology===

One of the earliest attempts to analyse a statistical problem involving censored data was [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s 1766 analysis of [[smallpox]] morbidity and mortality data to demonstrate the efficacy of [[vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli D. (1766) "Essai d’une nouvelle analyse de la mortalité causée par la petite vérole. ''Mem. Math. Phy. Acad. Roy. Sci. Paris'', reprinted in Bradley (1971) 21 and Blower (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; An early paper to use the [[Kaplan-Meier estimator]] for estimating censored costs was Quesenberry et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;C P Quesenberry, Jr, B Fireman, R A Hiatt, and J V Selby, A survival analysis of hospitalization among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, Am J Public Health 1989&lt;/ref&gt; however this approach was later found in 1997 by Lin et al.&lt;ref&gt;Lin DY, Feuer EJ, Etzioni R, Wax Y., Estimating medical costs from incomplete follow-up data, Biometric 1997&lt;/ref&gt; to be invalid unless all patients accumulated costs with a common deterministic rate function over time, they proposed an alternative estimation technique known as the Lin estimator.&lt;ref&gt;Wijeysundera HC, Wang X, Tomlinson G, Ko DT, Krahn MD, Techniques for estimating health care costs with censored data: an overview for the health services researcher, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating life testing===

[[Image:Censored Data Example.svg|right|thumb|250px|Example of five [[replication (statistics)|replicate]] tests resulting in four failures and one suspended time.]]
[[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] testing often consists of conducting a test on an item (under specified conditions) to determine the time it  takes for a failure to occur. 
* Sometimes a failure is planned and expected but does not occur: operator error, equipment malfunction, test anomaly, etc.  The test result was not the desired time-to-failure but can be (and should be) used as a time-to-termination. The use of censored data is unintentional but necessary.
* Sometimes engineers plan a test program so that, after a certain time limit or number of failures, all other tests will be terminated.  These suspended times are treated as right-censored data.  The use of censored data is intentional.
An analysis of the data from replicate tests includes both the times-to-failure for the items that failed and the time-of-test-termination for those that did not fail.

===Censored regression===

An earlier model for [[censored regression model|censored regression]], the [[Tobit model]], was proposed by [[James Tobin]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tobin |first=James |authorlink= |year=1958 |title=Estimation of relationships for limited dependent variables |journal=Econometrica |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=24–36 |jstor=1907382 |issn= |doi=10.2307/1907382 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Codex Marianus''''' is an [[Old Church Slavonic]] fourfold [[Gospel Book]] written in [[Glagolitic script]], dated to the beginning of the 11th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaganay|first=Léon|title=An introduction to New Testament textual criticism|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-42493-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3XFkk27-YYC&amp;pg=PA44 |author2=Christian-Bernard Amphoux |author3=Jenny Heimerdinger|accessdate=22 November 2011|page=44|quote=Codex Marianus, from the beginning of the eleventh century, was also copied in Macedonia and is kept in Moscow (two leaves are in Vienna)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is (along with [[Codex Zographensis]]), one of the oldest manuscript witnesses to the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, one of the two fourfold gospels being part of the [[Old Church Slavonic#Canon|Old Church Slavonic canon]].

==History==
Most of the Codex (172 folios, 171 according to some sources) was discovered by {{ill|Viktor Grigorovič|uk|Григорович Віктор Іванович}} at [[Mount Athos]] during a journey to the [[Balkans]] in 1844-45, in a hermitage belonging to the [[Monastery of the Holy Mother of God]] (the Blessed [[Theotokos]]), and thus the manuscript was named ''Codex Marianus'' in Latin. Grigorovič took the found folios to Kazan', and after his death in 1876 the Codex was transferred to [[Russian State Library]] in [[Moscow]] where it carries the catalog number грнг 6 (M.1689). Croatian diplomat and amateur scholar [[Antun Mihanović]] acquired 2 folios (containing Matthew 5.23 - 6.16) some time before Grigorovič made his discovery, and sent it to renowned Slovene Slavist [[Franc Miklošič]], who had them published in 1850. After Miklošič's death, the two-folio fragment was deposited in the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]] under the catalog number Cod. Slav. 146.

The Codex was first published by Croatian Slavist [[Vatroslav Jagić]] in 1883 in [[Berlin]] as ''Quattuor Evangeliorum versionis palaeoslovenicae Codex Marianus Glagoliticus'', transcribed in [[Cyrillic script]] and with extensive philological commentary in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Reprint was published in Graz in 1960.

==Linguistic analysis and origin==
Text of Codex especially abounds with the usage of [[Old Church Slavonic grammar#Asigmatic aorist|asigmatic aorist]], and very frequent is the assimilation of vowels in compound adjectival declension and present forms (''-aago'', ''-uumu'' instead of ''-aego'', ''-uemu''; ''-aatъ'' instead of ''-aetъ'' etc.).

Analysing the language of the Codex, Vatroslav Jagić concluded that one of the scribes of the Codex came from the Eastern-rite [[Štokavian]] area (see [[Old Church Slavonic#Serbian recension|Serbian recension]]), on the basis of substitutions ''u'' - ''ǫ'', ''i'' - ''y'', ''u'' - ''vъ'', ''e'' - ''ę'' etc. The conclusion about Serbo-Croatian origin of the Codex has been disputed by Russian [[Slavic studies|slavist]] Alexander Budilovich who believed that the Codex was written in northern Albania, in northern Macedonia or Mount Athos, in Bulgarian language environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runivers.ru/bookreader/book457608/#page/221/mode/1up Будилович, А. Мариинское евангелие с примечаниями и приложениями // ЖМНПр, 1884, март, с. 157.] According to Budilovich, the language of the Codex has only "small Serbian impurities".&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the Bulgarian researcher [[Lyubomir Miletich]] analysing some dialectal characteristics, claimed Western Bulgarian origin (from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]) of the Codex.&lt;ref&gt;Милетич, Любомир. Особеностите на езика на Марийнския паметник, Периодическо списание на Българското книжовно дружество в Средец, година V, 1886 г., кн. 19-20. [https://archive.org/stream/periodicheskosp04druzgoog#page/n239/mode/2up 219-252]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later researchers as [[Josip Hamm]] has warned that vocalization of [[yer]]s (''ъ'' &gt; ''o'', ''ь'' &gt; ''e''), as well as the occasional disappearance of epenthetic ''l'', suggests Macedonian provenience. According to [[F. Curta]], the book was "certainly of Macedonian origin", written "either in Ohrid or in one of the monastic centers in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&amp;pg=PA285|title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250|author=Florin Curta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|ISBN=0521815398|page=285|quote=Although one of them was found in the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God on Mount Athos (hence its name, Codex Marianus), both were written in Glagolitic either in Ohrid or in one of the monastic centers in the region.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[H. G. Lunt]], "Certain deviations from the theoretical norms indicate Macedonian influences, others possibly Serbian (if not northern Macedonian)".&lt;ref name=Lunt&gt;{{cite book|author=Horace Gray Lunt|year=2001|title=Old Church Slavonic Grammar|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BXJgfIo_fYC&amp;pg=PA7|quote=The Codex Marianus (Mar) has 174 folia, containing the Gospel text from Mt 5:23 to John 21:7. Certain deviations from the theoretical norms indicate Macedonian influences, others possibly Serbian (if not northern Macedonian).}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of arguments that link the Codex Marianus with territory that bordered that of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Monastic Traditions: Selected Proceedings of the Fourth International Hilandar Conference, the Ohio State University, 14–15 August 1998, Charles E. Gribble, Predrag Matejić Издание, Slavica, 2003, {{ISBN|0893573124}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to answer whether the Codex was created before the end of the First Bulgarian Empire (1018), or after its Byzantine conquest, i.e. into the [[theme of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-P_huGq9mV4C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Codex+Marianus+bulgarian+empire&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL74UajCFMG-PISBgZAO&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Codex%20Marianus%20bulgarian%20empire&amp;f=false Slavic Scriptures: The Formation of the Church Slavonic Version of the Holy Bible, Henry R.

Conservation of [[cultural heritage]] involves protection and restoration using "any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walston, S.|year=1978|page=9 |title=The Preservation and Conservation of Aboriginal and Pacific Cultural Material in Australian Museums|journal= ICCM Bulletin |volume=4 |issue= 1|url=http://www.aiccm.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=319:the-preservation-and-conservation-of-aboriginal-and-pacific-cultural-material-in-australian-museums&amp;catid=79:1978-iccm-bulletin-volume-4-no-4&amp;Itemid=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with [[Collection (artwork)|art collections]] and [[museum]]s and involves collection care and management through tracking, examination, documentation, exhibition, storage, preventative conservation, and restoration.&lt;ref name = Szczepanowska2013&gt;Szczepanowska, Hanna M.. 2013. Conservation of cultural heritage: key principles and approaches. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415674744}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope has widened from art conservation, involving protection and care of artwork and architecture, to conservation of cultural heritage, also including protection and care of a broad set of other cultural and historical works. Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical [[stewardship]].

Conservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:
* Minimal intervention;
* Appropriate materials and reversible methods;
* Full documentation of all work undertaken.

Often there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.

In order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]], the [[Values (heritage)|values]] and [[Preservation of meaning|meaning]] of the work, and the physical needs of the material.

Cesare Brandi in his ''Theory of Restoration'', describes restoration as "the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future".&lt;ref&gt;[Cesare Brandi, ''Teoria del restauro''; Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1963: reprint, Turin: G. Einaudi, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Key dates===
{{main article|List of dates in the history of art conservation}}

Some consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in Europe to have begun in 1565 with the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]], but more ancient examples include the work of [[Cassiodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pergoli Campanelli|first=Alessandro|title=Cassiodoro alle origini dell'idea di restauro|year=2013|publisher=Jaca book|location=Milano|isbn=978-88-16-41207-1|page=140|url=https://www.academia.edu/3522730/Cassiodoro_alle_origini_dellidea_di_restauro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief history===
[[File:Achter de schermen van het Rijksmuseum Weeknummer 50-11 - Open Beelden - 30641.ogv|thumb|An early video showing some activities in a conservation laboratory at the [[Rijksmuseum]]]]
[[File:Cloître Saint-Trophime Arles Conservation.jpg|thumb|A temporary windowed partition along restoration work area in the cloister of the [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]]]]
The care of cultural heritage has a long history, one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Pye, E, 2001. Caring for the Past: Issues in Conservation for Archaeology and Museums. London: James and James&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as [[Michael Faraday]] began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. [[Louis Pasteur]] carried out scientific analysis on paint as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. 2005. p. 41. [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11413&amp;page=41 “Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present”] in (Sackler NAS Colloquium) Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the [[United Kingdom]] of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in 1877. The society was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]], both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]]. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.

[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus, such as this "[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]", Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Conservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became the first [[chemist]] to be employed by a [[Museum]], the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin ([[Royal Museum (Berlin)|Royal Museums of Berlin]]). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gilberg, Mark.|year=1987|title= Friedrich Rathgen: The Father of Modern Archaeological Conservation|journal= Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=26|issue= 2|pages=105–120 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/jaic/articles/jaic26-02-004_2.html|doi=10.2307/3179459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]], academic chemist and Principal of [[Heriot-Watt University]] from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |title=Brief biography of Professor AP Laurie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714201324/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 the chemist [[Dr Harold Plenderleith]] began to work at the [[British Museum]] with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation ''profession'' in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx History]. British Museum (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the [[London Underground]] tunnels during the [[First World War]]. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]].

In the [[United States]], the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the [[Fogg Art Museum]], and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. [[Rutherford John Gettens]] was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with [[George L. Stout]], the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. "Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present". The publication exists in two editions. The earlier one is "Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques on Conservation and Analysis" and was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. The later edition of the publication is "Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia: Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis". It was published by the National Academies Press in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

George T. Oliver, of [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Art Conservation-Boston]]
(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for [[lining of paintings|relining]] paintings in 1920s; he filed a patent for the table in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Patent# 2,073,802 [http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=Oliver-George-T.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/Oliver-George-T&amp;RS=IN/Oliver-George-T U.S. "Art of Oil Painting Restoration"], March 16, 1937. Patft1.uspto.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation. Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.

The focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. [[International Institute for Conservation|The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)]] was incorporated under British law in 1950 as "a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds."&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"/&gt; The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as [[Cesare Brandi]] have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of [[preventive conservation]]. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by [[Garry Thomson]] [[CBE]], and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Environment (2nd Edition), 1986, by Garry Thomson CBE {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson was associated with the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.

==Ethics==
The conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of [[applied ethics]]. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:

* [[American Institute for Conservation]] Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=858 AIC – Code of Ethics]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.

As well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Stephen E.|date=October 1989|title=Too much Art?|journal=[[ArtNews]]|page=232|issn=0004-3273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caring for cultural heritage==

===Collections care===
{{Main article|Collections care}}
Many cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[light|visible light]] and [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, [[watercolour painting|watercolour paintings]] usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of [[pigment]]s.

Collections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

[[Image:Preventive Conservation - Serra da Capivara.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Work of preventive conservation in a rock wall with prehistoric paintings at the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]]. The work consists of filling the cracks to prevent the fragmentation of the wall.]]

===Interventive conservation===
[[File:FurnitureConservation2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Furniture conservation – Re-glueing loose element of solid nut marriage chest (probably Italy, 19th century)]]
A principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.

One of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Andrew Oddy]] and Sara Carroll (eds). 1999. Reversibility – Does it Exist? British Museum Occasional Paper Number 135. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered by many to be "a fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;p. 185. Muñoz-Viñas, Salvador. 2005. Contemporary Theory of Conservation. London: Elsevier/Butterworth Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom-cc.icom.museum/Start/ ICOM-CC] International Council of Museums Committee for Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|Sistine Chapel]].

==Conservation laboratories==
[[Image:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Lunder Conservation Center. Conservation staff for both the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques that [[Conservator (museum)|conservators]] use to examine, treat and preserve artworks within a functioning conservation Laboratory.]]
Conservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as [[microscope]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, and various [[x-ray]] regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.

==Country by country look==

===United States===
Heritage Preservation, in partnership with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/summary.html A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections], which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:
* Institutions must give priority to providing safe conditions for the collections they hold in trust.
* Every collecting institution must develop an emergency plan to protect its collections and train staff to carry it out.
* Every institution must assign responsibility for caring for collections to members of its staff.
* Individuals at all levels of government and in the private sector must assume responsibility for providing the support that will allow these collections to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/ Heritage Health Index]. Heritagepreservation.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Victoria and Albert conservation.jpg|thumb|Conservation in Progress note, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (2014)]]
In October 2006, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], a governmental department, authored a document: "Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/cons_uf_prioritiesforenglandsmuseums.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. Department for Culture, Media and Sport. culture.gov.uk. October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.

The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:

# Museums will fulfil their potential as learning resources (pp 7–10).
#* Museums will be embedded into the delivery of education in every school in the country.
#* Understanding of the effectiveness of museum education will be improved further and best practice built into education programmes.
#* The value of museums' collections as a research resource will be well understood and better links built between the academic community and museums.
# Museums will embrace their role in fostering, exploring, celebrating and questioning the identities of diverse communities (pp 11–14).
#* The sector needs to work with partners in academia and beyond to create an intellectual framework supporting museums' capacity to tackle issues of identity.
#* The museum sector must continue to develop improved practical techniques for engaging communities of all sorts.
# Museums' collections will be more dynamic and better used (pp 15–18).
#* Government and the sector will find new ways to encourage museums to collect actively and strategically, especially the record of contemporary society.
#* The sector will develop new collaborative approaches to sharing and developing collections and related expertise.
# Museums' workforces will be dynamic, highly skilled and representative (pp 17–22).
#* Museums' governing bodies and workforces will be representative of the communities they serve.
#* Find more varied ways for a broader range of skills to come into museums.
#* Improve continuing professional development.
# Museums will work more closely with each other and partners outside the sector (pp 23–26).
#* A consistent evidence base of the contribution of all kinds of museums to the full range of public service agendas will be developed.
#* There will be deeper and longer lasting partnerships between the national museums and a broader range of regional partners.
#* Museums' international roles will be strengthened to improve museum programmes in this country and Britain's image, reputation and relationships abroad.

The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the [[Institute of Conservation]] (ICON) published their response under the title "A Failure of Vision".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/images/stories/icon_understanding_the_future.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. The Institute of Conservation. icon.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; It had the following to say:

{{quote| "No sector can look with confidence to the future if its key asset is worked harder and harder across an ever broadening range of objectives while the inputs required to sustain it are neglected." }}

{{quote|"It is of major concern to us that the only part of this section which makes any acknowledgement of the need for greater resourcing is the part which refers to acquisitions. The original consultation paper made quite extensive reference to the importance of collections, the role of new technologies, and cultural property issues, but this appears to have been whittled away in the present document." }}

Concluding: {{quote| "When asked by the Commons Culture Media and Sport elect Committee CMS committee what he would like to see as a priority in the DCMS document arising from the 'Understanding the Future' consultation, Mr MacGregor responded 'I would like to see added there the need to conserve and research the collections, so that the collections can really play the role across the whole of the United Kingdom that they should.'
So would we."}}

Further to this the ICON website summary report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=15 The Future of Museums: A Failure of Vision]. Icon.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following specific recommendations:

* A national survey to find out what the public want from museums, what motivates them to visit them and what makes for a rewarding visit.
* A review of survey results and prioritisation of the various intrinsic, instrumental and institutional values to provide a clear basis for a 10-year strategy
* HR consultants to be brought in from the commercial sector to review recruitment, career development and working practices in the national and regional museums.
* A commitment to examine the potential for using Museum Accreditation as a more effective driver for improving recruitment, diversity, and career development across the sector.
* DCMS to take full account of the eventual findings of the current Commons Select Committee enquiry into Care of Collections in the final version of this document
* The adoption of those recommendations of the recent House of Lords enquiry into [[Heritage Science#Development of ‘Heritage Science’|Science and Heritage]] which have a potential impact on the future of museums.

In November 2008, the UK-based [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] published an influential pamphlet entitled ''It's a material world: caring for the public realm'',&lt;ref&gt;
Holden, John. and Samuel Jones. 2008. [http://demos.co.uk/files/Material%20World%20-%20web.pdf It's A Material World: Caring for the public realm]. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession:

{{quote|"conservators provide a paradigm not just for fixing things when they are broken, but for a wider social ethos of care, where we individually and collectively take responsibility and action"}}

==Training==
{{main article|Art conservation training}}
Training in conservation of cultural heritage for many years took the form of an [[apprenticeship]], whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="AIC training" &gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC – Becoming a Conservator]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an [[intern]].

Conservation of cultural heritage is an [[interdisciplinary]] field as conservators have backgrounds in the [[fine arts]], sciences (including [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[materials science]]), and closely related disciplines, such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[studio art]], and [[anthropology]]. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.

Within the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the [[American Institute for Conservation]] who advise "Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum".&lt;ref name="AIC training" /&gt;

In France, training for heritage conservation is taught by the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). 

==Associations and professional organizations==
{{main article|Conservation associations and professional organizations}}
Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spab.org.uk/html/what-is-spab/history-of-the-spab/ History of the SPAB]. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the [[United States]]. [[Preservation Virginia]], founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apva.org/ APVA Preservation Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613122322/http://www.apva.org/ |date=2008-06-13 }}. Apva.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/about About AIC – Overview]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

'''Continuous optimization''' is a branch of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] in [[applied mathematics]].

As opposed to [[discrete optimization]], the [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] used in the [[objective function]] are required to be [[continuous variable]]s&amp;mdash;that is, to be chosen from a set of [[real number|real]] values between which there are no gaps (values from [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s of the [[real line]]). Because of this [[continuity (mathematics)|continuity]] assumption, continuous optimization allows the use of [[calculus]] techniques.

[[File:Cooperative pulling experiment dogs.jpg|thumb|alt=Sketch of two dogs pulling a rope attached to a platform baited with food|A cooperative pulling experiment with dogs]]
The '''cooperative pulling paradigm''' is an [[Scientific control|experimental design]] in which two or more animals pull [[incentive salience|rewards]] toward themselves via an apparatus that they cannot successfully operate alone. Researchers ([[ethology|ethologists]], [[comparative psychology|comparative psychologists]], and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]]) use cooperative pulling experiments to try to understand how [[cooperation]] works and how and when it may have [[evolution|evolved]].

The type of apparatus used in cooperative pulling experiments can vary. Researcher Meredith Crawford, who invented the [[experiment|experimental]] [[paradigm (experimental)|paradigm]] in 1937, used a mechanism consisting of two ropes attached to a rolling platform that was too heavy to be pulled by a single [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]. The standard apparatus is one in which a single string or rope is threaded through loops on a movable platform. If only one participant pulls the string, it comes loose and the platform can no longer be retrieved. Only by pulling together in coordination can the participants be successful; success by chance is highly unlikely. Some researchers have designed apparatus that involve handles instead of ropes.

Although many animals retrieve rewards in their cooperative pulling tasks, the conclusions regarding cooperation are mixed and complex. Chimpanzees, [[bonobo]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[Capuchin monkey|capuchins]], [[tamarin]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[elephant]]s, [[raven]]s, and [[kea]]s appear to understand the requirements of the task. For example, in a delay condition, the first animal has access to the apparatus before the other. If the animal waits for its partner before pulling, this suggests an understanding of cooperation. Chimpanzees, elephants, wolves, dogs, ravens, and keas wait; grey parrots, rooks, and otters fail to wait. Chimpanzees actively solicit help when needed. They appear to recall previous outcomes to recruit the most effective partner. In a group setting, chimpanzees punish initial [[Competition (biology)|competitive behavior]] (taking food without pulling, displacing animals) such that eventually successful cooperation becomes the norm.

As for the evolution of cooperation, evidence from cooperative pulling experiments provides support for the theory that cooperation evolved multiple times independently. The fact that basic characteristics of cooperation are present in some mammals and some birds points to a case of [[convergent evolution]]. Within [[social animal]]s, cooperation is suspected to be a cognitive [[adaptation]].{{TOC Limit|3}}

Many species of animals [[cooperation|cooperate]] in the wild.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=545}} Collaborative [[Predation|hunting]] has been observed in the air (e.g., among [[Aplomado falcon]]s),{{sfn|Hector|1986|p=247}} on land (e.g., among [[lion]]s),{{sfn|Stander|1992|p=445}} in the water (e.g., among [[killer whale]]s),{{sfn|Pitman|Durban|2012|p=16}} and under the ground (e.g., among [[driver ant]]s).{{sfn|Brian|2012|p=18}} Further examples of cooperation include parents and others working together to raise young{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=545}} (e.g., among [[African elephant]]s),{{sfn|Lee|1987|p=278}} and groups defending their territory, which has been studied in [[primate]]s and other [[social animal|social species]] such as [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s, and [[common raven]]s.{{sfn|Massen|Ritter|Bugnyar|2015|p=1}}

Researchers from various disciplines have been interested in cooperation in animals.{{sfn|Noë|2006|p=1}} [[Ethology|Ethologists]] study animal behavior in general.{{sfn|de Waal|2016|p=9}} [[Comparative psychology|Comparative psychologists]] are interested in the origins, differences, and commonalities in psychological capacities across animal species.{{sfn|Papini|2003|p=211}} [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] investigate the origin of [[human behavior]] and [[cognition]], and cooperation is of great interest to them, as human [[society|societies]] are built on collaborative activities.{{sfn|Cosmides|Tooby|Barkow|1992|pp=9,163}}{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1756}}

For animals to be considered cooperating, partners must take account of each other’s behavior to pursue their common goal. There are various levels of cooperation. These increase in temporal and spatial complexity from performing similar actions, to synchrony (similar actions performed in unison), then coordination (similar actions performed at the same time and place), and finally collaboration (complementary actions performed at the same time and place).{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=967}}{{sfn|Boesch|Boesch|1989}} Researchers use [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]] to analyze the strategies applied by cooperating animals, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms that lead species to develop cooperative behavior.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=545}}{{sfn|Noë|2006|p=1}}

==Method==
The cooperative pulling paradigm is an experimental design in which two or more individuals, typically but not necessarily animals, can pull rewards towards themselves via an apparatus they can not successfully operate alone.{{sfn|de Waal|2016|p=276}} The cooperative pulling paradigm is the most popular paradigm for testing cooperation in animals.{{sfn|Ostojić|Clayton|2014|p=445}}

===Apparatus===
[[File:Sketch of a loose string paradigm apparatus.png|thumb|upright=1.5|right|alt=Sketch of two birds in front of a platform with two loops and a string threaded through the loops|A loose-string apparatus: the platform will only slide into reach if both animals pull at the same time. If only one animal pulls the string it will come loose.{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016|p=4}}]]
The type of apparatus used in cooperative pulling experiments can vary. Researcher Meredith Crawford, who invented the experimental paradigm in 1937 while at the [[Yerkes National Primate Research Center]], used an apparatus consisting of two ropes attached to a box that was too heavy to be pulled by a single chimpanzee.{{sfn|Crawford|1937}}{{sfn|de Waal|2016|p=185}} The standard apparatus is used in the loose-string task, designed by Hirata in 2003, in which a single string or rope is threaded through loops on a movable platform. If only one participant pulls the string, it comes loose and the platform can no longer be retrieved.{{sfn|Hirata|2003}}{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1422}} Only by pulling together in coordination can the participants be successful; success by chance is highly unlikely.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=142}} Some researchers have designed apparatus that involve handles instead of ropes.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=23}}{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|de Waal|2014}} [[Frans de Waal|De Waal]] and [[Sarah Brosnan|Brosnan]] have argued that complex electronically-mediated devices are not conducive to arrive at findings regarding cooperation. This is in contrast to mechanical pulling devices, in which the animals can see and feel their pull having immediate effect.{{sfn|de Waal|Brosnan|2005|p=95}} String-pulling tasks have advantages in terms of [[ecological validity]] for animals that pull branches with food towards themselves.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=134}}{{efn-ua|Pulling a string does require some level of cognition. It is unlikely to be governed fully by innate processes, as examples exist of animals that feed with their feet but use various techniques to pull a string.{{sfn|Jacobs|Osvath|2015|p=111}}}} Tasks in which participants have different roles in collaboration, such as for example, one pulls a handle and the other one needs to insert a stick, are considered outside the cooperative pulling paradigm.{{sfn|Melis|Tomasello|2013}}

===Subjects===
So far, fewer than twenty species have participated in cooperative pulling experiments: chimpanzees,{{sfn|Crawford|1937}} [[bonobo]]s,{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007}} [[orangutan]]s,{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997}} [[capuchin monkey]]s,{{sfn|de Waal|Brosnan|2005}} [[tamarin]]s,{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005}} [[macaque]]s,{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016}} [[human]]s,{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1756}} [[hyena]]s,{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009}} [[gray wolf|wolves]],{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017}} [[dog]]s,{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017}} [[elephant]]s,{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011}} [[otter]]s,{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017}} [[dolphin]]s,{{sfn|Kuczaj|Winship|Eskelinen|2015}} [[Rook (bird)|rooks]],{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010}} [[raven]]s,{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016}} [[parrot]]s,{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011}} and [[kea]]s.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017}}{{efn-ua|Werdenich and Huber investigated cooperation in [[marmoset]]s (''Callithrix jacchus'') using an experimental set-up where only one monkey pulled instead of both.{{sfn|Werdenich|Huber|2002|p=771}} They first trained eight marmosets in a solo task to pull a handle to bring a food reward within reach. Next, 16 pairs were given the cooperation test with a modified apparatus such that it required one monkey, the producer, to pull a handle so the other one, the scrounger, could grab a bowl with food, a single reward. All marmosets were willing and able to cooperate at least once. But only half of all pairings solved the task; primarily pairs in which the dominant monkey was the scrounger were successful. The researchers determined that tolerance of higher-ranking marmosets was an important factor in cooperation success.{{sfn|Werdenich|Huber|2002|p=771}} Marmosets are cooperative breeders with cognitive abilities far lower than apes.{{sfn|Burkart|Fehr|Efferson|van Schaik|2007|p=19765}}}} Researchers have picked species that cooperate in the wild (e.g., capuchins),{{sfn|de Waal|Berger|2000|p=563}} live in social structures (e.g., wolves),{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11795}} or have known cognitive abilities (e.g., orangutans).{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997}} Most of the participating animals have been in human care at an animal research center;{{sfn|Crawford|1937}}{{sfn|Noë|2006|p=5}} some lived semi-free at a sanctuary in their natural habitat.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006b|p=1297}}{{sfn|Hare|2007|p=64}} One study involved free animals ([[Barbary macaque]]s) in the wild.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=133}}

===Conditions===
To arrive at conclusions regarding cooperation, researchers have designed experiments with various conditions.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=969}}{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|p=5116}}
====Delay====
The first animal has access to the apparatus before the other one. If the animal does not wait for its partner this suggests a lack of understanding of the requirements for successful cooperation.{{sfn|Ostojić|Clayton|2014|pp=446–447}}
====Partner choice====
The first animal gets to choose which animal from a pair it wants as a partner.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006b|p=1297}} In some cases individual animals from within a group can decide to join an animal already at the apparatus.{{sfn|Massen|Ritter|Bugnyar|2015|p=1}}
====Apparatus choice====
Instead of just one apparatus in the test area there are two identical ones. Animals can decide to work on the same one (which can lead to success) or on different ones (which will lead to failure).{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11794}} A further design involves two different apparatus. The first animal can decide whether to use an apparatus that can be operated alone or one that requires and has a partner waiting.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1426}} A 'no rope' version involves an apparatus where everything is the same except for the rope on the partner's side being coiled up and not accessible to the partner.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=11}}

====Reward====
Rewards can be food split equally over two bowls in front of each animal, or in one bowl only. The type of food can vary from lots of small pieces to one big lump (e.g., slices of an apple vs. a whole apple).{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1423}} In combination with the apparatus choice, the reward for the joint-task apparatus is often twice as big as the reward for the solo apparatus.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017}} Another variation is a modified apparatus where one partner gets food before the other, requiring the first one to keep pulling despite already having received the reward.{{sfn|Greenberg|Hamann|Warneken|Tomasello|2010|p=876}}
====Visibility====
Typically the animals can see each other, all rewards, and all parts of the apparatus. To assess the role of visual communication, sometimes an opaque divider is placed such that the animals can no longer see each other, but can still see both rewards.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2002|p=145}}
====Training====
Animals are often first trained with an apparatus that can be operated by one individual. For example, the two ends of a string are on top of each other and a single animal can pull both ends. A technique called [[Shaping (psychology)|shaping]] can be used by gradually extending the distance between the string ends,{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1422}} or by gradually extending the length of delay between the arrival of the first and second animal at the apparatus.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|pp=5116–5117}}

==Findings==
===Overview===
Although many animals retrieve rewards in their cooperative pulling tasks, the conclusions regarding cooperation are mixed and complex.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun|de Waal|2011}}{{sfn|Albiach-Serrano|2015|p=361}} Some researchers have attributed successful cooperation to random simultaneous action,{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|p=5116}} or to the simple reactive behavior of pulling the rope when it moves.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=5}} Many trials with capuchins, hyenas, parrots and rooks led to failure because one partner pulled without the other present, suggesting a lack of understanding of cooperation.{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015|p=2}} A few researchers have offered the possible explanation that animals may understand cooperation to some extent but simply can not suppress the desire to have food they see.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=143}}

But there is evidence that some species do have an understanding of cooperation and perform intentional coordination to achieve a goal.{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015|p=1}}{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011}}
Specifically, chimpanzees,{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006b|p=1297}} bonobos,{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007|p=619}} orangutans,{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=23}} tamarins,{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=1}} capuchins,{{sfn|de Waal|Brosnan|2005|pp=95–96}} elephants,{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|p=5120}} wolves,{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11795}} ravens,{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016|p=9}} and keas{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=1}} appear to understand how cooperation works.{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015|pp=1–2}} Chimpanzees not only wait for a partner, but will actively solicit help when needed.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006}} They appear to recall previous outcomes to recruit the most effective partner.{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015}} In a group setting, chimpanzees punish initial competitive behavior (taking food without pulling, displacing animals) such that eventually, after many trials, successful cooperation becomes the norm.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|p=10218}} Bonobos, which are social animals with higher tolerance levels, can outperform chimpanzees on some cooperative tasks.{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007}} Elephants will wait for 45 seconds for a partner to arrive before they start a cooperative pulling task;{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun|de Waal|2011}} wolves do the same for 10 seconds.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11795}} Dogs raised as pets are also able to wait for a partner, albeit only for a few seconds;{{sfn|Ostojić|Clayton|2014}} pack dogs on the other hand rarely succeed in cooperative pulling in any condition.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11793}} Among birds, ravens are able to learn to wait after many trials,{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016|p=9}} while keas have set the record in waiting for a partner, 65 seconds.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=1}} Mere knowledge of the presence of a partner is not enough for success: when a barrier with a small hole was placed between two capuchins, obstructing the view of the partner's actions, the success rate dropped.{{sfn|de Waal|Suchak|2010|p=2713}} Of those species tested in the delay condition, parrots, rooks, and otters failed.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=545}}{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017|p=1111}}

In 2008, Seed, Clayton and Emery said the study of the proximate mechanisms underpinning cooperation in animals was in its infancy, due in part to the poor performances of animals such as chimpanzees in early tests that did not take factors such as inter-individual tolerance into account.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008}} Several studies since have highlighted the fact that tolerance has a direct impact on cooperation success, as the more tolerant an animal is around food the better it performs.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=546}} Subordinate animals seem simply not willing to risk being attacked by intolerant dominant animals, even if it means they will not obtain food either. {{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006b}} In general, cooperation will not emerge if individuals can not share the spoils obtained through their joint effort.{{sfn|Melis|Semmann|2010|p=2669}} [[Temperament]], whether an animal is bold or shy, has also been found to predict success.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|p=545}}

As for the evolution of cooperation, evidence from cooperative pulling experiments appears to support the theory that cooperation evolved multiple times independently. The fact that basic characteristics of cooperation are present in some mammals and some birds points to a case of [[convergent evolution]].{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=11}} Within social animals, cooperation is suspected to be a cognitive [[adaptation]].{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=11}} The ability of humans to cooperate is likely to have been inherited from an ancestor shared with at least chimpanzees and bonobos.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|p=10215}} The superior scale and range of human cooperation comes mainly from the ability to use [[language]] to exchange social information.{{sfn|Melis|Semmann|2010|p=2671}}

===Primates===

====Chimpanzees====
[[File:Chimpanzees in Uganda (5984913059).jpg|thumb|[[Chimpanzee]]s]]
Chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') are smart, social animals.{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1756}} In the wild they cooperate to hunt, dominate rival groups, and defend their territory.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006|p=275}} They have participated in many cooperative pulling experiments.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|p=10216}}{{sfn|Hirata|Fuwa|2007|p=13}} The first ever cooperative pulling experiment involved captive chimpanzees. In the 1930s Crawford was a student and researcher at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center.{{sfn|de Waal|2016|p=185}} In 1937 he published a study of two young chimpanzees named Bula and Bimba pulling ropes attached to a box. The box was too heavy to be pulled in by just one ape. On top of the box was food. The two participants synchronized their pulling and were able to get the food reward in four to five short pulls. In a second part of the study, Crawford fed Bula so much prior to the test that she was no longer interested in the food reward. By poking her and pushing her hand towards the rope, Bimba tried to enlist her help in the task, with success.{{sfn|de Waal|2016|p=185}}{{sfn|Crawford|1937}} In a follow-up experiment with seven pairs of chimpanzees Crawford found none of the apes spontaneously cooperated. Only after extensive training were they able to work together to obtain food. They also failed to transfer this new skill to a slightly different task, in which the ropes were hanging from the ceiling.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006|p=275}}{{sfn|Crawford|1941}}

}}

Similar mixed results, not matching the cooperative abilities observed in chimpanzees in the wild, were obtained in later studies by other researchers using a variety of experimental set-ups, including the loose-string task pioneered by Hirata.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006|p=275}}{{sfn|Hirata|2003}} Povinelli and O’Neill, for example, found that trained chimpanzees were unable to teach naive chimpanzees to cooperate on a Crawford-like box-pulling task. The naive animals did not imitate the experts.{{sfn|Povinelli |O’Neill|2000}}{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006|pp=275–276}} Chalmeau and Gallo found only two chimpanzees consistently cooperating in their handle-pulling task, and this involved one ape holding his own handle and waiting for the other to pull his. They concluded that social factors and not limited cognitive abilities were the reason for lack of widespread success, as they observed dominant chimpanzees controlling the apparatus and preventing others from interacting.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006|p=276}}

Melis, Hare, and Tomasello set up an experiment to control for such social factors. In a loose-string cooperative task without training they compared the ability of pairs of captive chimpanzees who in a non-cooperative setting were willing to share food with each other to pairs who were less inclined to do so. The results showed that food sharing was a good predictor for success in the cooperative pulling task. Melis, Hare, and Tomasello concluded that mixed results in the past could at least partially be explained by a failure to control for such social constraints.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006|p=275}} In a follow-up study with semi–free-ranging chimpanzees, again using the loose-string task, the researchers found that the apes only recruited a partner (by unlocking a door) if the task required it. When given the choice between partners, the apes chose the more effective one, based on their experience with each of them previously.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006b|p=1297}}{{efn-ua|Vail, Manica, and Bshary showed that, like chimpanzees, coral trout (''Plectropomus leopardus'') too can choose appropriately when and with whom to collaborate. They found this in the context of a set-up of a collaborative hunting relationship with moray eels, using experiments analogous to cooperative pulling tasks with chimpanzees but modified to be ecologically relevant to trout.{{sfn|Vail|Manica|Bshary|2014}}}}

Suchak, Eppley, Campbell, Feldman, Quarles, and de Waal argued that even when experiments take social relationships into account, the results still do not match the cooperation capabilities observed in the wild.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|p=10218}} They set out to increase the ecological validity of their experiments by placing a handle-pulling apparatus in an open-group setting, allowing the captive chimpanzees themselves to choose to interact with it or not, and with whom. They also refrained from any training, offered as little human intervention as possible, and extended the duration to much longer than any test had ever done, to 47 days of 1 hour tests.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|p=10216}}{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|de Waal|2014}} The chimpanzees first discovered that cooperation could lead to success, but as more individuals became aware of this new way to obtain food, competition increased, taking the form of dominant apes displacing others, monopolizing the apparatus, and [[freeloading]]: taking the food others worked for. This competition led to fewer successful cooperative acts.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|p=10217}} The group did manage to restore and increase levels of cooperative behavior by various enforcement techniques: dominant individuals were unable to recruit partners and abandoned the apparatus, displacement was met with aggressive protest, and freeloaders were punished by third-party arbiters.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|pp=10217–10218}} When the researchers repeated this experiment with a brand new group of chimpanzees who not yet had established a social hierarchy, they again found that cooperation overcame competition in the long run.{{sfn|Suchak|Eppley|Campbell|Feldman|2016|p=10219}} In a later study with a mix of novices and experts, Suchak, Watzek, Quarles, and de Waal found that novices learned rapidly in the presence of experts, although likely with limited understanding of the task.{{sfn|Suchak|Watzek|Quarles|de Waal|2018|p=87}}

Greenberg, Hamann, Warneken, and Tomasello used a modified apparatus that required two captive chimpanzees to pull, but delivered food to one ape first. They found that in many trials the apes who already had received a reward from joint effort kept pulling to help their partner obtain their food.{{sfn|Greenberg|Hamann|Warneken|Tomasello|2010|p=873}}
These partners did not need to gesture to solicit help, suggesting there was an understanding of what was wanted and needed.{{sfn|Greenberg|Hamann|Warneken|Tomasello|2010|p=879}}

====Bonobos====
[[File:6 bonobos WHCalvin IMG 1341.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Six apes huddled together|[[Bonobo]]s]]
Bonobos (''Pan paniscus'') are social animals that live in less hierarchical structures than chimpanzees. Hare, Melis, Woods, Hastings, and Wrangham set out to compare cooperation in chimpanzees and bonobos. They first ran a cofeeding experiment for each species. Pairs of bonobos were given two food dishes. In some trials both dishes had sliced fruit; in some one dish was empty and the other had sliced fruit; and in some one dish was empty and the other contained just two slices of fruit. The same set-up was then used for pairs of chimpanzees. When both dishes had food, there was no difference in behavior between bonobos and chimpanzees. But when only one dish contained food, bonobos were more than twice as likely to share food than chimpanzees. Bonobos were more tolerant of each other than chimpanzees.{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007|p=619}} The researchers then ran a loose-string cooperation task with both dishes filled with sharable food. The results showed similar success rates for bonobos and chimpanzees, 69% of chimpanzee pairs and 50% of bonobo pairs spontaneously solving the task at least once within the six-trial test session.{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007|p=620}}

In a third experiment, a year later, the same cooperation task was administered but now with different food distributions.  The bonobos outperformed the chimpanzees in the condition where one dish only had food and the food was clumped making it easier to monopolize the food reward. Bonobos cooperated more often in this condition. On average a single chimpanzee partner monopolized food rewards more often than a single bonobo did. In the condition where both dishes were filled with food, chimpanzees and bonobos performed similarly, as they had done the year before. The researchers concluded that the differences in performance between species were not due to differences in age, relationships, or experience.{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007|p=621}} It was the bonobos' higher social tolerance level that enabled them to outperform their relatives.{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007|p=619}}

====Orangutans====
[[File:Orang Utan, Semenggok Forest Reserve, Sarawak, Borneo, Malaysia.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Ape with brown-red hair in tree|[[Orangutan]]]]
Orangutans (''Pongo pygmaeus'') are tool-using apes that are mostly solitary.{{sfn|de Waal|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Te Boekhorst |Schürmann|Sugardjito|1990}} Chalmeau, Lardeux, Brandibas, and Gallo tested the cooperative capabilities of a pair of orangutans, using a device with handles. Only through simultaneous pulling could the pair retrieve a food reward. Without any training the orangutans succeeded in the first session. Over the course of 30 sessions, the apes succeeded more quickly, having learned to coordinate. Across trials the researchers found an increase in a sequence of actions that suggested understanding of cooperation: first looking at the partner; then if the partner holds or pulls the handle, starting to pull.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=26}}

The researchers also concluded that the orangutans learned a partner had to be present for success.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=23}} For example, they observed that time spent alone at the apparatus decreased as the trials progressed.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=27}} In some instances one orangutan pushed the other towards the free handle, soliciting cooperation.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|pp=27–28}} The researchers observed an asymmetry: one ape did all the monitoring and coordinating, the other one seemed to simply pull if the first one was present.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=29}} Rewards did not have to be shared equally for success to appear, as one orangutan took 92% of all food. This ape anticipated the falling of food and stuck his hand out first, before recruiting help from his partner.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=30}} Chalmeau, Lardeux, Brandibas, and Gallo concluded the apes appeared to understand the requirements of the cooperative task.{{sfn|Chalmeau| Lardeux| Brandibas| Gallo|1997|p=23}}

====Capuchins====

Capuchins (''Sapajus apella'') are large-brained monkeys that sometimes hunt cooperatively in the wild and
show, for nonhuman primates, unusually high levels of social tolerance around food.{{sfn|de Waal|Berger|2000|p=563}}{{sfn|de Waal|2006|p=355}} Early experiments to prove their ability to cooperate were unsuccessful. These tests involved capuchins having to pull handles or press levers in complex devices that the animals did not understand.{{sfn|de Waal|Brosnan|2005|p=95}}{{sfn|Chalmeau|Visalberghi|Gallo|1997}} They did not pull the handle more often when a partner was pulling; both novices and experienced participants kept pulling even in situations where success was impossible. Visalberghi, Quarantotti, and Tranchida concluded that there was no evidence of an appreciation of the role played by the partner.{{sfn|Visalberghi|Quarantotti|Tranchida|2000|p=300}}

The first test with evidence of cooperation in capuchins happened when de Waal and Brosnan adopted Crawford's pulling paradigm. Two captive monkeys were situated in adjacent sections of a test chamber, with a mesh partition between them. In front of them was an apparatus consisting of a counter-weighted tray with two pull bars and two food cups. Each monkey had access to only one bar and one food cup, but could see both, and only one cup was filled with food. The tray was too heavy for one monkey to pull it in, with weights established over trials lasting three years. Only when they worked together and both pulled could they move the tray, enabling one of them to grab the food. Trained monkeys were much more successful if they both obtained rewards after pulling than if only one of them received rewards. The pull rate dropped significantly when monkeys were alone at the apparatus, suggesting an understanding of the need for a partner.{{sfn|de Waal|Brosnan|2005|pp=95–96}} In later tests, researchers replaced the mesh partition with an opaque barrier with a small hole, so that the monkeys could see the other one was there but not their actions. This dramatically reduced success in cooperation.{{sfn|de Waal|Suchak|2010|p=2713}}{{sfn|Mendres|de Waal|2000}}

|quote = Sammy was in such a hurry to collect her rewards that she released the tray before Bias had a chance to get hers. The tray bounced back, out of reach of Bias. While Sammy munched on her food, Bias threw a tantrum. She screamed her lungs out for half a minute until Sammy approached her pull bar again. She then helped Bias bring in the tray a second time. Sammy did not do so for her own benefit, since by now her own cup was empty. Sammy's corrective response seemed the result of Bias’s protest against the loss of an anticipated reward. This example shows cooperation, communication, and the fulfillment of an expectation, perhaps even an obligation.

De Waal and Berger used the cooperative pulling paradigm to investigate animal economics. They compared the behavior when both transparent bowls were loaded with food to when just one was loaded, and with a solo task where the partner was only an observer and unable to help. They found that captive capuchin monkeys were willing to pull even if their bowl was empty and it was uncertain if their partner would share food. In 90% of cases the owner of the food did indeed share the food. Food was shared more often if the partner actually worked for it than just being an observer.{{sfn|de Waal |2006|pp=355–356}}

Brosnan, Freeman, and de Waal tested captive capuchin monkeys on a bar-pulling apparatus with unequal rewards. Contrary to their expectations, rewards did not have to be distributed equally to achieve success. What mattered was the behavior in an unequal situation: pairs that tended to alternate which monkey received the higher-value food were more than twice as successful in obtaining rewards than pairs in which one monkey dominated the higher-value food.{{sfn|Brosnan| Freeman|de Waal|2006|p=713}}

====Tamarins====
[[File:Saguinus oedipus at the Bronx Zoo 01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two tamarins in a tree|[[Cotton-top tamarin]]s]]
Cottontop tamarins (''Saguinus oedipus'') are small monkeys who take care of their young cooperatively in the wild.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=3}} Cronin, Kurian, and Snowdon tested eight captive cottontop tamarins in a series of cooperative pulling experiments.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=1}} Two monkeys were put on opposite sides of a transparent apparatus containing food. Only if both monkeys pulled a handle on their side of the apparatus towards themselves at the same time would food drop down for them to obtain.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=3}}
The tamarins were first trained, through shaping techniques, to use the handles successfully by themselves.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=4}} In the joint pulling test pairs were successful in 96% of trials.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=6}}

The researchers then ran a second study in which a tamarin was tested alone.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=8}} The results showed that tamarins pulled the handles at a lower rate when alone with the apparatus than when in the presence of a partner.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=9}} Cronin, Kurian, and Snowdon concluded from this that cottontop tamarins have a good understanding of cooperation.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=1}} They suggest that cottontop tamarins have developed cooperative behavior as a cognitive adaptation.{{sfn|Cronin|Kurian|Snowdon|2005|p=11}}

====Macaques====
[[File:Macaca sylvanus.Mother and baby.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a mother macaque with a child|[[Barbary macaque]]s]]
Molesti and Majolo tested a group of wild Barbary macaques (''Macaca sylvanus'') in Morocco to see if they would cooperate, and if so, what determined their partner choice. Macaques live in complex social environments and are relatively tolerant socially. After solo training, the researchers presented a loose-string apparatus for the cooperative task, which the animals were free to use.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|pp=133–135}}
Most animals that passed solo training were successful in spontaneously cooperating to obtain food (22 out of 26). More than half the pairs that chose to cooperate were juvenile-adult pairs. More than two monkeys pulling was never observed; stealing food from a partner was rare.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=140}} After a first successful cooperation, they were more likely to pull when a partner was directly available, but this was not always the case.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=142}} Molesti and Majolo did not rule out that pulling while no one held or pulled the other end of the rope was simply a signal to actively recruit a potential partner.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=143}}
The researchers randomly introduced control trials in which the solo apparatus was set up as well. The macaques preferred to get the food alone when a partner was not needed during the control.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=143}}

The extent to which a monkey tolerated another was a good predictor for initiating cooperation.
An individual was also found to be more successful with partners with whom they had a strong social bond.
Pairs sharing a similar temperament were more likely to initiate cooperation.
The quality of the relationship seemed to play an important role in the maintenance of cooperation over time.{{sfn|Molesti|Majolo|2016|p=143}}

====Humans====
Rekers, Haun, and Tomasello tested the cooperation abilities and preferences of humans (''Homo sapiens'') and compared them to chimpanzees.{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1756}}
The researchers provided 24 three-year-old children with some basic training in pulling food rewards towards themselves; in pairs using a loose-string setup, and solo training in which the two ends of a rope were tied together. They then tested the children in an apparatus choice set-up. On one side was the loose end of a rope that threaded through the apparatus to the other child. On the other side were two ends of a rope that when pulled would pull a platform towards both the child and its partner. Both the joint-operator platform and the solo-operated platform were holding two food dishes, all containing the same amounts of food. That is, from a partner's perspective, on one side the child had to pull to get food; on the other the partner could get food without any effort. The children chose the joint-operated board in 78% of trials.{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1757}}

The researchers then changed the design to ascertain if this choice preference was due to wishing to avoid freeloading and it may be that the children did not like their partner getting food without making any effort. In the modified set-up the partners never received any reward, not from the joint-operated apparatus and not from the solo-operated apparatus. Children again chose the joint-operated platform significantly more often, in 81% of trials. As in the first study, there was no significant difference in the time taken to obtain the food reward between using one side or the other. These results suggest that to obtain food, children prefer to work together with a partner as opposed to working alone.{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1757}} The chimpanzees in their study appeared to choose between the two platforms randomly, indicating no preference to work collaboratively.{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1757}}

===Other mammals===

====Hyenas====
[[File:Crocuta crocuta Ngorongoro Crater (2015).jpg|thumb|left|[[Spotted hyena]]]]
Captive [[spotted hyenas]] (''Crocuta crocuta''), social carnivores that hunt in groups, have cooperated to obtain food rewards by pulling ropes in an experimental setting.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=967}} Mimicking the natural choice hunting hyenas face when deciding which of many prey to jointly attack, researchers Drea and Carter set up two devices instead of one, as previously used in all cooperative pulling tasks with other species. With four ropes to pull from, the animals had to pick the two belonging to the same device to be successful.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=969}} If two vertically suspended ropes were simultaneously tugged, a spring-controlled trap door of an elevated platform was opened and previously hidden food dropped to the floor.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=970}}
Another innovation was the introduction of more than two animals. One of the many factors the researchers controlled for was the [[Clever Hans|Clever Hans effect]] (an effect in which humans unwittingly provide cues to animals), which they did by removing all humans from the test and by recording experiments on video.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=972}}

After extensive solo trials, all hyenas were successful in cooperating, displaying remarkable efficiency even on their first try.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=971}} On average, hyenas pulled on ropes more often when their companion was nearby and available to fulfil its partnership role.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=974}} With only a few solo trials, the success rate of the cooperation task was very low for pairs. In groups of four hyenas, all trials were successful, regardless of the number of reward platforms. Thereafter, group exposure to a cooperation task had enhancing effects on pairwise performance.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=972}} Social factors such as group size and hierarchy played a role. For instance, groups with a dominant member were far less successful than groups without, and lower-ranking animals were faster and consistently successful.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=973}} When pairing experienced cooperators with animals new to the cooperation task, the researchers found that experienced animals monitored the novices and modified their behavior to achieve success.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=974}} Despite initial accommodation, the pattern of rank-related social influences on partner performance also appeared in these tests with novices.{{sfn|Drea|Carter|2009|p=975}}

====Dogs====
[[File:Labrador Retrievers yellow and red.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two dogs near the water|[[Labrador Retrievers]] (one of many breeds used in experiments)]]
Ostojić and Clayton administered the loose-string cooperation task to domestic [[dog]]s (''Canis familiaris''). Pet dogs first were given a solo task in which the string ends were close enough for one dog to pull at both. Then they were given a transfer test to assess if they could generalize their newly learned rule to novel situations. Finally, the joint task was administered. Dog pairs always came from the same household. In half of the joint tasks one of the pair of dogs was shortly delayed by an obstacle course.{{sfn|Ostojić|Clayton|2014|pp=446–447}} All dogs that learned to master the solo task solved the joint task within 60 trials.{{sfn|Ostojić|Clayton|2014|p=455}} In the delayed condition, the not-delayed dog waited before pulling most of the time, but only for a few seconds. The researchers also tested dog–human pairs, again in delayed and not-delayed conditions. Dogs were equally successful when working with humans in the non-delayed condition, but far less successful when they had to wait for the human, who on average arrived with a 13-seconds longer delay than the delayed dog in the dog–dog trials. Ostojić and Clayton concluded that inhibiting the necessary action was not easy for dogs. They ruled out that dogs simply went for any moving string, as in the dog–human trials the humans did not pull hard enough to make the other end move.{{sfn|Ostojić|Clayton|2014|pp=455–456}} They attributed success to the dogs' ability to read the social cue of their partner's behavior, but could not rule out that visual feedback of seeing rewards incrementally move closer also played a role.{{sfn|Ostojić|Clayton|2014|p=456}}

These results with pet dogs stand in stark contrast to the results with pack dogs, which in a study by Marshall-Pescini, Schwarz, Kostelnik, Virányi, and Range rarely succeeded in obtaining food. The researchers theorized that pet dogs are trained not to engage in conflicts over resources, promoting a level of tolerance, which may facilitate cooperation. The pack dogs were used to competition over resources and thus were likely to have conflict avoidance strategies, which constrain cooperation.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11796}}

====Wolves====
[[File:Howlsnow.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A wolf howling|[[Gray wolf]]]]
Marshall-Pescini, Schwarz, Kostelnik, Virányi, and Range set out to test two competing hypotheses regarding cooperation in wolves (''Canis lupus'') and dogs. On the one hand, it could be theorized that dogs have been selected, during domestication, for tame temperaments and an inclination to cooperate and therefore should outperform wolves on a cooperative pulling task. On the other hand, it could be argued that dogs have evolved to become less able to work jointly with other dogs because of their reliance on humans. Wolves rely on each other for hunting, raising young and defending their territory; dogs rarely rely on other dogs.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11793}} The researchers set up a cooperative pulling task for captive wolves and pack dogs. Without any training on this task, five of the seven wolf pairs were successful at least once, but only one dog pair out of eight managed to obtain food, and only once.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11794}} After solo training, again the wolves far outperformed the dogs on the joint task. The researchers concluded that the difference does not stem from a difference in understanding of the task (their cognitive capabilities are largely the same), nor from a difference in social aspects (for both species, aggressive behavior by dominant animals was rare, as was submissive behavior by lower ranked ones). More likely is that dogs avoid potential conflict over a resource more than wolves do, something which has been observed in other studies as well.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11796}}

The wolves, but not the dogs, were then tested in pairs in a set-up with two identical apparatus 10 meters (39 ft) apart, requiring them to coordinate in time and space. In 74% of the trials they succeeded. The stronger the bond between the partners and the smaller the distance in rank, the better they performed.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11795}} In a subsequent delay condition, with the second wolf released 10 seconds after the first, most wolves did well, one being successful in 94% of trials.{{sfn|Marshall-Pescini|Schwarz|Kostelnik|Virányi|2017|p=11795}}

====Elephants====
[[File:Kui Buri National Park (Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, Thailand.jpg|thumb|alt=A herd of elephants in a forest|[[Asian elephant]]s]]
Elephants have a complex social structure and large brains that enable them to solve many problems.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|p=5116}} Their size and strength do not make them easy candidates for experiments. Researchers Plotnik, Lair, Suphachoksahakun, and de Waal adapted the apparatus and task to elephant requirements. They trained captive Asian elephants (''Elephas maximus'') to use a rope to pull a sliding platform with food on it towards themselves. Once the elephants managed this solo task, the researchers introduced a loose-string apparatus by threading the rope around the platform. At first, two elephants were released simultaneously to walk side by side in two lanes to the two loose ends of the rope. Using their trunks the animals coordinated their actions and retrieved the food.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|pp=5116–5117}}

At this stage they could simply be applying a 'see the rope, pull the rope' strategy. To see whether they understood the requirements of the task the researchers introduced a delay for one elephant, initially of 5 seconds and ultimately of 45 seconds. At first the lead elephant failed to retrieve the food but was soon seen to wait for a partner.  Across 60 trials the first elephant waited for the second one before pulling in most cases.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|pp=5116–5117}} In a further control the researchers prevented the second elephant from being able to access its end of the rope. In almost all of these cases the first elephant did not pull the rope, and four of the six returned when they saw the other rope end was not going to be accessible to their partner. The researchers concluded that this suggested the elephants understood they needed their partner to be present and to have access to the rope to succeed.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|pp=5118–5119}} One elephant never pulled the rope but simply put her foot on the rope and let the partner do all the pulling. Another one waited for his partner's release at the starting line rather than waiting at the rope.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|p=5119}} Plotnik, Lair, Suphachoksahakun, and de Waal conceded that it is difficult to distinguish learning from understanding. They did prove that elephants show a propensity towards deliberate cooperation. The speed with which they learned the critical ingredients of successful cooperation puts them on par with chimpanzees and bonobos.{{sfn|Plotnik|Lair|Suphachoksahakun |de Waal|2011|p=5120}}

====Otters====
[[File:Sketch of a cooperative pulling experiment with otters.gif|thumb|left|alt=Sketch of two otters and apparatus|Set-up in the delay conditions of  Schmelz et al.'s experiments with [[otters]]]]
Schmelz, Duguid, Bohn, and Völter presented two species of captive otters, [[giant otter]]s (''Pteronura brasiliensis'') and [[Asian small-clawed otter]]s (''Aonyx cinerea''), with the loose-string task.{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017|p=1107}} Both species raise young cooperatively and live in small groups. Because giant otters forage together but small-clawed otters do not, the researchers expected the giant otters to do better in the cooperative pulling experiment.{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017|p=1108}} After solo training, they tested both species in a group setting, to maintain ecological validity.{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017|p=1109}} The results showed that most pairs of otters were successful in pulling food rewards to themselves. Contrary to expectation, there was no difference between the species in success rate.{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017|p=1110}} In a subsequent experiment the researchers first lured the group away from the apparatus into the opposite corner of the enclosure. Then they put food on the apparatus and observed what happened when the first otter arrived at the nearest end of the rope, as there was no partner yet at the other end. Very few trials led to success in this condition as otters pulled the rope as soon as they could. The researchers concluded from this that the otters did not understand the necessary elements of successful cooperation, or, alternatively, they understood but were unable to inhibit the desire to reach for the food. When the same task was repeated with a longer rope, success rate did go up, but the otters appeared unable to learn from this and be successful in the next task with the rope length restored to the original length.{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017|p=1111}} Schmelz, Duguid, Bohn, and Völter suggested that an understanding of cooperation may not be required for successful cooperation in the wild. Cooperative hunting may be possible through situational coordination and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], without any complex social cognitive abilities.{{sfn|Schmelz|Duguid|Bohn|Völter|2017|p=1112}}

====Dolphins====
[[File:Tursiops truncatus 01-cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A dolphin jumping out of the water|[[Common bottlenose dolphin]]]]
Two groups of researchers (first Kuczaj, Winship, and Eskelinen, and then Eskelinen, Winship, and Jones) adapted the cooperative pulling paradigm for captive bottlenose dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus'').{{sfn|Kuczaj|Winship|Eskelinen|2015}}{{sfn|Eskelinen|Winship|Jones|2016}} As apparatus they used a container which could only be opened at one end if two dolphins each pulled a rope on either end. That is, the dolphins would have to face each other and pull in opposite directions.{{sfn|Kuczaj|Winship|Eskelinen|2015|p=545}} They first attached the container to a stationary dock so a single dolphin could learn to open it and get the food reward. Then they ran trials in which the container was free floating in a large test area with six dolphins. In Kuczaj, Winship, and Eskelinen's study, only two dolphins interacted with the container. In eight of the twelve trials they pulled simultaneously and obtained food. Once, they also managed to open the container through asynchronous pulling, and once a single male dolphin managed to open it by himself.{{sfn|Kuczaj|Winship|Eskelinen|2015|p=546}} Kuczaj, Winship, and Eskelinen admitted that this behavior may appear to be cooperation but could possibly be competition. They conceded it is possible that the dolphins did not understand the role of the other dolphin, but instead simply tolerated it pulling on the other side.{{sfn|Kuczaj|Winship|Eskelinen|2015|p=548}} King, Allen, Connor, and Jaakkola later argued that this design makes for a competitive ‘tug-of-war’, not cooperation, and any conclusions regarding cooperation should therefore be invalid.{{sfn|King|Allen|Connor|Jaakkola|2016}}

===Birds===

====Rooks====
[[File:Corvus frugilegus -Dartmoor, Devon, England-8.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black bird on grass|[[Rook (bird)|Rook]]]]
Rooks (''Corvus frugilegus'') are large-brained members of the bird family [[Corvidae]]. They live in big groups and have a high level of social tolerance.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1422}} Researchers Seed, Clayton, and Emery set up a loose-string experiment with eight captive rooks. They were first trained in a solo task, with the string ends placed at 1&amp;nbsp;cm, 3&amp;nbsp;cm and ultimately 6&amp;nbsp;cm apart (0.4, 1.2, and 2.4 inch respectively).{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1422}} A pair's willingness to share food was then tested, and was found to differ somewhat between pairs, although food was rarely monopolized by a dominant bird. In the cooperative task, all pairs were able to solve the cooperation problem and retrieve food; two pairs managed this in their first session.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|pp=1423–1424}} Food sharing was a good predictor for successful cooperation.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1425}}

In a subsequent delay test, where one partner had access to the apparatus first, all rooks pulled the string without waiting for their partner to enter the test area in the majority of trials.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1426}} In a second variant, birds were given a choice between a platform they could operate successfully alone and one that required a pulling partner. When tested alone, four of the six rooks showed no significant preference for either platform.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1426}} Seed, Clayton, and Emery concluded that although successful at the cooperation task, it seemed unlikely that the rooks had an understanding of when cooperation was necessary.{{sfn|Seed|Clayton|Emery|2008|p=1427}}

Researchers Scheid and Noë subsequently found that successful cooperation in rooks depended to a large extent on their temperament.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|p=545}} In their loose-string experiment with 13 captive rooks they distinguished between bold and shy animals.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|p=546}} The results were mixed, ranging from some pairs cooperating successfully every time to some pairs never cooperating.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|p=549}} In 81% of cases a rook should have waited for a partner, but it did not and started pulling.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|p=550}} Scheid and Noë concluded their experiment provided no evidence for or against rooks having an understanding of the task.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|pp=551–552}} They attributed any cooperation success to common external cues and not coordination of actions. But all subjects did better when they were paired with a bolder partner.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|p=550}} The researchers suggested that in evolution, cooperation can emerge because bolder individuals encourage a risk-averse one to engage.{{sfn|Scheid|Noë|2010|p=552}}

====Ravens====
[[File:Partner-Choice-in-Raven-(Corvus-corax)-Cooperation-pone.0156962.s001.ogv|thumbtime=59|thumb|400px|alt=Raven pulling strings simultaneously|A trial from Asakawa-Haas, Schiestl, Bugnyar, and Massen (2016) in which a middle [[common raven|raven]] first cooperates with the raven on its right side and then with the one on its left, which had been waiting without pulling. The left and right part of the video show the same trial, but shot from two different angles.{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016}}]]
Massen, Ritter, and Bugnyar investigated the cooperative capabilities of captive common ravens (''Corvus corax''),{{sfn|Massen|Ritter|Bugnyar|2015|p=1}} a species that frequently cooperates in the wild.{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016|p=1}} They found that without training ravens cooperated in the loose-string task.{{sfn|Massen|Ritter|Bugnyar|2015|p=1}} The animals did not seem to pay attention to the behavior of their partners while cooperating, and, like rooks, did not seem to understand the need for a partner to be successful.{{sfn|Massen|Ritter|Bugnyar|2015|p=7}} Tolerance of their partner was a critical factor for success. In one condition the researchers let ravens choose a partner from a group to cooperate with. Overall success was higher in this condition, and again, individuals that tolerated each other more had more success. The ravens also paid attention to reward distribution: they stopped cooperating when being cheated upon.{{sfn|Massen|Ritter|Bugnyar|2015|p=1}}

Asakawa-Haas, Schiestl, Bugnyar, and Massen subsequently ran an open-choice experiment with eleven captive ravens in a group setting, using nine ravens from one group and two newcomers.{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016|pp=1, 3}} They found that the ravens' decision which partner to cooperate with was based on tolerance of proximity and not on whether they were part of the group or not.{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016|p=1}} The ravens in this experiment learned to wait for their partner and inhibit pulling the string too soon.{{sfn|Asakawa-Haas|Schiest|Bugnyar|Massen|2016|p=9}}

====Grey parrots====
[[File:Psittacus erithacus -perching on tray-8d.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A grey bird perching on a tray|[[Grey parrot]]]]
Researchers Péron, Rat-Fischer, Lalot, Nagle and Bovet had captive [[grey parrot]]s (''Psittacus erithacus'') try to cooperate in a loose-string experimental set-up. The grey parrots were able to act simultaneously but, like the rooks, largely failed to wait for a partner in the delay task. They did not make any attempts to recruit a helping partner.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=545}} The parrots did take the presence of a partner into account, since they all pulled more when a partner was present, but this could be explained by [[operant conditioning|instrumental learning]] rather than a real understanding of the task.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=551}} The researchers also gave the parrots a choice between two apparatus, one from the solo task and one from the loose-string task, now stacked with double the food per bird. Two of the three parrots chose the solo apparatus when alone, and two of the three parrots preferred the joint-task apparatus when tested with a partner.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=552}} When paired up, social preferences and tolerance affected the likelihood a pair cooperated.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=552}}

[[File:Sketch of a cooperative pulling experiment with keas.png|thumb|alt=Sketch of two birds and an apparatus|The delayed partner arrival experiment with two [[kea]]s]]
Keas (''Nestor notabilis''), parrots native to New Zealand, are a distant relative of the grey parrot.{{sfn|Schwing|Jocteur|Wein|Noë|2016|p=1094}} They live in complex social groups and do well on cognitive tests.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=2}} Heaney, Gray, and Taylor gave four captive keas a series of cooperative loose-string tasks. After solo training and shaping with string ends increasingly further apart, two birds were released simultaneously in a joint loose-string task. Both pairs did very well, one pair failing only 5 in 60 trials.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=8}} Shaping was then used in a delay task, with the partner released after one second, then two, and gradually up to 25 seconds later than the first bird.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=2}}
The birds managed to wait for a partner between 74% to 91% of test trials, including success at 65 seconds delay, longer than any other animal of any species had been tested for.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=2}}
To assess if this success could be explained by the learning of a combination of cues, such as seeing a partner while feeling tension on the string, or by a proper understanding of cooperation, the researchers randomly gave the keas a set-up they could solve alone or one in which they needed to cooperate with a delayed partner.
Three of the four keas were successful at a significant rate: they chose to wait when they had to and immediately pulled when the task could be done alone.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|pp=6,9}} However, when the researchers modified the set-up and coiled up the string end of the delayed partner, no bird was successful at discriminating between a duo platform with both ends of string available to both keas and a duo platform with the partner’s string coiled out of reach.
The researchers were not able to determine the reason for this result. They speculated it could be that keas do have an understanding of when they need a partner but do not have a clear idea of the role their partner plays in relation to the string, or they may lack of a full causal understanding of how the string works.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=11}} Finally, the researchers attempted to ascertain if keas have a preference for working alone or together. No preference was found in three of the four keas, but one kea preferred the duo platform significantly more.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=9}} Heaney, Gray, and Taylor concluded that these results put keas on a par with elephants and chimpanzees in terms of cooperative pulling.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=1}}

These conclusions are in sharp contrast to those of Schwing, Jocteur, Wein, Noë, and Massen, who tested ten captive keas in a loose-string task on an apparatus that provided limited visibility to follow the trajectory of the string.{{sfn|Schwing|Jocteur|Wein|Noë|2016|pp=1094, 1100}} After training with a human partner (no solo training was done), only 19% of trials led to the birds obtaining food in the joint task. The researchers found that the closer the birds were affiliated, the more successful they were in the cooperation task. The keas did not seem to understand either the mechanics of the loose-string apparatus or the need of a partner, as in training with humans they still pulled the string even when the human was too far away or facing the wrong way. The way rewards were distributed had a small effect on the likelihood of cooperation attempts. The difference in social rank or dominance did not seem to matter.{{sfn|Schwing|Jocteur|Wein|Noë|2016|p=1099}}

[[Image:Daisy1web.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;''[[Osteospermum]]'' 'Pink Whirls' &lt;br&gt; A cultivar selected for its intriguing and colourful flowers&lt;/center&gt;]]

The term '''''cultivar'''''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Cultivar''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|t|ᵻ|ˌ|v|ɑːr|,_|-|ˌ|v|ɛər}}) has two denominations as explained in ''[[#Formal definition|Formal definition]]''. When referring to a [[taxon]], the word does not apply to an individual plant but to all plants that share the unique characters that define the cultivar.&lt;/ref&gt; most commonly refers to an assemblage of plants selected for desirable characters that are maintained during [[Plant propagation|propagation]]. More generally, ''cultivar'' refers to the most basic classification category of cultivated plants in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] (ICNCP). Most cultivars arose in cultivation, but a few are special selections from the wild.

Popular ornamental [[List of garden plants|garden plants]] like [[rose]]s, [[camellia]]s, [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]], [[rhododendron]]s, and [[azalea]]s are cultivars produced by [[Selective breeding|careful breeding and selection]] for floral colour and form. Similarly, the world's agricultural [[food crop]]s are almost exclusively cultivars that have been selected for characters such as improved yield, flavour, and resistance to disease, and very few wild plants are now used as food sources. Trees used in [[forestry]] are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield of [[timber]].

Cultivars form a major part of [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]]'s broader group, the [[cultigen]],&lt;ref name="Bailey 1923 113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|1923|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|2007|p=938}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cultivar is not the same as a [[Variety (botany)|botanical variety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1953|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a taxonomic rank below [[subspecies]], and there are differences in the rules for creating and using the names of botanical varieties and cultivars.  In recent times, the naming of cultivars has been complicated by the use of statutory [[patents]] for plants and recognition of [[plant breeders' rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120802200032/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/hort/courses/HORT217/Nomenclature/description.htm See]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]] (UPOV – {{Lang-fr|Union internationale pour la protection des obtentions végétales}}) offers legal protection of plant cultivars to persons or organisations that introduce new cultivars to commerce. UPOV requires that a cultivar be "distinct, uniform", and "stable". To be "distinct", it must have characters that easily distinguish it from any other known cultivar. To be "uniform" and "stable", the cultivar must retain these characters in repeated propagation.

The naming of cultivars is an important aspect of [[cultivated plant taxonomy]], and the correct naming of a cultivar is prescribed by the Rules and Recommendations of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' (ICNCP, commonly denominated the ''Cultivated Plant Code''). A cultivar is given a cultivar name, which consists of the scientific [[Latin]] botanical name followed by a cultivar [[Binomial nomenclature|epithet]]. The cultivar epithet is usually in a [[vernacular]] language. For example, the full cultivar name of the [[King Edward potato]] is ''Solanum tuberosum'' 'King Edward'. 'King Edward' is the cultivar epithet, which, according to the Rules of the ''Cultivated Plant Code'', is bounded by single quotation marks.&lt;ref name="Brickell 2009 19"&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Article 14.1 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

[[Image:Liberty Hyde Bailey 1858-1954.jpg|thumb|right|210px|&lt;center&gt;[[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858–1954) coined the words ''cultigen'' in 1918 and ''cultivar'' in 1923.&lt;/center&gt;]]{{Main|Cultivated plant taxonomy}}

The word ''cultivar'' originated from the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with characteristics that arose in cultivation, presently denominated ''cultigens''. This distinction dates to the Greek philosopher [[Theophrastus]] (370–285&amp;nbsp;BC), the "Father of Botany", who was keenly aware of this difference. Botanical historian Alan Morton noted that [[Theophrastus]] in his ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'' (''Enquiry into Plants'') "had an inkling of the limits of culturally induced ([[phenotype|phenotypic]]) changes and of the importance of genetic constitution" (''Historia Plantarum'', Book 3, 2, 2 and ''Causa Plantarum'', Book 1, 9, 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] uses as its starting point for modern [[botanical nomenclature]] the [[Latin]] names in [[Linnaeus]]' (1707–1778) ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (tenth edition) and ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' (fifth edition). In ''Species Plantarum'', Linnaeus enumerated all plants known to him, either directly or from his extensive reading. He recognised the rank of [[Variety (botany)|varietas]] (botanical "variety", a rank below that of [[species]] and [[subspecies]]) and he indicated these varieties with letters of the [[Greek alphabet]], such as α, β, and λ, before the varietal name, rather than using the abbreviation "var." as is the present convention. Most of the varieties that Linnaeus enumerated were of "garden" origin rather than being wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with variations that had been cultivated increased. In the nineteenth century many "garden-derived" plants were given horticultural names, sometimes in [[Latin]] and sometimes in a vernacular language. From ''circa'' the 1900s, cultivated plants in [[Europe]] were recognised in the Scandinavian, Germanic, and Slavic literature as ''stamm'' or ''sorte'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these words could not be used internationally because, by international agreement, any new denominations had to be in [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century an improved international nomenclature was proposed for cultivated plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] of [[Cornell University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]] created the word ''cultivar'' in 1923 when he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cultigen is a species, or its equivalent, that has appeared under domestication – the plant is cultigenous. I now propose another name, cultivar, for a botanical variety, or for a race subordinate to species, that has originated under cultivation; it is not necessarily, however, referable to a recognized botanical species. It is essentially the equivalent of the botanical variety except in respect to its origin.&lt;ref name="Bailey 1923 113"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In that essay, Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen, but it was obvious to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species, and that realization appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new category of ''cultivar''.

Bailey created the word ''cultivar'', which is generally assumed to be a [[portmanteau]] of '''''culti'''vated'' and '''''var'''iety''. Bailey never explicitly stated the [[etymology]] of ''cultivar'', and it has been suggested that it is instead a contraction of '''''culti'''gen'' and '''''var'''iety'', which seems correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trehane|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neologism]] ''cultivar'' was promoted as "euphonious" and "free from ambiguity".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This ignored its prior use as a transitive verb in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] denoting "to farm, to cultivate, to grow, or to practice" ([http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/cultivar Online Spanish dictionary]), and in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] denoting ''to cultivate, to husband, to farm, to plant, to polish, to reclaim, to improve'' ([http://online.ectaco.co.uk/main.jsp%3bjsessionid=bc304a778686293e1e2f?do=e-services-dictionaries-word_translate1&amp;direction=2&amp;status=translate&amp;lang1=23&amp;lang2=pt&amp;source=cultivar Ectaco online Portuguese dictionary]).&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Cultivated Plant Code'' of 1953 subsequently commended its use, and by 1960 it had achieved common international acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1960|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultigens ===
{{Main|Cultigen}}

[[File:Triticum aestivum, Gewone tarwe.jpg|thumb|210px|Bread wheat, ''[[Triticum aestivum]]'', is considered a cultigen, and is a distinct species from other [[Triticum|wheats]] according to the [[biological species concept]]. Many different cultivars have been created within this cultigen. Many other cultigens are not considered to be distinct species, and can be denominated otherwise.]]

The words ''[[cultigen]]'' and ''cultivar'' may be confused with each other. A ''[[cultigen]]'' is any plant that is deliberately selected for or altered in cultivation, as opposed to an ''[[indigen]]''; the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' states that cultigens are "maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation".&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 2.3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultigen]]s can have names at any of many taxonomic ranks, including those of [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]], [[species]], [[cultivar group]], [[variety (botany)|variety]], [[forma (botany)|form]], and cultivar; and they may be plants that have been altered in cultivation, including by [[Genetically modified organism|genetic modification]], but have not been formally denominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cultigen]] or a component of a cultigen can be accepted as a cultivar if it is recognisable and has stable characters. Therefore, all cultivars are [[cultigen]]s, because they originate in cultivation, but not all cultigens are cultivars, because some cultigens have not been formally distinguished and denominated as cultivars.

== Formal definition ==
{{Main|International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants}}
The ''Cultivated Plant Code'' notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses: first, as a "classification category" the cultivar is defined in Article 2 of the ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'' (2009, 8th edition) as follows: ''The basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this Code is the cultivar.''&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 2.1 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two other classification categories for cultigens, the [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]]&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 4 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cultivar group|group]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Code'' then defines a ''cultivar'' as a "taxonomic unit within the classification category of cultivar". This is the sense of ''cultivar'' that is most generally understood and which is used as a general definition.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A cultivar is an assemblage of plants that (a)&amp;nbsp;has been selected for a particular character or combination of characters, (b)&amp;nbsp;is distinct, uniform and stable in those characters, and (c)&amp;nbsp;when propagated by appropriate means, retains those characters.''&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 2.2 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Different kinds ==
[[Image:Airport orchid.JPG|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;A cultivar of the orchid genus ''[[Oncidium]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]
Which plants are chosen to be named as cultivars is simply a matter of convenience as the category was created to serve the practical needs of [[horticulture]], [[agricultural science|agriculture]], and [[forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Preamble &amp; Principles {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of a particular cultivar are not necessarily genetically identical. The ''Cultivated Plant Code'' emphasizes that different cultivated plants may be accepted as different cultivars, even if they have the same genome, while cultivated plants with different genomes may be regarded as the same cultivar. The production of cultivars generally entails considerable human involvement although in a few cases it may be as little as simply selecting variation from plants growing in the wild (whether by collecting growing tissue to propagate from or by gathering seed).&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Article 2.20 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultivars generally occur as [[Ornamental plant|ornamentals]] and food crops: ''[[Malus]]'' '[[Granny Smith]]' and ''Malus'' '[[Red Delicious]]' are cultivars of apples propagated by cuttings or [[grafting]], ''[[Lactuca]]'' 'Red Sails' and ''Lactuca'' 'Great Lakes' are lettuce cultivars propagated by seeds. Named cultivars of ''[[Hosta]]'' and ''[[Hemerocallis]]'' plants are cultivars produced by [[micropropagation]] or division.

=== Clones ===
{{Main|Clone (botany)}}
[[Image:Leucospermum cultivar Edit.jpg|right|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;''[[Leucospermum]]'' 'Scarlet Ribbon'&lt;br&gt;A cross performed in Tasmania between ''[[Leucospermum glabrum|L.&amp;nbsp;glabrum]]'' and ''[[Leucospermum tottum|L.&amp;nbsp;tottum]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]
Cultivars that are produced asexually are genetically identical and known as [[Cloning|clones]]; this includes plants propagated by [[division (horticulture)|division]], [[layering]], [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]], [[grafting|grafts]], and [[budding]]. The propagating material may be taken from a particular part of the plant, such as a lateral branch, or from a particular phase of the life cycle, such as a juvenile leaf, or from aberrant growth as occurs with [[witch's broom]]. Plants whose distinctive characters are derived from the presence of an intracellular organism may also form a cultivar provided the characters are reproduced reliably from generation to generation. Plants of the same [[chimera (plant)|chimera]] (which have mutant tissues close to normal tissue) or graft-chimeras (which have vegetative tissue from different kinds of plants and which originate by grafting) may also constitute a cultivar.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.5–2.11 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seed-produced ===
Some cultivars "come true from seed", retaining their distinguishing characteristics when grown from seed. Such plants are termed a "variety", "selection" or "strain" but these are ambiguous and confusing words that are best avoided. In general, asexually propagated cultivars grown from seeds produce highly variable seedling plants, and should not be labelled with, or sold under, the parent cultivar's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhs.org.uk/learning/publications/plantsman/0605/opinion.asp Courses / RHS Gardening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226124519/http://www.rhs.org.uk/learning/publications/plantsman/0605/opinion.asp |date=2005-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seed-raised cultivars may be produced by uncontrolled pollination when characteristics that are distinct, uniform and stable are passed from parents to progeny. Some are produced as "lines" that are produced by repeated self-fertilization or inbreeding or "multilines" that are made up of several closely related lines. Sometimes they are [[F1&amp;nbsp;hybrid]]s which are the result of a deliberate repeatable single cross between two pure lines. A few F2 hybrid seed cultivars also exist, such as ''Achillea'' 'Summer Berries'.

Some cultivars are [[Agamospermy|agamospermous]] plants, which retain their genetic composition and characteristics under reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.17–2.18 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally cultivars are raised from seed of a specially selected provenance – for example the seed may be taken from plants that are resistant to a particular disease.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.12–2.16  {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetically modified ===
{{Main|Genetic engineering}}
Genetically modified plants with characteristics resulting from the deliberate implantation of genetic material from a different [[germplasm]] may form a cultivar. However, the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] notes, "In practice such an assemblage is often marketed from one or more lines or multilines that have been genetically modified. These lines or multilines often remain in a constant state of development which makes the naming of such an assemblage as a cultivar a futile exercise." &lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.19 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, retired transgenic varieties such as the [[Fish tomato]], which are no longer being developed, do not run into this obstacle and can be given a cultivar name.

Cultivars may be selected because of a change in the [[ploidy]] level of a plant which may produce more desirable characteristics.

== Cultivar names ==
[[Image:Viola x hybrida 'Clear Crystals Apricot', SC, Vic., 15.9.2007.jpg|right|210px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''Viola'' 'Clear Crystals Apricot'&lt;br&gt;The specific epithet may be omitted from a cultivar name&lt;/center&gt;]]
Every unique cultivar has a unique name within its denomination class (which is almost always the genus). Names of cultivars are regulated by the ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'', and may be registered with an [[International Cultivar Registration Authority]] (ICRA). There are sometimes separate registration authorities for different plant types such as roses and camellias. In addition, cultivars may be associated with commercial marketing names referred to in the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' as "trade designations" (see below).

=== Presenting in text ===
A ''cultivar name'' consists of a [[botanical name]] (of a genus, [[species]], infraspecific [[taxon]], interspecific [[Hybrid animal|hybrid]] or intergeneric hybrid) followed by a cultivar [[epithet]]. The cultivar epithet is enclosed by single quotes;&lt;ref name="Brickell 2009 19"/&gt; it should not be italicized if the botanical name is italicized;&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Recommendation 8A.1 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each of the words within the epithet is [[capitalization|capitalized]] (with some permitted exceptions such as conjunctions).&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Article 21.3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is permissible to place a cultivar epithet after a common name provided the common name is botanically unambiguous. Cultivar epithets published before 1 January 1959 were often given a [[Latin]] form and can be readily confused with the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithets]] in botanical names; after that date, newly coined cultivar epithets must be in a modern vernacular language to distinguish them from botanical epithets.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 14 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Examples of correct text presentation:
:: ''[[Cryptomeria japonica]]'' 'Elegans'
:: ''[[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana]]'' 'Aureomarginata' (pre-1959 name, [[Latin]] in form)
:: ''Chamaecyparis lawsoniana'' 'Golden Wonder' (post-1959 name, [[English language]])
:: ''[[Pinus densiflora]]'' 'Akebono' (post-1959 name, [[Japanese language]])
:: Apple 'Sundown'

: Some '''incorrect''' text presentation examples:
:: ''Cryptomeria japonica'' "Elegans" (double quotes are unacceptable)
:: ''Berberis thunbergii'' cv. 'Crimson Pygmy' (this once-common usage is now unacceptable, as it is no longer correct to use "cv." in this context; ''Berberis thunbergii'' 'Crimson Pygmy' is correct)
:: ''Rosa'' cv. 'Peace' (this is now incorrect for two reasons: firstly, the use of "cv."; secondly, "Peace" is a trade designation or "selling name" for the cultivar ''R.'' 'Madame A. Meilland' and should therefore be printed in a different typeface from the rest of the name, without quote marks, for example: ''Rosa''&lt;tt&gt; Peace&lt;/tt&gt;.)

== Group names ==
{{Main|Cultivar group}}
Where several very similar cultivars exist they can be associated into a ''Group'' (formerly ''Cultivar-group''). As Group names are used with cultivar names it is necessary to understand their way of presentation. Group names are presented in normal type and the first letter of each word capitalised as for cultivars, but they are not placed in single quotes. When used in a name, the first letter of the word "Group" is itself capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presenting in text ===
:: ''Brassica oleracea'' Capitata Group (the group of cultivars including all typical [[cabbage]]s)
:: ''Brassica oleracea'' Botrytis Group (the group of cultivars including all typical [[cauliflower]]s)
:: ''Hydrangea macrophylla'' Groupe Hortensia (in French) = ''Hydrangea macrophylla'' Hortensia Group (in English)
: Where cited with a cultivar name the group should be enclosed in parentheses, as follows:
:: ''Hydrangea macrophylla'' (Hortensia Group) 'Ayesha' &lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 15 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal protection of cultivars and their names ==
{{Intellectual property}}
{{further|Plant breeders' rights|Trademark}}
Since the 1990s there has been an increasing use of legal protection for newly produced cultivars. [[Plant breeding|Plant breeders]] expect legal protection for the cultivars they produce. According to proponents of such protections, if other growers can immediately propagate and sell these cultivars as soon as they come on the market, the breeder's benefit is largely lost.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gepts (2004) ''Who Owns Biodiversity, and How Should the Owners Be Compensated?'' Plant Physiology 134, pp. 1295–1307&lt;/ref&gt;
Legal protection for cultivars is obtained through the use of Plant breeders’ rights and plant Patents but the specific legislation and procedures needed to take advantage of this protection vary from country to country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bspb.co.uk/BSPB%20Handbook.pdf BSPB ''Plant breeding – The business and science of crop improvement''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911091226/http://www.bspb.co.uk/BSPB%20Handbook.pdf |date=2011-09-11 }} British Society of Plant Breeders booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial use of legal protection for cultivars ===
The use of legal protection for cultivars can be controversial, particularly for food crops that are staples in developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=647863 Adi, A.B.C., ''Intellectual Property Rights in Biotechnology and the Fate of Poor Farmers' Agriculture.''  Social Science Research Network]&lt;/ref&gt; or for plants selected from the wild and propagated for sale without any additional breeding work; some people consider this practice [[Ethics|unethical]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callygardens.co.uk/pbr_article.html 'Who owns nature?'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911145947/http://www.callygardens.co.uk/pbr_article.html |date=2011-09-11 }} (article by nurseryman and plant hunter Michael Wickenden, published in ''[[The Plantsman (magazine)|The Plantsman]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade designations and selling names ===
{{anchor|Trade designations|reason=Old section name, with many links to it.}}
The formal scientific name of a cultivar, like ''Solanum tuberosum'' ‘King Edward’, is a way of uniquely designating a particular kind of plant. This scientific name is in the public domain and cannot be legally protected. Plant retailers wish to maximize their share of the market and one way of doing this is to replace the cumbersome Latin scientific names on plant labels in retail outlets with appealing '''marketing names''' that are easy to use, pronounce, and remember. Marketing names lie outside the scope of the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' which refers to them as "'''trade designations'''". If a retailer or wholesaler has the sole legal rights to a marketing name then that may offer a sales advantage. Plants protected by [[plant breeders' rights]] (PBR) may have a "true" cultivar name – the recognized scientific name in the public domain – and a "commercial synonym" – an additional marketing name that is legally protected.  An example would be ''Rosa'' {{tdes|Fascination}} = 'Poulmax', in which ''Rosa'' is the genus, {{tdes|Fascination}} is the trade designation, and ‘Poulmax’ is scientific cultivar name.

Because a name that is attractive in one language may have less appeal in another country, a plant may be given different '''selling names''' from country to country. Quoting the original cultivar name allows the correct identification of cultivars around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|pages=76–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body coordinating plant breeders' rights is the [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]] ({{lang|fr|Union internationale pour la protection des obtentions végétales}}, UPOV) and this organization maintains a database of new cultivars protected by PBR in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dahlia - "Akita" cultivar.pjg.jpg|left|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;''[[Dahlia]]'' 'Akita' &lt;br&gt; A cultivar selected for flower form and colour&lt;/center&gt;]]
An ''International Cultivar Registration Authority'' (ICRA) is a voluntary, non-statutory organization appointed by the ''Commission for Nomenclature and Cultivar Registration'' of the International Society of Horticultural Science. ICRAs are generally formed by societies and institutions specializing in particular plant genera such as ''Dahlia'' or ''Rhododendron'' and are currently located in Europe, North America, China, India, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=62, 67–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ICRA produces an annual report and its reappointment is considered every four years. The main task is to maintain a register of the names within the group of interest and where possible this is published and placed in the public domain. One major aim is to prevent the duplication of cultivar and Group epithets within a genus, as well as ensuring that names are in accord with the latest edition of the ''Cultivated Plant Code''. In this way, over the last 50 years or so, ICRAs have contributed to the stability of cultivated plant nomenclature. In recent times many ICRAs have also recorded trade designations and trademarks used in labelling plant material, to avoid confusion with established names.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://www.ishs.org/sci/icralist/icralist.htm International Cultivar Registration Authorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

New names and other relevant data are collected by and submitted to the ICRA and in most cases there is no cost. The ICRA then checks each new epithet to ensure that it has not been used before and that it conforms with the ''Cultivated Plant Code''. Each ICRA also ensures that new names are formally established (i.e. published in hard copy, with a description in a dated publication). They record details about the plant, such as parentage, the names of those concerned with its development and introduction, and a basic description highlighting its distinctive characters. ICRAs are not responsible for assessing the distinctiveness of the plant in question.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Most ICRAs can be contacted electronically and many maintain web sites: for an up-to-date listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Exhibitionism''' is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context those parts of one's body that are not normally exposed &amp;ndash; for example, the [[breast]]s, [[Sex organ|genitals]] or [[buttocks]]. The practice may arise from a desire or compulsion to expose themselves in such a manner to groups of friends or acquaintances, or to strangers for their amusement or sexual satisfaction or to shock the bystander.&lt;ref name="baunach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baunach|first1=Dawn Michelle|title=Sex and Society|date=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7614-7906-2|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;lpg=PA220|accessdate=22 May 2017|chapter=Exhibitionism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing oneself only to an [[intimate partner]] is normally not regarded as exhibitionism. In law, the act of exhibitionism may be called [[indecent exposure]], "exposing one's person", or other expressions.

==History==

Public exhibitionism by women has been recorded since classical times, often in the context of women shaming groups of men into committing, or inciting them to commit, some public action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |title=Origin of the world |publisher=Rutgerspress.rutgers.edu |date=1977-09-23 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120094326/http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] gives an account of exhibitionistic behaviors from the fifth century BC in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]''. Herodotus writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;When people travel to [[Bubastis]] for the festival, this is what they do. Every ''baris'' carrying them there overflows with people, a huge crowd of them, men and women together. Some of the women have clappers, while some of the men have pipes which they play throughout the voyage. The rest of the men and women sing and clap their hands. When in the course of their journey they reach a community — not the city of their destination, but somewhere else — they steer the ''bareis'' close to the bank. Some of the women carry on doing what I have already described them as doing, but others shout out scornful remarks to the women in the town, or dance, or stand and pull up their clothes to expose themselves. Every riverside community receives this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''The Histories''. Trans. R. Waterfield. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. Book Two, Chapter 60, Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A case of what appears to be exhibitionism in a clinical sense was recorded in a report by the Commission against Blasphemy in Venice in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloch|first=Iwan|title=Fall von Exhibitionismus im 16. Jahrhundert|journal=Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft|year=1914|issue=Born|page=i.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the 4th draft of the revised Vagrancy Act of 1824 included an additional clause 'or openly and indecently exposing their persons' which gave rise to difficulties because of its ill-defined scope. During the course of a subsequent debate on the topic in Parliament, the then Home Secretary, Mr Peel, observed that 'there was not a more flagrant offence than that of indecently exposing the person which had been carried to an immense extent in the parks...wanton exposure was a very different thing from accidental exposure'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rooth|first=F.G.|title=Some Historical Notes on Indecent Exposure and Exhibitionism|journal=The Medico-Legal Journal|year=1970|volume=38|issue=4|series=Part 4|pages=135–139|pmid=4923872}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets has permitted some exhibitionists to reorient their methods such as with nude selfies.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Matt. "Being naked on the internet: young people’s selfies as intimate edgework." Journal of Youth Studies (2016): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
[[File:Charles Lasegue.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lasègue]] was the first to describe exhibitionism as a disorder in 1877.]]
Exhibitionism was first described as a disorder in 1877 by French physician and psychiatrist [[Charles Lasègue]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasègue C. Les Exhibitionistes. L'Union Médicale (Paris), series 3, vol. 23; 1877. Pages 709–714.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn | Aggrawal | 2009 | p=388 }} When exhibitionistic sexual interest is acted on with a non-consenting person or interferes with a person's quality of life or [[normality (behavior)|normal]] functioning, it can be diagnosed as ''exhibitionistic disorder'' in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', fifth edition ([[DSM-5]]). The DSM states that the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in men is 2% to 4%. It is thought to be much less common in women.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Exhibitionistic Disorder, 302.4 (F65.2) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 689–691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Swedish survey, 2.1% of women and 4.1% of men admitted to becoming sexually aroused from the exposure of their genitals to a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan | year = 2014 | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | location = New York City, NY | publisher = McGraw-Hill Education | page = 384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research team asked a sample of 185 exhibitionists, "How would you have preferred a person to react if you were to expose your privates to him or her?" The most common response was "Would want to have sexual intercourse" (35.1%), followed by "No reaction necessary at all" (19.5%), "To show their privates also" (15.1%), "Admiration" (14.1%), and "Any reaction" (11.9%). Only very few exhibitionists chose "Anger and disgust" (3.8%) or "Fear" (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freund, K. |author2=Watson, R. |author3= Rienzo, D. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 1988 | title = The value of self-reports in the study of voyeurism and exhibitionism | journal = Annals of Sex Research | volume = 2 | pages = 243–262 | url = http://sax.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/2/243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of exposure==
[[File:Mardi Gras Flashing - Color.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A woman publicly exposing her bare breasts at [[Mardi Gras]], USA, 2008]]
Various types of behavior are classified as exhibitionism,&lt;ref name="baunach"/&gt; including:
*'''[[Anasyrma]]''': the lifting of the [[skirt]] when not wearing [[underwear]], to expose genitals.
*'''[[Candaulism]]''': when a person exposes his or her partner in a sexually provocative manner.
*'''Flashing''': the momentary display of bare female [[breasts]] by a woman with an up-and-down lifting of the shirt or [[bra]] or the exposure of a man's or woman's [[genitalia]].

[[File:Mooning.jpg|thumb|250px|Students mooning at [[Stanford University]], intended as both an unspecified protest and also a [[world record]] attempt of most number of people simultaneously mooning others.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">In [[radio engineering]], a '''frequency offset''' is an intentional slight [[frequency shift (disambiguation)|shift]] of broadcast [[radio frequency]] (RF), to reduce [[RF interference|interference]] with other transmitters.

== Interference ==
The most important problem encountered in broadcasting via terrestrial transmitters is the interference from other broadcasters. In principle, each broadcaster has a different radio frequency (planned by the public authority) in a common reception area to avoid interference from each other. However still there are two problems: spurious radiation of adjacent channels and fringe reception. 

[[TV and FM DX|Fringe reception]] is unintended reception under certain weather conditions.  The exceptionally long-range reception means that the receiver may be tuned to more than one transmitter (transmitting at same frequency) at the same time.  These transmitters may transmit programs of different broadcasters as well as the programs of the same broadcaster. In analogue transmission, even the transmitters transmitting the very same program interfere each other because of phase differences of the incoming [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], but in [[Digital data|digital]] transmission the transmitters transmitting the same program in the same channel may reinforce each other.

== The shift in RF ==

In order to reduce the interference from the fringe area transmitters transmitting in the same channels, a method named frequency offset is often used. By this method, a slightly shifted RF is assigned for a transmitter which may be interfered by other transmitters.  

In TV transmission, the shifted RF is calculated by the formula;

:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} = f_{ch} + \frac{f_L\cdot p}{12}&lt;/math&gt;
where,  
:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} &lt;/math&gt; is the offset RF,
:&lt;math&gt; f_{ch}&lt;/math&gt; is the standard channel frequency, 
:&lt;math&gt;p &lt;/math&gt; is an integer such that &lt;math&gt;-12&lt;p&lt;12&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_L &lt;/math&gt; is the line frequency. ( '''15625 Hz.''' for [[625-line]] systems, '''15750 Hz.''' for [[CCIR System M|System M]] and System J and '''20475 Hz.''' for [[Analog high-definition television system|system E]])

'''Precision offset''' is the same as frequency offset, except that in this case, the offset frequency is produced by a [[cesium]] controlled oscillator.

== Example ==

'''8p''' offset of channel '''9''' in system B can be found readily

The standard visual [[carrier frequency]] is '''203.25''' MHz The line frequency is '''15 625''' Hz.

:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} = 203 250 000 + \frac{15626\cdot 8}{12} \approx 203260417&lt;/math&gt;

'''8n''' offset of the same channel is likewise 

:&lt;math&gt;f_{os} = 203 250 000 - \frac{15626\cdot 8}{12} \approx 203239583&lt;/math&gt;

'''Helen Singer Kaplan''' (February 6, 1929 – August 17, 1995) was an [[Austrian-American]] [[sex therapist]] and the founder of the first clinic in the United States for [[sexual disorder]]s established at a [[medical school]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Kaplan as someone who was "considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-05 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/19/obituaries/dr-helen-kaplan-66-dies-pioneer-in-sex-therapy-field.html |title=Dr. Helen Kaplan, 66, Dies; Pioneer in Sex Therapy Field |work=The New York Times |date=1995-08-19 |author=Saxon, Wolfgang }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also dubbed the "Sex Queen" because of her role as a pioneer in sex therapy during the [[sexual revolution in 1960s America]], and because of her advocacy of the idea that people should enjoy [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] as much as possible, as opposed to seeing it as something dirty or harmful. The main purpose of her dissertation is to evaluate the psychosexual dysfunctions because these syndromes are among the most prevalent, worrying and distressing medical complaints of modern times.&lt;ref name=pa /&gt;

==Life==
Kaplan was born in [[Vienna]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], on February 6, 1929. In 1940, she emigrated to The United States, becoming a citizen in 1947. She received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from [[Syracuse University]] in 1951, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]''. She was then educated at [[Columbia University]], where she received a [[master's degree]] in [[psychology]] in 1952, and then a [[PhD]] in psychology in 1955. At [[New York Medical College]], she earned a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in 1959, and later completed a comprehensive course in [[psychoanalysis]] there in 1970. In 1964, she initiated a unique residency program for women MDs with children at New York Medical College, the "mother's program" enabled residents to be free during vacations and emergencies to care for their children.&lt;ref&gt;Medical World News, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; She was a long-time professor of psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]]. She died of cancer at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; At the time of her death, she was married to [[Toys "R" Us]] founder [[Charles Lazarus]].

==Sex research and therapy==
A psychologist and psychiatrist by training, Kaplan viewed [[Sexual arousal|human sexual response]] as a triphasic phenomenon, consisting of separate—but interlocking—phases: desire, arousal, and orgasm.&lt;ref name=MJK&gt;William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny, ''Human Sexuality'', 2nd ed.  Little, Brown, &amp; Co., Boston, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  She concluded that "desire" phase disorders are the most difficult to treat, being associated with deep-seated psychological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kaplan, ''Disorders of Sexual Desire''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan wrote extensively on the treatment of sexual dysfunctions, integrating other methods with principles of psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=MJK /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy''.  Quadrangle/New York Times, New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  As did many other experts in her field, Kaplan believed that sexual difficulties typically had superficial origins.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; She suggested that premature ejaculation occurred if the subject did not have voluntary control over when he ejaculated, and that coitally anorgasmic women should not necessarily be thought of as having a problem.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The New Sex Therapy''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan always encouraged people to enjoy having sex as much as possible. However, since the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|epidemic of AIDS into the United States]] from 1981 into the 1990s, she has had to add the caveat: "If you aren't extremely careful, it can kill you." Kaplan commented that she "absolutely hate[s] having to say that. [...] I have spent my whole life devising solutions to people's problems, telling them that sex is not dirty or harmful, but a natural function. And now I have to tell them, 'Hey, look out. You could die.'"&lt;ref name=pa&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning Women About AIDS for Years |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=1987-11-08 |author=Hacker, Kathy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her disciples are [[Ruth Westheimer]] and [[Hans-Werner Gessmann]] (in 1976, who added to sex therapy his own humanistic psychological and [[hypnosis]] approaches).

In botany, a '''hilum''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|l|ə|m}}) is a scar or mark left on a [[seed coat]] by the former attachment to the ovary wall or to the [[Ovule|funiculus]] (which in turn attaches to the ovary wall). On a [[bean]] seed, the hilum is called the "eye".

For some species of [[fungus]], the hilum is the microscopic indentation left on a [[spore]] when it separates from the [[sterigma]] of the [[basidium]].&lt;ref name=Kirk2008&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CABI |location=Wallingford, UK |year=2008 |page=317 |isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hilum can also be a nucleus of a starch grain; the point around which layers of starch are deposited.

The adjectival form ''hilar'' denotes the presence of such a mark, and can be used as a distinguishing characteristic of a [[seed]] or [[spore]].

[[Knot]]s and '''knotting''' have been used and studied throughout '''[[history]]'''. For example, [[Chinese knotting]] is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of Chinese folk art in the Tang and Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) in China, later popularized in the Ming. [[Knot theory]] is the recent mathematical study of [[unknot]]s.

Knots of ancient origin include the [[bottle sling]], [[bowline]], [[cat's paw (knot)|cat's paw]], [[clove hitch]], [[cow hitch]], [[double fisherman's knot]], [[eskimo bowline]], [[figure-eight knot]], [[fisherman's knot]], [[half hitch]], [[kalmyk loop]], [[one-sided overhand bend]], [[overhand knot]], [[overhand loop]], [[reef knot]], [[running bowline]], [[single hitch]], [[thief knot]], [[Turk's head knot]], and [[two half-hitches]].

The eleven main knots of Chinese knotting are the four-flower knot, six-flower knot, [[Chinese button knot]], [[Matthew Walker knot|double connection knot]], [[carrick bend|double coin knot]], agemaki, [[friendship knot|cross knot]], square knot, Plafond knot, [[endless knot|Pan Chang knot]], and the good luck knot.

Knots of more recent origin include the [[friendship knot]] of Chinese knotting. The [[sheepshank|sheepshank knot]] originates from 1627 while the [[Western Union splice]] originates from the beginning of [[telegraphy]].

'''Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal''' ('''IISER-B''' or '''IISER - Bhopal''') is an autonomous research and education institute in [[Bhauri]], [[Bhopal district]], Madhya Pradesh, India. It was established by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], Government of India in 2008 in order to incorporate research in basic science at undergraduate and graduate level, with equal emphasis on higher education for research and education in science. It is an autonomous institution awarding its own degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions of Higher Education|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/iisc-bangalore-iisers|work=Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs) were created in 2006 through a proclamation of [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], Government of [[India]], under the category of institiutes of national importance, to promote quality education and research in basic sciences. Soon after the announcement, two of these institutes at [[Pune]] and [[Kolkata]], respectively, were started in 2006. This was followed by institutes at [[Mohali]] (2007), [[Bhopal]] and [[Trivandrum]] (2008), Tirupati (2015) and [[Berhampur]] (2016). Each [[IISER]] is a degree granting autonomous institution with a prime focus to integrate [[science]] [[education]] and [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=https://www.iiserb.ac.in/page.php?page=Background%20&amp;pid=9&amp;id=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish Planning Institute''' ('''IPI''') is an all-island professional body representing professional planners engaged in [[Spatial planning|physical]] and [[environmental planning]] in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. 

The IPI works with both its members and other built environment professionals to promote and improve the quality of planning, to represent the views of the planning profession and to contribute to education and environmental awareness in the wider community.

This is achieved through the hosting of conferences and CPD Events for its members; awarding, recognising and publishing best practice; making submissions on behalf of the planning profession on national policies, governance and other relevant publications and papers; and by representing the values of planning and planning professionals in the general media.

== Activities ==

The Irish Planning Institute is an active member of the [[ECTP-CEU|European Council of Spatial Planners]] and has held the Presidency of this organisation. Through this involvement, the Institute not only represents Irish planning interests abroad but also forges important links with sister institutions in Europe. It is also a member of the Global Planners Network.

The IPI inspects and accredits on invitation a number of planning courses in universities and other third level educational institutions across the island of Ireland. The Institute is also a nominating body to [[Seanad Éireann]] and to [[An Bord Pleanála]].

The Irish Planning Institute lobbies central [[Government of Ireland|Government]] on new legislation and on planning policy at national, regional and local levels.  It also from time to time issues statements on current topics of public interest and debate.

The IPI publishes "Pleanáil" which is the only technical publication on planning theory and professional planning practice published in Ireland. 

Through its annual National Planning Conference, the Institute offers a major forum for the debate of planning and related topics.  It also organises the National Planning Awards every two years and a series of CPD events throughout the year to promote best practice and to inform our membership regarding new approaches and policies.

== Membership ==

The Irish Planning Institute has six categories of membership: Fellowship, Corporate, Graduate, Student, Affiliate and Honorary. 

'''Fellowship''' is generally awarded to professionally qualified planners who have considerable professional planning experience and who have made an important contribution to the development of the Institute. 

'''Corporate Membership''', which is the main class of membership, is open to professionally qualified planners those who have reached a standard of knowledge, skill and professional experience necessary to engage in planning in Ireland, in the public sector or in private practice.  This class of membership is also open to qualified professional planners who are full members of the member Institutes of the European Council of Spatial Planners, and to recently qualified planners from other countries, subject to appropriate post-qualification experience, under the provisions of the [[Directive (European Union)|European Directive]] on Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications.

'''Graduate Membership''' is available to those who have acquired an IPI accredited planning qualification and, under certain circumstances, those who have been awarded planning qualifications which have not been accredited by the IPI.

Persons engaged in a programme of formal study leading to an IPI accredited planning qualification from a planning school are eligible for '''Student Membership''' of the Institute.

'''Affiliate Membership''' can be awarded to persons who have a professional qualification that is related to planning, who have been engaged in approved research or practice related to planning and who have been engaged in approved research or practice relating to planning, and who have made a special contribution to planning in Ireland.

'''Honorary Membership''' is generally awarded as an honour on an individual whose special interests have been deemed by the Institute to have made an outstanding contribution to planning.

== Governance ==

The Council of the IPI, which is the governing body of the Institute, is directly elected by the Members by postal ballot.

The aims of the Planning Institute are: 

* To raise the standards of planning.
* To articulate professional planning opinion.
* To improve and promote the status of the planning profession.
* To contribute to planning education.
* To encourage environmental awareness in the community.
* To represent Irish planning interests abroad.

There are a number of regional and sectoral branches within the Institute.  The Regional Branches are: the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] Branch, the [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midland]] Branch, the [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West]] Branch, the [[West Region, Ireland|Western]] Branch, the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South Eastern]] Branch, the [[Greater Dublin Area]] Branch and the [[Northern Ireland|Northern]] Branch (covering members in Northern Ireland).  The sectoral Branch is the Private Practice Branch, covering members working in private practice throughout the island of Ireland.

'''Isochronic tones''' are regular beats of a single [[Pitch (music)|tone]] that are used alongside [[monaural beats]] and [[binaural beats]] in the process called [[brainwave entrainment]]. At its simplest level, an isochronic tone is a tone that is being turned on and off rapidly. They create sharp, distinctive pulses of sound.

The '''Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo Mauro Picone''' ({{lang-en|Institute for Calculus Applications "Mauro Picone"}}), abbreviated '''IAC''', is an [[applied mathematics]] [[institute]], part of the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]]. It was founded in 1927 as a private research institute by [[Mauro Picone]],&lt;ref name="G.and.F" /&gt; and as such it is considered the first applied and computational mathematics institute of such kind ever founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fichera|1995|pp=10–11}}, {{harv|Fichera|1999|p=297}}, {{harv|Benzi|2005|loc=p. 3 of the preprint version}} and the references cited in this latter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical notes==
The IAC was founded 1927 by Mauro Picone,&lt;ref name="G.and.F" /&gt; while working an the [[University of Naples Federico II]] and at the [[Istituto Universitario Navale]] as professor of [[infinitesimal calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Ghizzetti|1986|p=111}}, {{harv|De Angelis|Sbordone|1999|p=7}}, {{harv|Fichera|1995|pp=10–11}}, {{harv|Fichera|1999|p=297}}, {{harvtxt|Ghizzetti|1986|p=111}} states explicitly his professorship, while {{harvtxt|De Angelis|Sbordone|1999|p=7}} describes briefly his involvement in teaching at the Istituto Universitario Navale.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luigi Amoroso]] also contributed to the founding of the institute, by providing to his former ''[[Scuola Normale Superiore|Normale]]'' schoolfellow Picone the funding for the creation of the Institute by means of the [[Banco di Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvtxt|Fichera|1950|p=1}}, {{Harvtxt|Fichera|1986|p=81}}, {{Harvtxt|Fichera|1999|p=307}} and {{Harvtxt|Benzi|2005|loc=p. 3 of the preprint version}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only in 1932, when Picone moved from the University of Naples to the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], that the Institute became part of the Italian National Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harv|Ghizzetti|1986|p=111}}, {{harv|De Angelis|Sbordone|1999|p=7}}, {{Harvtxt|Fichera|1986|p=81}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1999|p=307}}, {{Harv|Benzi|2005|loc=p. 3 of the preprint version}}, {{Harv|Benzi|Toscano|2005|p=114}}: however many other published biographical and/or research achievements surveys on Mauro Picone cite this fact.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ruskin''' (8 February 1819&amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1900) was the leading English [[art critic]] of the [[Victorian era]], as well as an art patron, [[Drawing|draughtsman]], [[watercolor|watercolourist]], a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as [[geology]], [[architecture]], myth, [[ornithology]], [[literature]], [[education]], [[botany]] and [[political economy]].

His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.

He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J.M.W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s, he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Robert |last=Hewison| id=24291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John James Ruskin, (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer,&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]). John James was born and brought up in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to a mother from [[Glenluce]] and a father originally from [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage: A Prelude'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Margaret Cox, née Cock (1781–1871), was the daughter of an aunt on the English side of the family and a publican in [[Croydon]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; She had joined the Ruskin household when she became companion to John James's mother, Catherine.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

John James had hoped to practice law, and was articled as a clerk in London.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; His father, John Thomas Ruskin, described as a grocer (but apparently an ambitious wholesale merchant), was an incompetent businessman. To save the family from bankruptcy, John James, whose prudence and success were in stark contrast to his father, took on all debts, settling the last of them in 1832.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; John James and Margaret were engaged in 1809, but opposition to the union from John Thomas, and the issuance of the debt, delayed their wedding which was finally conducted without celebration in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John James died on 3 March 1864 and is buried in the churchyard of St John the Evangelist, Shirley, Croydon.

===Childhood and education===
[[File:John Ruskin by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|Ruskin as a young child, painted by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]].]]
Ruskin was born at 54 Hunter Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London (demolished 1969), south of [[St Pancras railway station]].&lt;ref name="Childhood"&gt;''ODNB''  (2004) "Childhood and education"&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was characterised by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]], in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/] {{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Ruskin, an [[Low church|Evangelical]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}} Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[King James Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.

Ruskin's childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished c. 1912), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Dearden, John Ruskin's Camberwell (Brentham Press for Guild of St George, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the friendless and toyless experience he later claimed in his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89).&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, and from 1834 to 1835 attended the school in [[Peckham]] run by the progressive Evangelical, Thomas Dale (1797–1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm |title=UCL Bloomsbury Project |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at [[King's College London|King's College, London]], where Dale was the first Professor of English Literature.&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; Ruskin went on to enroll and complete his studies at [[King's College London|King's College]], where he prepared for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] under Dale's tutelage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/johnkeats.aspx |title=King's College London - John Keats |website=Kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pookpress.co.uk/project/john-ruskin-biography/ |title=John Ruskin Biography &gt;&gt; Classic Stories |website=Pookpress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|upright|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives]]
Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. Travel helped establish his taste and augmented his education. His father visited business clients in Britain's country houses, exposing him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his 1830 tour)&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to relations in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope, so that in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], Milan, [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed his lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 he first visited [[Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 'Paradise of cities' that formed both the symbolism and subject of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.453n2}}

The tours provided Ruskin with the opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship's Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of [[Samuel Rogers]]'s poem, ''Italy'' (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and [[Samuel Prout]] whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding]].

===First publications of Ruskin===
Ruskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem "On Skiddaw and Derwent Water" (originally entitled "Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater" and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=2.265-8}} In 1834, three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close "scientific" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.191-6}}

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin's ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name "Kata Physin" (Greek for "According to Nature").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings which centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials, and anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin's 'Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science' was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.206-10}}

===Oxford===
In [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017013829/http://artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]], he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers.  Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].

His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).&lt;ref&gt;For his winning poem, "Salsette and Elephanata", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Dearden, "The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin (4671937).jpg|thumb|Engraving of John Ruskin by Henry Sigismund Uhlrich]]
Much of the period, from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev [[John Eagles]], in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and, from 1839, Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]] under the anonymous but authoritative title, "A Graduate of Oxford," was Ruskin's response to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]'s critics. An electronic edition is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |title=the electronic edition of John Ruskin's "Modern Painters" Volume I |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=28 June 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called "[[Old Masters]]" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]], unlike Turner, favoured pictorial convention, and not "truth to nature". He explained that he meant "moral as well as material truth".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio—to render what he has seen and understood imaginatively on canvas, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the "truths" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin's relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent again with his parents in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]] but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on [[Venice]]: "Venice is lost to me," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only true course was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated more on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: "the Beautiful as a gift of God".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}}  In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively through symbols. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to take.&lt;ref&gt;See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]] just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==
[[File:Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais by Thomas Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Effie Gray painted by [[Thomas Richmond]]. She thought the portrait made her look like "a graceful Doll".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?LinkID=mp07473&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=art |title=NPG 5160; Effie Gray (Lady Millais) – Portrait |publisher= National Portrait Gallery |website=Npg.org.uk |date=26 December 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for Effie that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |title=May 7th 1828 |publisher=Perthshire Diary |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Largely owing to this association, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds' earliest travelling together was limited, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]] (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill) secured for them by Ruskin's father. Effie was too ill to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring the social conscience that became increasingly sensitive.

The marriage, not consummated, later dissolved under discord and eventual annulment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Phyllis |year=2010 |title=Parallel lives five Victorian marriages |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0307761509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Ruskin's developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his work.

''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of [[A. W. N. Pugin]].

In August 1850 Ruskin and Effie were at [[Wenlock Abbey]] where Ruskin sketched some of the arcading in the Norman [[Chapter House]], which was used in ''The Stones of Venice''.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, October 2013, Ruskin Lost in Shades of Gray, Shropshire Magazine, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Stones of Venice''===
In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |title=Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks 1849–50 |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, 'The Nature of Gothic' appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan's joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, not machinery.

{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and socialist, [[William Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pre-Raphaelites===
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pp. 228–34, April 1996. (Accessed via [[JSTOR]], UK.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had established the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to 'naturalism'&amp;nbsp;– "paint[ing] from nature only",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.357n}} depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin came into contact with Millais after the artists approached him through their mutual friend [[Coventry Patmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to ''[[The Times]]'' in May 1851.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.319–335}} Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at [[Glenfinlas]], he painted the closely observed landscape background of [[gneiss]] rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin's [[John Ruskin (painting)|portrait]].

Millais had painted Effie for ''[[The Order of Release|The Order of Release, 1746]]'', exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

In April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of "non-consummation" owing to his "incurable [[impotence|impotency]],"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; a charge Ruskin later disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wrote, "I can prove my virility at once."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of continued speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''ODNB'': "Critic of Contemporary Art".&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who became a good friend (he called him "Brother Ned").&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making and breaking reputations. The satirical magazine, ''[[punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', for example, published the lines (24 May 1856), "I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I'm dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udKymsQhKMEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20paints%20and%20paints%2C%2Fhears%20no%20complaints%2FAnd%20sells%20before%20I%E2%80%99m%20dry%2C%2FTill%20savage%20Ruskin%20sticks%20his%20tusk%20in%2FThen%20nobody%20will%20buy ] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] drawings to the [[Ashmolean]] in [[Oxford]], and a further 25 to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |title=Fitzwilliam Museum Collections Explorer |website=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903031532/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.&lt;ref&gt;The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000), curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]]. The [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in the ''Little Church of St Francis'' Funtley, [[Fareham, Hampshire]] is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the ''St. Peter's Church'' Duntisbourne Abbots near [[Cirencester]], the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Low &amp; Julie Graham, ''The stained glass window of the Little Church of St. Francis'', private publication August 2002 &amp; April 2006, for viewing Fareham Library reference Section or the [[Westbury Manor Museum]] Ref: section Fareham, hants; [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.low1/funtley/funtleychurch.htm The stained glass window of the Church of St. Francis.

Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive "Ruskinian Gothic".&lt;ref&gt;J. Mordaunt Crook, "Ruskinian Gothic" in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'' ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his friendship with [[Sir Henry Acland]], from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]]) which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin and education===
The [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin's first direct involvement in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |title=John Ruskin on education |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805231329/http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin's ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.&lt;ref&gt;''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing embraced by its principal, Miss Bell.&lt;ref&gt;''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin's correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association led to Ruskin's sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (published December 1865, imprinted 1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington girls in which he cast himself as the "Old Lecturer".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cole, ''"Be Like Daisies": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon [[Somerville College]], one of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s first two [[women's college]]s, which he visited regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Anne|title=Breaking New Ground: A History of Somerville College as seen through its Buildings|page=12|date=2013|publisher=Somerville College|location=Oxford|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated many of his books to the [[Somerville College Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===
Both volumes III and IV of ''Modern Painters'' were published in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is "the expression of the spirits of great men".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. ''MP'' IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and its moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, "The Mountain Glory" and "The Mountain Gloom"&lt;ref&gt;Francis O'Gorman, "Ruskin's Mountain Gloom" in Rachel Dickinson and Keith Hanley (eds), ''Ruskin's Struggle for Coherence: Self-Representation through Art, Place and Society'' (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), pp. 76–89.&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early example of Ruskin's social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.385–417, 418–68}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Ruskin‟s Dialectic: Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory" in ''Ruskin Programme Bulletin'', no. 25 (January 2001), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public lecturer===
In addition to his more formal teaching classes, Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer in the 1850s. His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], Manchester in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]'s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.9-174}} He spoke about how to acquire, and how to use art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's intervention outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|"Manchester School" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''[[Manchester Examiner and Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–05.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L. Spates. [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/vanburd1.html An Introduction to Helen Gill Viljoen's Unpublished Biography of Ruskin by Van Akin Burd]; [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/spates1.html Editor's Introductory Comments on Viljoen's Chapter by James L.

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day [[Anglia Ruskin University]] has grown.&lt;ref&gt;For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177–206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and Cambridge" in ''The Companion'' (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8–10. [Revised version of inaugural Ruskin Lecture, Anglia Ruskin University, 11 October 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Two Paths'' (1859), five lectures given in London, [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge]]{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251–426}} Ruskin argued that a 'vital law' underpins art and architecture, drawing on the [[labour theory of value]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251}} (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–87.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, to Germany and [[Switzerland]].

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner's]] death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner's will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. In 1856, Ruskin's book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner's drawings, was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858: cataloguing, framing and conserving.&lt;ref&gt;For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin's design.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner's erotic drawings,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1 (Spring 2003), pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt; but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Misinterpreting Ruskin: New light on the "dark clue‟ in the basement of the National Gallery, 1857–58" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 35–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below, [[John Ruskin#Turner's erotic drawings|Controversies: Turner's Erotic Drawings]])

===Religious "unconversion"===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]] where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the Queen of Sheba''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his "unconversion" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.89}} But in reality he had doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, threatened by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "those dreadful hammers!" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], "I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.115}} This "loss of faith" precipitated a considerable crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.2.html |title=Chapter Four, Section II.

===Social critic and reformer: ''Unto This Last''===
{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Whenever I look or travel in England or abroad, I see that men, wherever they can reach, destroy all beauty. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 7.V.422–3 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

Although Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, "I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life" the break was not so dramatic or final.&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin's emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end of the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'', ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn  18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=There is no wealth but life. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration.

|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays, ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the "science" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.&lt;ref&gt;For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by a politics of [[social justice]]. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the "[[social economy]]" characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.15–118}} However, its editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, "reprobated in a violent manner".&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, "I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;Q. in James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's political ideas, and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' in particular, later proved highly influential, praised and paraphrased in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], a wide range of autodidacts, the economist [[John A. Hobson]] and many of the founders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour party]].&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of Ruskin's social and political thought: Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (I.B. Tauris, 2007) and Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote "I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn  27.167 and 35.13.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in duties and responsibilities to, and under, God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

Ruskin's explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of  ''[[Modern Painters]]'' focused on [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Titian]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest art are held together, like human communities, in quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive. Uniting ''[[Modern Painters]]'' V and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' is Ruskin's "Law of Help":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/galib64.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=6 July 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all things, the laws of death. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 7.207 and 17.25.&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', under the editorship of [[James Anthony Froude]], cut short his ''Essays on Political Economy'' (1862–63) (later collected as ''Munera Pulveris'' (1872)).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.129–298}}  Ruskin explored further political themes in ''Time and Tide'' (1867),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.309–484}} his letters to Thomas Dixon, the cork-cutter in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]] with a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin's sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father's death in 1864, Ruskin inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison's ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: "A Mid-Life Crisis").&lt;/ref&gt; This considerable inheritance from the father he described on his tombstone as "an entirely honest merchant"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils), by buying property in [[Marylebone]] for her philanthropic housing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Ruskin's endeavours extended to a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

===Lectures in the 1860s===
Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, [[Camberwell]] on "Work" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War'. Ruskin's widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html |title=Moral Taste in Ruskin's "Traffic" |website=Victorianweb.org |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I do not care about this Exchange," Ruskin told his audience, "because ''you'' don't!"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.383–533}}

[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]
The lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. "Of Kings' Treasuries" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. "Of Queens' Gardens" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin's most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.19-187}} The book's reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at "Of Queens' Gardens" particularly as an effort to "subvert the new heresy" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millett, Sexual Politics.  New York: Doubleday and Co., 1970, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford's first Slade Professor of Fine Art===
[[File:Vanity Fair Caricature of Ruskin.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1872]]
Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]] in August 1869, largely through the offices of his friend, [[Henry Acland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, "The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues.". Thus, its effect on each man should be visible and moving.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:121)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil Rhodes]] cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Symonds, 'Oxford and the Empire', in [[M. G. Brock]] and M. C. Curthoys (eds.), ''The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VII: Nineteenth-Century Oxford, part 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 689–716, specifically p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at [[Oxford]], [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |title=Oxford University Archives &amp;#124; Home |website=Oua.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally accommodated within the [[Ashmolean Museum]] but now occupies premises on "the High" (High Street). Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) with which to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government schools (the "South Kensington System").&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"&gt;See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Bibliography). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of "Art" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle's Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. "The teaching of Art...," Ruskin wrote, "is the teaching of all things."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist's work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |title=John Ruskin green plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, which included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer, [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably [[Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.&lt;/ref&gt; and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, "Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, resigning again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Latter Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],&lt;ref&gt;Jed Mayer, "Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–22.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"/&gt; He was also suffering increasingly poor health.

===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler Libel Case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his (originally) monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his [[Work of art|oeuvre]], and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]).

In the July 1877 letter of ''Fors Clavigera'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.160}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin''. – book review, ''Art in America'', January 1993, by Wendy Steiner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827175109/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 |date=27 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin. Whistler won the case, which went to trial in Ruskin's absence in 1878 (he was ill), but the jury awarded damages of only one [[British farthing coin|farthing]] to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription, but Whistler was bankrupted within six months. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, however, and may have accelerated his mental decline.&lt;ref&gt;For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's consistently exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in "blood-red".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Guild of St George===
Ruskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George's Fund, and then St George's Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27–29}} A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called "Companions" whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally.&lt;ref&gt;For the Guild's constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn  30.3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal mechanical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235259/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired some land and a remarkable collection of books, art and other precious and beautiful objects.&lt;ref&gt;On the origins of the Guild: Edith Hope Scott, ''Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Methuen, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin purchased land initially in [[Totley]], near [[Sheffield]], but the agricultural element of his scheme met with only moderate success after many difficulties. Donations of land from wealthy and committed Companions eventually placed land and properties in the Guild's care: [[Wyre Forest]], near [[Bewdley]], Worcestershire;&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Wardle and Cedric Quayle, ''Ruskin and Bewdley'' (Brentham Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barmouth]], in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]]; [[Cloughton]], in [[North Yorkshire]]; and [[Westmill]] in Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ruskinland.htm |title=Ruskinland |website=Utopia-britannica.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of "Companion", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild's own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George's Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd's Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]], publishing some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable organisation, has only ever operated on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George's Mill was established at [[Laxey]], on the [[Isle of Man]] producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent, but allied, efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press Ltd., 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sheffield]], in 1875, Ruskin established a museum for the working men of that city, and surrounding areas. Originally situated in [[Walkley]] and curated by Henry Swan, St. George's Museum housed a large collection of art works (original pencil sketches, architectural drawings, watercolours, copies of Old Masters and so on), minerals, geological specimens, manuscripts (many of them medieval in origin) and a multitude of other beautiful and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Sheffield City Council, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, "the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise confined to the wealthy who could afford to travel through Europe. The original Museum has been virtually recreated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |title=Ruskin at Walkley |publisher=Ruskin at Walkley |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]]. The collection is currently (2011) on display at [[Sheffield]]'s [[Millennium Galleries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/collections/ruskin-collection |title=eMuseum |website=Museums-sheffield.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose La Touche===
[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rose La Touche'', as sketched by Ruskin]]
Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten, Ruskin nearly 39. Ruskin gradually fell in love with her. Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin's own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildar''e [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; "Ruskin‟s "Wild Rose of Kildare", pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him, and always a source of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;See Van Akin Burd, ''John Ruskin and Rose La Touche: Her unpublished Diaries of 1861 and 1867'' (Clarendon Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867, but she asked him to wait three years for an answer, until she was 21. A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter. She finally rejected him in 1872, but they still occasionally met, for the final time on 15 February 1875. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature. Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]] and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones "to give," he said, "what guidance I may to travallers..."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new "Travellers' Edition" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark's Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).

===Return to belief===
In December 1875, Ruskin's desire for a meaningful universe and a life after death, both for himself and his loved ones, brought him back to Christianity. He never publicly related the date and cause of his return to belief, but his letters demonstrate that on 20 December 1875, a spiritualist seance at Broadlands convinced him that the ghost of Rose La Touche had appeared at his side.

While the direct link between Ruskin's faith and this event cannot be made, his subsequent writings demonstrate a return to Christianity. In ''Praeterita'' he affirms that [[Christ]] will return "and judge every man according to his work". These beliefs were often unquestioning, and even anti-intellectual. An example of this is a letter of 1876, in which he did "not think the question of the Trinity or Unity is one for Man to discuss."&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"/&gt;

===Final writings===
[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]
In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.265–397}} and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, 'Of Past Things'), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the "l'art pour l'art" or "art for art's sake" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.

===Brantwood===
[[File:John Ruskin's grave, and family plot - geograph.org.uk - 1231315.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Ruskin, in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] churchyard]]
In August 1871, Ruskin purchased from [[W. J. Linton]] the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]], on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |title=Museum, Arts Centre &amp; Self Catering Accommodation Coniston |website=Brantwood.org.uk |date=14 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ruskin's 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with a congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235342/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Brantwood]] from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], according to his wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&amp;search=RANDOM&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and |title= Look and Learn History Picture Library |website=Lookandlearn.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness (thought in retrospect to have been [[CADASIL syndrome]]), he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly "companion" to Ruskin's mother) and she inherited his estate. "Joanna's Care" was the eloquent final chapter of his memoir which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.&lt;ref&gt;For Ruskin's relationship with Joan Severn, see ''John Ruskin's Correspondence with Joan Severn: Sense and Nonsense Letters'' ed. Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his Will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin's ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to articulate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.&lt;ref&gt;James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, 'John Ruskin‟s Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no. 1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centenary of Ruskin's birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of Ruskin's home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;See James S. Dearden, ''Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood: the Growth of the Whitehouse Collection'' (Ryburn, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, it was opened to the public as a permanent memorial to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brantwood.org.uk/temp.../History%20of%20Brantwood%202pp.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal appearance===
In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander MacEwen, who attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, reported that the papers described him thus. See David Smith Cairns, ''Life and times of Alexander Robertson MacEwen, D.D'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1925), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.&lt;ref&gt;See [[H. W. Nevinson]], ''Changes and Chances'' (James Nisbet, 1923), pp. 53–55 and [[J. A. Spender]], ''Life, Journalism and Politics'' (Cassell &amp; Co., 1927), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.

In 1884, the 17-year-old [[Beatrix Potter]] spotted Ruskin at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] exhibition. She wrote in her journal, "Mr Ruskin was one of the most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not particularly clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Linder, ed. (1966) ''The Journal of Beatrix Potter''. London: Frederick Warne &amp; Co. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===International===
Ruskin's influence reached across the world. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] described him as "one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his words into Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''Ruskin and Tolstoy'' (Guild of St George, 2010) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia J. Gamble,  ''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin. The Seven Lamps of Translation'' (Summa Publications, 2002) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] wrote of the "magic spell" cast on him by ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it ''[[Sarvodaya]]'', "The Advancement of All".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.&lt;ref&gt;Masami Kimura, "Japanese Interest in Ruskin: Some Historical Trends" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik (eds.), ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 215–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/catalogue-of-the-ryuzo-mikimoto-collection-ruskin-library-tokyo-2004/oclc/56923207 |title=Catalogue of the Ryuzo Mikimoto Collection : Ruskin Library, Tokyo 2004 |website=WorldCat.org |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
A number of [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] [[Ruskin Colonies]] attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included [[Ruskin, Florida]], [[Ruskin, British Columbia]] and the [[Ruskin Colony|Ruskin Commonwealth Association]], a colony which existed in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1899.

Ruskin's work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Chinese, Welsh and even [[Esperanto]] and [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]] incorporated Ruskin's ideas in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Daniels and Geoff Brandwood (ed.), ''Ruskin and Architecture'' (Spire Books, 2003) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as diverse as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Ezra Pound]] felt Ruskin's influence.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin (Methuen, 1900) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The American poet [[Marianne Moore]] was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them [[Herbert Read]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Wilhelm Worringer]] knew Ruskin's work well.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Cianci and Peter Nicholls (eds.)  ''Ruskin and Modernism'' (Palgrave, 2001) and Toni Cerutti (ed.) ''Ruskin and the Twentieth Century: the modernity of Ruskinism'' (Edizioni Mercurio, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver, [[John William Hill]] to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist, [[Eric Gill]]. Aside from [[E. T. Cook]], Ruskin's editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include [[J. A. Spender]], and the war correspondent, [[H. W. Nevinson]].

===Craft and conservation===
[[William Morris]] and [[C. R. Ashbee]] (the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin's legacy can be traced in the [[arts and crafts movement]]. Ruskin's ideas on preservation of open spaces and conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends, [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], to help found the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill Download Samuel Jones (ed.), ''The Enduring Relevance of Octavia Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618093500/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill |date=18 June 2012 }} and see specifically, Robert Hewison, "'You are doing some of the work that I ought to do': Octavia Hill and Ruskinian values", pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and education===
Pioneers of [[urban planning|town planning]], such as [[Thomas Coglan Horsfall]] and [[Patrick Geddes]] called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in their writings. The same is true for the founders of the [[garden city movement]], [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Lang ''Designing Utopia: John Ruskin's Urban Vision for Britain and America'' (Black Rose Books Ltd., 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Carpenter]]'s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy's colony at [[Purleigh]], briefly a refuge for the [[Doukhobor]]s, combined Ruskin's ideas and Tolstoy's.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was [[John Howard Whitehouse]], who saved Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established [[Bembridge School]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to [[Michael Ernest Sadler]] wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of Ruskin and education, see Sara Atwood,  ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruskin College]], an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and [[Charles A. Beard]].

Ruskin's innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time [[Working Men's College]] pupil, George Allen, whose business was eventually merged to become [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], anticipated the establishment of the [[Net Book Agreement]].

[[Pierre de Coubertin]], the innovator of the modern [[Olympic Games]], used Ruskin's principles of beautification, asserting that the games should be "Ruskinized" to create an aesthetic identity that transcended mere championship competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. 'The masses are much more sensitive to the perfection of the whole than to any separate details': The Influence of John Ruskin's Political Economy on Pierre de Coubertin, in: Olympika, 1996 Vol. V, pp. 25–44. www.library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1996/olympika0501c.pdf;[[Arnd Krüger]].

Ruskin's Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art which he gathered as learning aids for the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] which he founded at Oxford, is still in the possession of the school, now the Ashmolean Museum. The Museum has promoted Ruskin's art teaching methods using the collection, using them as the basis for in-person and online drawing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruskin.ashmolean.org/collection/8994/ |title=The Elements of Drawing |access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and economics===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], and his ideas informed the work of economists such as [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]] and [[J. A. Hobson]], and the positivist, [[Frederic Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (Tauris, 2007) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the [[settlement movement]] in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at [[Toynbee Hall]] such as the later civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and [[William Beveridge]] (author of the [[Beveridge Report|Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services]]), and the future Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British [[welfare state]]. More of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]'s earliest members acknowledged his significance than mentioned [[Karl Marx]] or the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: the social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Ruskin's works have also influenced [[Phillip Blond]] and the [[Red Tory]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Tory intrigues and infuriates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica | work=The Guardian | first=Madeleine|last=Bunting|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin in the 21st-century===
Admirers and scholars of Ruskin can visit the [[Ruskin Library]] at [[Lancaster University]], also Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and the [[Ruskin Museum]], both in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] in the English [[Lake District]].

[[File:John Ruskin Street in London.JPG|thumb|right|John Ruskin Street in [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], London]]
Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name. [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Cambridge]] traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. [[John Ruskin College]], South Croydon, is named after him. The Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today. The Ruskin Art Club is the oldest ladies club in Los Angeles. In addition, there is the [[Ruskin Pottery]], [[Ruskin House]], Croydon and [[Ruskin Hall]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

[[Ruskin, Florida]], United States—site of one of the short-lived American [[Ruskin Colleges]]—is named for John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled, "Head, Heart And Hands" on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |title=Ruskin Community Mural |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Oliver Lodge]] admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and [[cultural tourism]] (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with [[Thomas Cook]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Newey and Jeffrey Richards ''John Ruskin and the Victorian Theatre'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]], argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout [[Web 2.0]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gauntlett]] ''Making Is Connecting: the social meaning of creativity from DIY and knitting to YouTube and Web 2.0'' (Polity, 2011), pp. 25–36, 217–19; specifically on YouTube, see pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, architectural theorist [[Lars Spuybroek]] has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Spuybroek, ''The Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design'' (V2_NAI Publishers, 2011), pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable modern-day Ruskin enthusiasts include the writers [[Geoffrey Hill]] and [[Charles Tomlinson]], and the politicians, [[Patrick Cormack]], [[Frank Judd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012145610/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |archivedate=12 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] spoke at the [[Art Workers Guild]] on Ruskin, 6 February 2010. Stuart Eagles, '' The Economic Symposium. John Ruskin and the Modern World: Art and Economics, 1860–2010'' in ''The Companion'' no. 10 (2010), pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Benn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/659657 ''Omnibus.

BBC1, 13 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury]], Raficq Abdulla, [[Jonathon Porritt]] and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]] were among those to contribute to the symposium, ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]] (ed.) ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century'' (Ruskin To-Day, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Glancey]] at ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Andrew Hill at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' have both written about Ruskin,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hill, ''Introduction'' in John Ruskin, ''Unto This Last'' (Pallas Athene, 2010), pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; as has the broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvyn Bragg]], ''Foreword'' in John Ruskin, ''On Genius'' (Hesperus, 2011), pp. vii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, [[literary criticism]], the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume "Library Edition", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, "the spell of his eloquence is broken".&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet &amp; Co., 1898), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that "the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts" is "something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985; and Kindle), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: "go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites whose members, he said, had formed "a new and noble school" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |title=Ruskin, Turner and The Pre-Raphaelites |website=Tate.org.uk |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ruskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: "Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv, §35;  Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century, to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts which he had helped to inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and "savage" aspects were proof of "the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure."&lt;ref&gt;John Unrau, Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic, in New Approaches to Ruskin, ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 12.417–32. Cynthia J. Gamble, "John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L‟Harmattan et l‟Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay "The Nature of Gothic" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative "freedom of thought" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works attacking ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism which he considered to be at the root of it. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].

Ruskin's views on art, wrote [[Kenneth Clark]], "cannot be made to form a [[logical system]], and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value."  Ruskin's accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind's eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin's writing on art and architecture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.'
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, "A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture," in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historic preservation===
Ruskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. Ruskin was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]],'' (1849) Ruskin wrote:

{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=&lt;small&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.&lt;/small&gt;}}

This abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a "means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time."&lt;ref&gt;Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. p. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ruskin, the "age" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: "For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Ruskin attacked orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, "social affections"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy For Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Nay, but I choose my physician and my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work. By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be "chosen." The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

At the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See section, "Stones of Venice", above.)

He argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Jose Harris, "Ruskin and Social Reform" in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Turner's erotic drawings===
Until 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the [[National Gallery]], was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at [[Tate Britain]], were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] Also see Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1, Spring 2003, pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DB1738F930A25752C0A9639C8B63 |title=A Censorship Story Goes Up in Smoke – No Bonfire Devoured J.M.W. Turner's Erotica  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 January 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Ruskin's sexuality has led to much speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years because of non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that he found her "person" repugnant.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause of Ruskin's "disgust" has led to much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, [[Mary Lutyens]], suggested that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Peter Fuller]] in his book ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' writes, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1988, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter, Mary, "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".&lt;ref&gt;Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1950), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he was a [[paedophile]], on the grounds that he stated that he fell in love with her when he met her at the age of nine.&lt;ref&gt;Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Hewison, R, John Ruskin, ''The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,132930,00.html#article_continue The Guardian, review of Batchelor, J., John Ruskin: ''No Wealth but Life'', 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T. ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, "absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her "girlies" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will you – (it's all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills?  And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lurie |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Lurie |title=Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they're not in love with anybody but me.—I've got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_4_86/ai_n31641126/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Philological Quarterly'', Fall, 2007 by Van Akin Burd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigwiggina is a nickname Ruskin used for the girl as she looked after (lambs and) piglets; c.f. {{cite book |title=Letters to M. G. and H. G. |url=https://archive.org/stream/letterstomgandhg00rusk/letterstomgandhg00rusk_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin's biographers disagree about the allegation of "paedophilia". Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, boldly asserts that Ruskin "was a paedophile" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not "fit the profile".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T., ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–54; Batchelor, J, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Abse concluded that "the older girls became, the more their attractions diminished in his eyes. He liked them best, as he was to tell his friend Lady Naesmith two years later, when they were 'just in the very rose of dawn'".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Abse, ''John Ruskin – The Passionate Moralist'', Quarter Books, London, 1980, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also point to a definite pattern of "[[Nympholepsy|nympholeptic]]" behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a [[Winnington Hall|Winnington school]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kemp and Jan Van Heurck, ''The Desire of My Eyes: The Life &amp; Work of John Ruskin '', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was (supposedly in common with his contemporary, [[Lewis Carroll]]) their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.&lt;ref&gt;''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the "[[common law of business balance]]"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as:  "The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot." This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin's authorship is disputed among Ruskin scholars. Shapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin's works,&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fred R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"/&gt; The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, spoken, or published the statement. Due to the statement's widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin's authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.

==Definitions==
[[File:John Ruskin 1850s 2.jpg|thumb|upright|John Ruskin in the 1850s, photo from the [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].]]
* [[Pathetic fallacy]]: Ruskin coined this term in ''Modern Painters'' III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in "Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy" (Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'').&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Painter''s III (see Part VI, "Of Many Things", c. XII, "Of the Paethetic Fallacy") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''Force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, "Introduction", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |title=The Fortnightly Review › Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria |website=Fortnightlyreview.co.uk |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to ''the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.''
* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is 'well-being', illth is "ill-being".
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an "excrescence" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival]] features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|lentic}}

A '''lake ecosystem''' includes [[Biotic component|biotic]] (living) plants, animals and micro-organisms, as well as [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] (nonliving) physical and chemical interactions.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown

Lake ecosystems are a prime example of '''lentic ecosystems'''. ''Lentic'' refers to stationary or relatively still water, from the [[Latin]] ''lentus'', which means sluggish. Lentic waters range from [[pond]]s to [[lake]]s to [[wetland]]s, and much of this article applies to lentic ecosystems in general. Lentic ecosystems can be compared with [[lotic ecosystems]], which involve flowing terrestrial waters such as rivers and streams. Together, these two fields form the more general study area of freshwater or [[aquatic ecology]].

Lentic systems are diverse, ranging from a small, temporary rainwater pool a few inches deep to [[Lake Baikal]], which has a maximum depth of 1740 m.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brönmark
  | first = C.

  | isbn =0198516134
  | page = 285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general distinction between pools/ponds and lakes is vague, but Brown&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; states that ponds and pools have their entire bottom surfaces exposed to light, while lakes do not.  In addition, some lakes become seasonally stratified (discussed in more detail below.)  Ponds and pools have two regions: the [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] open water zone, and the [[benthic zone]], which comprises the bottom and shore regions.  Since lakes have deep bottom regions not exposed to light, these systems have an additional zone, the [[profundal]].&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kalff
  | first = J.
  | title = Limnology
  | publisher = Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle, NJ
  | year = 2002
  | isbn =0130337757
  | page = 592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These three areas can have very different abiotic conditions and, hence, host species that are specifically adapted to live there.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt;

==Important abiotic factors==

===Light===
Light provides the solar energy required to drive the process of [[photosynthesis]], the major energy source of lentic systems.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;  The amount of light received depends upon a combination of several factors.  Small ponds may experience shading by surrounding trees, while cloud cover may affect light availability in all systems, regardless of size.  Seasonal and diurnal considerations also play a role in light availability because the shallower the angle at which light strikes water, the more light is lost by reflection.  This is known as [[Beer's law]].&lt;ref name="giller:1998"/&gt; Once light has penetrated the surface, it may also be scattered by particles suspended in the water column.  This scattering decreases the total amount of light as depth increases.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moss:1998"/&gt; Lakes are divided into [[photic zone|photic]] and [[aphotic]] regions,  the prior receiving sunlight and latter being below the depths of light penetration, making it void of photosynthetic capacity.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;  In relation to lake zonation, the pelagic and benthic zones are considered to lie within the photic region, while the profundal zone is in the aphotic region.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt;

===Temperature===
Temperature is an important abiotic factor in lentic ecosystems because most of the biota are [[poikilotherm]]ic, where internal body temperatures are defined by the surrounding system.  Water can be heated or cooled through radiation at the surface and conduction to or from the air and surrounding substrate.&lt;ref name="giller:1998"/&gt; Shallow ponds often have a continuous temperature gradient from warmer waters at the surface to cooler waters at the bottom.  In addition, temperature fluctuations can be very great in these systems, both diurnally and seasonally.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt;

Temperature regimes are very different in large lakes (Fig. 2).  In temperate regions, for example, as air temperatures increase, the icy layer formed on the surface of the lake breaks up, leaving the water at approximately 4&amp;nbsp;°C.  This is the temperature at which water has the highest density.  As the season progresses, the warmer air temperatures heat the surface waters, making them less dense.  The deeper waters remain cool and dense due to reduced light penetration.  As the summer begins, two distinct layers become established, with such a large temperature difference between them that they remain stratified.  The lowest zone in the lake is the coldest and is called the [[hypolimnion]].  The upper warm zone is called the [[epilimnion]].  Between these zones is a band of rapid temperature change called the [[thermocline]].  During the colder fall season, heat is lost at the surface and the epilimnion cools.  When the temperatures of the two zones are close enough, the waters begin to mix again to create a uniform temperature, an event termed [[lake turnover]].   In the winter, inverse stratification occurs as water near the surface cools freezes, while warmer, but denser water remains near the bottom.  A thermocline is established, and the cycle repeats.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

[[Image:LSE Stratification.png|center|thumb|600px|Fig. 2 Seasonal stratification in temperate lakes]]

===Wind===
[[Image:Foamlines.png|right|thumb|300px|Fig. 3 Illustration of Langmuir rotations; open circles=positively buoyant particles, closed circles=negatively buoyant particles]]
In exposed systems, wind can create turbulent, spiral-formed surface currents called [[Langmuir circulation]]s (Fig. 3).  Exactly how these currents become established is still not well understood, but it is evident that it involves some interaction between horizontal surface currents and surface gravity waves.  The visible result of these rotations, which can be seen in any lake, are the surface foamlines that run parallel to the wind direction.  Positively buoyant particles and small organisms concentrate in the foamline at the surface and negatively buoyant objects are found in the upwelling current between the two rotations.  Objects with neutral buoyancy tend to be evenly distributed in the water column.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt; This turbulence circulates nutrients in the water column, making it crucial for many pelagic species, however its effect on benthic and profundal organisms is minimal to non-existent, respectively.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt; The degree of nutrient circulation is system specific, as it depends upon such factors as wind strength and duration, as well as lake or pool depth and productivity.

===Chemistry===
{{See also|Aquatic respiration}}
[[Oxygen]] is essential for organismal [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].  The amount of oxygen present in standing waters depends upon:  1) the area of transparent water exposed to the air, 2) the circulation of water within the system and 3) the amount of oxygen generated and used by organisms present.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; In shallow, plant-rich pools there may be great fluctuations of oxygen, with extremely high concentrations occurring during the day due to photosynthesis and very low values at night when respiration is the dominant process of primary producers.  Thermal stratification in larger systems can also affect the amount of oxygen present in different zones.  The epilimnion is oxygen rich because it circulates quickly, gaining oxygen via contact with the air.  The hypolimnion, however, circulates very slowly and has no atmospheric contact.  Additionally, fewer green plants exist in the hypolimnion, so there is less oxygen released from photosynthesis.  In spring and fall when the epilimnion and hypolimnion mix, oxygen becomes more evenly distributed in the system. Low oxygen levels are characteristic of the profundal zone due to the accumulation of decaying vegetation and animal matter that “rains” down from the pelagic and benthic zones and the inability to support primary producers.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt;

[[Phosphorus]] is important for all organisms because it is a component of DNA and RNA and is involved in cell metabolism as a component of ATP and ADP.  Also, phosphorus is not found in large quantities in freshwater systems, limiting photosynthesis in primary producers, making it the main determinant of lentic system production.  The phosphorus cycle is complex, but the model outlined below describes the basic pathways.  Phosphorus mainly enters a pond or lake through runoff from the watershed or by atmospheric deposition.  Upon entering the system, a reactive form of phosphorus is usually taken up by algae and macrophytes, which release a non-reactive phosphorus compound as a byproduct of photosynthesis.  This phosphorus can drift downwards and become part of the benthic or profundal sediment, or it can be [[remineralization|remineralized]] to the reactive form by microbes in the water column.  Similarly, non-reactive phosphorus in the sediment can be remineralized into the reactive form.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;  Sediments are generally richer in phosphorus than lake water, however, indicating that this nutrient may have a long residency time there before it is remineralized and re-introduced to the system.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt;

==Lentic system biota==

===Bacteria===
Bacteria are present in all regions of lentic waters.  Free-living forms are associated with decomposing organic material, [[biofilm]] on the surfaces of rocks and plants, suspended in the water column, and in the sediments of the benthic and profundal zones.  Other forms are also associated with the guts of lentic animals as parasites or in [[commensal]] relationships.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt; Bacteria play an important role in system metabolism through nutrient recycling,&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; which is discussed in the Trophic Relationships section.

===Primary producers===
[[File:Nelumbo nucifera LOTUS bud.jpg|thumb|''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', an aquatic plant.]]
Algae, including both [[phytoplankton]] and [[periphyton]] are the principle photosynthesizers in ponds and lakes.  Phytoplankton are found drifting in the water column of the pelagic zone.  Many species have a higher density than water which should make them sink and end up in the benthos.  To combat this, phytoplankton have developed density changing mechanisms, by forming vacuoles and gas vesicles or by changing their shapes to induce drag, slowing their descent.  A very sophisticated adaptation utilized by a small number of species is a tail-like [[flagellum]] that can adjust vertical position and allow movement in any direction.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; Phytoplankton can also maintain their presence in the water column by being circulated in Langmuir rotations.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt;  Periphytic algae, on the other hand, are attached to a substrate.  In lakes and ponds, they can cover all benthic surfaces.  Both types of plankton are important as food sources and as oxygen providers.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

[[Aquatic plants]] live in both the benthic and pelagic zones and can be grouped according to their manner of growth:  1) emergent = rooted in the substrate but with leaves and flowers extending into the air, 2) floating-leaved  = rooted in the substrate but with floating leaves, 3) submersed = growing beneath the surface and 4) free-floating macrophytes = not rooted in the substrate and floating on the surface.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; These various forms of macrophytes generally occur in different areas of the benthic zone, with emergent vegetation nearest the shoreline, then floating-leaved macrophytes, followed by submersed vegetation.  Free-floating macrophytes can occur anywhere on the system’s surface.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

[[Aquatic plants]] are more buoyant than their terrestrial counterparts because freshwater has a higher density than air.  This makes structural rigidity unimportant in lakes and ponds  (except in the aerial stems and leaves).  Thus, the leaves and stems of most aquatic plants use less energy to construct and maintain woody tissue, investing that energy into fast growth instead.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; In order to contend with stresses induced by wind and waves, plants must be both flexible and tough.  Light, water depth and substrate types are the most important factors controlling the distribution of submerged aquatic plants.&lt;ref name=Keddy&gt;Keddy, P.A. (2010). Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. {{ISBN|0521739675}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Macrophytes are sources of food, oxygen, and habitat structure in the benthic zone, but cannot penetrate the depths of the euphotic zone and hence are not found there.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moss:1998"&gt;{{cite book

===Invertebrates===
[[Image:Water strider G remigis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gerridae|Water striders]] are predatory insects which rely on [[surface tension]] to walk on top of water. They live on the surface of ponds, marshes, and other quiet waters. They can move very quickly, up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[metre per second|m/s]].]]
[[Zooplankton]] are tiny animals suspended in the water column.  Like phytoplankton, these species have developed mechanisms that keep them from sinking to deeper waters, including drag-inducing body forms and the active flicking of appendages such as antennae or spines.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; Remaining in the water column may have its advantages in terms of feeding, but this zone’s lack of refugia leaves zooplankton vulnerable to predation.  In response, some species, especially [[Daphnia]] sp., make daily vertical migrations in the water column by passively sinking to the darker lower depths during the day and actively moving towards the surface during the night. Also, because conditions in a lentic system can be quite variable across seasons, zooplankton have the ability to switch from laying regular eggs to resting eggs when there is a lack of food, temperatures fall below 2&amp;nbsp;°C, or if predator abundance is high.  These resting eggs have a [[diapause]], or dormancy period that should allow the zooplankton to encounter conditions that are more favorable to survival when they finally hatch.&lt;ref name="gliwicz:2004"&gt;Gliwicz, Z. M. "Zooplankton", pp. 461–516 in O'Sullivan (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The invertebrates that inhabit the benthic zone are numerically dominated by small species and are species rich compared to the zooplankton of the open water.  They include Crustaceans (e.g. crabs, crayfish, and shrimp), molluscs (e.g. clams and snails), and numerous types of insects.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; These organisms are mostly found in the areas of macrophyte growth, where the richest resources, highly oxygenated water, and warmest portion of the ecosystem are found.  The structurally diverse macrophyte beds are important sites for the accumulation of organic matter, and provide an ideal area for colonization.  The sediments and plants also offer a great deal of protection from predatory fishes.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt;

Very few invertebrates are able to inhabit the cold, dark, and oxygen poor profundal zone.  Those that can are often red in color due to the presence of large amounts of [[hemoglobin]], which greatly increases the amount of oxygen carried to cells.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; Because the concentration of oxygen within this zone is low, most species construct tunnels or borrows in which they can hide and make the minimum movements necessary to circulate water through, drawing oxygen to them without expending much energy.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt;

===Fish and other vertebrates===
Fish have a range of physiological tolerances that are dependent upon which species they belong to.  They have different lethal temperatures, dissolved oxygen requirements, and spawning needs that are based on their activity levels and behaviors.  Because fish are highly mobile, they are able to deal with unsuitable abiotic factors in one zone by simply moving to another.  A detrital feeder in the profundal zone, for example, that finds the oxygen concentration has dropped too low may feed closer to the benthic zone.  A fish might also alter its residence during different parts of its life history: hatching in a sediment nest, then moving to the weedy benthic zone to develop in a protected environment with food resources, and finally into the pelagic zone as an adult.

Other vertebrate taxa inhabit lentic systems as well.  These include amphibians (e.g. salamanders and frogs), reptiles (e.g. snakes, turtles, and alligators), and a large number of waterfowl species.&lt;ref name="moss:1998"/&gt; Most of these vertebrates spend part of their time in terrestrial habitats and thus are not directly affected by abiotic factors in the lake or pond.  Many fish species are important as consumers and as prey species to the larger vertebrates mentioned above.

==Trophic relationships==

===Primary producers===
Lentic systems gain most of their energy from photosynthesis performed by aquatic plants and algae.  This [[Indigenous (ecology)|autochthonous]] process involves the combination of carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy to produce carbohydrates and dissolved oxygen.  Within a lake or pond, the potential rate of photosynthesis generally decreases with depth due to light attenuation.  Photosynthesis, however, is often low at the top few millimeters of the surface, likely due to inhibition by ultraviolet light.  The exact depth and photosynthetic rate measurements of this curve are system specific and depend upon: 1) the total biomass of photosynthesizing cells, 2) the amount of light attenuating materials and 3) the abundance and frequency range of light absorbing pigments (i.e. [[chlorophylls]]) inside of photosynthesizing cells.&lt;ref name="moss:1998"/&gt; The energy created by these primary producers is important for the community because it is transferred to higher [[trophic level]]s via consumption.

===Bacteria===
The vast majority of bacteria in lakes and ponds obtain their energy by decomposing vegetation and animal matter.  In the pelagic zone, dead fish and the occasional [[allochthonous]] input of litterfall are examples of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM&gt;1&amp;nbsp;mm).  Bacteria degrade these into fine particulate organic matter (FPOM&lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm) and then further into usable nutrients.  Small organisms such as plankton are also characterized as FPOM.  Very low concentrations of nutrients are released during decomposition because the bacteria are utilizing them to build their own biomass.  Bacteria, however, are consumed by [[protozoa]], which are in turn consumed by zooplankton, and then further up the [[trophic level]]s.  Nutrients, including those that contain carbon and phosphorus, are reintroduced into the water column at any number of points along this food chain via excretion or organism death, making them available again for bacteria.  This regeneration cycle is known as the [[microbial loop]] and is a key component of lentic food webs.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

The decomposition of organic materials can continue in the benthic and profundal zones if the matter falls through the water column before being completely digested by the pelagic bacteria.  Bacteria are found in the greatest abundance here in sediments, where they are typically 2-1000 times more prevalent than in the water column.&lt;ref name="gliwicz:2004"/&gt;

===Benthic Invertebrates===
Benthic invertebrates, due to their high level of species richness, have many methods of prey capture.  [[Filter feeder]]s create currents via siphons or beating cilia, to pull water and its nutritional contents, towards themselves for straining.  [[Grazing|Grazers]] use scraping, rasping, and shredding adaptations to feed on periphytic algae and macrophytes.  Members of the collector guild browse the sediments, picking out specific particles with raptorial appendages.  [[Deposit feeding]] invertebrates indiscriminately consume sediment, digesting any organic material it contains.  Finally, some invertebrates belong to the [[predator]] guild, capturing and consuming living animals.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jonasson:2003"&gt;Jónasson, P. M. "Benthic Invertebrates", pp. 341–416 in O'Sullivan (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The profundal zone is home to a unique group of filter feeders that use small body movements to draw a current through burrows that they have created in the sediment.  This mode of feeding requires the least amount of motion, allowing these species to conserve energy.&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; A small number of invertebrate taxa are predators in the profundal zone.  These species are likely from other regions and only come to these depths to feed.  The vast majority of invertebrates in this zone are deposit feeders, getting their energy from the surrounding sediments.&lt;ref name="jonasson:2003"/&gt;

===Fish===
Fish size, mobility, and sensory capabilities allow them to exploit a broad prey base, covering multiple zonation regions.  Like invertebrates, fish feeding habits can be categorized into guilds.  In the pelagic zone, [[herbivores]] graze on periphyton and macrophytes or pick phytoplankton out of the water column.  [[Carnivore]]s include fishes that feed on zooplankton in the water column ([[zooplanktivore]]s), insects at the water’s surface, on benthic structures, or in the sediment ([[insectivore]]s), and those that feed on other fish ([[piscivore]]s).  Fish that consume detritus and gain energy by processing its organic material are called [[detritivore]]s.  Omnivores ingest a wide variety of prey, encompassing floral, faunal, and detrital material.  Finally, members of the [[parasitic]] guild acquire nutrition from a host species, usually another fish or large vertebrate.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; Fish taxa are flexible in their feeding roles, varying their diets with environmental conditions and prey availability.  Many species also undergo a diet shift as they develop.  Therefore, it is likely that any single fish occupies multiple feeding guilds within its lifetime.&lt;ref name="windfield:2003"&gt;Winfield, I. J. "Fish Population Ecology", pp. 517–537 in O'Sullivan (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lentic food webs===
As noted in the previous sections, the lentic biota are linked in complex web of trophic relationships.  These organisms can be considered to loosely be associated with specific trophic groups (e.g. primary producers, herbivores, primary carnivores, secondary carnivores, etc.).  Scientists have developed several theories in order to understand the mechanisms that control the abundance and diversity within these groups.  Very generally, [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Ecology|top-down]] processes dictate that the abundance of prey taxa is dependent upon the actions of consumers from higher [[trophic level]]s.  Typically, these processes operate only between two trophic levels, with no effect on the others.  In some cases, however, aquatic systems experience a [[trophic cascade]]; for example, this might occur if primary producers experience less grazing by herbivores because these herbivores are suppressed by carnivores.  [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Ecology|Bottom-up]] processes are functioning when the abundance or diversity of members of higher trophic levels is dependent upon the availability or quality of resources from lower levels.  Finally, a combined regulating theory, [[bottom-up:top-down]], combines the  predicted influences of consumers and resource availability.  It predicts that trophic levels close to the lowest trophic levels will be most influenced by bottom-up forces, while top-down effects should be strongest at top levels.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

==Community patterns and diversity==
{{lake stratification topics}}

===Local species richness===
The biodiversity of a lentic system increases with the surface area of the lake or pond.  This is attributable to the higher likelihood of partly terrestrial species of finding a larger system.  Also, because larger systems typically have larger populations, the chance of extinction is decreased.&lt;ref name="browne:1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Browne

===Succession patterns in plankton communities – the PEG model===
Phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in lake systems undergo seasonal succession in relation to nutrient availability, predation, and competition. Sommer ''et al.''&lt;ref name="sommer:1986"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Sommer

  | year = 1986
}}&lt;/ref&gt; described these patterns as part of the Plankton Ecology Group ([[Plankton Ecology Group model|PEG]]) model, with 24 statements constructed from the analysis of numerous systems.  The following includes a subset of these statements, as explained by Brönmark and Hansson&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; illustrating succession through a single seasonal cycle:

''Winter''&lt;br&gt;
1.  Increased nutrient and light availability result in rapid phytoplankton growth towards the end of winter.  The dominant species, such as diatoms, are small and have quick growth capabilities.  
2.  These plankton are consumed by zooplankton, which become the dominant plankton taxa.

''Spring''&lt;br&gt;
3.  A [[clear water phase]] occurs, as phytoplankton populations become depleted due to increased predation by growing numbers of zooplankton.

''Summer''&lt;br&gt;
4.  Zooplankton abundance declines as a result of decreased phytoplankton prey and increased predation by juvenile fishes.&lt;br&gt;
5.  With increased nutrient availability and decreased predation from zooplankton, a diverse phytoplankton community develops.&lt;br&gt;
6.  As the summer continues, nutrients become depleted in a predictable order: phosphorus, [[silica]], and then [[nitrogen]].  The abundance of various phytoplankton species varies in relation to their biological need for these nutrients.&lt;br&gt;
7.  Small-sized zooplankton become the dominant type of zooplankton because they are less vulnerable to fish predation.

''Fall''&lt;br&gt;
8.  Predation by fishes is reduced due to lower temperatures and zooplankton of all sizes increase in number.

''Winter''&lt;br&gt;
9.  Cold temperatures and decreased light availability result in lower rates of primary production and decreased phytoplankton populations.
10.  Reproduction in zooplankton decreases due to lower temperatures and less prey.

The PEG model presents an idealized version of this succession pattern, while natural systems are known for their variation.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

===Latitudinal patterns===
There is a well-documented global pattern that correlates decreasing plant and animal diversity with increasing latitude, that is to say, there are fewer species as one moves towards the poles.  The cause of this pattern is one of the greatest puzzles for ecologists today.  Theories for its explanation include energy availability, climatic variability, disturbance, competition, etc.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; Despite this global diversity gradient, this pattern can be weak for freshwater systems compared to global marine and terrestrial systems.&lt;ref name="hillebrand:2004"&gt;{{cite journal

They attributed this to better dispersal ability by smaller organisms, which may result in high distributions globally.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

==Natural lake lifecycles==

===Lake creation===
Lakes can be formed in a variety of ways, but the most common are discussed briefly below.  The oldest and largest systems are the result of [[tectonic]] activities.  The rift lakes in Africa, for example are the result of seismic activity along the site of separation of two tectonic plates.  Ice-formed lakes are created when [[glaciers]] recede, leaving behind abnormalities in the landscape shape that are then filled with water.  Finally, [[oxbow lake]]s are [[fluvial]] in origin, resulting when a meandering river bend is pinched off from the main channel.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

===Natural extinction===
All lakes and ponds receive sediment inputs.  Since these systems are not really expanding, it is logical to assume that they will become increasingly shallower in depth, eventually becoming wetlands or terrestrial vegetation.  The length of this process should depend upon a combination of depth and sedimentation rate. Moss&lt;ref name="moss:1998"/&gt; gives the example of [[Lake Tanganyika]], which reaches a depth of 1500 m and has a sedimentation rate of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.  Assuming that sedimentation is not influenced by anthropogenic factors, this system should go extinct in approximately 3 million years.  Shallow lentic systems might also fill in as swamps encroach inward from the edges.  These processes operate on a much shorter timescale, taking hundreds to thousands of years to complete the extinction process.&lt;ref name="moss:1998"/&gt;

==Human impacts==

===Acidification===
[[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxides]] are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt; These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name="brown:1987"/&gt; Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH.  Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid.&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt; At a pH of 5–6 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency – a characteristic feature of acidified lakes.  As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse.  The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction.  Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kalff:2002"/&gt; Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in [[Scandinavia]], western [[Scotland]], west [[Wales]] and the north eastern United States.

===Eutrophication===
[[Eutrophication|Eutrophic]] systems contain a high concentration of phosphorus (~30&amp;nbsp;µg/L), nitrogen (~1500&amp;nbsp;µg/L), or both.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; Phosphorus enters lentic waters from [[sewage treatment]] effluents, discharge from raw sewage, or from runoff of farmland.  Nitrogen mostly comes from [[Fertilizer|agricultural fertilizers]] from runoff or leaching and subsequent groundwater flow.  This increase in nutrients required for primary producers results in a massive increase of phytoplankton growth, termed a [[Algal bloom|plankton bloom]].  This bloom decreases water transparency, leading to the loss of submerged plants.  The resultant reduction in habitat structure has negative impacts on the species’ that utilize it for spawning, maturation and general survival.  Additionally, the large number of short-lived phytoplankton result in a massive amount of dead biomass settling into the sediment.&lt;ref name="moss:1998"/&gt; Bacteria need large amounts of oxygen to decompose this material, reducing the oxygen concentration of the water.  This is especially pronounced in stratified lakes when the thermocline prevents oxygen rich water from the surface to mix with lower levels.  Low or anoxic conditions preclude the existence of many taxa that are not physiologically tolerant of these conditions.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt;

===Invasive species===
[[Invasive species]] have been introduced to lentic systems through both purposeful events (e.g. stocking game and food species) as well as unintentional events (e.g. in [[ballast water]]).  These organisms can affect natives via competition for prey or habitat, predation, habitat alteration, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]], or the introduction of harmful diseases and parasites.&lt;ref name="giller:1998"&gt;{{cite book | last = Giller

  | page = 296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to native species, invaders may cause changes in size and age structure, distribution, density, population growth, and may even drive populations to extinction.&lt;ref name="bronmark:2005"/&gt; Examples of prominent invaders of lentic systems include the [[zebra mussel]] and [[sea lamprey]] in the Great Lakes.

The '''Las Cruces Biological Station / Wilson Botanical Garden''' is located in the southern [[Puntarenas]] [[province]] of [[Costa Rica]],  and is the newest of the three [[research station]]s operated by the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]] (OTS).  Las Cruces includes a biological research station, tourist facilities, and the botanical gardens started by Robert and Catherine Wilson, and bequeathed to OTS.&lt;ref name="CRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson Botanical Gardens from CostaRicaGuide.com|url=http://costa-rica-guide.com/parks/wilson.htm|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heliconia hirsuta 1zz.jpg|thumb|A ''Heliconia hirsuta'' in the botanical garden of the station]]

Las Cruces is located in a mountainous region at an elevation of approximately 1,000 [[meters above sea level]] (m.a.s.l.).  Surrounded mostly by [[pastures]], [[Coffee_in_the_global_economy#Coffee_and_the_environment|coffee plantation]]s and other [[Farmland (farming)|agricultural areas]], Las Cruces includes a relatively small 270 Ha [[forest fragmentation|forest fragment]] that ranges from 900–1300 m.a.s.l.  As such, much of the research conducted here focuses on [[agroecology]] or studies of [[forest fragmentation]].

The '''legal history of the [[Catholic Church]]''' is the history of the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Edward N. Peters]], [http://www.canonlaw.info CanonLaw.info], accessed Jul-1-2013&lt;/ref&gt; much later than [[Roman law]] but predating the evolution of modern European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions. The history of Latin [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] can be divided into four periods: the ''jus antiquum'', the ''jus novum'', the ''jus novissimum'' and the ''Code of Canon Law''.&lt;ref name=Manual13&gt;Manual of Canon Law, pg. 13, #8&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the ''jus vetus'' (all law before the Code) and the ''jus novum'' (the law of the Code, or ''jus codicis'').&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt; Eastern canon law developed separately.

==Latin canon law==
=== ''Jus Antiquum'' ===
{{main|Collections of ancient canons}}
The most ancient collections of canonical legislation are certain very early Apostolic documents, known as the [[Ancient Church Orders|Church Orders]]: for instance, the ''[[Didache]] ton dodeka apostolon'' or "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles", which dates from the end of the first or the beginning of the 2nd century; the [[Apostolic Church-Ordinance]]; the ''[[Didascalia]]'', or "Teaching of the Apostles"; the [[Apostolic Canons]] and [[Apostolic Constitutions]]. These collections have never had any official value, no more than any other collection of this first period. However, the Apostolic Canons and, through it, the Apostolic Constitutions, were influential for a time in that later collections would draw upon these earliest sources of Church law.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fournier and Gabriel Le Bras, ''Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident depuis les Fausses Décrétales jusqu’au Décret de Gratien'', 2 vols. (Paris, 1931), vol I, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It was in the East, after Constantine I's [[Edict of Milan]] of toleration (313), that arose the first systematic collections. We cannot so designate the chronological collections of the canons of the councils of the 4th and 5th centuries (314-451); the oldest systematic collection, made by an unknown author in 535, has not come down. The most important collections of this epoch are the ''Synagoge kanonon'', or the collection of [[John the Scholastic]] (Joannes Scholasticus), compiled at [[Antioch]] about 550, and the [[Nomocanons]], or compilations of civil laws affecting religious matters (''nomos'') and ecclesiastical laws (''kanon''). One such mixed collection is dated in the 6th century and has been erroneously attributed to John the Scholastic; another of the 7th century was rewritten and much enlarged by the schismatical ecumenical patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (883).
 
In the Western Church one collection of canons, the ''Collectio Dionysiana'', exercised an influence far beyond the limits of the country in which it was composed. This collection was the work of [[Dionysius Exiguus]], who compiled several collections that now go under the name ''Dionysiana''. Dionysius appears to have done most of his work shortly after the year 600.&lt;ref&gt;On the controversial date of the Dionysian collections, see E. Wirbelauer, ed., ''Zwei Päpste in Rom: der Konflikt zwischen Laurentius und Symmachus (498–514)'', Studien und Texte, Quellen und Forschungen zur antiken Welt 16 (Munich, 1993), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; His collections contain his own Latin translation of the canons of the ancient third-, fourth- and fifth-century councils, excerpts from a (probably) confected collection of African canons (which Dionysius calls the ''Registrum ecclesiae Carthaginensis'', c.f. [[Church of Carthage]]), and a collection of (38) papal letters (''Epistolæ decretales'') dating from the reign of [[Pope Siricius]] (384-398) to that of [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]] (died 498). The influence of this Italian collection grew enormously during the seventh and eighth centuries, especially in England and France. It was continuously enlarged and modified, the most famous modification being a version supposedly send by Pope [[Adrian I]] to [[Charlemagne]] in 774 and therefore known today as the ''[[Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana]]''.

Besides the ''Dionysiana'' Italy also produced two 5th-century Latin translations of the Greek synods known as the '' Corpus canonum Africano-Romanum'' and ''Collectio prisca'', both of which are now lost though large portions of them survive in two very large Italian collections known as the ''[[Collectio canonum Quesnelliana]]'' and ''[[Collectio canonum Sanblasiana]]'' respectively. In Italy was also produced a popular fifth-century collection of forgeries known today as the ''[[Symmachean forgeries]]''. Africa possessed a late fourth-century collection known as the ''Breviarium Hipponense'' as well as an early fifth-century collection known as the ''Codex Apiarii causae''; also the ''Breviatio canonum'', or digest of the canons of the councils by [[Fulgentius Ferrandus]] (died c. 546), and the ''Concordia canonum'' of [[Cresconius Africanus]], an adaptation of the ''Dionysiana'' (about 690). In Gaul many important collections were produced, like the collection known today as the ''Concilium Arelatense secundum'' and, at the beginning of the 6th century, the ''Statuta Ecclesiæ antiqua'', erroneously attributed to Africa. Also from Gaul/France are the collections known today as the ''[[Collectio canonum quadripartita]]'' and the ''Libri duo de synodalibus causis'' composed by [[Regino of Prüm]]. Gaul/France also produced two immensely important collections known as the ''[[Collectio canonum vetus Gallica]]'' (compiled in Lyons about 600) and the ''[[Collectio canonum Dacheriana]]'' (about 800), the latter so called from the name of its editor, Luc d'Achéry. The ''Collectio canonum Hibernensis'' or Irish collection of canons, compiled in the 8th century, influenced both [[England]], [[Gaul]] and (though much later) Italy.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Dumville, "Ireland, Brittany and England: Transmission and Use of the ''Collectio canonum Hibernensis''", in Catherine Laurent and Helen Davis (eds.), ''Irlande et Bretagne : vingt siècles d'histoire'', Actes du colloque de Rennes, 29-31 mars 1993 (Rennes, 1994), pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike almost every other region, England never produced a 'national' collection, though English personnel played an important role in copying and disseminating Irish and Italian collections in Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;M. Elliot, ''Canon Law Collections in England ca 600–1066: The Manuscript Evidence'', unpubl. PhD dissertation (University of Toronto, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 700 there developed in either England or Germany a [[Paenitentiale Theodori|collection of penitential canons]] attributed to [[Theodore of Tarsus]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (died 690). This collection marked a major advance in the development of penitential-canonical collections, which had already been in development for centuries especially within the Irish church. Collection like the one attributed to Theodore were known as ''[[penitentials]]'', and were often rather short and simple, most likely because they were meant as handbooks for the use of confessors. There were many such books circulating in Europe from the seventh to the eleventh century, each penitential containing rules indicating exactly how much penance was required for which sins. In various ways these penitentials, mainly Insular in origin, came to affect the larger canon law collections in development on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Fournier and Le Bras, ''Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident'', vol I, pp. 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Iberia (i.e. Spain) possessed the ''Capitula Martini'', compiled about 572 by Martin, Bishop of Braga (in Portugal), and the immense and influential ''Collectio Hispana'' dating from about 633, attributed in the 9th century to [[St. Isidore of Seville]]. In the 9th century arose several apocryphal collections, viz. those of [[Benedictus Levita]], of [[Pseudo-Isidore]] (also [[Isidorus Mercator]], Peccator, Mercatus), and the ''Capitula Angilramni''. An examination of the controversies which these three collections give rise to will be found elsewhere (see [[False Decretals]]). The Pseudo-Isidorian collection, the authenticity of which was for a long time admitted, has exercised considerable influence on ecclesiastical discipline, without however modifying it in its essential principles. Among the numerous collections of a later date, we may mention the ''Collectio Anselmo dedicata'', compiled in Italy at the end of the 9th century, the ''Libellus de ecclesiasticis disciplinis'' of Regino of Prum (died 915); the ''Collectarium canonum'' of [[Burchard of Worms]] (died 1025); the collection of the younger [[St. Anselm of Lucca]], compiled towards the end of the 11th century; the ''Collectio trium partium'', the ''Decretum'' and the ''Panormia'' of [[Yves of Chartres]] (died 1115 or 1117); the ''Liber de misericordia et justitia'' of Algerus of Liège, who died in 1132; the Collection in 74 Titles — all collections which Gratian made use of in the compilation of his ''Decretum''

===''Jus Novum''===
The period of canonical history known as the ''Jus Novum'' ("new law") or ''middle period'' covers the time from [[Decretum Gratiani|Gratian]] to the [[Council of Trent]] (mid-12th century–16th century).&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt;

The spurious conciliar canons and papal decrees were gathered together into collections, both unofficial and official.  In the year 1000, there was no book that had attempted to summarized the whole body of canon law, to systematize it in whole or in part.&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116&gt;Law and Revolution, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many collections of the decrees of councils and great bishops. These collections usually only had regional force and were usually organized chronologically by type of document (e.g. letters of popes, canons of councils, etc.), or occasionally, by general topic.&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116/&gt; Before the late 11th century, canon law was highly decentralized, depending on many different codifications and sources, whether of local councils, ecumenical councils, local bishops, or of the [[pope|Bishops of Rome]].&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116/&gt;

The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the [[Camaldolese]] monk [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] in the 11th century, commonly known as the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' ("Gratian's Decree") but originally called ''The Concordance of Discordant Canons''&lt;ref&gt;Law and Revolution, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt; (''Concordantia Discordantium Canonum''). Canon law greatly increased from 1140 to 1234. After that it slowed down, except for the laws of local councils (an area of canon law in need of scholarship), and secular laws supplemented.&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes.com, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/books/neighbors-and-wives.html ''Neighbors and Wives'' book review] of Nov-13-1988, accessed 27 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1234 [[Pope]] [[Gregory IX]] promulgated the first official collection of canons, called the ''[[Decretals of Gregory IX|Decretalia Gregorii Noni]]'' or ''Liber Extra''.  This was followed by the ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]], the ''Clementines'' (1317) of [[Clement V]], the ''[[Extravagantes Joannis XXII]]'' and the ''[[Extravagantes Communes]]'', all of which followed the same structure as the ''Liber Extra''.  All these collections, with the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', are together referred to as the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. After the completion of the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'', subsequent [[papal]] legislation was published in periodic volumes called ''[[Bullarium|Bullaria]]''.

Johannes Gratian was a monk who taught theology at a monastery in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06730a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a comprehensive and ''comprehensible'' collection of canon law. He resolved contradictions and discrepancies in the existing law.&lt;ref name="High Middle Ages pp. 127"&gt;Europe in the High Middle Ages, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1140s his work became the dominant legal text.&lt;ref&gt;Europe in the High Middle Ages, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The papacy appreciated and approved the [[Decretum Gratiani|''Decretum'' of Gratian]]. The ''Decretum'' formed the core of the [[Corpus Iuris Canonici|body of canon law]] upon which a greater legal structure was built.&lt;ref name="High Middle Ages pp. 127"/&gt;{{clarify|note that the [[Decretum Gratiani]] says that his work was NOT approved by the church. This needs resolution either here or in that article|date=February 2013}} Before Gratian there was no "jurisprudence of canon law" (system of legal interpretation and principles). Gratian is the founder of canonical jurisprudence, which merits him the title "Father of Canon Law".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Kenneth J. Pennington, Ph.D., CL701, CUA School of Canon Law, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVwHMzCUx4k&amp;index=27&amp;list=PLIyjmpcCSGmbeqoESo25a9Rg6YH0BQVnc "History of Canon Law, Day 1"], around 0:25:30, accessed 8-15-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The combination of logical, moral, and political elements contributed to a systematization that was quite different from a merely doctrinal or dogmatic analysis of legal rules, however complex and however coherent. The canon law as a system was more than rules; it was a process, a dialectical process of adapting rules to new situations. This was inevitable if only because of the limits imposed upon its jurisdiction, and the consequent competition which it faced from the secular legal systems that coexisted with it."&lt;ref&gt;Harold J. Berman, "Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition", pg. 254&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the thirteenth century, the Roman Church began to collect and organize its canon law, which after a millennium of development had become a complex and difficult system of interpretation and cross-referencing.  The official collections were the ''Liber Extra'' (1234) of Pope [[Gregory IX]], the  ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]] and the ''Clementines'' (1317), prepared for [[Clement V]] but published by [[John XXII]].  These were addressed to the universities by papal letters at the beginning of each collection, and these texts became textbooks for aspiring canon lawyers.   In 1582 a compilation was made of the Decretum, Extra, the Sext, the Clementines and the ''[[Extravagantes]]'' (that is, the decretals of the popes from [[Pope John XXII]] to [[Pope Sixtus IV]]).

===''Jus Novissimum''===
After the [[Council of Trent]], an attempt to secure a new official collection of church laws was made about 1580, when [[Gregory XIII]] charged three cardinals with the task. The work continued during the pontificate of [[Sixtus V]], was accomplished under [[Clement VIII]] and was printed (Rome, 1598) as: "Sanctissimi Domini nostri Clementis papæ VIII Decretales", sometimes also "Septimus liber Decretalium". This collection, never approved either by Clement VIII or by [[Paul V]], was edited (Freiburg, 1870) by Sentis. In 1557 the Italian canonist [[Paul Lancelottus]] attempted unsuccessfully to secure from Paul IV, for the four books of his "Institutiones juris canonici" (Rome, 1563), an authority equal to that which its model, the "Institutiones" of Emperor [[Justinian]], once enjoyed in the Roman Empire. A private individual, Pierre Mathieu of Lyons, also wrote a "[[Liber Septimus]] Decretalium", inserted in the appendix to the Frankfort (1590) edition of the "Corpus Juris Canonici". This work was put on the Index.

===''Jus Codicis''===

====Pio-Benedictine law====
{{Main|1917 Code of Canon Law}}
At the [[First Vatican Council]] several bishops asked for a new codification of the canon law, and after that several canonists attempted to compile treatises in the form of a full code of canonical legislation, e.g. de Luise (1873), Pillet (1890), Pezzani (1894), Deshayes (1894), Collomiati (1898–1901). [[Pius X]] determined to undertake this work by his decree "Arduum sane munus" (19 March 1904), and named a commission of cardinals to compile a new "Corpus Juris Canonici" on the model of the [[codification (law)|codes of civil law]]. The 1917 ''Codex Iuris Canonici'' (CIC, Code of Canon Law) was the first instance of a new code completely re-written in a systematic fashion, reduced to a single book or "codex" for ease of use. It took effect on 29 May 1918. It had 2,414 canons.

====Johanno-Pauline law====
{{Main|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
In 1959, Pope John XXIII announced, together with his intention to call the Second Vatican Council and a Synod of the Diocese of Rome, that the 1917 Code would be completely revised.&lt;ref name="John XXIII 1959 pp. 68-69"&gt;John XXIII, [[allocution]] ''Questa festiva'' (25 Jan. 1959), [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis|AAS]] 51 (1959) pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canonlaw.info"&gt;CanonLaw.info, [http://canonlaw.info/canonlaw_LegisHistory.htm "Legislative History of the 1983 Code of Canon Law"]; accessed June-7-2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the commission appointed to undertake the task decided to delay the project until the Council had been concluded. After Vatican II closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II. After decades of discussion and numerous drafts, the project was nearly complete upon the death of [[Paul VI]] in 1978. The work was completed in the pontificate of Pope [[John Paul II]]. The revision was promulgated by the [[apostolic constitution]] "[[Sacrae Disciplinae Leges]]" on 25 January 1983, taking effect on 27 November 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apostolic Constitution ''Sacrae Disciplinae Leges''| author=Pope John Paul II| accessdate=2007-04-08| date=1983-01-25| publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_sacrae-disciplinae-leges_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects of the  ''Codex Iuris Canonici'' (CIC, [[Code of Canon Law]]) are the world's 1.2 billion Catholics of what the Code itself calls the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]]. It has 7 books and 1,752 canons.

==Oriental canon law==
{{main|Oriental canon law}}
Distinct from the canonical tradition of the [[Latin Church]] is the tradition of the [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches.  The earliest [[Oriental canon law]] collections were called [[nomocanon]]s, which were collections of both [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].

In the early twentieth century, when Eastern Churches began to come back to full communion with the [[Holy See]], [[Pope Benedict XV]] created the [[Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church]] in order to preserve the rights and traditions of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

Since the early twentieth century, [[Oriental canon law]] had been in the process of codification. Some of these [[Eastern canonical reforms of Pius XII|Oriental canon law reforms]] were [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by [[Pope Pius XII]]. The codification effort culminated with the [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1990 promulgation of the ''Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium'' (CCEO, [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]) which incorporates certain differences in the hierarchical, administrative, and judicial ''fora'' for the 23 ''[[sui juris]]'' particular [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which were each encouraged to issue codes of particular law peculiar to each church, so that all of the [[Catholic Church]]'s canon law would be [[codification (law)|codified]].

'''''Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life''''' (published 1985) is a book by [[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]]. It examines the debate between [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] over Boyle's air-pump experiments in the 1660s. In 2005, Shapin and Schaffer were awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]] for this work.

On a theoretical level, the book explores the acceptable methods of knowledge production, and societal factors related to the different knowledge systems promoted by Boyle and Hobbes. The "Leviathan" in the title refers to Hobbes's book on the structure of society, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil]]'' and the "Air-Pump" refers to Robert Boyle's invention. The book also contains a translation by Schaffer of Hobbes's ''Dialogus physicus de natura aeris''. It attacked Boyle and others who founded the society for experimental research, soon known as the [[Royal Society]].

== Intention of the work ==
Shapin and Schaffer state, in their first chapter ''Understanding Experiment'', that they wish to answer the question, "Why does one do experiments in order to arrive at scientific truth?"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Their aim is to use a historical account of the debate over the validity of Boyle's air pump experiments, and by extension his [[experimental method]], to discover the origins of the credibility that we give experimentally produced facts today.  The authors wish to avoid "'The self-evident'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt; method, which (they explain) is when historians project the values of their current culture onto the time period that they are studying (in this case valuing the benefits of [[empiricism]]).  They wish to take a "stranger's"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4"/&gt; viewpoint when examining the debate between Hobbes and Boyle because, in the 1660s, both methods of knowledge production were well respected in the academic community&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the reasons that Boyle's experimentalism prevailed over Hobbes's [[natural philosophy]] would not have been obvious to contemporaries.

They explain that, traditionally, Hobbes's position on natural philosophy has been dismissed by historians because historians perceived Hobbes as "misunderstanding"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle's work.  Thus, in ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'', Shapin and Schaffer aim to avoid bias and consider both sides' arguments with equal weight. In addition, they comment on the social instability of [[English Restoration|Restoration]] society post-1660.  They aim to show that the debate between these two contemporaries had political fallout beyond the intellectual sphere, and that accepting Hobbes or Boyle's method of knowledge production was also to accept a social philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
== Chapter II: Seeing and Believing: The Experimental Production of Pneumatic Facts ==
Chapter two outlines Boyle's theory of knowledge production, which revolves around the creation of the "matter of fact".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to an experimentally generated piece of knowledge separate from a universal theory and that was based on probability.  This is in direct opposition to Hobbes (discussed in chapter 3), who required "absolute certainty" based on "logic and geometry" to consider a phenomenon a fact.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  In the eyes of Boyle and his colleagues, the abandonment of absolute certainty was not "a regrettable retreat from more ambitious goals; it was celebrated as a wise rejection of a failed project".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, because "matters of fact" did not have to be absolute, universal assent was not necessary for the production of knowledge.  Boyle made use of three knowledge-producing technologies in order to produce knowledge: "a ''material technology'' embedded in the construction and operation of the air-pump; a ''literary technology'' by means of which the phenomena produced by the pump were made known to those who were not direct witnesses; and a ''social technology'' that incorporated the conventions that experimental philosophers should use in dealing with each other and considering knowledge-claims".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, Shapin and Schaffer give a description of the "material technology," the air-pump itself, essentially a [[suction pump]] attached to a replaceable glass bulb.  When the pump was set in motion, the air would be evacuated from the glass bulb thus creating what we now consider to be a vacuum, but what for contemporaries was a space of great debate (explained below).  However, the integrity of the pump was far from perfect and this leaking is central to the arguments both for and against experimentalism.  Shapin and Schaffer assert that three important points should be taken into account when considering the pump itself: "(1) that both the engine's integrity and its limited leakage were important resources for Boyle in validating his pneumatic finding and their proper interpretation; (2) that the physical integrity of the machine was vital to the perceived integrity of the knowledge the machine helped to produce; and (3) that the lack of its physical integrity was a strategy used by critics, particularly Hobbes, to deconstruct Boyle's claims and to substitute alternative accounts".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments about experimentally generated knowledge revolve around two of Boyle's experiments.  The first experiment is the [[Torricellian apparatus]] placed within the exhausted receiver (the bulb).  The result is that the liquid in the inverted tube of the Torricellian apparatus falls, but not to the level of the liquid in the dish at the base of the inverted tube.  For Boyle, the water level fell because the air was being evacuated from the bulb and thus its spring and weight were no longer acting on the liquid around the base of the tube holding the liquid in the inverted tube up.  The fact that the water did not fall completely to the bottom of the tube was explained (for Boyle) by the existence of air in the bulb that occurred due to leakage.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  However Boyle was careful not to commit to saying that a vacuum existed in the bulb; he stated only that when air was sucked out of the bulb the level of the liquid in the inverted tube fell&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt; - this was the nature of a matter of fact.  The second experiment was based on the theory of cohesion - that "two smooth bodies, such as marble or glass discs, can be made spontaneously to cohere when pressed against each other".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyle's idea was that if two cohered discs were placed in the receiver of the air-pump they would spontaneously separate without the air's pressure to keep them together.  However, when the receiver was evacuated, they did not separate - a result which Boyle blamed on leakage and the fact that he could not get enough air out of the receiver to reduce the air's pressure to an appropriate level.  It should be noted here that Boyle's definitions of "pressure" and "spring" were never clearly defined,&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt; which we shall see is one of Hobbes's major complaints.

The air-pump granted access to a whole new branch of "elaborate" experiments.  In order to witness the phenomena produced by the pump, one had to have access to a pump - which was vastly expensive and difficult to build.  However, the space in which the existing pumps did work was arguably a public space - albeit a restricted one.  "The laboratory was, therefore, a disciplined space, where experimental, discursive, and social practices were collectively controlled by competent members".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective viewing of the air-pump experiments avoided the problem of single eye-witness testimony (which was unreliable), and it offered a space for discourse.  This social space for discourse had two important restrictions: "dispute over matters of fact" was not allowed, and "the rules of the game by which maters of fact were experimentally produced" was not to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  "In Boyle's view the capacity of experiments to yield matters of fact depended not only upon their actual performance but essentially upon the assurance of the relevant community that they had been so performed".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to expand his audience (and credibility) Boyle recommended to the academic community that replication was crucial, though he admitted that others "[would] find it no easy task".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60"/&gt;  As such, the literary technology was used to create "virtual witnessing"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55"/&gt; - a technique in which description of the experimental scene is written so that the reader can envision the experiment.  "Stipulations about how to write proper scientific prose were dispersed throughout [Boyle's] experimental reports of the 1660s, but he also composed a special tract on the subject of 'experimental essays.'"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything about how Boyle instructed other experimentalists to write stressed honesty.  He wanted readers to read circumstantial accounts of failed experiments as well as successes, and he asserted that all physical causes should be stated as only "probable."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In summation, Boyle's theory of knowledge production revolves around assent.  All three technologies work towards allowing as many people as possible to come to an agreement about a "matter of fact."

== Chapter III: Seeing Double: Hobbes's Politics of Plenism before 1660 ==
The third chapter centers on Hobbes' side of the debate for the effective production of knowledge.  However, unlike Boyle, Hobbes denies that natural philosophy can be separated from politics and religion.  In the previous chapter, Boyle's "matter of fact" worked towards separation from church and state by remaining objective and probabilistic.  For Hobbes, however, "the boundaries Boyle proposed to erect and maintain were guarantees of continued disorder, not remedies to philosophical dissension".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes also argued for "proper metaphysical language", in contrast to Boyle's reluctance to address the issue of a vacuum and his vague concept of air "pressure."  Hobbes was motivated by three things in his attack on Boyle: (1) to save his own reputation as a natural philosopher, (2) to develop a system of knowledge production that secured order and maintained proper goals for natural philosophy (namely precision instead of probability) and (3) to be sensitive to the needs of Restoration society (discussed in more detail in chapter 7).&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes' denial of a vacuum stems in part from a need for political stability.  It follows logically that if there can be a space which is devoid of matter, then that is proof of "incorporeal substance"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83"/&gt; - an idea that was adopted by priests to gain the allegiance of the people by promising the safety of this substance, the immortal soul.  This splits the allegiance of each person in a country between the Church and the Monarch, which creates social instability and ultimately, for Hobbes, the risk of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered incorporeal substance a priestly conspiracy to "usurp power" from the true and legitimate leader - the King.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The conflict could be resolved "by collapsing the hierarchy [spiritual government and material government] in favour of matter".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was to that end that Leviathan proffered a materialist and monist natural philosophy.".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98"/&gt;

''Leviathan'' also instructs that the way to produce good theories is through good definition of terms, the use of materialist and monist theory, and the equal importance of ontology and epistemology ("Show men what knowledge is and you will show them the grounds of assent and social order"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 100&lt;/ref&gt;).  Hobbes works from a model of geometry, and the aims of his natural philosophy share the same precision as geometry.  That is why, for Hobbes, good definition is extremely important.  Hobbes also rejects the idea that the senses were reliable enough to be able to provide factual knowledge&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102&lt;/ref&gt; because "the same impressions could be obtained dreaming or waking, by the motions of matter in real external object or by rubbing the eyes".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"/&gt;  Instead, Hobbes posits that man's own agency is the place for natural philosophy, once again drawing on geometry: "'as we know, that, if the figure shown be a circle, then any straight line through the centre shall divide it into two equal parts.'  'And this,' Hobbes said, 'is the knowledge required in a philosopher.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"/&gt;  Thus, belief played no part in Hobbes' concept of a fact, and this ran in opposition to Boyle because Boyle's "matters of fact" required the consensus of a group of witnesses who all believed the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  "Knowledge was constituted when all believed alike.  Likewise for Boyle's clerical allies, religion was a matter of belief and giving witness to that belief...[Hobbes] strategy was one of behavioural control, not one of internal moral control.  It was not that the control of belief was wrong; it was that such control was impractical and an inadequate surety for order."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Artfully, this chapter ends, "For Hobbes, the rejection of vacuum was the elimination of a space within which dissension could take place."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter IV: The Trouble with Experiment: Hobbes versus Boyle ==
As the chapter title suggests, this chapter focuses on how these two historical figures interacted.  It starts with a list of Hobbes' criticisms of Boyle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
- [Hobbes] was skeptical about the allegedly public and witnessed character of experimental performances, and, therefore, of the capacity to generate consensus, even within the experimental rules of the game.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He regarded the experimental programme as otiose.  It was pointless to perform a systematic series of experiments, for if one could, in fact, discern causes from natural effects, then a single experiment should suffice.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He denied the status of "philosophy" to the outcome of the experimental programme.  "Philosophy", for Hobbes, was the practice of demonstrating how effects followed from causes, or of inferring causes from effects.  The experimental programme failed to satisfy this definition.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He systematically refused to credit experimentalists' claims that one could establish a procedural boundary between observing the positive regularities produced by experiment (facts) and identifying the physical cause that accounts for them (theories).
&lt;br /&gt;
- He persistently treated experimentalists' "hypotheses" and "conjectures" as statements about real causes.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He contended that, whatever hypothetical cause or state of nature Boyle adduced to explain his experimentally produced phenomena, an alternative and superior explanation could be proffered and was, in fact, already available.  In particular, Hobbes stipulated that Boyle's explanations invoked vacuism.  Hobbes's alternatives proceed from plenism.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He asserted the inherently defeasible character of experimental systems and therefore the knowledge experimental practices produced.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes criticized Boyle's experimental space for being private (as it was exclusive to everyone but empiricists) and insisted that the space had a "master"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 113&lt;/ref&gt; - which undermined Boyle's concept of free discourse and consensus to generate matters of fact.  Also he criticized the fact that, since the whole experimental community must come into agreement before a "matter of fact" can be produced, the whole experimental community must view the same demonstration at the same time.  This was an obvious impossibility and was problematic for Boyle because "If they were not witnessed simultaneously and together, then in what ways was the evaluation of experimental testimony different from the evaluation of testimony generally?"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes also criticized the air-pump itself, saying that "the physical integrity of the machine was massively violated."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  He asserted that "it was impossible to understand the air-pump experiments 'unless the nature of the air is known first.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  This was important for three reasons: (1) because Hobbes said the fluidity of the air ruled out the ability to produce an impermeable seal (2) because describing the air as mixture allowed Hobbes to explain the pumps actions (drawing out the course aspects of the air and leaving behind the more subtle fluid) and (3) because Hobbes said that, since Boyle could not offer a cause for the spring of the air, that made him an inadequate natural philosopher.&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117"/&gt;  Indeed, it was Boyle's recommendation to ignore causes that Hobbes found intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not an objection to the empirical method.  Hobbes only ever doubted the senses as a reliable source of information.  He makes an example of the motion of a person's blood, "for no one feels the motion of their blood unless it pours forth,"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt; as proof of the unreliability of the senses.  Yet he did not object to Harvey's work to prove the motion of the blood - rather he even considered himself a "methodological ally" of Harvey's "both denying the foundational nature and of personal experience."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127"/&gt;

"Thus for Hobbes, the task of the natural philosopher was to approach as near as he could to the products of the geometer and the civic philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt; while "Boyle's compulsion was only partial; there was room to differ and tolerance was essential to the maintenance of this partial and liberal compulsion.  Managed dissent within the moral community of experimentalists was safe.  Uncontrollable divisiveness and civil war followed from any other course."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter V: Boyle's Adversaries: Experiment Defended ==
While the previous chapter focuses on the attacks of Boyle's main opponent (Hobbes), this chapter focuses on Boyle's actions in the face of more general adversity.  The three main opponents to Boyle were Hobbes, Linus and More, and Boyle's response to each in turn reflects his opinion of their ideas and shows what parts of his own ideas he deemed essential and what parts he deemed less so.  The figures can be divided into two groups: Linus - who conformed to the model of the experimental programme but did not agree with Boyle's explanation of the air-pump experiments, and Hobbes and More - who attacked the experimental programme as an institution.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

"Linus said there was no vacuum in the Torricellian space.  This was apparent because one could see through that space; if there were a vacuum, 'no visible species could proceed either from it, or through it, unto the eye."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Linus offered a nonmechanical solution to the sustained height of the liquid in the Torricellian apparatus.  He suggested that "a certain internal thread (funiculus) whose upper extremity was attached to the finger [blocking the top of the inverted tube] and whose lower extremity was attached to the surface of the mercury."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157"/&gt;  He also explained that, in the marble disc experiment, the fault was not with the air-pump but rather with Boyle's theory of the spring of the air.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as far as experimental procedure was concerned, Linus was following the rules. So how would Boyle respond?  While Boyle's response contained a restatement of the rules of experimentation, a restatement of the boundaries of experimental philosophy, a defense of his mechanical interpretation, and a particular defense of the spring of the air, Boyle took great pains to "make clear that he generally approved of Linus's manner of constructing and delivering his criticisms."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Linus was fully welcomed into the experimental community despite his difference of opinion.  Thus, "in his ''Defense'' Boyle would therefore demonstrate not merely that Linus was wrong, but also how experimental controversies ought to be conducted."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''Defense'', Boyle restated that "he could not understand why Linus, like Hobbes, had attacked him as a vacuist when he had explicitly declared his nescience on the matter and had identified the question as metaphysical in character" and thus out of the range of experimental exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes on the other hand attacked the validity of the experimental programme itself.  "Boyle's response to Hobbes was fundamentally a defense of the integrity and value of experimental practices."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyle's reply included a technical response detailing the changes he had made to the pump (immersing it in water), a reiteration of the rules of experimental discourse, "an experimental programme devoted to clearing up the troubles which Hobbes had pointed to in his comments on New Experiments," and an ideological rejection of Hobbes's natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  In his reiteration of the rules of experimental discourse he defended his empirical method by asserting that the argument was over the interpretation of matters of fact and not the facts themselves, thus keeping the experimental way of life out of the line of fire.  In response to Hobbes's criticism that the air had a subtler part that permeated the pump, Boyle stated that "this aether must either be demonstrated by experiment to exist or it was to be regarded as a metaphysical entity",&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 181&lt;/ref&gt; which Boyle has excluded from the scope of the experimental method.

Henry More had three main arguments in relation to Boyle: "(1) that matter itself was passive, inert and stupid; (2) that its motion was guided by 'some Immaterial Being that exercises its directive Activity on the Matter of the World'; (3) that mechanism alone was an inadequate way of accounting for Boyle's phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  He insisted that natural philosophy could be used "as [a weapon] in theology"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 212&lt;/ref&gt; which we have seen is an area that Boyle wished to keep separate from the experimental method.  Thus, in response, Boyle "defended the autonomy and status of his [experimental] community" as separate from other social bodies (such as the Church)&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote "of 'the doctor's grand and laudable design, wherein [he] heartily wish[ed] him much success of proving the existence of an incorporeal substance.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  "Boyle argued that because More's spirit was not a physical principle it could not be part of the language of organized experimenters."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217"/&gt;

Thus, from this chapter we see that above all Boyle wished to defend his experimental method, its separation from other bodies of knowledge, and lastly his personal claims about the spring of the air.

== Chapter VI: Replication and Its Troubles: Air-Pumps in the 1660s ==
Chapter 6 is an evaluation of the technologies stated in chapter 2 and their role in replication - namely replication of the material technology and the utility of virtual witnessing.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt;  The chapter focuses on the propagation of the pump via the experimental community.

The air-pump was first developed in Oxford and London with the help of the Royal Society (and in response to Hobbes criticism) beginning in 1659.  It was during its development that Robert Moray wrote to Christiaan Huygens (Holland) detailing the changes Boyle would be making to the original design of his pump.  Huygens rejected Boyle's changes and set about making his own alterations.  "Christiaan Huygens was the only natural philosopher in the 1660s who built an air-pump that was outside the direct management of Boyle and Hooke."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 235&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of Huygens development, Huygens claimed that "my pneumatic pump was begun to work since yesterday, and all that night a bladder stayed inflated within it [which was a test for the goodness of a pump]...which Mr. Boyle was not able to effect."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, he discovered a phenomenon called anomalous suspension (the suspension of water in a Toricellian apparatus when the water was purged of air, but when a bubble was introduced the water fell) "whose outcome measured the excellence of any air-pump...[and] to interpret this calibration phenomenon, Huygens had summoned into existence a new fluid and challenged the sufficiency of the weight and spring of common air.  The effect of this fluid was only visible in good pumps."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "for more than eighteen months neither of Huygens' claims were granted the status of matters of fact" and it is in this time period that we see how the troubles of replication were dealt with by contemporaries.  The dispute resulted in a flurry of letters between Boyle and Huygens, each attacking the integrity of the other's machine (and by extension the theories of their makers).  "So in March and April 1663 it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 249&lt;/ref&gt; - full and complete breakdown of the technology of virtual witnessing.  Thus, Huygens travelled to London and became part of the Royal Society and replicated his matter of fact.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with replication was that the pumps were constantly being rebuilt, and so results would vary with each reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shapin and Schaffer there were two main problems with replication in the 1660s.  (1) "The accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment.  One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved" and (2) "if replication is the technology which turn belief into knowledge, then knowledge-production depends not just on the abstract exchange of paper and ideas but on the practical social regulation of men and machines."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, "the effective solution to the problem of knowledge was predicated upon a solution to the problem of social order."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter VII: Natural Philosophy and the Restoration: Interests in Dispute ==
"Hobbes and Boyle used the work of the 1640s and 1650s to give rival accounts of the right way to conduct natural philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and, in chapter 7, Shapin and Schaffer show how those models were interpreted and supported by Restoration society.  "The experience of the War and the Republic showed that disputed knowledge produced civil strife...Boyle's technologies could only gain assent within a secure social space for experimental practice...[while] Hobbes assaulted the security of that space because it was yet one more case of divided power."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283"/&gt;

In essence, Boyle's theory and Hobbes's theory are inspired by the same problem: what to do when people can't agree on the truth.  Boyle's supporters  "Wilkins and Ward were ejected from the universities...they argued against each other about the virtues of toleration or suppression of Dissent.  Wilkins attacked the Uniformity Act as too coercive: he would have preferred that the Church 'stand without whipping.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301&lt;/ref&gt;  "These exchanges give considerable point to the proposals that Boyle and his allies produced for the establishment of a social space in which dissent would be safe and tolerable."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"/&gt;  In addition, "Sprat's ''History of the Royal Society'' (1667) labeled Hobbesian dogmatism as tyranny, and uncontrolled private judgement as enthusiasm.  Such dangers were to be excluded from the community - otherwise debate would not be safe."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"/&gt;  "The works of Barlow, Pett, and Dury argued that the balance of disputing sects was better than a state that included a cowed and disaffected party coerced into silence."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 302&lt;/ref&gt;  "With Hobbes in view...[[Joseph Glanvill|Glanvill]] insisted that 'dogmatizing is the great disturber both of our selves, and the world with-out us: for while we wed an opinion, we resolvedly ingage against every one that opposeth it...hence grow Schisms, heresies, and anomalies beyond Arithmetick."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Adversaries of the experimental method took offense in two ways.  The first was to "satirize the low status of experimental labour" and label their discipline as little more than children playing with toys.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 307&lt;/ref&gt;  And the second, more social ingrained argument, was that the division between Church and the discovery of "matters of fact" "would weaken, rather than strengthen, the fortunes of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 308&lt;/ref&gt;  "Boyle portrayed the work of experiment as distinct from that of the Church.  Yet its work was also valuable for the churchmen.  If the rules of the experimental game were obeyed, then the game would work well for the godly.  These were the aspects of experimental philosophy that More and his allies found useful at the Restoration."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  As we have seen previously, this allied relationship between natural philosophy and the clergy was unacceptable to Hobbes because it undermined the political authority of the King and caused social instability by splitting the allegiances of the his subjects between his own temporal authority over their bodies and the spiritual authority harnessed by the clergy&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310"/&gt;

== Chapter VIII: The Polity of Science: Conclusions ==
In the final chapter of ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'', Shapin and Schaffer condense their vastly complicated picture of Restoration society and how it interacted with the development of modern science to three points.  "First, scientific practitioners have created, selected, and maintained a [[polity]] within which they operate and make intellectual product; second, the intellectual product made within that polity has become an element in political activity and in the state; third, there is a conditional relationship between the nature of the polity occupied by scientific intellectual and the nature of the wider polity."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 332&lt;/ref&gt;  In proving those three points they say they had three things to connect: "(1) the polity of the intellectual community; (2) the solution to the practical problem of making and justifying knowledge; and (3) the polity of the wider society" and that they did so by connection three things: "(1) that the solution to the problem of knowledge is political...(2) that the knowledge thus produced and authenticated become an element in political action in the wider polity...[and] (3) that the contest among alternative forms of life and their characteristic forms of intellectual product depend on the political success of the various candidates in insinuating themselves into the activities of other institutions and other interest groups.  He who has the most, and the most powerful, allies wins."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 342&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a departure from the "self-evident" scholars who attribute the victory of the empirical method to its inherent "goodness" (discussed in chapter 1).

They end by relating their examination of Restoration society to their current social climate in the late twentieth century:  "As we come to recognize the conventional and artifactual status of our forms of knowing, we put ourselves in a position to realize that it is ourselves and not reality that is responsible for what we know.  Knowledge, as much as the state, is the product of human actions.  Hobbes was right."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 344&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

== Reception of ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'' ==
The work has been described as a classic example in the [[history of science]] of the posing of a basic question on [[scientific rationality]]. Can the rationality of two sides in a debate be described, from outside, when hindsight operates and the "road not taken" by science is known?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=austin harrington|author2=Barbara L. Marshall|author3=Hans-Peter Mèuller|title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWHoZJ8RzhoC&amp;pg=PA534|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-29046-3|pages=534–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret C. Jacob wrote that, for a time, it was the most influential book in the field of history of science, following the trend to [[relativism]] with its equation of "scientific discourses" with "strategies of power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victoria E. Bonnell|author2=Lynn Avery Hunt|author3=Richard Biernacki|title=Beyond the Cultural Turn: New Directions in the Study of Society and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnZiiFs24MIC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21679-2|pages=101–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. L. Heilbron credits Shapin and Schaffer with picking important aspects of the development of experimental culture that are still relevant, citing specifically the problems with replication.  However, he casts doubt upon the strength of the relationship between politics of the greater society and the politics within the Royal Society.  In addition, Heilbron laments the absence of comparisons to the development of empiricism in the rest of Europe because it blinds the reader to what may have been peculiar to England's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1035825 | year = 1989 | author1 = Heilbron | first1 = J. L. | title = Leviathan and the air-pump. Hobbes, Boyle, and the experimental life | journal = Medical History | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 256–257 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300049292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Marie Roos, on the other hand, writes that Shapin and Schaffer do indeed draw a connection between the history of science and the history of political thought, and that their resolution to remain impartial when examining the argument between Hobbes and Boyle forces historians of science and politics alike to recognize the relationship between the two branches of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Roos http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=25967955484936&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence M. Principe, in ''The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest'', argues extensively that many of the conclusions reached by Shapin and Schaffer rest on inaccurate and at times presentist conceptions of Boyle's work.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Principe. ''The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest''. Princeton University Press, Princeton 1998. {{ISBN|0-691-01678-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noel Malcolm and Cees Leijenhorst deny the political background of the Hobbes-Boyle controversy. They argue that Hobbes’ rejection of the void has no political agenda and has nothing to do with his attack on [[incorporeal substances]], as Shapin and Schaffer claim. Both Malcolm and Leijenhorst call attention to the remarkable fact that Hobbes was already attacking incorporeal substances when he was a [[vacuist]], and long before he became a [[plenist]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm: ''Aspects of Hobbes''. Oxford University Press, Oxford 2002. {{ISBN|0-19-924714-5}}. pp. 187-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cees Leijenhorst: ''The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: the Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes’ Natural Philosophy''. Brill, Leiden 2002. {{ISBN|90-04-11729-6}}. p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Horstmann, in ''Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe'', has criticized Shapin and Schaffer's use of the historical evidence. He argues that Shapin and Schaffer have a lot of important facts wrong. Before May 1648, for example, Hobbes preferred vacuist interpretations of experimental pneumatics and strictly rejected plenist interpretations as ''not imaginable'';&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes: ''Thomas White’s De Mundo Examined''. Bradford University Press, London 1976. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but Shapin and Schaffer turn the vacuist into a plenist by ignoring all the vacuist interpretations and by producing a very faulty translation as a putative proof for a plenist interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Horstmann argues that there are many similar errors and wrong quotations in ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'' and suggests that the chapters dealing with Hobbes are constructed on heavy and sometimes systematic misrepresentations of the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Horstmann: ''Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe''. Mackensen, Berlin 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-926535-52-8}}. ''Leviathan und die Erpumper''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lotka-Volterra model (1.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1).png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Predator]]-prey population cycles in a Lotka–Volterra model&lt;!-- with the parameters set to (1.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1)--&gt;]]
The '''Lotka–Volterra equations''', also known as the '''predator–prey equations''', are a pair of first-order [[nonlinear]] [[differential equation]]s, frequently used to describe the [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of [[Systems biology|biological systems]] in which two species interact, one as a [[predator]] and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= \alpha x - \beta x y, \\
 \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= \delta x y - \gamma y,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:{{mvar|x}} is the number of prey (for example, [[rabbit]]s);
:{{mvar|y}} is the number of some [[Predation|predator]] (for example, [[fox]]es);
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; represent the instantaneous growth rates of the two populations;
:{{mvar|t}} represents time;
:{{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} are positive real [[parameter]]s describing the interaction of the two [[species]].

The Lotka–Volterra system of equations is an example of a [[Kolmogorov]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freedman |first=H. I. |title=Deterministic Mathematical Models in Population Ecology |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brauer |first=F. |last2=Castillo-Chavez |first2=C. |title=Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoppensteadt |first=F. |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Predator-prey_model |title=Predator-prey model |work=[[Scholarpedia]] |volume=1 |issue=10 |page=1563 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a more general framework that can model the dynamics of ecological systems with predator–prey interactions, [[Competition_(biology)|competition]], disease, and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].

==History==
The Lotka–Volterra predator–prey [[mathematical model|model]] was initially proposed by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] in the theory of autocatalytic chemical reactions in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Periodic Reaction|journal=[[Journal of Physical Chemistry A|J. Phys. Chem.]]|volume=14|issue=3|pages=271–274|year=1910|doi=10.1021/j150111a004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goelmany"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goel|first=N. S.|display-authors=etal|title=On the Volterra and Other Non-Linear Models of Interacting Populations|location=|publisher=Academic Press|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was effectively the [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic equation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berryman|first=A.

H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&amp;id=8GsEAAAAYAAJ&amp;jtp=113#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Notice sur la loi que la population poursuit dans son accroissement|journal=Corresp. mathématique et physique|volume=10|issue=|pages=113–121|year=1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 Lotka extended the model, via [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], to "organic systems" using a plant species and a herbivorous animal species as an example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|pmc=1084562|title=Analytical Note on Certain Rhythmic Relations in Organic Systems|journal=[[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.]]|volume=6|issue=|pages=410–415|year=1920|doi=10.1073/pnas.6.7.410|pmid=16576509}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 he utilised the equations to analyse predator–prey interactions in his book on [[biomathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|title=Elements of Physical Biology|location=|publisher=[[Williams and Wilkins]]|year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same set of equations was published in 1926 by [[Vito Volterra]], a mathematician and physicist, who had become interested in [[mathematical biology]].&lt;ref name="Goelmany"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volterra|first=V.|title=Variazioni e fluttuazioni del numero d’individui in specie animali conviventi|journal=[[Accademia dei Lincei|Mem.

Lincei Roma]]|volume=2|issue=|pages=31–113|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Volterra|first=V.|chapter=Variations and fluctuations of the number of individuals in animal species living together|title=Animal Ecology|editor-last=Chapman|editor-first=R. N.|location=|publisher=[[McGraw–Hill]]|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volterra's enquiry was inspired through his interactions with the marine biologist [[Umberto D'Ancona]], who was courting his daughter at the time and later was to become his son-in-law. D'Ancona studied the fish catches in the [[Adriatic Sea]] and had noticed that the percentage of predatory fish caught had increased during the years of [[World War I]] (1914–18). This puzzled him, as the fishing effort had been very much reduced during the war years. Volterra developed his model independently from Lotka and used it to explain d'Ancona's observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kingsland|first=S.|title=Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology|location=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0-226-43728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was later extended to include density-dependent prey growth and a [[functional response]] of the form developed by [[C. S. Holling]]; a model that has become known as the Rosenzweig–McArthur model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=M. L.|last2=MacArthur|first2=R.H.|year=1963|title=Graphical representation and stability conditions of predator-prey interactions|journal=American Naturalist|issue=|pages=209–223|doi=10.1086/282272|volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Lotka–Volterra and Rosenzweig–MacArthur models have been used to explain the dynamics of natural populations of predators and prey, such as the [[lynx]] and [[snowshoe hare]] data of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilpin|first=M. E.|year=1973|title=Do hares eat lynx?|journal=American Naturalist|issue=|pages=727–730|doi=10.1086/282870|volume=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the moose and wolf populations in [[Isle Royale National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=C.|last2=Devulder|first2=G.|last3=Vucetich|first3=J.A.|last4=Peterson|first4=R.|last5=Arditi|first5=R.|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00977.x|title=The wolves of Isle Royale display scale-invariant satiation and density dependent predation on moose|journal=J. Anim. Ecol.|volume=74|issue=5|pages=809–816|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, an alternative to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model (and its common-prey-dependent generalizations) emerged, the ratio dependent or [[Arditi–Ginzburg equations|Arditi–Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arditi|first=R.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=L. R.|year=1989|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf|title=Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: ratio dependence|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=139|issue=|pages=311–326|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(89)80211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of prey- or ratio-dependent models has been much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abrams|first=P. A.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=L. R.|year=2000|title=The nature of predation: prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=15|issue=8|pages=337–341|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)01908-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lotka–Volterra equations have a long history of use in [[Economics|economic theory]]; their initial application is commonly credited to [[Richard M. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gandolfo|first=G.|authorlink=Giancarlo Gandolfo|title=Giuseppe Palomba and the Lotka–Volterra equations|journal=Rendiconti Lincei|volume=19|issue=4|pages=347–357|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12210-008-0023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=R.

==Physical meaning of the equations==
The Lotka–Volterra model makes a number of assumptions, not necessarily realizable in nature, about the environment and evolution of the predator and prey populations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/predator-prey.html|title=PREDATOR-PREY DYNAMICS|website=www.tiem.utk.edu|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The prey population finds ample food at all times.
#The food supply of the predator population depends entirely on the size of the prey population.
#The rate of change of population is proportional to its size.
#During the process, the environment does not change in favour of one species, and genetic adaptation is inconsequential.
#Predators have limitless appetite.

As differential equations are used, the solution is [[determinism|deterministic]] and [[Continuous function|continuous]]. This, in turn, implies that the generations of both the predator and prey are continually overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=D.|last2=Hiorns|first2=R. W.|display-authors=etal|title=The Mathematical Theory of the Dynamics of Biological Populations|volume=II|publisher=Academic Press|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations}}

===Prey===
When multiplied out, the prey equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta x y.&lt;/math&gt;

The prey are assumed to have an unlimited food supply and to reproduce exponentially, unless subject to predation; this [[exponential growth]] is represented in the equation above by the term ''αx''. The rate of predation upon the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet, this is represented above by ''βxy''. If either {{mvar|x}} or {{mvar|y}} is zero, then there can be no predation.

With these two terms the equation above can be interpreted as follows: the rate of change of the prey's population is given by its own growth rate minus the rate at which it is preyed upon.

===Predators===
The predator equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta xy - \gamma y.&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''δxy'' represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used, as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey). ''γy'' represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration, it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey.

Hence the equation expresses that the rate of change of the predator's population depends upon the rate at which it consumes prey, minus its intrinsic death rate.

==Solutions to the equations==
The equations have [[periodic function|periodic]] solutions and do not have a simple expression in terms of the usual [[trigonometric function]]s, although they are quite tractable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Antonio|last2=Gander|first2=Martin Jakob|year=1999|title=Parametrische Lösungen der Räuber-Beute-Gleichungen im Vergleich|journal=Il Volterriano|volume=7|issue=|pages=32–44|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:6300/ATTACHMENT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=C.

If none of the non-negative parameters {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} vanishes, three can be absorbed into the normalization of variables to leave only one parameter: since the first equation is homogeneous in {{math|''x''}}, and the second one in {{math|''y''}}, the parameters ''β''/''α'' and ''δ''/''γ'' are absorbable in the normalizations of {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, and {{math|''γ''}} into the normalization of {{math|''t''}}, so that only {{math|''α''/''γ''}} remains arbitrary. It is the only parameter affecting the nature of the solutions.

A [[linearization]] of the equations yields a solution similar to [[simple harmonic motion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tong|first=H.|title=Threshold Models in Non-linear Time Series Analysis|location=|publisher=Springer–Verlag|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the population of predators trailing that of prey by 90° in the cycle.

===A simple example===
Suppose there are two species of animals, a baboon (prey) and a cheetah (predator). If the initial conditions are 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs, one can plot the progression of the two species over time. The choice of time interval is arbitrary.
[[File:Cheetah Baboon LV.jpg|center]]

One may also plot solutions parametrically as [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s in [[phase space]], without representing time, but with one axis representing the number of prey and the other axis representing the number of predators for all times.

This corresponds to eliminating time from the two differential equations above to produce a single differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{y}{x} \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{\beta y -\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
relating the variables ''x'' and ''y''. The solutions of this equation are closed curves. It is amenable to [[separation of variables]]: integrating
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta y - \alpha}{y} \,dy + \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{x} \,dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
yields the implicit relationship 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \delta x - \gamma \ln(x) + \beta y - \alpha \ln(y),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is a constant quantity depending on the initial conditions and conserved on each curve.

[[File:CentralTendencyLV.jpg|center|Phase-space plot]]

An aside: These graphs illustrate a serious potential problem with this ''as a biological model'': For this specific choice of parameters, in each cycle, the baboon population is reduced to extremely low numbers, yet recovers (while the cheetah population remains sizeable at the lowest baboon density). In real-life situations, however, chance fluctuations of the discrete numbers of individuals, as well as the family structure and life-cycle of baboons, might cause the baboons to actually go extinct, and, by consequence, the cheetahs as well. This modelling problem has been called the "atto-fox problem", an [[atto-]]&lt;nowiki&gt;fox&lt;/nowiki&gt; being a notional 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; of a fox.&lt;ref name="LobrySari2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobry |first1=Claude |last2=Sari |first2=Tewfik |title=Migrations in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model and the "atto-fox" problem |journal=Arima |date=2015 |volume=20 |pages=95-125 |url=http://arima.inria.fr/020/pdf/vol.20.pp.95-125.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mollison |first=D. |url=http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~denis/epi/velocities.pdf |title=Dependence of epidemic and population velocities on basic parameters |journal=Math.

===Phase-space plot of a further example===
A less extreme example covers: 
{{mvar|α}} = 2/3, {{mvar|β}} = 4/3, {{mvar|γ}} = 1 = {{mvar|δ}}. Assume {{math|''x'', ''y''}} quantify thousands each. Circles represent prey and predator initial conditions from {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}} = 0.9 to 1.8, in steps of 0.1. The fixed point is at (1, 1/2).
[[Image:Lotka-Volterra orbits 01.svg|center]]

==Dynamics of the system==
In the model system, the predators thrive when there are plentiful prey but, ultimately, outstrip their food supply and decline. As the predator population is low, the prey population will increase again. These dynamics continue in a cycle of growth and decline.

===Population equilibrium===
Population equilibrium occurs in the model when neither of the population levels is changing, i.e. when both of the derivatives are equal to 0:
:&lt;math&gt;x(\alpha - \beta y) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-y(\gamma - \delta x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above system of equations yields two solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;\{y = 0, x = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{y = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}, x = \frac{\gamma}{\delta} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, there are two equilibria.

The first solution effectively represents the extinction of both species. If both populations are at 0, then they will continue to be so indefinitely. The second solution represents a fixed point at which both populations sustain their current, non-zero numbers, and, in the simplified model, do so indefinitely. The levels of population at which this equilibrium is achieved depend on the chosen values of the parameters ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', and ''δ''.

===Stability of the fixed points===
The stability of the fixed point at the origin can be determined by performing a [[linearization]] using [[partial derivative]]s.

The [[Jacobian matrix]] of the predator–prey model is

:&lt;math&gt;J(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 
 \alpha - \beta y &amp; -\beta x \\
 \delta y &amp; \delta x - \gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
and is known as [[community matrix]].

====First fixed point (extinction)====
When evaluated at the steady state of (0,&amp;nbsp;0), the Jacobian matrix ''J'' becomes

:&lt;math&gt;J(0, 0) = \begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -\gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenvalue]]s of this matrix are

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \alpha, \quad \lambda_2 = -\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

In the model ''α'' and ''γ'' are always greater than zero, and as such the sign of the eigenvalues above will always differ. Hence the fixed point at the origin is a [[saddle point]].

The stability of this fixed point is of significance. If it were stable, non-zero populations might be attracted towards it, and as such the dynamics of the system might lead towards the extinction of both species for many cases of initial population levels. However, as the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point, and hence unstable, it follows that the extinction of both species is difficult in the model. (In fact, this could only occur if the prey were artificially completely eradicated, causing the predators to die of starvation. If the predators were eradicated, the prey population would grow without bound in this simple model.) The populations of prey and predator can get infinitesimally close to zero and still recover.

====Second fixed point (oscillations)====
Evaluating ''J'' at the second fixed point leads to
:&lt;math&gt;J\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right) = \begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; -\frac{\beta \gamma}{\delta} \\
 \frac{\alpha \delta}{\beta} &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues of this matrix are
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}, \quad \lambda_2 = -i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As the eigenvalues are both purely imaginary and conjugate to each others, this fixed point is [[Dynamical system#Conjugation results|elliptic]], so the solutions are periodic, oscillating on a small ellipse around the fixed point, with a period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

As illustrated in the circulating oscillations in the figure above, the level curves are closed [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s surrounding the fixed point: the levels of the predator and prey populations cycle and oscillate without [[damping]] around the fixed point with period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the [[constant of motion]] ''V'', or, equivalently, ''K'' = exp(''V''), &lt;math&gt;K = y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;, can be found for the closed orbits near the fixed point.

Increasing ''K'' moves a closed orbit  closer to the fixed point. The largest value of the constant ''K'' is obtained by solving the optimization problem
:&lt;math&gt;y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x} = \frac{y^\alpha x^\gamma}{e^{\delta x+\beta y}} \longrightarrow \max\limits_{x,y&gt;0}.&lt;/math&gt;
The maximal value of ''K'' is thus attained at the stationary (fixed) point &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and amounts to 
:&lt;math&gt;K^* = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta e}\right)^\alpha \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta e}\right)^\gamma,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''e'' is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]].

In [[astronomy]], '''luminosity''' is the total amount of [[energy]] emitted per unit of [[time]] by a [[star]], [[galaxy]], or other [[astronomical object]].&lt;ref name=Hopkins1980&gt;{{cite book |last=Hopkins |first=Jeanne |title=Glossary of Astronomy and Astrophysics |edition=2nd |publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]] |date=1980 |isbn=978-0-226-35171-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term for energy emitted per unit time, luminosity is [[synonym]]ous with [[Power (physics)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/luminosity|title=Luminosity {{!}} astronomy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.mimi.hu/astronomy/luminosity.html|title=* Luminosity (Astronomy) - Definition,meaning - Online Encyclopedia|website=en.mimi.hu|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/21640-star-luminosity-and-magnitude.html|title=Brightest Stars: Luminosity &amp; Magnitude|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/a290/lectures/A2290_13%20(Flux%20and%20Magnitudes).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[SI]] units luminosity is measured in [[joules]] per second or [[watt]]s. Values for luminosity are often given in the terms of the [[Solar luminosity|luminosity]] of the [[Sun]], L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. Luminosity can also be given in terms of the astronomical [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] system: the [[Absolute magnitude#Bolometric magnitude|absolute bolometric magnitude]] (M&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt;) of an object is a logarithmic measure of its total energy emission rate, while [[absolute magnitude]] is a logarithmic measure of the luminosity within some specific [[wavelength]] range or [[Passband|filter band]].

In contrast, the term ''brightness'' in astronomy is generally used to refer to an object's apparent brightness: that is, how bright an object appears to an observer. Apparent brightness depends on both the luminosity of the object and the distance between the object and observer, and also on any [[Extinction (astronomy)|absorption]] of light along the path from object to observer. [[Apparent magnitude]] is a logarithmic measure of apparent brightness.

== Measuring luminosity ==
[[File:Hertzsprung-Russel StarData.png|thumb|230px|right|[[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] identifying stellar luminosity as a function of temperature for many stars in our solar neighborhood.]]In [[astronomy]], ''luminosity'' is the amount of [[Radiant energy|electromagnetic energy]] a body radiates per unit of time.&lt;ref name="AUSTRALIA2004"&gt;{{cite web |title=Luminosity of Stars |publisher=[[Australia Telescope National Facility]]|url=http://outreach.atnf.csiro.au/education/senior/astrophysics/photometry_luminosity.html |date=12 July 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809144429/http://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach//education/senior/astrophysics/photometry_luminosity.html |archivedate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When not qualified, the term "luminosity" means bolometric luminosity, which is measured either in the [[SI]] units, [[watt]]s, or in terms of [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]] ({{solar luminosity}}).  A [[bolometer]] is the instrument used to measure [[radiant energy]] over a wide band by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and measurement of heating.  A star also radiates [[neutrino]]s, which carry off some energy (about 2% in the case of our Sun), contributing to the star's total luminosity.&lt;ref name="BAHCALL1"&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Bahcall |authorlink=John N.

While bolometers do exist, they cannot be used to measure even the apparent brightness of a star because they are insufficiently sensitive across the electromagnetic spectrum and because most wavelengths do not reach the surface of the Earth.  In practice bolometric magnitudes are measured by taking measurements at certain wavelengths and constructing a model of the total spectrum that is most likely to match those measurements.  In some cases, the process of estimation is extreme, with luminosities being calculated when less than 1% of the energy output is observed, for example with a hot [[Wolf-Rayet star]] observed only in the infra-red.  Bolometric luminosities can also be calculated using a [[bolometric correction]] to a luminosity in a particular passband.&lt;ref name=nieva&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2013A&amp;A...550A..26N|arxiv=1212.0928|title=Temperature, gravity, and bolometric correction scales for non-supergiant OB stars|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=550|pages=A26|author1=Nieva|first1=M.-F|year=2013|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201219677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buzzoni&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2010MNRAS.403.1592B|arxiv=1002.1972|title=Bolometric correction and spectral energy distribution of cool stars in Galactic clusters|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=403|issue=3|pages=1592|author1=Buzzoni|first1=A|last2=Patelli|first2=L|last3=Bellazzini|first3=M|last4=Pecci|first4=F.

The term luminosity is also used in relation to particular [[passband]]s such as a visual luminosity of [[k band (infrared)|K-band]] luminosity.  These are not generally luminosities in the strict sense of an absolute measure of radiated power, but absolute magnitudes defined for a given filter in a [[photometric system]].  Several different photometric systems exist.  Some such as the UBV or [[UBV photometric system|Johnson]] system are defined against photometric standard stars, while others such as the [[AB magnitude|AB system]] are defined in terms of a [[spectral flux density]].&lt;ref name=delfosse&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2000A&amp;A...364..217D|arxiv=astro-ph/0010586|title=Accurate masses of very low mass stars.

== Stellar luminosity ==
A star's luminosity can be determined from two stellar characteristics: size and [[effective temperature]].&lt;ref name="AUSTRALIA2004" /&gt; The former is typically represented in terms of solar [[radius|radii]], R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, while the latter is represented in [[kelvin]]s, but in most cases neither can be measured directly.  To determine a star's radius, two other metrics are needed: the star's [[angular diameter]] and its distance from Earth, often calculated using [[parallax]].  Both can be measured with great accuracy in certain cases, with cool supergiants often having large angular diameters, and some cool evolved stars having [[astrophysical maser|maser]]s in their atmospheres that can be used to measure the parallax using [[VLBI]].  However, for most stars the angular diameter or parallax, or both, are far below our ability to measure with any certainty.  Since the effective temperature is merely a number that represents the temperature of a black body that would reproduce the luminosity, it obviously cannot be measured directly, but it can be estimated from the spectrum.

An alternative way to measure stellar luminosity is to measure the star's apparent brightness and distance.  A third component needed to derive the luminosity is the degree of [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] that is present, a condition that usually arises because of gas and dust present in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM), the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and [[circumstellar dust|circumstellar matter]].  Consequently, one of astronomy's central challenges in determining a star's luminosity is to derive accurate measurements for each of these components, without which an accurate luminosity figure remains elusive.&lt;ref name="KARTTUNEN1"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Karttunen  | first1 = Hannu  | title = Fundamental Astronomy  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]  | date = 2003  | page = 289  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEhHqwW-kgQC |deadurl=no | isbn = 978-3-540-00179-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extinction can only be measured directly if the actual and observed luminosities are both known, but it can be estimated from the observed colour of a star, using models of the expected level of reddening from the interstellar medium.

In the current system of [[stellar classification]], stars are grouped according to temperature, with the massive, very young and energetic [[O-type main sequence star|Class O]] stars boasting temperatures in excess of 30,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] while the less massive, typically older [[Stellar classification#Class M|Class M]] stars exhibit temperatures less than 3,500&amp;nbsp;K. Because luminosity is proportional to temperature to the fourth power, the large variation in stellar temperatures produces an even vaster variation in stellar luminosity.&lt;ref name="LEDREW1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ledrew, Glenn | title=The Real Starry Sky | journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date=February 2001 | volume=95 | pages=32–33 | url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2001JRASC..95...32L&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf | accessdate=2 July 2012 | bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the luminosity depends on a high power of the stellar mass, high mass luminous stars have much shorter lifetimes.  The most luminous stars are always young stars, no more than a few million years for the most extreme.  In the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], the x-axis represents temperature or spectral type while the y-axis represents luminosity or magnitude.  The vast majority of stars are found along the [[main sequence]] with blue Class O stars found at the top left of the chart while red Class M stars fall to the bottom right.  Certain stars like [[Deneb]] and [[Betelgeuse]] are found above and to the right of the main sequence, more luminous or cooler than their equivalents on the main sequence.  Increased luminosity at the same temperature, or alternatively cooler temperature at the same luminosity, indicates that these stars are larger than those on the main sequence and they are called giants or supergiants.

Blue and white supergiants are high luminosity stars somewhat cooler than the most luminous main sequence stars.  A star like Deneb, for example, has a luminosity around 200,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, a spectral type of A2, and an effective temperature around 8,500&amp;nbsp;K, meaning it has a radius around 203 R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. For comparison, the red supergiant Betelgeuse has a luminosity around 100,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, a spectral type of M2, and a temperature around 3,500&amp;nbsp;K, meaning its radius is about 1,000 R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. Red supergiants are the largest type of star, but the most luminous are much smaller and hotter, with temperatures up to 50,000&amp;nbsp;K and more and luminosities of several million L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning their radii are just a few tens of R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.  An example is [[R136a1]], over 50,000&amp;nbsp;K and shining at over 8,000,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; (mostly in the UV), it is only 35 R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Radio luminosity ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
The luminosity of a [[Astronomical radio source|radio source]] is measured in {{math|W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, to avoid having to specify a [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] over which it is measured. The observed strength, or [[flux density]], of a radio source is measured in [[Jansky]] where  {{math|1 Jy {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

For example, consider a 10W transmitter at a distance of 1 million metres, radiating over a bandwidth of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. By the time that power has reached the observer, the power is spread over the surface of a sphere with area {{math|4{{pi}}''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} or about {{math|1.26×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so its flux density is {{math|10 / 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; / 1.26×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jy}}.

More generally, for sources at cosmological distances, a [[k-correction]] must be made for the spectral index α of the source, and a relativistic correction must be made for the fact that the frequency scale in the emitted [[rest frame]] is different from that in the observer's [[rest frame]]. So the full expression for radio luminosity, assuming [[isotropic]] emission, is

:&lt;math&gt;L_{\nu} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{obs}} 4 \pi {D_{L}}^{2}}{(1+z)^{1+\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the luminosity in {{math|W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the observed [[flux density]] in {{math|W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[luminosity distance]] in metres, ''z'' is the redshift, ''&amp;alpha;'' is the [[spectral index]] (in the sense &lt;math&gt;I \propto{\nu}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and in radio astronomy, assuming thermal emission the spectral index is typically [[Spectral index|equal to 2.]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singal |first1=J. |last2=Petrosian |first2=V. |last3=Lawrence |first3=A. |last4=Stawarz |first4=Ł. |title=ON THE RADIO AND OPTICAL LUMINOSITY EVOLUTION OF QUASARS |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=20 December 2011 |volume=743 |issue=2 |pages=104 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/743/2/104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider a 1 Jy signal from a radio source at a [[redshift]] of 1, at a frequency of 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz.
[http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html Ned Wright's cosmology calculator] calculates a [[luminosity distance]] for a redshift of 1 to be 6701 Mpc =  2×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; m
giving a radio luminosity of {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; × 4{{pi}}(2×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / (1+1)&lt;sup&gt;(1+2)&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 6×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

To calculate the total radio power, this luminosity must be integrated over the bandwidth of the emission. A common assumption is to set the bandwidth to the observing frequency, which effectively assumes the power radiated has uniform  intensity from zero frequency up to the observing frequency. In the case above, the total power is {{math|4×10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; × 1.4×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 5.7×10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; W}}. This is sometimes expressed in terms of the total (i.e. integrated over all wavelengths) luminosity of the [[Sun]] which is {{math|3.86×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W}}, giving a radio power of {{math|1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Luminosity is an intrinsic measurable property of a star independent of distance. The concept of magnitude, on the other hand, incorporates distance. First conceived by the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] in the second century BC, the original concept of magnitude grouped stars into six discrete categories depending on how bright they appeared. The brightest first magnitude stars were twice as bright as the next brightest stars, which were second magnitude; second was twice as bright as third, third twice as bright as fourth and so on down to the faintest stars, which Hipparchus categorized as sixth magnitude.&lt;ref name="KNOWLE2001"/&gt; The system was but a simple delineation of stellar brightness into six distinct groups and made no allowance for the variations in brightness within a group. With the invention of the [[telescope]] at the beginning of the seventeenth century, researchers soon realized that there were subtle variations among stars and millions fainter than the sixth magnitude—hence the need for a more sophisticated system to describe a continuous range of values beyond what the naked eye could see.&lt;ref name="KNOWLE2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASTRONOTES1"&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Astronomy Notes

 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856 [[Norman Pogson]], noticing that [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements had established first magnitude stars as being about 100 times brighter than sixth magnitude stars, formalized the Hipparchus system by creating a [[logarithmic scale]], with every interval of one magnitude equating to a variation in brightness of 100&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; or roughly 2.512 times. Consequently, a first magnitude star is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude star, 2.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; brighter than a third magnitude star, 2.5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; brighter than a fourth magnitude star, et cetera. Based on this continuous scale, any star with a magnitude between 5.5 and 6.5 is now considered to be sixth magnitude, a star with a magnitude between 4.5 and 5.5 is fifth magnitude and so on. With this new mathematical rigor, a first magnitude star should then have a magnitude in the range 0.5 to 1.5, thus excluding the [[List of brightest stars|nine brightest stars]] with magnitudes lower than 0.5, as well as the four brightest with negative values. It is customary therefore to extend the definition of a first magnitude star to any star with a magnitude less than 0.5, as can be seen in accompanying table.&lt;ref name="KNOWLE2001"&gt;{{cite web

The [[apparent magnitude]] is a measure of the diminishing flux of light as a result of distance according to the [[inverse-square law]].&lt;ref name="HAWAII2003"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this brightness decrease from increased distance, there is an extra decrease of brightness due to extinction from intervening interstellar dust.&lt;ref name="ASTRONOTES1"/&gt;

By measuring the width of certain absorption lines in the [[stellar classification|stellar spectrum]], it is often possible to assign a certain luminosity class to a star without knowing its distance. Thus a fair measure of its absolute magnitude can be determined without knowing its distance nor the interstellar extinction, allowing astronomers to estimate a star's distance and extinction without [[parallax]] calculations. Since the [[stellar parallax]] is usually too small to be measured for many distant stars, this is a common method of determining such distances.

To conceptualize the range of magnitudes in our own [[Milky Way|galaxy]], the smallest star to be identified has about 8% of the Sun’s mass and glows feebly at absolute magnitude +19. Compared to the Sun, which has an absolute of +4.8, this faint star is 14 magnitudes or 400,000 times dimmer than our Sun. Our galaxy's most massive stars begin their lives with masses of roughly 100 times solar, radiating at upwards of absolute magnitude –8, over 160,000 times the solar luminosity. The total range of stellar luminosities, then, occupies a range of 27 magnitudes, or a factor of 60 billion.&lt;ref name="LEDREW1" /&gt;

In measuring star brightnesses, absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance are interrelated parameters—if two are known, the third can be determined. Since the Sun's luminosity is the standard, comparing these parameters with the Sun's apparent magnitude and distance is the easiest way to remember how to convert between them.

== Luminosity formulae ==
[[File:Inverse square law.svg|right|thumb|Point source ''S'' is radiating light equally in all directions. The amount passing through an area ''A'' varies with the distance of the surface from the light.]]
The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law|Stefan–Boltzmann]] equation applied to a [[black body]] gives the value for luminosity for a black body, an idealized object which is perfectly opaque and non-reflecting:&lt;ref name="AUSTRALIA2004"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L= \sigma A T^4&lt;/math&gt; ,

where A is the area, T is the temperature (in Kelvins) and σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], with a value of {{physconst|sigma|after=.}}

Imagine a point source of light of luminosity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that radiates equally in all directions. A hollow [[sphere]] centered on the point would have its entire interior surface illuminated. As the radius increases, the surface area will also increase, and the constant luminosity has more surface area to illuminate, leading to a decrease in observed brightness.

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{L}{A}&lt;/math&gt; ,
where
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the illuminated surface.
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flux density]] of the illuminated surface.

The surface area of a sphere with radius ''r'' is &lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;, so for stars and other point sources of light: 
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2} \,&lt;/math&gt; ,
where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the light source.

It has been shown that the luminosity of a star &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (assuming the star is a [[black body]], which is a good approximation) is also related to temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the star by the equation:&lt;ref name="AUSTRALIA2004"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma T^4 \,&lt;/math&gt; ,
where
:&amp;sigma; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]] 5.67{{e|&amp;minus;8}} [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;.

Dividing by the [[Solar luminosity|luminosity of the Sun]] &lt;math&gt;L_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; and cancelling constants, we obtain the relationship:&lt;ref name="AUSTRALIA2004"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = {\left ( \frac{R}{R_{\odot}} \right )}^2 {\left ( \frac{T}{T_{\odot}} \right )}^4&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;R_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; are the radius and temperature of the Sun, respectively.

For stars on the [[main sequence]], luminosity is also [[mass–luminosity relation|related to mass]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx {\left ( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right )}^{3.5}&lt;/math&gt; .

== Magnitude formulae ==
{{main|Bolometric magnitude}}
The magnitude of a star, a unitless measure, is a logarithmic scale of observed visible brightness.  The apparent magnitude is the observed visible brightness from [[Earth]] which depends on the distance of the object.  The absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s, therefore the bolometric absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of the bolometric luminosity.

The difference in bolometric magnitude between two objects is related to their luminosity ratio according to:

:&lt;math&gt;M_\text{bol1} - M_\text{bol2} = -2.5 \log_{10}\frac{L_\text{1}}{L_\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\text{bol1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the bolometric magnitude of the first object
:&lt;math&gt;M_\text{bol2}&lt;/math&gt; is the bolometric magnitude of the second object.
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the first object's bolometric luminosity
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the second object's bolometric luminosity

This can be used to derive a luminosity in solar units:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\text{*} - M_{\odot} = -2.5 \log_{10}\frac{L_{*}}{L_\odot}&lt;/math&gt;

which makes by inversion:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L_{*}}{L_\odot} = 10^{(M_{\odot} - M_{*})/2.5}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;L_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the star's bolometric luminosity
:&lt;math&gt;L_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the Sun's bolometric luminosity
:&lt;math&gt;M_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the bolometric magnitude of the star.
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; is the bolometric magnitude of the Sun (approximately 4.7554).

Although the absolute bolometric magnitude of the sun is approximately 4.7554, the zero point of the absolute magnitude scale is actually defined as a fixed luminosity of {{val|3.0128|e=28|u=W}}. Therefore, the absolute magnitude can be calculated from a luminosity in watts:

:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{bol} = -2.5 \log_{10} \frac{L_{*}}{L_0} \approx -2.5 \log_{10} L_{*} + 71.1974&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the zero point luminosity {{val|3.0128|e=28|u=W}}

and the luminosity in watts can be calculated from an absolute magnitude (although absolute magnitudes are often not measured relative to an absolute flux):
:&lt;math&gt;L_{*} = L_0 \times 10^{-0.4 M_\mathrm{bol}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Minan-ur-Rehman-Book.jpg|150px|thumb|Book-Title '''Minan-ur-Rehman'' '''(1895)]]
{{Ahmadiyya}}
'''Arabic - the Mother of all Languages - (Book) ''' ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' [Arabic: منن الرّحمٰن ] is a brief treatise on Philology by   [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], (1835-1908) written in May 1895. Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the first language taught to man by God Himself and the Mother of all languages (Arabic: ''Ummul-al-Sinnah''). He highlighted certain peculiarities of the Arabic language, which he claimed could not be found in any other language and challenged his adversaries, to refute his claim also addressing [[Max Muller]] (1823-1900) to come forward and meet the challenge.

==A 20th Century Prophet Ahmad==
::"From my early age, I have been engaged in investigations in religion, I have never reconciled myself with mere platitudes or cursory observations ;  I have never been content with superficial ideas as is the wont of every dull person who is a prisoner of ignorance and untruth. I have never insisted upon baseless ideas, as is the habit of a narrow-minded person who had no desire to understand. Never has anything moved me towards anything except with the eye of penetrating research and except for the attraction of deep-delving insight, nothing has ever lured me into professing a formal creed. And no one has taught me except God Who is the best of all teachers." (page 35)

==Introduction to the book==
:: "So, I named the book منن الرّحمٰن .  [Literally]  ''Favours of the Beneficent God'',   for by many a variety of Grace and Favour, God Almighty bestowed a reward on me, and He is the best of the Givers of favours". (page. 77)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=Urdu#page/126/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman, (Arabic), by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1895)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A short Treatise, namely ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' (1895) English translation by Qazi Abdul Hameed, Lahore (1963)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=English#page/-3/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman (English Translation) 1963 by Qazi Abdul Hameed]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently the book appears to be in response to [[Max Muller]]'s belief that:
::: “I, therefore, date the real beginning of the science of language from the first day of [[Pentecost]].” &lt;ref&gt;Lectures on the Science of Language,  page 53. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32856/32856-0.txt] page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad strongly reacted to this claim and  refuted [[Max Muller]]'s proposition by referring him to the NT Acts II:4-6, explaining that the Disciples only spoke languages already known and understood by all the Jews &lt;ref&gt;"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance ... Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language." -Acts 2:4,6"&lt;/ref&gt;
Ahmad writes, he very earnestly prayed to God, and asked for true knowledge in this regard. So God diverted his attention to a verse of the Quran 30:23.
:: وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفُ أَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَأَلْوَنِكُمْ
::إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأَيَـتٍ لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ
[The Quran, 30:23] And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge.

Ahmad claimed in light of Quranic verses:
::"All praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer, the Beneficent. To Him belongs all Excellence, Grace and Goodness. He created man and taught him a plain language. And out of one language He created various languages in different countries just as He created various colors (of mankind); out of one color. And He made Arabic the mother of all languages. He made it the like of the sun in brightness and luster."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/ Minan-ur-Rahman - Arabic - the mother of all languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed, the true Science of Languages has been taught in the Holy Quran, explaining the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. "He created man then taught him speech and guided him " (page 85).

==Unique Characteristics of Arabic==
In this book ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the very First Language, taught to man by God. Ahmad describes the system of ''Mufradaat'' [the Simples or the Roots of words] in the Arabic Language had a unique scientific organization and a system, unknown in any other language. He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic,

He explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11)

فِ  (fi) 'Be faithful'

قِ  (qi) 'Keep an eye on'

لِ  (li) 'Come nearer'

عِ  ('I) 'Call to mind'

اِ   (I)  'Promise'

خِ  (Khe)  'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace'

ہِ   (hi)  'Burst thyself, or become weak'

دِ   (di)  'Pay blood-money'

رِ   (ri)  'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty'

شِ  (shi)  'Paint thy garments with patterns '

نِ   (ni)   'Be slow or lazy'

Ahmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small '''single words''' give extensive meanings: e.g.

عرضتُ  (''araztu'') means: "I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them."

طہفلتُ  (''Tahfaltu'') means: "I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread ."

جثمَ  (''Jasama'')  means: "Half the night has passed".

حیعلَ  (''Haya-al'')  means: "Come; Pray!  It is proper time."

==The Mother Language==
"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to
other languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon." (page  100).

Ahmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah,  Genesis 11:1:-
::: ויהי כל הארץ שׂפה אחת ודברים אחדים׃
:::"And the whole earth was one lip and speeches identical". (Gen, 11:1) [page. 14]
::...the nearness or remoteness of a place from the equator, of the distinctive effect of the various plants, and because of other unknown factors, every locality inheres in its inhabitants a proclivity of a special kind, towards developing a peculiar voice-apparatus, a distinctive accent, and a form of words which is of a peculiar character....[page: 12]

He after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes:
::...all the languages of the world have come into existence through a process of far  reaching change, yet by fully pondering over it, and by looking at the operative factors, it clearly appears that the speeches and words of these languages have been transplanted into a variety of shapes and forms from Arabic simples. [page. 16]

::"Arabic is singular in its attributes, perfect in its root-words, wonderful  in the charm of its compounds and captivating in the structural beauty of its sentences." (page 105).

==Five Points of Excellence==
Ahmad highlighted ''Five'' points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17]

1. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted.

2. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning.

3. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages.

4. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ا) [alif], and (ل) [laam] and nunnation (تنوین) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose.

5. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas.

A greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, " Thousands of languages
are stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man." [page. 22]

==Arabic follows the Law of Nature==
After the above  ''Introductory details'', the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127]
He explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these ''Two'' requirements,  Arabic has ''Two'' distinct words for ''Mercy'', ''Rahman'' [رحمان]and ''Raheem''. [رحیم].
To explain his point, Ahmad writes:
::It will be noticed that in as much  this quality Mercy, in accordance with the eternal distribution process. consisted of two manifestations of the Divine Law of Nature. there are to be found two root-words in the Arabic language to express that fact. And for a seeker of Truth. it would be profitable to follow the rule that the Attributes and Acts of God which are prominently portrayed in the Book of Nature should be taken as a standard, that their different categories which are apparent from the Law of Nature should be searched for in the root-words of Arabic, and that when ever it is intended to point out the difference between Arabic synonyms, which relate to the attributes or the acts of God, one should turn to the division and distribution of the attributes or acts of God which are apparent from the working of the universe, for, the real object of the Arabic language is the service of Divine Knowledge, as the real aim of the creation of man is the recognition of the Creator. [page. 35]

==Ten Categories of Arabic Roots==
Ahmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the ''Ten Circles of Roots''. He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40)

::1) Root-words  relating to the Person of God, arguments for the existence of God, His attributes, His Names and Acts, His Practice and Custom.

::2)  The system of root-words relating to the Unity of God and the arguments on behalf thereof.

::3) The system of root-words which deals with the attributes, acts, and actions, habits and situations, spiritual and physical, (of man) which, along with their mutual distinctions, are perpetrated by man and which may appear,  in agreement with or in opposition to God's Will.

::4) The system of root-words which constitute, as facts of Divine knowledge; a perfected  teaching from God Almighty and which relate to inculcations or techniques dealing with morals, beliefs, rights of God, rights of men, philosophic learning, punishments, commandments, the Do's and Dont's.

::5) The system of root-words which expound the nature of true salvation, the true means or methods of obtaining it; the signs by which the saved believers and those who occupy a station  of nearness to God may be recognized.

::6) The system of root-words which explain what is Islam, what is disbelief, what is ''shirk'' or polytheistic belief and which deal forth with the arguments for the truth of Islam, and refute the objections against Islam.

::7) The system of root-words which refute all the wrong beliefs of opponents.

::8) The system of root-words which relate to warnings and tidings, promise of favourable or adverse happenings ; which relate to description of the hereafter, to miracles and to parables or which are of the nature of prophecies which contribute to the strengthening of one's faith, or which relate to other expedient subjects, or which deal with narratives which are meant as a warning, a threat, or a tiding.

::9) The system of root-words which relate to the life-story and chaste qualities of the Holy Prophet (May peace and blessings of God be upon him,) which consist of the high example of the pure life of the Holy Prophet ; which also partake of full and forceful arguments in support of the prophet-hood of the Holy Prophet (may peace and the blessings of God be upon him.)

::10) The system of root-words which expound the beauties and the spiritual effectiveness of the Holy Quran and which set out its inherent qualities.

==Language as the Evolution of ''Names''==
How did language come into being? To quote Encyclopædia Britannica: " On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of-fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://gluedideas.com/content-collection/Encyclopedia-Britannica-Volume-13-Part-2-Kurantwad-Statue-of-Liberty/The-Origin-of-Language.html Origin of Language Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology and Bible history, (1992) by Joseph P. Free, page 43 (W. Schmidt on Language, [https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVoe4n0ifIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

::"When man was made to evolve through stages of creation ; when he was transferred from a state of potentiality to one of actuality, when he was given, in his nature and physical evolution, different shapes and figures, and some of the varieties of creation succeeded other varieties, and there happened to be mutual differences and distinctions, the process gave rise to many degrees and stages which required to be described by ''Names'',  Arabic provided them with their "names", and thus completed its gift as is the custom of rich philanthropists." (page 123)

==Further Contributions ==
A renowned Philologist Sheikh [[Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar]] (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words. The works, which trace the Arabic Roots, are the dictionary format, are easily available, can be downloaded freely by pasting the links in the browser's address bar. Most of the work is yet unpublished and in MSS forms.

'''Open Discourse''' is a [[Technical terminology|technical term]] used in [[discourse analysis]] and [[Sociolinguistics]] and is commonly contrasted with ''Closed Discourse''. The concept of open and closed discourse is associated with the overlay of open and closed [[discourse community|discourse communities]] and open and closed communication events. Keys to determining whether a discourse is open or closed include [[Information access|access to information]], [[Equity theory|equity]] of access, [[Open access (publishing)|open access]], quality of discourse and mechanisms and modalities of discourse control: overt, covert, implicit and incidental. As a conceptual filter and cultural construct, [[ideology]] is a function and mechanism of discourse control. [[Channel (communications)|Channel]] and [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] of a communication event and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of communication together control discourse and therefore, determine the degree of [[social inclusion]] and [[social exclusion]] and, by extension, the relative efficiency of that communication event. Open and closed discourse operate along a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] where absolute closure and complete openness are theoretically untenable due to [[Communication noise|noise]] in the channel. The nature of the channel, signal, code, replicability, recording, transmissibility, cataloguing, recall or other variable of a communication event and its information control and context of transmission-as-event, impact its relative position along the continuum between open and closed discourse. In all cases, open discourse is assumed to be sustained discourse.

[[Teun A. van Dijk|Van Dijk]] (c.2003: p.&amp;nbsp;357) holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although most discourse control is contextual or global, even local details of meaning, form, or style may be controlled, e.g. the details of an answer in class or court, or choice of lexical items or jargon in courtrooms, classrooms or newsrooms (Martin Rojo 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, Teun A. (c2003). "Critical Discourse Analysis." Cited in: Schiffrin, Deborah; Tannen, Deborah; Hamilton, Heidi Ehernberger (2003). ''The handbook of discourse analysis''.

==Internet, weblogging and social media==
In regards to the Internet as [[cultural artifact]] and information as [[complex adaptive system]] with [[emergent properties]] of open discourse such as [[Blog|weblogs]] and [[social media]], Boyd (February 2009) holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Web is the most important and valuable human artifact ever created. And, it is not owned by any single group, government, company, or person. It is not patented, no one is in charge, and we have no idea whatsoever as to how much we have invested in it, or even how much it costs us to keep it running.... The Web – and in particular the rise of the so-called blogosphere – has led to a resurgence of open public discourse that is unparalleled since the emergence of independent newspapers and pamphleteers at the outset of the Industrial revolution. The Web has grown from a handful of websites to millions of individuals and organizations publishing on every conceivable topic from every imaginable perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Stowe (February 2009). "Open Social Discourse and Web Culture." ''We Magazine''. Source: [http://www.we-magazine.net/we-volume-02/open-social-discourse-and-web-culture/] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Open discourse as open-endedness: text and context as living document==
Open discourse as [[living document]] may also be understood as the open-endedness in both a communication event and the inability to collapse a communication event into definitives, the unequivocal import of a cultural artifact and the associated inability to resolve ambiguity due to noise and ever-changing context and audience, as Graham (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;5) further states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...I  understand  the  play  on  multiplicity  of  interpretation  and  open‐endedness  that  ambiguity signifies  however,  the  term  ambiguous  is  itself  ambiguous  –  it  not  only  means  “open  to various interpretations” but also “of doubtful and uncertain nature; difficult to understand” and “lacking clearness or definiteness, obscure” (Macquarie Essential Dictionary, 1999: 23).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Linda J.(2005).

Paper presented at Australian Association for Research in Education; 2005 Annual Conference, Sydney: 27th November – 1st December.

==Medicine, scientific publishing and pharmacology==
Dayton (2006) frames the transition from open access to open discourse in the [[Internet]] discourse community in regards to the parameters of scientific publishing thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [I]nternet is expanding the realm of scientific publishing to include free and open public debate of published papers. Journals are beginning to support web posting of comments on their published articles and independent organizations are providing centralized web sites for posting comments about any published article. The trend promises to give one and all access to read and contribute to cutting edge scientific criticism and debate." [http://internetisapropernoun.net/ NB: proper noun of 'Internet' repaired from the error 'internet'.]&lt;ref&gt;Dayton, Andrew (2006). "Beyond open access: open discourse, the next great equalizer." ''Retrovirology''. Source: [http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/55] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Urban planning and public discourse==
Ter Borg and Dijking (1995) explore discourse control in relation to [[urban planning]], [[urban development]], [[public participation]] and [[stakeholder engagement]] in their analysis of two [[case studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth ter Borg &amp; Gertjan Dijkink (1995). "Naturalising Choices and Neutralising Voices? Discourse on Urban Development in Two Cities." ''Urban Studies'', Vol. 32, No. 1, pp.49-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogical discourse==
Dawson &amp; Taylor (1998) have documented experiential learnings of the logistics of open and critical discourse in the discourse community of the science classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Vaille M. &amp; Taylor, Peter C. (1998). "Establishing open and critical discourses in the science classroom: Reflecting on initial difficulties."  ''Research in Science Education''. Netherlands: Springer. ISSN 0157-244X (Print) 1573-1898 (Online). Volume 28, Number 3 / September, 1998. Source: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/up681k2252k73r52/] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In framing the relationship between the discourse community of a classroom and therefore [[pedagogical]] discourse throughout all media and associating open discourse to a democratic ideology Celce-Murcia &amp; Olshtain (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;11) hold that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...it is important that teachers understand what critical discourse analysis is and that they are at the very least sensitized to the potentially discriminatory and demeaning discourse that may arise in the classroom and in teaching materials and be prepared to deal with it constructively (i.e., to use such instances of discourse as opportunities for discussions and activities that can make the language classroom a more democratic and open discourse community)."&lt;ref&gt;Celce-Murcia, Marianne &amp; Olshtain, Elite (2000).

The '''Oregon Forest Resources Institute'''  (OFRI) is an educational organization based in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] dedicated to [[forestry]] issues, including improving public understanding of the state's forest resources and encouraging environmentally sound [[forest management]]. It provides education, training and publications for forest landowners, students and teachers, and the general public. It also produces research on forest science and current issues.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= About OFRI |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFRI's seven-member staff is located in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].&lt;ref name=Contact&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/ContactInformation.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= Contact OFRI |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
OFRI was created by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] in 1991 and is funded by a dedicated [[Forest product|forest-products]] harvest tax.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; It is governed by a 13-member board of directors who represent small, medium and large forest producers, small woodland owners, forest sector employees, academia and the general public. The [[Oregon Department of Forestry|Oregon State Forester]] appoints 11 members. The others are ex officio: the dean of [[Oregon State University]] College of Forestry and a public representative appointed by the president of the [[Oregon State Senate]] and speaker of the [[Oregon House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=Board&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/BoardofDirectors.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= Board of Directors |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of Directors&lt;ref name="Board"/&gt;==
The Board of Directors consists entirely of representatives from the timber industry.

The state forester appoints 11 dedicated individuals to a board of directors that governs the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The state forester is charged by statute with soliciting nominations and appointing the following board members: nine representatives of producer classes, with three each from small (Class 1), medium (Class 2) and large (Class 3) producers; one member representing small woodland owners; and one representative for forest industry employees.

Ex officio members required by statute include the dean of the Oregon State University College of Forestry and a public member appointed jointly by the president of the Oregon Senate and the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives.

Board members appointed by the state forester serve three-year terms. 
Current OFRI board members (as of January 2016) are as follows:

Class 1:  producers are defined by rule as those paying the harvest tax on 20 million board feet per year or less. 
Class 2: producers are those paying tax on more than 20 million per year but less than 100 million board feet. 
Class 3: producers pay tax on 100 million board feet per year or more.
Small woodland owners: are defined as those who own between 100 and 2,000 acres of forestland and who have no direct financial interest in any forest products processing activity.

==Advertising Campaigns==
OFRI has purchased several prominent advertising campaigns in the state of Oregon. These campaigns are paid for with taxpayer dollars. In 2015 OFRI spent $1.05 million in taxpayer funds.&lt;ref name="TAX-DOLLAR TIMBER INDUSTRY ADVERTISING FACES SCRUTINY IN OREGON"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://invw.org/2015/09/09/tax-dollar-timber-industry-advertising-faces-scrutiny-in-oregon |title= TAX-DOLLAR TIMBER INDUSTRY ADVERTISING FACES SCRUTINY IN OREGON |publisher= Investigate West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016-2017 the advertising campaigns have focused on promoting a [[corporate website]] created by OFRI, http://oregonforestlaws.org/

==Landowner education==
OFRI provides workshops, publications and conferences focused on recent science and advances in forest management practices. Its programs are available to both large and small forestland owners.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/assets/media/pdf/0910_annualrpt.pdf.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= 2009-2010 Annual Report |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student and teacher education==
OFRI's K-12 forestry education programs reach more than 100,000 students and more than 1,000 educators annually.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; Its Oregon Forest Literacy Program includes a forest education conceptual framework correlated with state education standards that offer educators guidance for developing classroom lessons related to forests. Student programs include classroom presentations, career events, publications, field tours and activities. Teacher training also includes support for workshops and conferences.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

OFRI manages the Rediscovery Forest, a forested area used for educational purposes and to demonstrate diverse Oregon wildlife habitat and [[forest ecology|forest ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=Disc&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/rediscovery |title= Rediscovery Forest |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rediscovery Forest is located in the [[Oregon Garden]], in [[Silverton, Oregon|Silverton]].

==Public education==
To increase public understanding about Oregon forests and their management, OFRI produces educational spots aired on broadcast and cable television; print, radio and Internet advertising; and online newsletters.&lt;ref name=Facts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/FactsAndResources/Videos.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= FactsAndResources/Videos |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a [[speakers bureau]], and co-sponsors and supports conferences and forest field trips.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

==Publications==
OFRI maintains a library of approximately 70 titles that includes special reports, fact sheets, research reports, pocket reference guides and career information, all available at OFRI's website.&lt;ref name=Facts/&gt;  It publishes an annual report each year in the fall.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

'''Place identity''' or '''place-based identity''' refers to a cluster of ideas about [[Sense of place|place]] and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in the fields of [[geography]], [[urban planning]], [[urban design]], [[landscape architecture]], [[environmental psychology]], [[ecocriticism]] and urban sociology/ecological sociology. Place identity is sometimes called [[urban character]], [[neighbourhood character]] or local character. Place identity has become a significant issue in the last 25 years in urban planning and design. Place identity concerns the meaning and significance of places for their inhabitants and users, and how these meanings contribute to individuals' conceptualizations of self.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2011.

&lt;/ref&gt; Place identity also relates to the context of modernity, history and the politics of representation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45636842|title=City and nation : rethinking place and identity|last=P.|first=Smith, Michael|last2=Thomas.|first2=Bender,|date=2001|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=0765808714|oclc=45636842}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, [[historical determinism]], which intersects historical events, social spaces and groups by [[gender]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this way, it explores how spaces have evolved over time by exploring the [[social constructs]] through time and the development of space, place and power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To the same extent, the politics of representation is brought into context, as the making of place identity in a community also relates to the exclusion or inclusion in a community.  Through this, some have argued that place identity has become an area for social change because it gives [[marginalized]] communities agency{{clarify|date=June 2017}} over their own spaces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the same respect, it is argued that place identity has also been used to intervene social change and perpetuate oppression from a top-down approach by creating segregated spaces for marginalized communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Place attachment and sense of place ==
In some ways it is related to the concepts of [[place attachment]] and [[sense of place]]. Place identity is largely related to the concepts of community formation because it recognizes that geographical spaces do not solely bond a community together but rather there are social bonds that account for community formation. Those social forces often are feelings of belonging and security, which involve theoretical formations of community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key Concepts in Community Studies|last=Blackshaw|first=Tony|publisher=Sage|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4129-2844-1|location=London|pages=97–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical formations of community, which were identified in ''Community: Seeking Safety in an Insecure World'' (Bauman, 2001) as bonds formed by similar locality, culture, language, kinship and/or experiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, identity also conceives feelings of security and freedom as one is able to self-identify and especially, when it comes to being able to foster agency over community formation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, the similar and shared experiences of culture, language and locality foster the sense of community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872630621|title=Neighborhood as refuge : community reconstruction, place remaking, and environmental justice in the city|last=Isabelle,|first=Anguelovski,|isbn=9780262525695|oclc=872630621}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fostering of community is largely seen as an extension of agency because when a community is able to achieve a sense of place and place attachment, this allows for individuals to reinforce their own identities and strengthen their bonds within their community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Methodology ==
Methodologies for understanding place identity primarily involve qualitative techniques, such as interviewing, [[participant observation]], [[discourse analysis]] and mapping a range of physical elements. Some urban planners, urban designers and landscape architects use forms of [[deliberative planning]], [[design charettes]] and [[participatory design]] with local communities as a way of working with place identity to transform existing places as well as create new ones. This kind of planning and design process is sometimes referred to as [[placemaking]].

=== Case studies ===
The following case studies are examples of how place identity is researched on the field.

==== Cape Cod, Massachusetts ====
In a study by Lee Cuba and David M. Hummon (1993), they focus on Cape Cod, Massachusetts residents and how social and environmental factors are associated with place identity. Place identity in regards to "at-homeness" was defined by existence, affiliations, and locus. Community members were asked if they feel at home in Cape Cod to measure the positive responses for existence. The open-ended responses to why community members feel at home were used to measure place affiliation. A close-ended question, "Do you associate feeling at home with living in this particular house or apartment, with living in this community, or with living on the Cape, in general?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuba|first=Lee|last2=Hummon|first2=David M.|date=1993|title=A Place to Call Home: Identification with Dwelling, Community, and Region|jstor=4121561|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume=34|issue=1|pages=111–131|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1993.tb00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used to measure locus. Most respondents reported they did feel "at home".

==== Michigan and the Great Lakes ====
Michigan and the Great Lakes are analyzed to see the values and connections shared within the residents of Michigan. A questionnaire was given to Michigan residents to see how attached the residents are. The questionnaire consisted of statements and the statements were evaluated through the five-point Likert scale. As a result, the data revealed "Michigan's voters have developed a strong sense of place regarding the state".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nanzer|first=Bruce|date=2004|title=Measuring Sense of Place: A Scale for Michigan|jstor=25610679|journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis|volume=26|issue=3|pages=362–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two case studies shows that place has a lot more to offer than just a physical location. Understanding how to measure a sense of place assist policy makers in decision making and creating potential policy implementation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They will take the community's issues into consideration during the planning process once they understand the values of a community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4778">The '''Plummer model''' or '''Plummer sphere''' is a density law that was first used by [[Henry Crozier Keating Plummer|H. C. Plummer]] to fit observations of [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, H. C. (1911), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1911MNRAS..71..460P On the problem of distribution in globular star clusters], ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.]]'' '''71''', 460&lt;/ref&gt; It is now often used as [[toy model]] in [[N-body simulation]]s of stellar systems.

== Description of the model ==
[[Image:Plummer rho.png|thumb|right|220px|The density law of a Plummer model]]

The Plummer 3-dimensional density profile is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_P(r) = \bigg(\frac{3M}{4\pi a^3}\bigg)\bigg(1+\frac{r^2}{a^2}\bigg)^{-\frac{5}{2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the total mass of the cluster, and ''a'' is the '''Plummer radius''', a scale parameter which sets the size of the cluster core. The corresponding potential is

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_P(r) = -\frac{G M}{\sqrt{r^2+a^2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[gravitational constant]]. The velocity dispersion is

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_P^2(r) = \frac{G M}{6\sqrt{r^2+a^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution function is 

:&lt;math&gt; f(\vec{x},\vec{v}) = \frac{24\sqrt{2}}{7\pi^3} \frac{N a^2}{G^5 M^5} (-E(\vec{x},\vec{v}))^{7/2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(\vec{x},\vec{v}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise, where &lt;math&gt;E(\vec{x},\vec{v})=\frac12 v^2 + \Phi_P(r)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific energy]].

== Properties ==

The mass enclosed within radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;M(&lt;r) = 4\pi\int_0^r r^2 \rho_P(r) dr = M{r^3\over\left(r^2+a^2\right)^{3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Many other properties of the Plummer model are described in [[Herwig Dejonghe]]'s comprehensive paper.&lt;ref&gt;Dejonghe, H. (1987), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987MNRAS.224...13D A completely analytical family of anisotropic Plummer models]. ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.]]'' '''224''', 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Core radius &lt;math&gt;r_c&lt;/math&gt;, where the surface density drops to half its central value, is at &lt;math&gt;r_c =a\sqrt{\sqrt{2}-1}\approx0.64a&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Half-mass radius]] is &lt;math&gt;r_h \approx 1.3 a&lt;/math&gt;

[[Virial Theorem#Galaxies and cosmology (virial mass and radius)|Virial radius]] is &lt;math&gt;r_V = \frac{16}{3 \pi} a \approx 1.7 a&lt;/math&gt;

The radial turning points of an orbit characterized by [[specific energy]] &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2} v^2 + \Phi(r)&lt;/math&gt; and [[specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt;L=|\vec{r}\times\vec{v}|&lt;/math&gt; are given by the positive roots of the [[cubic function|cubic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;R^3 + \frac{GM}{E}R^2 - \left(\frac{L^2}{2E} + a^2 \right) R - \frac{GMa^2}{E} = 0  &lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{r^2+a^2}&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{R^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt;. This equation has three real roots for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, two positive and one negative given that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;L_c(E)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_c(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the specific angular momentum for a circular orbit for the same energy. Here &lt;math&gt;L_c&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from single real root of the [[Cubic function #The discriminant|discriminant of the cubic equation]] which is itself another [[cubic function|cubic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{E}\, \underline{L}_c^3 + \left(6 \underline{E}^2 \underline{a}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\underline{L}_c^2 + \left(12 \underline{E}^3 \underline{a}^4 + 20 \underline{E} \underline{a}^2 \right) \underline{L}_c + \left(8 \underline{E}^4 \underline{a}^6 - 16 \underline{E}^2 \underline{a}^4 + 8 \underline{a}^2\right) = 0  &lt;/math&gt;

where underlined parameters are dimensionless in Henon units defined as &lt;math&gt;\underline{E}=Er_V/(GM)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\underline{L}_c = L_c / \sqrt{G\, M\, r_V}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = a / r_V = 3\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
The Plummer model comes closest to representing the observed density profiles of [[star clusters]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}, although the rapid falloff of the density at large radii (&lt;math&gt;\rho\rightarrow r^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;) is not a good description of these systems.

The behavior of the density near the center does not match observations of elliptical galaxies, which typically exhibit a diverging central density.

The ease with which the Plummer sphere can be realized as a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte-Carlo model]] has made it a favorite choice of [[N-body simulation|N-body experimenters]], in spite of the model's lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;Aarseth, S. J., Henon, M. and Wielen, R. (1974), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1974A%26A....37..183A A comparison of numerical methods for the study of star cluster dynamics.] ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]'' '''37''' 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantitative psychology''' is a field of scientific study that focuses on the [[mathematical modeling]], research design and methodology, and [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of human or animal psychological processes. It includes tests and other devices for measuring human abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantitative Psychology|url=http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/index.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative psychologists develop and analyze a wide variety of research methods, including those of [[psychometrics]], a field concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of Instructional Programs – Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=87539|website=The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have long contributed to statistical and mathematical analysis, and quantitative psychology is now a specialty recognized by the [[American Psychological Association]]. Doctoral degrees are awarded in this field in a number of universities in Europe and North America, and quantitative psychologists have been in high demand in industry, government, and academia. Their training in both [[social science]] and quantitative methodology provides a unique skill set for solving both applied and theoretical problems in a variety of areas.

== History ==
[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|175px|thumbnail|right|[[Francis Galton]]'s [[correlation]] diagram, 1875.]]
Quantitative psychology has its roots in early [[experimental psychology]] when, in the nineteenth century, the scientific method was first systematically applied to psychological phenomena. Notable contributions included E. H. Weber's studies of tactile sensitivity (1930s), [[Gustav Fechner|Fechner's]] development and use of the psychophysical methods (1850-1860), and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz's]] research on vision and audition beginning after 1850. [[Wilhelm Wundt]] is often called the "founder of experimental psychology", because he called himself a psychologist and opened a psychological laboratory in 1879 where many researchers came to study.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hearst (ed) The First Century of Experimental Psychology, 1979, pp. 19-20, Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; The work of these and many others helped put to rest the assertion, by theorists such as [[Immanuel Kant]], that psychology could not become a science because precise experiments on the human mind were impossible.

=== Intelligence testing ===
{{main|intelligence testing}}
[[Intelligence testing]] has long been an important branch of quantitative psychology. The nineteenth-century English statistician [[Francis Galton]], a pioneer in psychometrics, was the first to create a standardized test of intelligence, and he was among the first to apply   statistical methods to the study of human differences and their inheritance. He came to believe that intelligence is largely determined by heredity, and he also hypothesized that other measures such as the speed of [[reflex]]es, [[muscle]] strength, and head size are correlated with intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Bulmer, M. (1999). The development of Francis Galton's ideas on the mechanism of heredity. ''Journal of the History of Biology, 32''(3), 263-292. Cowan, R. S. (1972). Francis Galton's contribution to genetics. ''Journal of the History of Biology, 5''(2), 389-412. See also Burbridge, D. (2001). Francis Galton on twins, heredity and social class. ''British Journal for the History of Science, 34''(3), 323-340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fancher, R. E. (1983). Biographical origins of Francis Galton's psychology. ''Isis, 74''(2), 227-233.&lt;/ref&gt; He established the world's first mental testing center in 1882 in the following year he published his observations and theories in "Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development".

=== Statistical techniques ===
[[File:IQ curve.svg|250px|thumbnail|left|[[IQ]] scores represented by a [[normal distribution]].]]
Statistical methods are the quantitative tools most used by psychologists. Pearson introduced the correlation coefficient and the chi-squared test. The 1900–1920 period saw the t-test (Student, 1908), the ANOVA (Fisher, 1925) and a non-parametric correlation coefficient (Spearman, 1904). A large number of tests were developed in the latter half of the 20th century (e.g., all the multivariate tests). Popular techniques (such as Hierarchical Linear Model, Arnold, 1992, Structural Equation Modeling, Byrne, 1996 and Independent Component Analysis, Hyvarinën, Karhunen and Oja, 2001) are relatively recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cousineau|first1=Denis|title=The rise of quantitative methods in psychology|journal=Tutorial in Quantitative Methods for Psychology|date=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–3|url=http://doe.concordia.ca/cslp/Downloads/PDF/The%20rise%20of%20..art.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024719/http://doe.concordia.ca/cslp/Downloads/PDF/The%20rise%20of%20..art.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] organized [[levels of measurement]] into four scales: Nominal, Ordinal, Ratio, and Interval  in a paper that is still often cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=June 7, 1946 |last=Stevens |first=Stanley Smith |title=On the Theory of Scales of Measurement |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=103 |issue=2684 |pages=677–680 |doi=10.1126/science.103.2684.677 |pmid=17750512 |url=http://www.mpopa.ro/statistica_licenta/Stevens_Measurement.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906231510/http://www.mpopa.ro/statistica_licenta/Stevens_Measurement.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |bibcode=1946Sci...103..677S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jacob Cohen (statistician)|Jacob Cohen]], a [[New York University]] professor of psychology, analyzed quantitative methods involving statistical power and effect size, which helped to lay foundations for current statistical [[meta-analysis]] and the methods of estimation statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/04/04708608/0470860804-2.pdf Cohen's entry in Encyclopedia of Statistics in Behavioral Science]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his name to [[Cohen's kappa]] and [[Cohen's d]].

In 1990, an influential paper titled "Graduate Training in Statistics, Methodology, and Measurement in Psychology" was published in the [[American Psychologist]] journal. This article discussed the need for increased and up-to-date training in quantitative methods for psychology graduate programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aiken|first1=Leona S.|last2=West|first2=Stephen G.|title=Graduate Training in Statistics, Methodology, and Measurement in Psychology: A Survey of PhD Programs in North America|journal=American Psychologist|date=June 1990|volume=45|issue=6|pages=721–734|url=http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF%27s/Aiken%20et%20al%20%281990%29_AmPsy.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2015|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.45.6.721|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119163608/http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF%27s/Aiken%20et%20al%20%281990%29_AmPsy.pdf|archive-date=2015-01-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and training ==
{{Main|List of schools for quantitative psychology}}

=== Undergraduate ===
Training for quantitative psychology can begin informally at the undergraduate level. Many graduate schools recommend that students have some coursework in psychology and complete the full college sequence of [[calculus]] (including [[multivariate calculus]]) and a course in [[linear algebra]]. Quantitative coursework in other fields such as [[economics]] and research methods and statistics courses for psychology majors are also helpful. Historically, however, students without all these courses have been accepted if other aspects of their application show promise. Some schools also offer formal minors in areas related to quantitative psychology. For example, the [[University of Kansas]] offers a minor in "Social and Behavioral Sciences Methodology" that provides advanced training in research methodology, applied data analysis, and practical research experience relevant to quantitative psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Minor in Social and Behavioral Sciences Methodology|url=http://www2.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/social-behavioral-sciences|website=University of Kansas|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coursework in computer science is also useful. Mastery of an [[object-oriented programming language]] or learning to write code in [[SPSS]] or [[R (programming language)|R]] is useful for the type of data analysis performed in graduate school.

=== Graduate ===
[[File:Peabodyvu.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|[[Peabody College]] (''pictured'') at [[Vanderbilt University]] houses their Quantitative Methods program.]]
Quantitative psychologists may possess a doctoral degree or a master's degree. Due to its interdisciplinary nature and depending on the research focus of the university, these programs may be housed in a school's [[college of education]] or in their psychology department. Programs that focus especially in [[educational research]] and psychometrics are often part of education or [[educational psychology]] departments. These programs may therefore have different names mentioning "research methods" or "quantitative methods", such as the "Research and Evaluation Methodology" Ph.D from the [[University of Florida]] or the "Quantitative Methods" degree at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. However, some universities may have separate programs in their two colleges. For example, the [[University of Washington]] has a "Quantitative psychology" degree in their psychology department and a separate "Measurement &amp; Statistics" Ph.D in their college of education. Others, such as [[Vanderbilt University]]'s Ph.D in Psychological Sciences is jointly housed across its two psychology departments.

Universities with a mathematical focus include [[McGill University]]'s "Quantitative Psychology and Modeling" program and [[Purdue University]]'s "Mathematical and Computational Cognitive Science" degrees. Students with an interest in modeling biological or functional data may go into related fields such as [[biostatistics]] or [[computational neuroscience]].

Doctoral programs typical accept students with only bachelor's degrees, although some schools may require a master's degree before applying. After the first two years of studies, graduate students typically earn a [[Master of Arts]] in Psychology, [[Master of Science]] in Statistics or [[Applied statistics]], or both.

Additionally, several universities offer minor concentrations in quantitative methods, such as New York University.

Companies that produce [[standardized tests]] such as [[College Board]], [[Educational Testing Service]], and [[American College Testing]] are some of the biggest private sector employers of quantitative psychologists. These companies also often provide internships to students in graduate school.

==== Shortage of qualified applicants ====
In August 2005, the American Psychological Association expressed the need for more quantitative psychologists in the industry—for every PhD awarded in the subject, there were about 2.5 quantitative psychologist position openings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/quant-task-force-report.pdf Report of the Task Force for Increasing the Number of Quantitative Psychologists], page 1. ''American Psychological Association''. Retrieved February 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of applicants in the field, the APA created a Task Force to study the state of quantitative psychology and predict its future. Domestic U.S. applicants are especially lacking. The majority of international applicants come from [[Asia]]n countries, especially [[South Korea]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Task Force for Increasing the Number of Quantitative Psychologists|url=http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/quant-task-force-report.pdf|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the lack of qualified applicants, the APA Council of Representatives authorized a special task force in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantitative Psychology|url=http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task force was chaired by Leona S. Aiken from [[Arizona State University]].

== Research areas ==

Other research areas include modeling psychological processes through [[time series]] analysis, such as in [[fMRI]] data collection, and [[structural equation modeling]], [[social network analysis]], [[decision theory|human decision science]], and [[statistical genetics]].

Two common types of psychometric tests are: aptitude tests, which are supposed to measure raw intellectual ability, and personality tests that aim to assess your character, temperament, and how you deal with problems.

Item response theory is based on the application of related [[mathematical model]]s to testing data. Because it is generally regarded as superior to [[classical test theory]], it is the preferred method for developing scales in the United States, especially when optimal decisions are demanded, as in so-called [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]], e.g., the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) and [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT).

== Professional organizations ==
Quantitative psychology is served by several scientific organizations.  These include the Psychometric Society, Division 5 of the [[American Psychological Association]] (Evaluation, Measurement and Statistics), the [[Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology]], and the European Society for Methodology.  Associated disciplines include statistics, [[mathematics]], educational measurement, educational statistics, sociology, and political science.  Several scholarly journals reflect the efforts of scientists in these areas, notably ''[[Psychometrika]]'', ''Multivariate Behavioral Research'', ''Structural Equation Modeling'' and ''Psychological Methods''.

'''Synthetic morphology''' is a sub-discipline of the broader field of [[synthetic biology]].

In standard [[synthetic biology]], artificial [[gene networks]] are introduced into [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, inputs (e.g. chemicals, light) are applied to those networks, and the networks perform logical operations on them and output the result of the operation as the activity of an [[enzyme]] or as the amount of [[green fluorescent protein]]. Using this approach, synthetic biologists have demonstrated the ability of their gene networks to perform [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[computation]], to hold a memory, and to generate pulses and [[oscillation]]. 

Synthetic morphology extends this idea by adding output modules that alter the shape or social behaviour of cells in response to the state of the artificial gene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a [[gene network]] may switch on an [[adhesion molecule]] so that cells stick to each other, or activate a [[motility]] system so that cells move. It has been argued that the formation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of about ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion, differential adhesion, cell de-adhesion, cell fusion, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging).&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Davies JA (2008) Synthetic morphology: prospects for engineered, self-constructing anatomies. J Anat. 2008 Jun;212(6):707-19. {{PMID|18510501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly similar lists exist for tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of output modules might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-designed arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'. 

The term synthetic morphology was introduced to the [[peer review]]ed scientific literature in 2008 &lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt; and is now becoming more widely used both in peer-reviewed literature &lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;Tanaka H, Yi TM (2009) Synthetic morphology using alternative inputs. PLoS One. 2009 Sep 10;4(9):e6946. {{PMID|19746161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texts.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Meyer, Meyer, Handschel, Wiesmann (2009) Fundamentals of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.

"'''The Art of Donald McGill'''" is a critical essay first published in 1941 by the English author [[George Orwell]]. It discusses the genre of English saucy [[Seaside postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]]s that were sold mostly in small shops in British coastal towns, and particularly the work of its prime exponent, [[Donald McGill]]. Orwell notes the role of this type of humour as a rebellion against convention in society and states that, despite the vulgarity, he would be sorry to see the postcards vanish.

==Background==
Seaside postcards represent the low humour and wordplay that was characteristic of the Victorian [[music hall]]. They were sold by newsagents and at booths along the front at British seaside holiday resorts.

McGill created an estimated 12,000 of the colour washed drawings which were then reproduced as postcards and an estimated 200 million were printed and sold.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/postcard_censorship_20040714.shtml BBC Radio 4 Postcard Censorship]&lt;/ref&gt; His career began in 1904 when he was encouraged by a relation who saw an illustrated get-well card McGill had made for a sick nephew. Within a year it was his full-time occupation.&lt;ref name=Ind&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/sun-sea-and-censorship-551680.html The Independent Rhoda Koenig ''Sun, Sea and Censorship'' 1 July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; McGill studied art and married the daughter of the owner of [[Greenwich Theatre|Crowder's Music Hall]] in [[Greenwich]]. Such postcards were associated with embarrassment and McGill noted that his two daughters "ran like stags whenever they passed a comic postcard shop".

Orwell's interest in such postcards began in his schooldays in [[Eastbourne]]. [[Jacintha Buddicom]] recalls him around the age of twelve at Shiplake and Henley when he kept a collection in an album. She recalls that some were kept in a manilla envelope because they were "too vulgar" to be put on display.&lt;ref&gt;Jacintha Buddicom ''Eric &amp; Us'' 1974 Leslie Frewin&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Such, Such Were the Joys]]" Orwell reports his alarm at being stared at with suspicion by a man as he came out a [[newsagent's shop]] in Eastbourne, although he says in the essay that he was buying sweets.

==Publication==
"The Art of Donald McGill" was first published in ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' in September 1941. The article has appeared in many anthologies including ''[[Critical Essays (Orwell)|Critical Essays]]'' (1946), ''Collected Essays'' (1961), ''[[Decline of the English Murder]] and Other Essays'' (1965) and ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' (1968), republished by the Donald McGill Museum &amp; Archive Ryde (2010) with for the first time examples of the cards discussed accompanying the text.

==Summary==
Orwell identifies the overpowering vulgarity, the crude drawing and unbearable colours of the seaside postcard which specialises in very 'low' humour. He selects McGill because he sees his work as the most representative and perfect in the tradition, although he is ignorant of whether McGill is a real individual or just a corporate name.

Orwell picks out the main subjects of the postcards as sex, home life, drunkenness, [[Toilet humour|WC jokes]], snobbery within the working-class, stereotypical figures and topical politico-social fads. They feature illegitimacy, the mother-in-law, the hen-pecked husband, the middle-aged drunk, chamber pots, the nervous clergyman who says the wrong thing, [[malapropism]]s and "an endless succession of fat women in tight bathing-dresses." He concludes that this reflects, on a comic level, the working-class outlook that youth and adventure, and even individual life, end with marriage.

Orwell considers that in England under censorship laws there is a wide gap between what can be said and what can be printed. He sees comic post cards as the only medium in which really "low" humour is printable although similar jokes are part and parcel of the revue and music-hall, and can be heard on the radio.

Orwell presents a thesis of duality in human nature which he calls the [[Don Quixote]]–[[Sancho Panza]] combination—the conflict between high-minded respectability and vulgar buffoonery. "Society has always to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice—that they should work hard, pay their taxes, and be faithful to their wives, men should think it glorious to die on the battlefield and women should want wear themselves out with child-bearing. The postcards represent the worm's-eye view of life where "marriage is a dirty joke or a comic disaster... where the lawyer is always a crook and the Scotsman always a miser, where the newly-weds make fools of themselves on the hideous beds of seaside lodging-houses and the drunken, red-nosed husbands roll home at four in the morning to meet the linen-nightgowned wives who wait for them behind the front door, poker in hand". Orwell brings in a quotation from [[Ecclesiastes]] (vii 15).

Such postcards are therefore symptomatically important as a sort of [[saturnalia]], a harmless rebellion against virtue. Orwell notes that the mood of the comic post card could appear between the murders in Shakespeare's tragedies&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Macbeth'', Act 2, scene 1&lt;/ref&gt; but that this type of humour in literature had been repressed from the beginning of the 19th century and has dwindled to these "ill-drawn post cards, leading a barely legal existence in cheap stationers' windows".

==Postscript==
In 1954, under a government crackdown on declining morals, McGill was prosecuted and fined under the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;"The World of Donald McGill" Buckland,E: London, Blandford, 1990 {{ISBN|0-7137-1400-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This almost wiped out the industry. In 1957 he gave evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee which was revising the legislation.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In the light of an exhibition of the work of McGill in 2004, various critics have challenged Orwell's dismissive view of the quality of the art.&lt;ref name=Ind/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000824.php The Social Affairs Unit – Christie Davies "Donald McGill was a far better artist than Orwell acknowledges"]&lt;/ref&gt;

DIKU was created in 1970 as a spin-out from the [[University of Copenhagen Institute for Mathematical Sciences|Institute for Mathematical Sciences]]. The first professor at DIKU was [[Peter Naur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diku.dk/ominstituttet/jubilee/historie_side/1970erne/ | title=Fra DIKUs historiebog - 1970erne | publisher=DIKU | date=2010-06-02 | accessdate=7 January 2016 | author=Søndergaard, Ann Steendahl | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research groups ==
Research at the department is handled by a number of research groups, labs and centres.
As of September 2010, the main groups are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diku.dk|accessdate=2010-09-06 |publisher=[[Copenhagen University]]|title=Department of Computer Science, DIKU}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Image Group - image processing, physics based animation, robotics and artificial intelligence.
* Algorithmic and Programming Languages - optimization algorithms inspired by practical problems in bioinformatics, electronic chip design and logistics; and research on programming languages with a focus on automatic program optimization, analysis and transformation.
* Human‐centered computing - designs and implements systems, where human needs are in focus.
* Additional centres and laboratories - eScience Center, CITI - Center for IT Innovation, Performance Engineering Laboratory, Experience Lab.

== Location ==

[[Image:Datalogisk Institut - main entrance.jpg|thumb|The entrance]]
DIKU is based at [[University Park (University of Copenhagen)|University Park]] in Copenhagen, part of the university's [[North Campus (University of Copenhagen)|North Campus]]. Its building complex comprises the former Department of Anatomy. The building was completed in 1942 to design by [[Kaj Gottlob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bygningskulturenshus.dk/blog_entries/anatomisk-institut/html|title=Anatomisk Institutlanguage=Danish|publisher=Bygningskulturens Hus|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human-Centered Computing Group is located at both the university's [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|South Campus]] on [[Amager]] as well as at the e-Science center in the [[Hans Christian Ørsted Institute]], also at University Park.

== Student life ==
An important social event is the DIKU [[revue]] which is held each year in June. The DIKU revue is always in competition with the [[physics]] revue and never misses an opportunity to computer-animate the complete and utter destruction of the physics institute at the [[H. C. Ørsted Institute]].

As something unique among the institutes of Copenhagen University, the DIKU cantine is entirely student driven and open 24 hours. It is the natural hub for all social events on DIKU.

The two largest social events are the DIKU revue and the ''Julefrokost'' (Christmas lunch) of the cantine.

== Miscellaneous ==

The [[domain name|domain]] &lt;code&gt;diku.dk&lt;/code&gt; was registered on October 29, 1987, and was one of the first [[.dk]] domain names to be registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.netsite.dk/blog/2015/03/verdens-foerste-domaenenavn-fylder-30-i-dag/ | title=Verdens første domænenavn fylder 30 i dag | publisher=Netsite | date=15 March 2015 | accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Guadalajara''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Guadalajara}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[higher education]] institution in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Guadalajara]]. The University has several high schools as well as graduate and undergraduate campuses, which are distributed all over the state of [[Jalisco]], Mexico. It is regarded as the most significant university in the state and the second in the country, only behind the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. Chronologically, based on its foundation, is the second oldest in Mexico, the seventeenth in North America and the fourteenth in Latin America.

Since 1994 the University works through a network model to organize its academic activities. This university network is integrated by 15 university centers, the '''Virtual University System''', the '''High School Education System''' and the general administrative body of the University. During 2014–2015 the total number of enrolled students is 255, 944, of which 116, 424 belong to graduate and undergraduate students and 139, 520 to high school students.

== History ==

=== The Royal University of Guadalajara (1791–1821) ===
[[File:Escudo de la Real y Literaria Universidad de Guadalajara.svg|thumb|left|Royal University of Guadalajara's Coat of Arms]]
At the time of its foundation in 1586 College began offering higher education in [[Guadalajara]], and as a result it was the first institution that granted academic degrees. The first one who requested to establish a university in Guadalajara was Friar Felipe Galindo y Chavez who, in 1696, asked the King [[Charles II of Spain]] to increase the range of the recently founded Royal Seminary of San Jose. This way, a long century of arrangements to found the '''University of Guadalajara''' began. Chronologically, the second oldest in Mexico, the seventeenth in North America and the fourteenth in Latin America.

The proposition of Friar Felipe was reconsidered by the lawyer Matias Angel de la Mota Padilla, who, in 1750, was able to involve the [[Guadalajara]]'s city hall into the project. However, it was only after the banishment of all Company of Jesus' members from all Spain's territories in 1767, when the need of a university in the region of [[Nueva Galicia]] was relevant. This occurred because the Company of Jesus managed the two most important colleges in the city: the Santo Tomas College and the San Juan Bautista College. Moreover, on December 12, 1771 arrived to Guadalajara the new bishop to [[Nueva Galicia]], Friar Antonio Alcalde y Barriga, who significantly supported the foundation of the University. In 1775 the Friar replied a grit from King [[Charles III of Spain]], who consulted him about the convenience of establishing a university in [[Nueva Galicia]]. The answer of the Friar was completely positive, so on November 18, 1791 the King [[Charles IV of Spain]] enacted a royal grit where he proclaim the foundation of the '''Royal University of Guadalajara'''.

This grit arrived to the authorities in [[Nueva Galicia]] on March 26, 1792, who proceeded to celebrate and quickly revamp the said Santo Tomas College. Therefore, the University was founded on November 3, 1792. By mutual agreement between the Friar Alcalde and the president of the Royal Audience, Jacobo Ugarte de Loyola, Jose Maria Gomez y Villaseñor was named as the first Rector of the University. Academically speaking, the University was first composed by the Art, Theology, Law and Medicine Faculties.

=== The Confrontation between the University of Guadalajara and the Institute of Sciences of the Jalisco State (1821–1861) ===
The University adhered itself to the [[Agustin de Iturbide]]'s [[Plan of Iguala]], with which the [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence of Mexico]] was concluded, as a result the university kept its royal status. However, it came to be imperial when the [[first Mexican Empire]] of Agustin I was proclaimed, but then when the Republic was established it became a national university.

On January 16, 1826, during the administration of Jose Cesareo de la Rosa as the Rector, the [[Jalisco]] State Congress proclaimed the first enclosed order to the '''University of Guadalajara''' and then the State's Governor, Prisciliano Sanchez Padilla, reestablish the Institute of Sciences. However, on September 1, 1834 the State's Governor, José Antonio Romero, declared the first reopening of the University and the closing of the Institute of Sciences. Nevertheless, thirteen years later, in 1847, the State Congress proclaimed the Public Teaching Program by which the '''University of Guadalajara''' as well as the San Juan Bautista College would be closed, furthermore it'd also reestablish the Institute of Sciences and found two high schools, namely the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum. Yet the Program was not executed since Mariano Hurtado convinced the State's Governor, Joaquin Angulo, not to do so. As a result, in that same year it was proclaimed that the Institute of Sciences and the '''University of Guadalajara''' would coexist, although the later would lose its finances and headquarters. Fortunately, a later State's Governor, Jose Maria Yañez Carillo, proclaimed 1853 the assimilation of the Institute of Sciences into the '''University of Guadalajara''', so the later recovered its traditional patrimony.

At the time the [[Plan of Ayutla]] got the triumph around 1855, the State's Governor, Jose Santos Degollado proclaimed the second enclosed order to the University and the reestablishment of the Institute of Sciences. However, during the [[Reform War]], on February 2, 1859 the Governor and Commander of the [[Jalisco]] State, Leonardo Marquez, reestablish the '''University of Guadalajara'''.

Despite that, following the military success of the liberal wing in 1860, the State's Governor, Pedro Ogazon, proclaimed the third enclosed order to the University which also proclaimed the reestablishment of the Institute of Sciences, the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum.

=== The University Interregnum (1861–1925) ===
During this period the higher and high school education both came to be totally dominated by the Government of Jalisco which triggered the emergence of private schools. Besides, the Medicine, Law and Engineering Schools, as well as the Boys' Lyceum and the Ladies' Lyceum continued teaching higher and high school education as a result of the governmental support that they received, except from some governors as Ramon Corona and Manuel Macario Dieguez, since the later closed the Lyceums and founded the '''High School of Jalisco''' in 1914.

=== The University of Guadalajara (1925–1989) ===
[[File:Explanada dv.jpg|thumb|University of Guadalajara's General Rectory Building]]
Derived from the worries that many intellectuals and artists manifested in the reunions at the "Centro Bohemio", the conference given by the engineer Juan Salvador Agraz Ramirez de Prado about a project to establish the '''"National University of Guadalajara"''' and the new orientations that the [[Mexican Revolution]] brought about in 1910, the [[Jalisco]] State's Governor, Jose Guadalupe Zuno Hernandez, reopened the '''University of Guadalajara''' by third time in 1925 and named Enrique Diaz de Leon as its Rector. Therefore, the study plans for high schools and faculties, as well as the Organic Law were elaborated and then approved by the State Congress on September 7, 1925. In the first meeting of the University Council the motto of the University was chosen: '''“Piensa y Trabaja" (Think and Work)'''.

In the First Congress of Universities that took place at [[Mexico City]], the Rector Diaz de Leon supported the socialist education, but when he tried to carry it out in [[Guadalajara]], several student's protests happened. As a result of the protests the Governor, Sebastian Allende decided to close the '''University of Guadalajara''' again. However, to prevent the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara|Autonomous University of Guadalajara]] to take the historic name of '''University of Guadalajara''', the State Congress reopened the University and named Constancio Hernandez Alvirde as its twenty ninth Rector.

=== The Jalisco University Network (1989–present) === 
During this period the need to create a modern, efficient, qualified and ecofriendly university was recognized, however, this meant a change in the academic and administrative structure of the university would be necessary. This purposes were established in the Institutional Development Programme: A Future Vision, presented in 1989 by the Rector Raul Padilla Lopez, who is regarded for accomplishing the modernization the University. In this document, the aims and programs of all, teaching, researching and extension areas were established, which were based on a series of projected indicators to 1995.

Additionally, on September 2, 1989 the General University Council approved the document “Bases for the discussion about the Reform of the University of Guadalajara”, which had a current diagnostic about the University and proposed to decentralize the services and functions of the institution all across its entities. Also, some elements as the updating and creation of study plans, the expansion of research and graduate studies, the promotion of cultural and sports activities as well as the diversification of its financial funds were presented in the document. This reform took place when the State Congress approved the new Organic Law of the '''University of Guadalajara'''. In this, the autonomy of the University in matters as the academic planning and the financial administration was acknowledged. In that same year the thematic and regional university campuses were created and the '''High School Education System''' was established.

Moreover, the Labor Union of the Academic Workers of the University of Guadalajara was created and the Labor Union of University Workers got enhanced, the Union of University Students was established as well. Among other changes derived from the creation of the '''University Network''', it is important to mention the creation of the '''Virtual University System''' and the '''University System of Radio, Television and Cinematography'''.

In 2014, with Itzcoatl Tonatiuh Bravo Padilla as the Rector of the University, the Institutional Development Programme was updated with projections to 2030. Besides, the arrangements to build a new regional university campus located in [[Zapotlanejo]], [[Jalisco]] began.  At present the '''University Network''' is located in each region of [[Jalisco]] and has campuses in 109 of 125 municipalities in the State.

'''Verbosity''' or '''verboseness''' is speech or writing that uses more words than necessary (for example, using "Despite the fact that" instead of "Although").&lt;ref name="communitycollege" /&gt; The opposite of verbosity is [[plain language]].
Some teachers, including the author of ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', warn writers not to be verbose. Similarly, some authors, including [[Mark Twain]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], are known for their avoidance of verbosity. 

Synonyms for verbosity include '''wordiness''', '''verbiage''', '''prolixity''', '''grandiloquence''', '''garrulousness''', '''expatiation''', '''logorrhea''', and '''sesquipedalianism'''. 

Examples of verbosity are common in political speech, academic prose, and other genres.

==Etymology and synonyms==
The word ''verbosity'' comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''verbosus'', "wordy". There are many other English words that also refer to the use of excessive words.

''Prolixity'' comes from Latin ''prolixus'', "extended". ''Prolixity'' can also be used to refer to the length of a [[monologue]] or speech, especially a formal address such as a lawyer's [[oral argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Percy Anecdotes |last=Percy |first=Sholto |authorlink= Joseph Clinton Robertson |author2=Reuben Percy  |year=1826 |publisher=T. Boys |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzJEAAAAIAAJ |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grandiloquence'' is complex speech or writing judged to be pompous or bombastic [[diction]]. It is a combination of the Latin words ''grandis'' ("great") and ''loqui'' ("to speak").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grandiloquence |title=Dictionary.com - Grandiloquence |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Logorrhea'' or ''logorrhoea'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] λογόρροια, ''logorrhoia'', "[[word]]-[[flux]]") is an excessive flow of words. It is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe prose that is hard to understand because it is needlessly complicated or uses excessive jargon. The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

''Sesquipedalianism'' is a linguistic style that involves the use of long words. Roman poet [[Horace]] coined the phrase ''sesquipedalia verba'' in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0064%3Acard%3D73 |title=Ars Poetica, l.97 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''sesqui'', "one and a half", and ''pes'', "[[Foot (prosody)|foot]]", a reference to [[Meter (poetry)|meter]]. The earliest recorded usage in English of ''sesquipedalian'' is in 1656, and of ''sesquipedalianism'', 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Simpson |first =J. A. |last2=Weiner |first2=E. S. C. |title=The Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) |year=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Garrulous'' comes from Latin ''garrulus'', "talkative", a form of the verb ''garrīre'', "to chatter". The adjective may describe a person who is excessively talkative, especially about trivial matters, or a speech that is excessively wordy or diffuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/garrulous |title=Dictionary.com - Garrulous |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''expatiation'' and the verb ''expatiate'' come from Latin ''expatiātus'', past participle from ''spatiārī'', "to wander". They refer to enlarging a discourse, text, or description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/expatiation |title=Dictionary.com - expatiation |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific jargon==
The word ''logorrhea'' is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe highly [[figurative language|abstract]] prose that contains little [[Literal and figurative language|concrete language]]. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems confusing or excessive. Works in academic fields that involve many abstract ideas, such as [[philosophy]], often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas.
 
In an attempt to prove that "logorrhea" accompanies a lack of academic rigor, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (''[[Social Text]]'') as a [[practical joke]]. The journal defended the article as genuine even after Sokal denounced his own article publicly. The episode has come to be known as the [[Sokal Affair]].&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ The Sokal Affair]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes also applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general; this is more usually referred to as ''prolixity''. Some people defend the use of additional words as [[idiom]]atic, a matter of artistic preference, or helpful in explaining complex ideas or messages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' published a 229-page parody of postmodern writing titled "Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional 'Meaning' for the Uninitiated". The article consists of complicated and context-sensitive self-referencing narratives. The text is peppered with number of parenthetical citations and asides, which is supposed to mock the cluttered style of postmodern writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arrow|first=Dennis W.|title=Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional "Meaning" for the Uninitiated|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=December 1997|volume=96|issue=3|pages=461–690|jstor=1290146|doi=10.2307/1290146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The King's English]]'', Fowler gives a passage from ''[[The Times]]'' as an example of verbosity: "''The Emperor'' received yesterday and to-day General Baron von Beck.... It may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in ''His Majesty's'' mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when ''the Monarch'' goes again to Budapest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Henry Watson|last2=Fowler|first2=Francis George|title=The King's English|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler objected to this passage because ''The Emperor'', ''His Majesty'', and ''the Monarch'' all refer to the same person: "the effect", he pointed out in ''Modern English Usage'', "is to set readers wondering what the significance of the change is, only to conclude that there is none."

In ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' (1926) [[Henry Watson Fowler]] says, "It is the second-rate writers, those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying their meaning clearly, &amp; still more those whose notions of style are based on a few misleading rules of thumb, that are chiefly open to the allurements of [[elegant variation]]," Fowler's term for the over-use of [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Henry Watson|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|year=1994|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|isbn=978-1-85326-318-7|origyear=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Fowler's criticism of several words being used to name the same thing in English [[prose]], in some other languages, including [[French language|French]], it might be thought to be a good writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Translation And Creativity: Perspectives on Creative Writing And Translation Studies |chapter=Painting with words |editor=Eugenia Loffredo, Manuela Perteghella |first=Ann |last=Paterson |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8793-9 |page=88 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]]|quote=. . . the rule of ''elegant variation'' (that is, using synonyms wherever possible), which purists consider to be essential for good style in French.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Translator's Handbook: (with special reference to conference translation from French and Spanish) |first=Frederick |last=Fuller |year=1984 |isbn=0-271-00368-5 |page=35 |publisher=[[Penn State University Press]] |quote=''Elegant variation'' French tends to avoid repetition of proper names, with a description of the person, at second reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study from the [[psychology]] department of [[Princeton University]] found that using long and obscure words does not make people seem more intelligent. Dr. Daniel M. Oppenheimer did research which showed that students rated short, concise texts as being written by the most intelligent authors. But those who used long words or complex [[font]] types were seen as less intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oppenheimer|first=Daniel M.|url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/psy3001/files/simple%20writing.pdf|format=PDF|year=2005|title=Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with using long words needlessly|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=20|pages=139–15|doi=10.1002/acp.1178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's audiences were not necessarily inclined to read Polonius as someone who is perfectly wise; his sentences, like that of much early modern drama, can easily be seen as part of a comic trope.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[George Orwell]] mocked logorrhea in "[[Politics and the English Language]]" (1946) by taking verse (9:11) from the book of [[Ecclesiastes]] in the [[Bible]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22312">'''Vigilance''', in the field of [[behavioral ecology|behavioural ecology]], refers to an animal's examination of its surroundings in order to heighten awareness of [[predation|predator]] presence. Vigilance is an important behaviour during [[foraging]] as animals must often venture away from the safety of shelter to find food. However being vigilant comes at the expense of time spent feeding so there is a [[trade-off]] between the two. The length of time animals devote to vigilance is dependent on many factors including predation risk and [[hunger (motivational state)|hunger]].

Vigilance is often observed in animals that forage in groups, such as [[yellow-eyed junco]]s (''Junco phaeonutus'') and [[meerkat]]s (''Suricata suricatta''). Foraging in groups [[selfish herd theory|dilutes an individual's risk of predation]], and allows them to reduce their own vigilance while the vigilance of the group is maintained.&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;Davies, N.B., Krebs, J.R. &amp; West, S.A. (2012) An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology 4th edn, Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alarm signal]]s may be used to alert the group to the presence of predators. Groups of some species have at least one individual on sentry duty who looks out for predators on a perch while the rest of the group forages.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;

== Feeding and predation risk trade-off ==
Vigilance and feeding (both searching for and handling food) are generally mutually exclusive activities, leading to foragers facing a trade-off between [[nutrition|energy intake]] and safety from predation. As time allocated to scanning reduces the time spent feeding, vigilant individuals must devote more time on foraging to obtain the required food intake.&lt;ref name= "illius"&gt;Illius, A.W. &amp; Fitzgibbon, C. (1994) Costs of vigilance in foraging ungulates. Animal Behaviour 47: 481-484&lt;/ref&gt; This impedes on other activities in their time budget such as [[mating]] and prolongs their exposure to predation as foraging occurs away from shelter.&lt;ref name="illius"/&gt; When foraging time is limited, vigilant animals are left with a reduced energy intake.&lt;ref name="illius"/&gt;

[[Optimality model]]s can be used to predict foraging decisions of an animal based on costs (predation risk, starvation) and benefits (safety, food), which are also affected by [[physiology]] such as hunger levels.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;

[[File:Eastern Grey Squirrel in St James's Park, London - Nov 2006 edit.jpg|thumb|A [[Eastern gray squirrel|grey squirrel]] (''Sciurus carolinensis'') feeding in the safety of a tree to minimise exposure to predators during food handling]]
[[Eastern gray squirrel|Grey squirrels]] (''Sciurus carolinensis'') alter their behaviour according to the relative costs and benefits when foraging in the open.&lt;ref name="lima1985"&gt;Lima, S.L., Valone, T.J. &amp; Caraco, T. (1985) Foraging-efficiency – predation-risk trade-off in the grey squirrel. Animal Behaviour 33: 155-165&lt;/ref&gt; Small food items are consumed immediately to maximise energy intake, as they require little handling time so the cost of predation risk is low.&lt;ref name="lima1985"/&gt; Large items that require a long handling time, and hence time exposed to predators, are carried back to the safety of a tree to minimise predation risk.&lt;ref name="lima1985"/&gt; Although there is an energetic cost to transporting food, large food items have a high contribution to [[food energy|nutrient intake]] so the cost outweighs the benefits.&lt;ref name="lima1985"/&gt;

The overall predation risk is a function of the [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]], activity and ability of predators to [[prey detection|detect]] the forager, as well as the likelihood that the forager can escape the predator if it is not vigilant.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, J.S. (1999) Vigilance, patch use and habitat selection: foraging under predation risk. Evolutionary Ecology Research 1: 49-71&lt;/ref&gt; Animals prioritise vigilance over feeding when the predation risk is high. For example, yellow-eyed juncos spend more time scanning for predators when a potential predator, a [[Harris's hawk]] (''Parabuteo unicinctus''), is present compared to when the hawk is absent.&lt;ref name="caraco"&gt;Caraco, T., Martindale, S. &amp; Pulliam, H.R. (1980) Avian flocking in the presence of a predator. Nature 285: 400-401&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that influences vigilance is the benefit that is expected from foraging in the absence of predation.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; This is dependent on the quality of the food as well as the energetic state of the individual. If there is much to be gained from feeding, foragers may forgo vigilance. Similarly, if [[hunger (motivational state)|hungry]] animals have a higher chance of dying from [[starvation]] than from predation, it is more beneficial to sacrifice vigilance to fulfill their energy requirements. When [[three-spined stickleback]]s (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'') are deprived of food, they prefer to feed in locations with a high [[population density|density]] of [[Cladocera|water fleas]].&lt;ref name="milinski"&gt;Milinski, M. &amp; Heller, R. (1978) Influence of a predator on the optimal foraging behaviour of sticklebacks (''Gasterosteus aculeatus''). Nature 275: 642-644&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to this choice is that the sticklebacks must concentrate on picking out the prey due to the 'predator confusion effect' where many moving targets make it difficult for predators to pick out individual prey.&lt;ref name="milinski"/&gt; This choice means that the sticklebacks are less able to scan for predators however the risk of starvation is relatively higher than the risk of predation.&lt;ref name="milinski"/&gt; Similarly, [[junco]]s that have been deprived of food exhibit lower levels of vigilance, instead focusing on rapid feeding which is a behaviour incompatible with scanning.&lt;ref name="lima1995"&gt;Lima, S.L. (1995) Back to the basics of anti-predatory vigilance: the group-size effect. Animal Behaviour 49: 11-20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat and food choice ===
The state of an animal can change due to its behaviour and vice versa due to the dynamic [[feedback]] between foraging, body reserves and predation risk.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;  The feedback can influence an individual's choice of where, when and what to feed on.  If the predation risk is so great that an animal must maintain a level of vigilance that drastically inhibits feeding, it may opt for an alternative.

For example, the [[bluegill|bluegill sunfish]] (''Lepomis macrochirus'') has the choice of foraging on [[plankton]] in the safety of [[reed (plant)|reeds]] or on [[benthos|benthic invertebrates]] which are a better quality food source.&lt;ref name="gilliam"&gt;Gilliam, J.F. (1982) Foraging under mortality risk in size-structured populations. PhD thesis. Michigan State University, MI&lt;/ref&gt; When a predator (the [[largemouth bass]]) is present, smaller sunfish spend the majority of their time foraging in the reeds despite this choice reducing their food intake and seasonal growth rate.&lt;ref name="gilliam"/&gt; Sunfish that are too large to be eaten by the bass forage almost entirely on benthos. Although staying in the reeds means a slower growth rate and a longer period of being a size vulnerable to predators, for maximum survival sunfish choose to remain in the reeds feeding on plankton until they reach a certain size and then leave to feed on benthos.&lt;ref name="gilliam"/&gt;

[[Nocturnality|Nocturnal animals]] alter the timing of their foraging based on the level of light – avoiding feeding when the [[moonlight]] is bright as this is when predation risk is highest.&lt;ref name="clarke"&gt;Clarke, J.A. (1983) Moonlight’s influence on predator/prey interactions between short-eyed owls (''Asio flammeus'') and deermice (''Peromyscus maniculatus''). Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology 13: 205-209&lt;/ref&gt;

A raised head is the most commonly used indicator of vigilance, as many animals require their heads to be lowered to search for and handle food.&lt;ref&gt;Makowska, J. &amp; Kramer, D.L. (2007) Vigilance during food handling in grey squirrels, ''Sciurus carolinensis''. Animal Behaviour 74: 153-158&lt;/ref&gt; Different foods require different handling that can affect the amount of vigilance an animal can maintain. [[Seed]]s without husks, for example, require little handling by birds so are rapidly pecked up with the birds head down which is incompatible with vigilance.&lt;ref name="lima1988"&gt;Lima, S.L. (1988) Vigilance and diet selection: a simple example in the dark-eyed junco. Canadian Journal of Zoology 66: 593-596&lt;/ref&gt; In situations of high predation risk, animals may choose foods that can be foraged while maintaining vigilance. When [[dark-eyed junco]]s (''Junco hymenalis'') feed in small [[flock (birds)|flocks]], they prefer to feed on larger pieces of food than when they are part of a larger flock.&lt;ref name="lima1988"/&gt; As individuals in smaller flocks have a greater need to be vigilant (see more in [[Vigilance (Behavioural Ecology)#Vigilance in groups|Vigilance in groups]]), large pieces of food are more beneficial as they require a longer handling time that can be simultaneously spent scanning, whereas birds feeding on small pieces must intermittently stop foraging to scan their environment.&lt;ref name="lima1988"/&gt;

== Vigilance in groups ==

Both [[Foraging#Solitary foraging|solitary]] and [[Foraging#Group foraging|group]] foraging come with a variety of costs and benefits but for many animals, foraging in a group is the most optimal strategy. Among the many benefits of group foraging, reduction of predation risk by improved vigilance is one. [[common wood pigeon|Wood pigeons]] (''Columba palumbus'') in large flocks are more able to escape predation by [[goshawk]]s because they are able to spot them and fly away more quickly than they would individually.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; This is because in larger flocks, it is more likely that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and alert the group by flying away.

=== Group foraging ===
''Further information: [[Foraging#Group foraging|Group foraging]] and [[Anti-predator adaptation#Group living|Group living]]''

==== Advantages ====
A group of animals may be better at both finding and capturing food than solitary animals. For species that feed on food that is patchy, the likelihood of locating food is greater if individuals search for food independently and inform the rest of the group when a food patch is found.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;Clark, C.W. &amp; Mangel, M. (1984) Foraging and flocking strategies: information in an uncertain environment. The American Naturalist 123(5): 626-641&lt;/ref&gt; Information sharing in this way has little cost to the individual who locates the food if it occurs in high abundance in the patch.

[[Cooperative hunting|Group hunting]] allows predators to take down larger prey, as well as prey that can outrun the predator but can be caught by an [[ambush]]. For example, [[lion]]esses (''Panthera leo'') hunt [[Cooperative hunting#Lions|cooperatively]] for large prey such as [[zebra]] (''Equus burchelli'') and [[wildebeest]] (''Connochaetes taurinus''), with each lioness adopting particular [[division of labour|positions]] in a formation.&lt;ref&gt;Stander, P.E. (1992) Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual. Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology 29: 445-454&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of many predators also causes [[panic]] in groups of prey, often causing them to flee in different directions making it easier for the predators to single out a target.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;

[[File:Red-billed quelea flocking at waterhole.jpg|thumb|[[Red-billed quelea]]s form huge flocks of thousands of birds]]
Foraging in a group also has some anti-predator benefits. Being part of a group [[Anti-predator adaptation#Dilution effect|dilutes]] an individual's risk of being attacked, as the more group members there are, the lower the probability that that individual will be the victim.&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;Foster, W.A. &amp; Treherne, J.E. (1981) Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect. Nature 293: 466-467&lt;/ref&gt; Grouping may [[predator satiation|swamp the predator's capacity]] to capture prey - for example, hawks are unable to capture more than one yellow-eyed junco per attack.&lt;ref name="caraco"/&gt; Large groups also cause predator confusion as it makes it difficult for prey to focus on one target.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; Groups of animals may engage in communal defences, such as [[mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]], for further protection.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;

==== Disadvantages ====
Dilution of predation risk only occurs if groups of animals are not more prone to attack than individuals.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; Often large groups are more conspicuous to predators so grouping may increase the risk of attack. [[Blue acara]] cichlid fish (''Aequidens pulcher'') choose [[shoaling and schooling|shoals]] of [[guppy|guppies]] (''Poecilia reticulate'') to attack based on how visually conspicuous they are, preferring shoals that are larger or exhibit more movement.&lt;ref name="krause"&gt;Krause, J. &amp; Godin, J.J. (1995) Predator preferences for attacking particular prey group sizes: consequences for predator hunting success and prey predation risk. Animal Behaviour 50: 465-473&lt;/ref&gt; Foraging in groups requires sharing so may also lead to greater [[competition]] for food.

=== Effect of group size ===
Larger groups may have a greater overall vigilance than small groups due to the ‘many eyes’ hypothesis: more eyes scanning for predators means that the proportion of time that at least one individual is vigilant (collective vigilance) is higher.&lt;ref name="lima1990"&gt;Lima, S.L. &amp; Dill, L.M. (1990) Behavioral decisions made under the risk of predation: a review and prospectus. Canadian Journal of Zoology 68: 619-640&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fernandez"&gt;Fernandez, G.J., Capurro, A.F. &amp; Reboreda, J.C. (2003) Effect of group size on individual and collective vigilance in greater rheas. Ethology 109: 413-425&lt;/ref&gt; This improved vigilance may allow an individual to decrease the time it allocates to vigilance without any increase in its personal risk of being attacked - particularly as large groups already have a diluted predation risk.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, G. (1996) Why individual vigilance declines as group size increases. Animal Behaviour 51: 1077-086&lt;/ref&gt; Lower individual levels of vigilance with increasing group size has been observed in many bird, mammal and fish species.&lt;ref name="lima1995"/&gt; Individual [[ostrich]]es (''Struthio camelus'') and [[greater rhea]]s (''Rhea americana'') in large groups both spend less time with their head up than individuals in small groups, however collective vigilance increases with group size in ostriches but not rheas.&lt;ref name="fernandez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bertram"&gt;Bertram, B.C.R. (1980) Vigilance and group size in ostriches. Animal Behaviour 28: 278-286&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the many eyes hypothesis does not always hold. Although individuals in groups may be able to decrease the time they spend scanning, and hence reach their energy requirements in a shorter period of time, the increased competition for food in groups may mean that animals need to devote more time overall to foraging due to an increased allocation of time for [[aggression|aggressive behaviour]] during foraging.&lt;ref name="roberts"/&gt; For example, the rate of fighting between [[house sparrow]]s (''Passer domesticus'') increases with the size of the flock.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, C.J. (1980) Factors affecting flock size mean and variance in a winter population of house sparrows (''Passer domesticus L.'') Behaviour 74(1):114-127&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alarm signals ===
{{further|Alarm signal}}

Large groups of animals are able to detect predators earlier because of the higher probability that at least one individual is being vigilant when the predator approaches. As many predators rely on the element of [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] in successful attacks, early detection of predators reduces predation risk.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; The detection of a predator by one individual only translates to collective detection if that individual makes some sort of signal to alert the rest of the group. The signal may be a deliberate call made by the vigilant individual (as in the case of meerkats) or simply the departure of the individual who has detected the predator.

[[Flock (birds)|Flocks]] of birds often exhibit collective detection. One or more birds initially detect the threat, and other birds that did not perceive the threat detect their departure and also respond by fleeing.&lt;ref name="lima1995"/&gt; The departure of multiple birds simultaneously is likely to be a more effective alarm signal than that of a single bird as birds regularly depart flocks for reasons other than predator detection.&lt;ref name="lima1995"/&gt;

[[Gerridae|Water skaters]] (''Halobates robustus'') transmit predator avoidance behaviour through the group through the sense of [[somatosensory system|touch]]: individuals at the edge of the flotilla detect a predator and move, bumping into their neighbours, who in turn start moving and bumping into more individuals.&lt;ref name="treherne"&gt;Treherne, J.E. &amp; Foster, W.A. (1981) Group transmission of predator avoidance behaviour in a marine insect: the Trafalgar Effect. Animal Behaviour 29: 911-917&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘wave’ of alarm has been termed the ‘Trafalgar Effect’.&lt;ref name="treherne"/&gt;

==== Sentinels ====
[[File:Suricate, Namibia (2813287155).jpg|thumb|A [[meerkat]] (''Suricata suricatta'') on sentry duty looks out for predators on a perch]]
In some species, individuals in a foraging group take on sentry duty. The sentinels look out for predators (often from a good vantage point) while the rest of the group forages, and sound an alarm when they spot a predator.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; Sentry duty is particularly important for species whose foraging activity is incompatible with vigilance, or who feed in areas where they are highly exposed to predators. For example, [[common dwarf mongoose|dwarf mongooses]] (''Helogale parvula'') dig up [[arthropod]]s from the ground to eat; an activity which requires fixation of both their [[visual perception|vision]] and [[olfaction]] on the prey.&lt;ref&gt;Rasa, O.A.E. (1986) Coordinated vigilance in dwarf mongoose family groups: the ‘Watchman’s Song’ hypothesis and the costs of guarding. Ethology 71: 340-344&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the sentry makes quiet calls that function as a ‘watchman’s song’ to reassure the rest of the group that an individual is on guard.&lt;ref&gt;Wickler, W. (1985) Coordination of vigilance in bird groups, the ‘Watchman’s Song’ hypothesis. Zeitschrift fur Tierphysiologie, Tierernahrung und Futtermittelkunde 69: 250-253&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a vocalising sentry, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] (''Turdoides bicolor'') decrease their own vigilance, spread out further from the group and forage in more exposed patches resulting in a higher intake of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Hollen, L.I., Bell, M.B.V. &amp; Radford, A.N. (2008) Cooperative sentinel calling? Foragers gain increased biomass intake. Current Biology 18: 576-579&lt;/ref&gt;

Guarding may appear to be an [[altruism (biology)|altruistic behaviour]] as an individual on sentry duty is unable to feed, may be more exposed to predators, and may attract the predators attention when they make an alarm call. However meerkats on sentry duty are at no greater risk of predation as they are generally the first to detect predators (e.g. [[jackal]]s, [[eagle]] species) and flee to safety.&lt;ref name="clutton"&gt;Clutton-Brock, T.H., O’Riain, M.J., Brotherton, P.N.M., Gaynor, D., Kansky, R., Griffin, A.S. &amp; Manser, M. (1999) Selfish sentinels in cooperative mammals. Science 284: 1640-1644&lt;/ref&gt; Meerkats also only go on guard once they are satiated so if no other individual is on sentry duty, guarding may be the most beneficial behaviour as the individual has no requirement for feeding and can benefit from early predator detection.&lt;ref name="clutton"/&gt;

=== Cheating ===
In a large group, it is possible for an individual to cheat by scanning less than other members of the group without having any negative effect on the collective vigilance of the group. Cheating would seem to be the most beneficial strategy as the individual still benefits from the collective detection of the group while being able to feed more than other individuals. However, cheating is not a stable strategy because if all members of the group did it, then there would be no collective vigilance.&lt;ref name="pulliam"&gt;Pulliam, H.R. (1982) The scanning behavior of juncos: a game-theoretical approach. Journal of Theoretical Biology 95: 89-103&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting a very high level of vigilance in a group is also not a stable strategy as an individual who adopts a lower level of vigilance would have a greater advantage. The evolutionarily stable ([[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESS]]) scanning rate is the rate that if all group members adopted, an individual that scanned more or less frequently would have a lower chance of survival.&lt;ref name="pulliam"/&gt;

Maintaining individual vigilance may be a more beneficial strategy if vigilant animals gain some sort of advantage.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, J.M. &amp; Houston, A.I. (1992) Evolutionarily stable levels of vigilance as a function of group size. Animal Behaviour 43: 641-658&lt;/ref&gt; Non-vigilant individuals are often the last to flee to safety, as groups generally flee in succession from the individual who spots the predator, individuals who were vigilant when the first animal departs, and finally the non-vigilant individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Lima, S.L. (1994) On the personal benefits of anti-predatory vigilance. Animal Behaviour 48: 734-736&lt;/ref&gt; Predators may also target less vigilant prey as they are likely to detect the predator later and therefore respond more slowly. [[Cheetah]]s (''Acinonyx jubatus'') select less vigilant [[Thomson's gazelle]]s (''Eudorcas thomsonii'') before initiating a chase and target them for attack.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgibbon, C.D. (1989) A cost to individuals with reduced vigilance in groups of Thomson’s gazelles hunted by cheetahs. Animal Behaviour 37(3): 508-510&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wolfram Demonstrations Project''' is an organized, open-source&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/issues/v40_1/2.htm Interactive Economic Models from the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Journal of Economic Education.&lt;/ref&gt; collection of small (or medium-size) interactive programs called Demonstrations, which are meant to visually and interactively represent ideas from a range of fields. It is hosted by [[Wolfram Research]], whose stated goal is to bring computational exploration to the widest possible audience.  At its launch, it contained 1300 demonstrations&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/product/P000002568 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] CERN Courier June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but has grown to over 10,000. The site won a [[Parents' Choice Award]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=24826&amp;StepNum=1 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Parents Choice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- May 2012--&gt;

==Technology==
The Demonstrations run in ''[[Mathematica]]'' 6 or above and in ''[[CDF Player|Wolfram CDF Player]]'' which is a free modified version of Wolfram's ''Mathematica'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_05_02_07.html Math Games] MAA Online, May 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificcomputing.com/Adventures-with-the-Wolfram-Demonstrations-Project.aspx Adventures with the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] John Wass, Scientific Computing&lt;/ref&gt; and can operate as a web browser plugin.

They typically consist of a very direct user interface to a graphic or visualization, which dynamically recomputes in response to user actions such as moving a slider, clicking a button, or dragging a piece of graphics. Each Demonstration also has a brief description of the concept.

Demonstrations are now easily embeddable into any website or blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaurov|first=Vitaliy|title=Add a Wolfram Demonstration to Your Site in One Easy Step|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/04/24/add-a-wolfram-demonstration-to-your-site-in-one-easy-step/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Demonstration page includes a snippet of JavaScript code in the Share section of the sidebar.

==Topics==
The website is organized by topic: for example, science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/molecular-wolfram-demonstrations.html Molecular Wolfram Demonstrations] ScienceBase&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics, computer science, art, biology, and finance. They cover a variety of levels, from elementary school mathematics to much more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and models of biological organisms.  The site is aimed at both educators and students, as well as researchers who wish to present their ideas to the broadest possible audience.

==Process==
Wolfram Research's staff organizes and edits the Demonstrations, which may be created by any user of ''Mathematica'', then freely published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific-computing.com/education/archives/29 Throwing beanbags in Mathematica 6], Scientific Computing, May 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and freely downloaded. The Demonstrations are open-source, which means that they not only demonstrate the concept itself but also show how to implement it.

==Alternatives==
The use of the web to transmit small interactive programs is reminiscent of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Java applet]]s, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], and the open-source [[Processing (programming language)|processing]]. However, those creating Demonstrations have access to the algorithmic and visualization capabilities of ''Mathematica'' making it more suitable for technical demonstrations. 

The Demonstrations Project also has similarities to user-generated content websites like [[Wikipedia]] and [[Flickr]].  Its business model is similar to Adobe's [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat]] and Flash strategy of charging for development tools but providing a free reader.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

'''Xenia''' (also known as the '''Xenia effect''') in plants is the effect of pollen on seeds and fruit of the fertilized plant.&lt;ref name=Denny&gt;{{cite journal|author=Denney, J.O.|year=1992|title=Xenia includes metaxenia|journal=HortScience|volume=27|issue=722–728|pages=722–728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is separate to the contribution of the pollen towards the next generation.

The term was coined in 1881 by the botanist [[Wilhelm Olbers Focke]] to refer to effects on maternal tissues, including the seed coat and pericarp, but at that time [[endosperm]] was also thought to be a maternal tissue, and the term became closely associated with endosperm effects.&lt;ref name="Denny" /&gt; The term '''metaxenia''' was later coined and is still sometimes used to describe the effects on purely maternal tissues.&lt;ref name="Denny" /&gt;

==Endosperm effects in the seed==
One of the most familiar examples of xenia is the different colours that can be produced in [[maize]] (''Zea mays'') by assortment of alleles via individual pollen grains. Such maize cobs are cultivated for decorative purposes.

The [[endosperm]] tissue, which makes up most of the bulk of a maize seed, is not produced by the mother plant, but is the product of fertilization, and genetic factors carried by the pollen affect its colour. For example, a yellow-seeded race may have its yellow colour determined by a [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive allele]]. If it receives pollen from a purple-seeded race that has one copy of a dominant allele for purple colour and one copy of the recessive allele for yellow seed, the resulting cob will have some yellow and some purple seeds.

Qualities affected in the endosperm of [[sorghum]] may include starchiness, sweetness, waxiness, or other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Investigation of a xenia effect for yield caused by the waxy gene in grain sorghum|url = http://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/2624|website = oaktrust.library.tamu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-11|language = en-US|first = Kuhlman, Leslie|last = Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fruit-growth effects==
[[File:Vaccinium corymbosum a2.jpg|thumb|Ripe and unripe fruit of ''Vaccinium corymbosum'']]
The vigour of the seeds forming inside a fruit can affect the growth of the fruit itself. For example, in two plant species whose fruit ripen asynchronously (''[[Vaccinium corymbosum]]'' and ''[[Amelanchier arborea]]'') the fruit with more seeds ripened faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gorchov, D.L.|year=1985|title=Fruit ripening asynchrony is related to variable seed number in ''Amelanchier'' and ''Vaccinium''|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=72|issue=12|pages=1939–1943|jstor=2443610|doi=10.2307/2443610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xenia and genetically engineered crops==
Because there is concern about pollen from [[genetically modified crops|genetically modified]] (GM) crops, male-sterile forms are being considered, particularly of maize.&lt;ref name=Feil&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Euphytica |author1=B. Feil |author2=U. Weingartner |author3=P. Stamp |title=Controlling the release of pollen from genetically modified maize and increasing its grain yield by growing mixtures of male-sterile and male-fertile plants |volume=130 |pages=163–165 |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/a:1022843504598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male-fertile non-GM plants must then be grown with the GM crop to ensure pollination. In some cases, a xenia effect due to the genetic difference between the two strains has been observed that increases grain yield, and could make it financially viable to grow the male-sterile plants in such a mixture.&lt;ref name=Feil/&gt;
