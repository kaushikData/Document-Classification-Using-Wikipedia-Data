{{Italic title}}'''''Actus Essendi'''''  is a [[Latin]] expression coined by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274). Translated as "act of being", the expression ''actus essendi'' refers to a fundamental metaphysical principle discovered by Aquinas in his Christianizing of [[Aristotle]]. 

Aquinas saw that in any subsisting extramental thing one finds a couplet of [[metaphysical]] principles: one is the ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is, the other is the ''actus essendi'' which gives to the thing and to its ‘essence’ actual existence. 

The observation that individual things display instantiations of a particular ‘essence’ led Aquinas to postulate that what gives actual existence to a thing and to its ‘essence’ — the ''actus essendi'' — is unique, in the sense that the perfection of ''actus essendi'' cannot be said to be common in the way an ‘essence’ is said to be common. 

Things instantiating the essence of horseness, for example, are said to be similar because of their horseness. The essence of horseness is what makes horses to be the same under a common category.

But things instantiating the perfection of ''actus essendi'', are said to be different on account of their ''actus essendi''. The possession of ''actus essendi'' is what makes things unique and distinct from all other things. 

Thus in what actually exists as a subsisting extramental thing, there is an ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is (a horse, for example), and the ''actus essendi'' which makes the thing to be a real, individual, existing thing.

Aristotle didn’t have the notion of ''actus essendi''. In fact, the contribution of Aquinas to the philosophy of being is precisely this, that he discovered that all Aristotelian acts were in reality ‘potency’ with respect to the ''actus essendi''. 

Aquinas saw that the metaphysical principle of ''actus essendi'' is the "act of all acts, the perfection of all perfections",&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Quaestiones Disputatae De Potentia'', question 7, article 2, ad 9.  See also ''Summa Theologiae'', part I, question 4, article 1, ad 3; and ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', book II, chapter 54, no. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a proper effect of God".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', book III, chapter 66, no. 4. See also ''Summa Theologiae'', part I, question 45, article 5, corpus.&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphysics of Aristotle did not reach that far.

Accordingly, Pope John Paul II stresses in his teachings that the philosophy of Aquinas is the philosophy of ''actus essendi'', "whose transcendental value paves the most direct way to rise to the knowledge of subsisting Being and pure Act, namely to God."&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, "The ''Angelicum'' Address", speech delivered at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in Rome on 17 November 1979. The original, in Italian, was published in ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 71 (1979): 1472-1483. English translations are available in ''L'Osservatore Romano English Weekly Edition'' (17 December 1979): 6-8; and in ''Angelicum'' 57 (1980): 133-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas defined God as the ‘''Ipse Actus Essendi subsistens''’, subsisting act of being.

'''Agency''' is the capacity of an [[Free will|actor]] to act in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503–509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synofzik, M., Vosgerau, G. and Newen, A., 2008. Beyond the comparator model: a multifactorial two-step account of agency. Consciousness and Cognition, 17(1), pp. 219–239.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and [[moral agency]] is therefore a distinct concept. In [[sociology]], an agent is an individual engaging with the [[social structure]]. Notably, though, the primacy of [[structure and agency|social structure vs. individual capacity]] with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] an agent may possess.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‘goal directed action’ an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/ |title=Action |last1=Wilson |first1=George |last2=Shpall |first2=Samuel |date=4 April 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human agency==
{{See also|Action (philosophy)}}
Agency is contrasted to objects reacting to [[Natural phenomenon|natural forces]] involving only unthinking [[determinism|deterministic]] processes. In this respect, agency is subtly distinct from the concept of [[free will]], the [[philosophical]] [[doctrine]] that our choices are not the product of causal chains, but are significantly free or undetermined. Human agency entails the claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world. ''How'' humans come to make decisions, by free choice or other processes, is another issue.

The capacity of a human to act as an agent is [[person]]al to that human, though considerations of the outcomes flowing from particular acts of human agency for us and others can then be thought to invest a [[moral]] component into a given situation wherein an agent has acted, and thus to involve moral agency. If a situation is the consequence of human decision making, persons may be under a duty to apply [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] judgments to the consequences of their decisions, and held to be responsible for those decisions. Human agency entitles the observer to ask ''should this have occurred?'' in a way that would be nonsensical in circumstances lacking human decisions-makers, for example, the impact of comet [[Shoemaker–Levy]] on [[Jupiter]].

===In philosophy===
The philosophical discipline in charge of studying agency is [[action theory (philosophy)|action theory]]. In certain philosophical traditions (particularly those established by [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]), human agency is a collective, historical dynamic, rather than a function arising out of individual behavior. Hegel's [[Geist]] and Marx's [[universal class]] are [[idealist]] and [[materialist]] expressions of this idea of humans treated as social beings, organized to act in concert. Also look at the debate, philosophically derived in part from the works of [[David Hume|Hume]], between [[determinism]] and [[indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminacy]].

Structure and agency forms an enduring core debate in sociology. Essentially the same as in the [[Marxist]] conception, "agency" refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices, based on their will, whereas "structure" refers to those factors (such as social class, but also religion, gender, ethnicity, subculture, etc.) that seem to limit or influence the opportunities that individuals have.

===In other sciences===
Other notions of agency have arisen in the field of economics/management, psychology and social cybernetics:

'''In economics ([[contract theory]])''':

''Economic agency'' is an internal instrumentality through which external influences operate mechanistically on action. Internal agency events are a reflection of the impact of external environments from which causal attributes are ignored, and the self-system is simply a repository and conduit for environmental forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=S. A.|title=The Economic Theory of Agency: The Principal's Problem|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=134–139|jstor=1817064|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In psychology''':

The term of [[Agency (psychology)|agency]] used in different fields of [[psychology]] with different meaning. It can refer to the ability of recognizing agents or attributing agency to objects based on simple perceptual cues or principles, for instance the principle of rationality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Nádasdy|first2=Zoltán|last3=Csibra|first3=Gergely|last4=Bíró|first4=Szilvia|date=1995|title=Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/001002779500661H|journal=Cognition|volume=56|issue=2|pages=165–193|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(95)00661-h|issn=0010-0277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|date=2003|title=Teleological reasoning in infancy: the naı̈ve theory of rational action|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661303001281|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=287–292|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00128-1|issn=1364-6613|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that context-sensitive, goal-directed efficient actions are the crucial characteristics of [[Agency (psychology)|agents]]. This topic is thoroughly investigated by [[Developmental psychology|developmental]] and [[Comparative psychology|comparative psychologists]] to understand how an observer is able to differentiate agentive entities from inanimate objects, but it can be also related to the term of autonomous [[Intelligent agent|intelligent agency]] used in [[cybernetics]]. Agency can also imply the [[sense of agency]], that is the feeling of being in control.

''Emergent interactive agency'' defines Bandura's view of agencies, where human agency can be exercised through direct personal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=A.|title=Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=1999|volume=2|pages=21–41|url=https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1999AJSP.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2016|doi=10.1111/1467-839X.00024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura formulates his view of agency as a [[socio-cognitive]] one, where people are [[self-organizing]], proactive, [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulating]], and engage in [[self-reflection]], and are not just reactive organisms shaped and shepherded by external events. People have the power to influence their own actions to produce certain results. The capacity to exercise control over one’s thought processes, motivation, affect, and action operates through mechanisms of personal agency. Such agencies are emergent and interactive, apply perspectives of social cognition, and make causal contributions to its own motivations and actions using ‘[[Causality|reciprocal causation]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1986). Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ Bormann, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In social cybernetics''':

''Autonomous agency'' is able to embrace the concepts of both the economic agency and the emergent interactive agency. An autonomous system is self-directed, operating in, and being influenced by, interactive environments. It usually has its own immanent dynamics that impact on the way it interacts. It is also adaptable and (hence viable thus having a durable existence), proactive, self-organizing, self-regulating and so forth, participates in creating its own behaviour, and contributes to its life circumstances through cognitive and cultural functionality. Autonomous agency may also be concerned with the relationship between two or more agencies in a mutual relationship with each other and their environments, with imperatives for an agency's behaviour within an interactive context due to immanent emergent attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, K.J., Yolles, M., Fink, G., Iles, P., 2016, The Changing Organisation: Agency Theory in a Cross-cultural Context, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Sanskrit]] aphorism '''''Ahaṁ Brahmāsmi''''' ([[Devanagari]]: अहं ब्रह्मास्मि) "I am [[Brahman]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://iskcondesiretree.com/group/krishnaconsciousness/forum/topics/q-what-is-the-meaning-of-aham-brahmasmi Meaning of Aham Brahamasmi]&lt;/ref&gt; or "I am the Infinite Reality"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} or "I am the Ultimate". It is one of the four [[Mahavakyas]] used to explain the unity of [[macrocosm and microcosm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gurumayum Ranjit Sharma |title=The Idealistic Philosophy of Swami Vivekananda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORYOsJHi53sC&amp;pg=PA180 |year=1987 |publisher=Atlantic |page=180 |id=GGKEY:PSWXE5NTFF4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

Literally, ''Aham'' (अहं) means "I", that which cannot be deserted or abandoned on account of being constant, unavoidable, ever present. ''Brahma'' (ब्रह्म) means ever-full or whole (ब्रह्म is the first case ending singular of Brahman) and ''Asmi'' (अस्मि) means "am," the first-person singular present tense of the verb "अस्," "to be."{{cn|date=July 2018}} This ''mahāvākya'' is in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] of the [[Yajurveda#Shukla Yajurveda|Shukla Yajurveda]].

[[Brahman]] is the Infinite Reality, the all encompassing existence in itself; only when the ego dies can this be realized. In this aphorism the "I" is not the limited [[wikt:transmigration|transmigrating]] ego, the doer and the enjoyer within, and also not the body and the mind. Man (who is a conscious entity) alone has the capacity to improve his present state, to guide his future, to enquire and know the truth, and to free himself from the cycle of birth and death (''vidyā adhikāra'') through thoughtful actions (''karma adhikāra'').{{cn|date=July 2018}}

[[Vidyaranya|Vidyāranya]] in his [[Panchadasi]] (V.4) explains:
: स्वतः पूर्णः परात्माऽत्र ब्रह्मशब्देन वर्णितः |
: अस्मीत्यैक्य-परामर्शः तेन ब्रह्म भवाम्यहम् ||

: "Infinite by nature, the Supreme Self is described here by the word ''Brahman'' (lit. ever expanding; the ultimate reality); the word ''asmi'' denotes the identity of ''aham'' and ''Brahman''. Therefore, (the meaning of the expression is) "I am Brahman."

This realization is gained through true enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swami Tejomayananda, Mādhava |title=Pañcadaśī, chapters 5, 10 and 15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UCHnUq18pUC&amp;pg=PA12 |year=1999 |publisher=Chinmaya Mission |isbn=978-81-7597-036-6 |pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== In Vaishnavism ===
Vaishnavas, when they talk about Brahman, usually refer to impersonal Brahman, brahmajyoti (rays of Brahman). Brahman according to them means God - Narayana, Rama or Krishna. Thus, the meaning of "aham brahma asmi" according to their philosophy is that "I am a drop of Ocean of Consciousness.", or "I am soul, part of cosmic spirit, Parabrahma". Here, the term Parabrahma is introduced to avoid confusion. If Brahman can mean soul (though, Parabrahma is also the soul, but Supreme one - Paramatma), then Parabrahma should refer to God, Lord Vishnu.

==Significance==
This memorable expression appears in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] when the sage, in the context of meditation on the Self, in reply to the query – What did that Brahma know by which It became all? - states:-

: "ब्रह्म वा इदमग्र आसीत्, तदात्मनामेवावेत्, अहं ब्रह्मास्मीति | तस्मात्तत्सर्वमभवत्; तद्यो यो देवानां प्रत्यबुध्यत स एव तदभवत्, तदषीर्णाम् तथा मनुष्याणाम्,..."

: "This (self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning; It knew only Itself as, "I am Brahman". Therefore It became all; and whoever among the gods knew It also became That; and the same with sages and men…” - (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I.iv.10)

In his comment on this passage [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that here Brahman is not the conditioned Brahman (saguna), that a transitory entity cannot be eternal, that knowledge about Brahman, the infinite all-pervading entity, has been enjoined, that knowledge of non-duality alone dispels ignorance and that the meditation based on resemblance is only an idea. He also tells us that the expression ''Aham Brahmaasmi'' is the explanation of the [[mantra]] –

: पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते |
: पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ||

: "That ('Brahman') is infinite, and this ('universe') is infinite; the infinite proceeds from the infinite. (Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite ('universe'), it remains as the infinite ('Brahman') alone." - (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad V.i.1)

He explains that non-duality and plurality are contradictory only when applied to the Self, which is eternal and without parts, but not to the effects, which have parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brhadaranayaka Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=98-105,557,559|url= https://archive.org/details/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''aham'' in this memorable expression is not closed in itself as a pure mental abstraction but it is radical openness. Between Brahman and ''aham-brahma'' lies the entire temporal universe experienced by the ignorant as a separate entity (duality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raimundo Panikkar |title=Mantramañjari |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M01LSxaneasC&amp;pg=PA743 |year=1994 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1280-2 |pages=742–743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequence==

The difference between Brahma and atma emerges most clearly where they appear side by side with one another such as - स वा अयमात्मा ब्रह्म विज्ञानमयो मनोमयः प्राणमयः – 'That Self is indeed Brahma, as also identified with the intellect, the mind and the vital-force'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swami Parmeshwaranand |title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanisads |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA219 |year=2000 |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |isbn=978-81-7625-148-8 |pages=219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Isha Upanishad]] tells us that the Supreme Brahma present in the ''Mukhya Prana'' is the bearer of the secret names of ''Aham'' and ''Asmi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B. N. Krishnamurti Sharma |title=History of the Dvaita School of Vedānta and Its Literature: From the Earliest Beginnings to Our Own Times |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA609 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=978-81-208-1575-9 |page=609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara proclaims that there is a plane where everything is entirely "different"; where laws of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' no longer apply; where distinctions like subject and object fall away; where ''[[Tat Tvam Asi]]'' and ''Aham Brahma asmi'' are actually felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Torwesten |title=Vedanta: Heart of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWptZtEa0hcC&amp;pg=PA152 |date=January 1994 |publisher=Grove/Atlantic |isbn=978-0-8021-3262-8 |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alobha''' (Sanskrit, Pali; Tibetan Wylie: ''ma chags pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "non-attachment". It is defined as the absence of attachment or desire towards worldly things or worldly existence. It causes one to not engage in unwholesome actions.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 536-537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the virtuous [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is alobha? It is not to be attached to a mode of life and all that is involved with it. It functions in providing the basis for not being caught up in non-virtuous action.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

== Syllogisms ==
{{Main|Syllogism}}
A ''[[syllogism]]'' is a kind of [[logical argument]] in which one [[proposition]] (the conclusion) is [[Inference|inferred]] from two or more others (the ''[[premise]]s'') of a specific form. The classical example of a valid syllogism is:

::All humans are mortal. (major premise)
::Socrates is human. ([[minor premise]])
::Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)

An example of an invalid syllogism is:

:: All teenage girls are ambitious.
:: Teenage girls study hard.
:: Therefore, girls study hard because they are ambitious.

Typically, a majority of test subjects in studies incorrectly identify this syllogism as one in which the conclusion follows from the premises.&lt;ref name="SternbergLeighton2004"/&gt;  It might be true ''in the real world'' that a) ''girls study'' and b) ''this is because they are ambitious''. However, this argument is a fallacy, because the conclusion is not supported by its premises. The validity of an argument is different from the truth of its conclusion: there are valid arguments for false conclusions and invalid arguments for true conclusions. Hence, it is an error to judge the validity of an argument from the plausibility of its conclusion. This is the reasoning error known as belief bias.&lt;ref name="SternbergLeighton2004"/&gt;

When a person gives a response that is determined by the believability of the conclusion rather than logical validity, this is referred to as belief bias only when syllogism are used. This phenomenon is so closely related to syllogistic reasoning that when it does occur, in areas such as [[Wason selection task|Wason's selection task]] or the [[THOG problem]], it is called "memory cueing" or the "effects of content".&lt;ref name="Human Reasoning: The Psychology of Deduction"/&gt;

== Dual-process theory of belief bias ==
Many researchers in thinking and reasoning have provided evidence for a dual-process cognitive approach to reasoning, judgement and decision making. They argue that these two systems (system 1 and system 2) engage in a constant battle for control over our brain to reason and make decisions. System 1 can be described as an automated system&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Walter|last2=Shiffrin|first2=Richard M.|date=1977-01-01|title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: I. Detection, search, and attention.|journal=Psychological Review|language=English|volume=84|issue=1|pages=1–66|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.1.1|issn=1939-1471}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised by “unconscious” ,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Barbara J.|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|last3=Potter|first3=W. James|last4=Kunkel|first4=Dale|last5=Linz|first5=Daniel|last6=Colvin|first6=Carolyn M.|last7=Donnerstein|first7=Edward|date=2002-01-01|title=Violence in Children's Television Programming: Assessing the Risks|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=52|issue=1|pages=5–35|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2002.tb02531.x|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; "intuitive" &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammond|first=Thomas H.|date=1996-04-01|title=Formal Theory and the Institutions of Governance|journal=Governance|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=107–185|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.1996.tb00237.x|issn=1468-0491}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "rapid"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;”; whereas system 2 is said to be a controlled system,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; characterised by “conscious”,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “Analytic”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and “Slow”;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; some researchers (Reber 1993, Stanovich 1999) even claimed to have found a link between general intelligence and the effectiveness of decision making. It is important that note that the dual-process cognitive theory is different from the two minds hypothesis. A research done by Johnathan Evans in 2007 provided evidence for the view that System 1 which serves as a quick heuristic processor fights for control over System 2's slower analytical approach. In the experiment, participants were asked to evaluate syllogisms that have valid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; valid arguments with convincing conclusions; invalid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; invalid arguments with convincing conclusions. The results show that when the conclusion is believable, people blindly accept invalid conclusions more so than invalid arguments are accepted.

== Influencing factors of belief bias ==

=== Time ===
Various studies have proved that the time period of which a subject is allowed to think when evaluating arguments is related to the tendency for belief bias to take place. In a study done by Evans and Holmes in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Jonathan St B. T.|last2=Curtis-Holmes|first2=Jodie|date=2005-09-01|title=Rapid responding increases belief bias: Evidence for the dual-process theory of reasoning|journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning|volume=11|issue=4|pages=382–389|doi=10.1080/13546780542000005|issn=1354-6783}}&lt;/ref&gt; they recruited two different groups of people to answer a series of reasoning questions. One group of people were given only two seconds to answer the questions; whereas the other group of people were allowed to use as much time as they would like to answer the questions. The result obtained was that a higher percentage of incorrect answers were found in the time pressured group than the other; they concluded that this was a result of a shift in logical to belief-biased way of thinking.

=== Nature of content ===
The nature of the content presented can also affect belief bias of an individual as shown by a study done by Goel &amp; Vartanian in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goel|first=Vinod|last2=Vartanian|first2=Oshin|date=2011-01-01|title=Negative emotions can attenuate the influence of beliefs on logical reasoning|journal=Cognition and Emotion|volume=25|issue=1|pages=121–131|doi=10.1080/02699931003593942|pmid=21432659|issn=0269-9931}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, 34 participants were presented with a syllogism upon each trial. Each trial were either neutral or carried some degree of negative content. Negative content involved in the experiment were politically incorrect social norm violations, such as the statement “Some wars are not unjustified, Some wars involve raping of women, therefore, Some raping of women is not unjustified”. For syllogisms where the content was neutral, the results were consistent with studies of belief bias; however, for syllogisms with negative emotional content, participants were more likely to reason logically on invalid syllogisms with believable conclusions instead of automatically judging them to be valid. In other words, the effect of belief bias is reduced when the content presented is of negative emotion. According to Goel and Vartanian, this is a because negative emotions prompts us to reason in more careful and in more detail. This argument was supported by the observation that for questions with negative emotions, the reaction time taken was significantly longer than that of questions that a neutral.

=== Instructions given ===
In an experiment done by Evans, Newstead, Allen &amp; Pollard in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newstead|first=Stephen E.|last2=Pollard|first2=Paul|last3=Evans|first3=Jonathan St. B. T.|last4=Allen|first4=Julie L.|date=1992-12-01|title=The source of belief bias effects in syllogistic reasoning|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779290019E|journal=Cognition|volume=45|issue=3|pages=257–284|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90019-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; where subjects were given detailed instructions which lack specific reference to the notion of logical necessity when answering questions, it was shown that a larger proportion of answers actually rejected invalid arguments with convincing conclusions as opposed to when no further instructions were given when the subjects were asked to answer the questions. The results of the experiments reflects that when elaborated instructions were given to subjects to reason logically, the effects of belief bias is decreased.

== Research ==
In a series of experiments by Evans, Barston and Pollard (1983),&lt;ref name=EvansBarstonPollard1983 /&gt; participants were presented with evaluation task paradigms, containing two premises and a conclusion. The participants were asked to make an evaluation of logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. The subjects, however, exhibited a belief bias, evidenced by their tendency to reject valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorse invalid arguments with believable conclusions. Instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs.

Consequently, these results demonstrated a greater acceptance of more believable (80%), than unbelievable (33%) conclusions. Participants also illustrated evidence of logical competences  and the results determined an increase in acceptance of valid (73%) than invalid (41%). Additionally, there's a small difference between believable and valid (89%) in comparison to unbelievable and invalid (56%) (Evans, Barston &amp; Pollard, 1983; Morley, Evans &amp; Handley, 2004).&lt;ref name=EvansBarstonPollard1983&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = J. St. B.T. | last2 = Barston | first2 = J.L. | last3 = Pollard | first3 = P. | year = 1983 | title = On the conflict between logic and belief in syllogistic reasoning | url = | journal = Memory and Cognition | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 295–306 | doi=10.3758/bf03196976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morely|first=N. J. |author2=Evans, J. St. B. T. |author3=Handley, S.

It has been argued that using more realistic content in [[syllogisms]] can facilitate more normative performance from participants. It has been suggested that the use of more abstract, artificial content will also have a biasing effect on performance. Therefore, more research is required to understand fully how and why belief bias occurs and if there are certain mechanisms that are responsible for such things.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} There is also evidence of clear individual differences in normative responding that are predicted by the response times of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stupple|first=E.J.N. |author2=L. J. Ball |author3=J. St. B. T. Evans |author4=E. Kamal-Smith |title=When logic and belief collide: Individual differences in reasoning times support a selective processing model|journal=Journal of Cognitive Psychology|year=2011|volume=23|issue=8|pages=931–941|doi=10.1080/20445911.2011.589381|url=https://derby.openrepository.com/derby/handle/10545/575936 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 study by Markovits and Nantel gave participants four reasoning tasks. The results indicated “a significant belief-bias effect”  that existed “independently of the subjects' abstract reasoning ability.”&lt;ref name="Markovits &amp; Nantel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markovits|first1=H.|last2=Nantel|first2=G.|title=The belief-bias effect in the production and evaluation of logical conclusions.|date=January 1989|pmid=2913452|volume=17|issue=1|journal=Memory and Cognition|pages=11–7|doi=10.3758/bf03199552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by Donna Torrens examined differences in belief bias among individuals. Torrens found that “the extent of an individual's belief bias effect was unrelated to a number of measures of reasoning competence” but was, instead, related to that person's ability  “to generate alternative representations of premises: the more alternatives a person generated, the less likely they were to show a belief bias effect."&lt;ref name="Torrens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torrens|first1=Donna|title=Individual Differences and the Belief Bias Effect: Mental Models, Logical Necessity, and Abstract Reasoning|journal=Thinking and Reasoning|date=September 24, 2010|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1080/135467899394066|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 study, Chad Dube and Caren M. Rotello of the [[University of Massachusetts]] and Evan Heit of the [[University of California, Merced]], showed that “the belief bias effect is simply a response bias effect.”&lt;ref name="Dube, Rotello, and Heit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dube|first1=Chad|last2=Rotello|first2=Caren|last3=Heit|first3=Evan|title=The Belief Bias Effect Is Aptly Named: A Reply to Klauer and Kellen (2011)|journal=Psychological Review|volume=118|issue=1|pages=155–163|url=http://wixtedlab.ucsd.edu/publications/Psych%20272/Dube_Rotello_Heit_2011.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2016|doi=10.1037/a0021774|pmid=21244191|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study, Adrian P. Banks of the [[University of Surrey]] explained that “belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banks|first1=Adrian|title=The Influence of Activation Level on Belief Bias in Relational Reasoning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=September 4, 2009|doi=10.1111/cogs.12017|pmid=23294043|url=http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Banks-2013.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2016|volume=37|issue=3|pages=544–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle Colleen and Elizabeth Hilscher of the [[University of Toronto]] showed in 2014 that belief bias can be affected by the difficulty level and placement of the syllogism in question.&lt;ref name="Hilscher"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilscher|first1=Michelle|title=Attenuating Belief Bias Effects in Syllogistic Reasoning: The Role of Belief-Content Conflict|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/65668/6/Hilscher_Michelle_C_201406_PhD_thesis.pdf|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789.jpg|thumb|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789 is a fundamental document of the [[French Revolution]] and in the history of [[human rights]].]]
[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|Draft of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], also from 1789]]
A '''bill of rights''', sometimes called a '''declaration of rights''' or a '''charter of rights''', is a list of the most important [[rights]] to the citizens of a country. The purpose is to protect those rights against [[Civil and political rights|infringement from public officials and private citizens]]. 

Bills of rights may be ''[[Entrenched clause|entrenched]]'' or ''unentrenched''. An entrenched bill of rights cannot be amended or repealed by a country's legislature through regular procedure, instead requiring a supermajority or referendum; often it is part of a country's constitution, and therefore subject to special procedures applicable to constitutional amendments. A bill of rights that is ''not entrenched'' is a normal [[statute law]] and as such can be modified or repealed by the legislature at will. 

In practice, not every jurisdiction enforces the protection of the rights articulated in its bill of rights.

==History==

The history of legal [[charter]]s asserting certain  rights for particular groups goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. An example is [[Magna Carta]], an English legal charter agreed between the King and his barons in 1215.&lt;ref name=Rau2016&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rau|editor1-first=Zbigniew|editor2-last=Żurawski vel Grajewski|editor2-first=Przemysław|editor3-last=Tracz-Tryniecki|editor3-first=Marek|title=Magna Carta: A Central European Perspective of Our Common Heritage of Freedom|date=2016|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=1317278593|page=xvi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBHeCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR16&amp;pg=PR16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Britain in its history proposed many pioneering documents - not only Magna Carta, 1215 but those such as the Provisions of Oxford 1258, the Petition of Right 1628, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Claim of Right 1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early modern period]], there was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-10-16|postscript=none}}; {{Cite web|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th Century|website=The Society of Antiquaries of London|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English common law]] judge Sir [[Edward Coke]] revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed [[Rights of Englishmen|such rights]]. The [[Petition of Right 1628]], the [[Declaration of Right, 1689]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] established certain rights in statute.

In America, the English Bill of Rights was one of the influences on the 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights#Drafting and adoption|Virginia Declaration of Rights]], which in turn influenced the [[United States Declaration of Independence#Influences and legal status|United States Declaration of Independence]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Maier|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Maier|title=American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence|year=1997|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-45492-6|pages=126-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] asserted the universality of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OSDNl6Ydq_oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs78fI7vzYAhWJLsAKHdOID1kQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271040130}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in 1789 by France's [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], during the period of the [[French Revolution]].

After the [[Constitution of the United States]] was adopted in 1789, the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was ratified in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d52OVwT_6PYC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjixLyPsf_YAhWkBcAKHcrPDQIQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Great Rights of Mankind: A History of the American Bill of Rights|last=Schwartz|first=Bernard|date=1992|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780945612285|pages=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yyQXl4LmdAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjixLyPsf_YAhWkBcAKHcrPDQIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Bill of Rights and the States: The Colonial and Revolutionary Origins of American Liberties|last=Conley|first=Patrick T.|last2=States|first2=U.

The 20th century saw different groups draw on these earlier documents for influence when drafting the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hugh Starkey, Professor of Citizenship and Human Rights Education at UCL Institute of Education, London|title=Magna Carta and Human rights legislation|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/human-rights-legislation|publisher=British Library|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions in Western democracies==
The [[constitution of the United Kingdom]] remains uncodified,&lt;ref name=Rau2016/&gt; however the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">[[File:Bipolar cylindrical coordinates.png|thumb|350px|right|[[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|Coordinate surfaces]] of the bipolar cylindrical coordinates.  The yellow crescent corresponds to σ, whereas the red tube corresponds to τ and the blue plane corresponds to ''z''=1.  The three surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere).]]

'''Bipolar cylindrical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from projecting the two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] in the
perpendicular &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  The two lines of [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] 
&lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of the projected [[Apollonian circles]] are generally taken to be 
defined by &lt;math&gt;x=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, (and by &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

The term "bipolar" is often used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s.  However, the term ''bipolar coordinates'' is never used to describe coordinates associated with those curves, e.g., [[elliptic coordinates]].

==Basic definition==

The most common definition of bipolar cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = \ z
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
equals the angle &lt;math&gt;F_{1} P F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the 
&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; to the focal lines

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Recall that the focal lines &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;x=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) 

Surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; correspond to cylinders of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{2} +
\left( y - a \cot \sigma \right)^{2} = \frac{a^{2}}{\sin^{2} \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that all pass through the focal lines and are not concentric.  The surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting cylinders of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} +
\left( x - a \coth \tau \right)^{2} = \frac{a^{2}}{\sinh^{2} \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the focal lines but again are not concentric.  The focal lines and all these cylinders are parallel to the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis (the direction of projection).  In the &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; plane, the centers of the constant-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and constant-&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; cylinders lie on the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axes, respectively.
 
==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = h_{\tau} = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the remaining scale factor &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  
Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{a^{2}}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^{2}} d\sigma d\tau dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi =
\frac{1}{a^{2}} \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^{2}
\left( 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \sigma^{2}} + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \tau^{2}} 
\right) + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which bipolar coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]] (in 2D).  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding two 
parallel cylindrical conductors.

In algebra, given a category ''C'' with a [[cotriple]], the''' ''n''-th cotriple homology''' of an object ''X'' in ''C'' with coefficients in a functor ''E'' is the ''n''-th [[homotopy group]] of the ''E'' of the augmented simplicial object induced from ''X'' by the cotriple. The term "homology" is because in the abelian case, by the [[Dold–Kan correspondence]], the homotopy groups are the homology of the corresponding chain complex.

Example: Let ''N'' be a left module over a ring ''R'' and let &lt;math&gt;E=-\otimes_R N&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''F'' be the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of rings to '''Set'''; i.e., free module functor. Then &lt;math&gt;FU&lt;/math&gt; defines a cotriple and the ''n''-th cotriple homology of &lt;math&gt;E(FU_*M)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th left derived functor of ''E'' evaluated at ''M''; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}^R_n(M, N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Example ([[algebraic K-theory]]):&lt;ref&gt;Swan, [http://ac.els-cdn.com/0021869372900397/1-s2.0-0021869372900397-main.pdf?_tid=a5109660-9b5f-11e3-8b6d-00000aab0f6c&amp;acdnat=1393032264_0c56cefc529454ba14cae699413786ab Some relations between K-functors]&lt;/ref&gt; Let us write ''GL'' for the functor &lt;math&gt;R \mapsto \varinjlim_n GL_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;. As before, &lt;math&gt;FU&lt;/math&gt; defines a cotriple on the category of rings with ''F'' free ring functor and ''U'' forgetful. For a ring ''R'', one has:
:&lt;math&gt;K_n(R) = \pi_{n-2} GL(FU_* R), \, n \ge 3&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
where on the left is the ''n''-th ''K''-group of ''R''. This example is an instance of [[nonabelian homological algebra]].

'''Dakshina Kannada Rationalist Association''' ('''DKRA''') is a well known rationalist group based in [[Mangalore]], [[Karnataka]] which promotes [[scientific skepticism|skepticism]]. It was formed in 1976 at the initiative of a few individuals led by [[Narendra Nayak]]. DKRA, now a member of [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]], was initially formed to host the talk by [[Abraham Kovoor]], the eminent rationalist from [[Sri Lanka]] who was then touring [[India]] as part of his Miracle Exposure Campaign.&lt;ref name="TricksRevealed"&gt;{{cite news | last=Shenoy | first=Jaideep | url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/yw/2003/05/31/stories/2003053100110300.htm | title=Tricks revealed | newspaper=The Hindu | date=2003-05-31 | accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The DKRA attempts to oppose [[superstition]] and [[pseudoscience]] in India. Often in association with other rationalist organisations in India and abroad, the DKRA has led media and educational campaigns debunking the purportedly [[supernatural]] feats of [[Godman (Hindu ascetic)|godmen]].&lt;ref name="TricksRevealed"/&gt; The group critiques [[paranormal]] and pseudoscientific claims including [[psychic surgery]], inexhaustible oil lamps, materialization of holy ash, and [[pyrokinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shenoy | first=Jaideep | url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/06/21/stories/2004062102450300.htm | title=Gawd! You can do it too | newspaper=The Hindu | date=2004-06-21 | accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], the DKRA opposed a 2009 proposal to make yoga a compulsory subject for high school and primary school students in Mangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/01/10/stories/2009011058290300.htm | title=Move to introduce yoga education opposed | newspaper=The Hindu | date=2009-01-10 | accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As a technique, the deprogramming that has been practiced over the last half century has been typically commissioned by relatives, often parents of adult offspring, who objected to the subject's membership in an organization or group. It has been compared to exorcisms in both methodology and manifestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shupe | first1 = Anson D. | last2 = JR | first2 =  | last3 = Spielmann | first3 = Roger | last4 = Stigall | first4 = Sam | year = 1977 | title = Deprogramming: The New Exorcism | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 941–956 | doi = 10.1177/000276427702000609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process sometimes has been performed with tacit support of law enforcement and judicial officials.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David Melton, J. Gordon 2002. Cults, Religion, and Violence. West Nyack, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflex"/&gt;  In response to a burgeoning number of [[new religious movement]]s in the 1970s in the United States, the "father of deprogramming", [[Ted Patrick]], introduced many of these techniques to a wider audience as a means to combat cults.&lt;ref name="Chryssides"&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring New Religions|last=Chryssides|first=George|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1999|isbn=0-8264-5959-5|pages=346–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, G.D. and B.E. Zeller. 2014. The Bloomsbury Companion to New Religious Movements: BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, deprogrammings have been carried out "by the thousands".&lt;ref name="reflex"&gt;James T Richardson "Reflexivity and objectivity in the study of controversial new religions  Religion Vol. 21, Iss. 4, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various [[atrocity stories]] served as justification for deprogramming of [[Unification Church]] members in the USA.&lt;ref name="Kurtz2007"&gt;[[Lester R. Kurtz|Kurtz, Lester R.]] ''Gods in the Global Village: The World's Religions in Sociological Perspective'' 2007, Pine Forge Press, {{ISBN|1-4129-2715-3}}, page 228&lt;/ref&gt;

As a technique for encouraging people to disassociate with groups with whom they have as consenting adults chosen to associate, deprogramming is a controversial practice. Even some cult critics have denounced it on legal and ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Langone, Michael D., and Paul R. Martin. "Viewpoint: Deprogramming, Exit Counseling, and Ethics: Clarifying the Confusion." Christian Research Institute Journal (30 June 1994) [Winter 1993]: page 46 (Retrieved 26 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar actions, when done without force, have been referred to as "[[exit counseling]]". 
Sometimes the word ''deprogramming'' is used in a wider (and/or ironic or humorous sense), to mean the freeing of someone (often oneself) from any previously uncritically assimilated [[idea]]. According to [[Carol Giambalvo]], "exit cousellors are usually former cult members themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giambalvo |first=Carol |year= 1992 |title= Exit Counseling: A Family Intervention |url= |location= |publisher= [[American Family Foundation]] |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academics have commented on the practice. For example, as defined by James T. Richardson, [[UNLV]] Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies and Director of the Grant Sawyer Center for Justice Studies, deprogramming is a "private, self-help process whereby participants in unpopular new religious movements (NRMs) were forcibly removed from the group, incarcerated, and put through radical resocialization processes that were supposed to result in their agreeing to leave the group."&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = James T | year = 2011 | title = Deprogramming: from private self-help to governmental organized repression | url = | journal = Crime, Law and Social Change | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 321–336 | doi=10.1007/s10611-011-9286-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law professor [[Douglas Laycock]], author of ''Religious Liberty: The free exercise clause'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beginning in the 1970s, many parents responded to the initial conversion with "deprogramming." The essence of deprogramming was to physically abduct the convert, isolate him and physically restrain him, and barrage him with continuous arguments and attacks against his new religion, threatening to hold him forever until he agreed to leave it.&lt;ref&gt;Laycock, D. 2011. ''Religious Liberty: The free exercise clause''. W.B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiwxUad97IC.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lawyer John LeMoult, writing in a law review journal, described such practices as the person subject to deprogramming being "seized, held against his will, subjected to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his beliefs", and compared this power to that of Nazis over their prisoners.&lt;ref name="holywars"/&gt; Legal scholar [[Dean M. Kelley]] called deprogramming "protracted spiritual gang-rape".&lt;ref&gt;Dean Kelley, "Deprogramming and Religious Liberty", ''Civil Liberties Review'' 23 (July/August 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedures ==
There has never been a standard procedure among deprogrammers; descriptions in anecdotal reports, studies, and interviews with former deprogrammers vary greatly. Deprogrammers generally operate on the presumption that the people they are paid to extract from religious organizations are victims of [[mind control]] (or [[brainwashing]]). Books written by deprogrammers and [[exit counseling|exit counselor]]s say that the most essential part of freeing the mind of a person is to convince the subject that he or she had been under the mental control of others.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Ted Patrick]], one of the pioneers of deprogramming, used a confrontational method, enlisting psychiatrists and psychologists to assist him in the deprogramming process.&lt;ref name="holywars"&gt;24 T. Marshall L. Rev. 359 (1998-1999) Holy Wars: Involuntary Deprogramming as a Weapon against Cults; McAllister, Shawn&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick was tried and convicted of multiple felonies related to kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of deprogramming subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Polly J. Regulation of religious proselytism in the United States. ''Brigham Young University Law Review''. 2001 537-574.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvia Buford, an associate of Ted Patrick who has assisted him on many deprogrammings, described five stages of deprogramming:&lt;ref name="All Gods Children"&gt;(Stoner, C., &amp; Parke, J. (1977). [[All Gods Children (book)|All God's children: The cult experience - salvation or slavery?]] Radrior, PA: Chilton )&lt;/ref&gt;
#Discredit the figure of authority: the cult leader
#Present contradictions (ideology versus reality): "How can he preach love when he exploits people?" is an example.
#The breaking point: When a subject begins to listen to the deprogrammer; when reality begins to take precedence over ideology.
#Self-expression: When the subject begins to open up and voice gripes against the cult.
#Identification and transference: when the subject begins to identify with the deprogrammers, starts to think as an opponent of the cult rather than as a member.

=== Violence ===
The deprogramming accounts vary widely regarding the use of force, with the most dramatic accounts coming from deprogrammed people who returned to the group.

[[Steven Hassan]] in his book ''Releasing the Bonds'' spoke against coercive deprogramming methods using force or threats.

The deprogramming case observed by Dubrow-Eichel did not include any violence.

Sociologist [[Eileen Barker]] wrote in Watching for Violence:

{{quote|Although deprogramming has become less violent in the course of time ... Numerous testimonies by those who were subjected to a deprogramming describe how they were threatened with a gun, beaten, denied sleep and food and/or sexually assaulted. But one does not have to rely on the victims for stories of violence: [[Ted Patrick]], one of the most notorious deprogrammers used by CAGs (who has spent several terms in prison for his exploits) openly boasts about some of the violence he employed; in November 1987, [[Cyril Vosper]], a Committee member of the British cult-awareness group, [[Family Action Information Resource|FAIR]], was convicted in Munich of "causing bodily harm" in the course of one of his many deprogramming attempts; and a number of similar convictions are on record for prominent members of CAGs elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Colombrito vs. Kelly'', the Court accepted the definition of deprogramming by J. Le Moult published in 1978 in the Fordham Law Review:

{{quote|Deprogrammers are people who, at the request of a parent or other close relative, will have a member of a religious sect seized, then hold him against his will and subject him to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his religious beliefs. Deprogrammers usually work for a fee, which may easily run as high as $25,000.

The deprogramming process begins with abduction. Often strong men muscle the subject into a car and take him to a place where he is cut off from everyone but his captors. He may be held against his will for upward of three weeks. Frequently, however, the initial deprogramming only last a few days. The subject's sleep is limited and he is told that he will not be released until his beliefs meet his captors' approval. Members of the deprogramming group, as well as members of the family, come into the room where the victim is held and barrage him with questions and denunciations until he recants his newly found religious beliefs.}}

Deprogrammer [[Carol Giambalvo]] writes in the 1998 text "Deprogramming to Thought Reform Consultation":

{{quote|It was believed that the hold of the brainwashing over the cognitive processes of a cult member needed to be broken – or "snapped" as some termed it – by means that would shock or frighten the cultist into thinking again. For that reason in some cases cult leader's pictures were burned or there were highly confrontational interactions between deprogrammers and cultist. What was often sought was an emotional response to the information, the shock, the fear, and the confrontation. There are horror stories – promoted most vehemently by the cults themselves – about restraint, beatings, and even rape. And we have to admit that we have met former members who have related to us their deprogramming experience – several of handcuffs, weapons wielded and sexual abuse. But thankfully, these are in the minority – and in our minds, never justified. Nevertheless, deprogramming helped to free many individuals held captive to destructive cults at a time when other alternatives did not seem viable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giambalvo, Carol]] (November 1998).

==Effectiveness and harm==
Alan W. Gomes (chairman of the department of theology at Talbot School of Theology, [[Biola University]]) in his 2009 book ''Unmasking the Cults'' reports:
  
{{quote|While advocates of the deprogramming position have claimed high rates of success, studies show that natural attrition rates actually are higher than the success rate achieved through deprogramming.&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, Alan W., ''Unmasking the Cults'',
Zondervan Guide to Cults and Religious Movements, [[Zondervan]], 2009
{{ISBN|0-310-86455-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-310-86455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Dialog Center International]] (DCI) a major [[Christian countercult movement|Christian counter-cult]] organization founded in 1973 by a [[Denmark|Danish]] professor of [[missiology]] and [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] [[theology]], Dr. [[Johannes Aagaard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2007/aagaard.htm Obituary, 23 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; rejects deprogramming, believing that it is counterproductive, ineffective, and can harm the relationship between a cult member and concerned family members.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions'', [[George D. Chryssides]], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8264-5959-5}},  {{ISBN|978-0-8264-5959-6}}, pages 353-254&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of psychiatry Saul Levine suggests that it is doubtful that deprogramming helps many people and goes on to say that it actually causes harm to the victim by very nature of the deprogramming. For deprogramming to work, the victim must be convinced that they joined a religious group against their will. They then must renounce responsibility and accept that in some mysterious way that their minds were controlled.&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 =  | year = 1979 | title = The Role of Psychiatry in the Phenomenon of Cults | url = | journal = Canada Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 24 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Levine's professional opinion that once deprogrammed, a person would never be certain that they were really doing what they want. He states that deprogramming destroys a person's identity and is likely to create permanent anxiety about freedom of choice and leave the deprogrammed subject dependent upon the guidance and advice of others. "Fundamentally deprogramming denies choice and creates dependency.  It robs people of their sense of responsibility.  Instead of encouraging people to accept that they made a mistake, it encourages people to deny their actions and blame others."&lt;ref name="levine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Cults and New Age Religions, by Irving Hexham, Karla Poewe, and J. I. Packer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

Deprogramming activities often fall outside of the law. Government agencies have at times been aware and have taken part in deprogramming to enforce official views of "correct" beliefs and behaviors.&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;  This can involve "vigorous, even violent, efforts to dissuade people from participating in groups deemed unacceptable to the government" and have been "given legal sanction by the passage of laws that make illegal the activities or even the beliefs
of the unpopular movement or group being targeted".&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;

==Controversy and related issues==
{{See also|Mind control#Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement|l1=Mind control: Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement}}

In the United States, from the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s [[mind control]] was a widely accepted theory in public opinion, and the vast majority of [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits' relatives were well justified to seek [[conservatorship]]s and to hire deprogrammers. It took nearly 20 years for public opinion to shift.&lt;ref name=Rusher/&gt;

One aspect that gradually became disturbing from a civil rights point of view, was that relatives would use deception or other ethically questionable methods—even kidnapping—to get the recruit into deprogrammers' hands, without allowing the person any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing. Previously, there would be a sanity hearing first, and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy. But with deprogramming, judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearing.

One of main objections raised to deprogramming (as well as to [[exit counseling]]) is the contention that they begin with a [[false premise]]. Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming, as well as some [[civil libertarian]]s, [[sociologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s, argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate people.

[[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]] and [[Anson Shupe]] wrote:
{{Quote|Deprogrammers are like [[Witchcraft#Colonial_North_America|the American colonials who persecuted "witches"]]: a confession, drawn up before the suspect was brought in for torturing and based on the judges' fantasies about witchcraft, was signed under duress and then treated as justification for the torture.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David G., and Shupe, Anson D., Jr. (1981) Strange Gods, The Great American Cult Scare. Boston: Beacon (pp. 198-204)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of factors contributed to the cessation of deprogramming:

Some of the deprogrammed adults sued the deprogrammers or the relatives who had hired them.  Also in 1987, psychologist [[Margaret Singer]] became unusable as an [[expert witness]] after the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) rejected her [[APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control|''Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control'']] (DIMPAC) report.&lt;ref name=APA_memo&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gmcjPkrGTQ8C&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;ots=335cDzpa_5&amp;dq=%22May%2011%2C%201987%22%20dimpac&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q=%22May%2011,%201987%22%20dimpac&amp;f=false May 11, 1987, APA MEMORANDUM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] published a statement in 1977 which said:
{{quote|ACLU opposes the use of mental incompetency proceedings, temporary conservatorship, or denial of government protection as a method of depriving people of the free exercise of religion, at least with respect to people who have reached the age of majority. Mode of religious proselytizing or persuasion for a continued adherence that do not employ physical coercion or threat of same are protected by the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment against action of state laws or by state officials. The claim of free exercise may not be overcome by the contention that 'brainwashing' or 'mind control' has been used, in the absence of evidence that the above standards have been violated.}}

In the 1980s in the United States, namely in [[New York (state)|New York]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1981), [[Kansas]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1982), and [[Nebraska]] (conservatorship legislation for 1985), lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted to legalize involuntary deprogramming.

Rev. [[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church]] (many of whose members were targets of deprogramming) issued this statement in 1983:

{{quote|The methods involved in "deprogramming" are like those used in Communist concentration camps. Using parents and relatives to entrap members, "deprogrammers" commit grown adults to mental hospitals with the supposed "illness" of holding of a minority religious belief. Other typical deprogramming techniques include kidnapping, illegal detention, violence, psychological harassment, [[sleep deprivation]], inducement to use alcohol and drugs, sexual seduction and rape. By such threats, harassment and manipulation, professional "deprogrammers" force members to renounce their faith. Many people are injured physically and psychologically because of this criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.net/1983/831125.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1990s, deprogrammer [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]] was sued by [[Jason Scott case|Jason Scott]], a former member of a Pentecostal group called the Life Tabernacle Church, after an unsuccessful deprogramming attempt. In 1995, the jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $2,500,000 in punitive damages against Ross, which were later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services. More significantly, the jury also found that the leading anti-cult group known as the [[Cult Awareness Network]] was a co-conspirator in the crime and fined CAN $1,000,000 in punitive damages, forcing the group into [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2001/CAN/02/01.htm Scott vs. Ross, Workman, Simpson.] Retrieved May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This case is often seen as effectively closing the door on the practice of involuntary deprogramming in the United States.&lt;ref name="holywars"/&gt;

==Referral and kickback system==
Anti-cult groups play a central role in maintaining the underground network of communications, referrals, transportation, and housing necessary for continued deprogramming.&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, D. and B. Hankins. 2003. New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America: Baylor University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as the [[Cult Awareness Network]] operated a referral scheme ([[Cult Awareness Network#NARDEC|NARDEC]]) in which they would refer people to deprogrammers in return for a 'kickback' in the form of a donation or as a commission.&lt;ref name="shupe2011"&gt;Shupe, A. and S.E. Darnell. 2011.

==Victims==
In 1974, Kathy Crampton, whose abduction and deprogramming were televised across the US, went back to the [[Love Family]] group several days after her apparently successful deprogramming. Patrick was charged with kidnapping, but acquitted with the reasoning: "[w]here parents are, as here, of the reasonable and intelligent belief that they were not physically capable of recapturing their daughter from existing, imminent danger, then the defense of necessity transfers or transposes to the constituted agent, the person who acts upon their belief under such conditions. Here that agent is the Defendant [[Ted Patrick]]." ''(District Court of the United States 1974: 79; New York Times 1974).''

In 1980, Susan Wirth, a 35-year-old teacher living in San Francisco, was abducted by her parents to be deprogrammed in reaction to her leftist political views and activities.&lt;ref name=Rusher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Daughter kidnapped over politics|date = July 2, 1980|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19800702&amp;id=Q6wiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GLIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1677,212672|newspaper = [[Beaver County Times]]|accessdate = November 14, 2013|agency = [[Associated Press]]|page = A-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patrick was paid $27,000 to carry out the deprogramming, which involved handcuffing her to a bed for two weeks and denying her food.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Garrard Postpage, ''Inquiries in bioethics'', 1993, Georgetwon University Press, {{ISBN|0-87840-538-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87840-538-1}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt;  She was later released and after returning to San Francisco spoke out against deprogramming but declined to press legal charges against her parents.&lt;ref&gt;"Feared kidnapped, she reconciles with mother", ''[[Merced Sun-Star]]'', July 29, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Patrick was convicted of conspiracy, kidnapping, and [[false imprisonment]] for abducting and attempting to deprogram Roberta McElfish, a 26-year-old Tucson waitress.&lt;ref name="nyt-08301980" /&gt; Patrick was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $5,000.&lt;ref name="nyt-09271980"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Patrick is sentenced in seizure of cult member|date=1980-09-27|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Stephanie Riethmiller, who lived in Ohio, was kidnapped by deprogrammers hired by her parents to end her lesbian relationship. She was held against her will and repeatedly raped. After her release she filed civil charges against her parents and the deprogrammers, which were dismissed in a trial that generated some controversy in the media.&lt;ref name=Rusher&gt;{{cite news|last=Rusher|first=William A.|title=Deprogramming A Disgrace To Free Society|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19830528&amp;id=0KQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LNYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4176,5893764|accessdate=14 November 2013|newspaper=Gadsden Times|date=28 May 1983|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Violence Against Lesbians and Gay Men'',

In 1990, Patrick attempted to deprogram Elma Miller, an [[Amish]] woman who had joined a liberal sect. He was hired by her husband to return her to him and the Amish church. Criminal charges of conspiracy were filed against Miller's husband, brother, and two others but were later dropped on her request to the prosecuting attorney.&lt;ref&gt;''Amish Woman Charges Deprogramming'', ''[[Pittsburg Press]]'', November 30, 1990, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Amish Woman Asks Prosecutor to Drop Charges on Kidnapping'', [[Madison Courier]]'', December 8, 1990, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]], a noted cult intervention advocate who took part in a number of deprogramming sessions, was sued by [[Jason Scott case|Jason Scott]], a former member of a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalist]] group called the Life Tabernacle Church (part of [[United Pentecostal Church International]]), after an unsuccessful coercive deprogramming.&lt;ref name=Shupe180-184 /&gt; The jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages against the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN), and $2,500,000 against Ross (later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services "as an expert consultant and intervention specialist").&lt;ref name=Shupe180-184&gt;{{cite book

==Exit counseling==
Deprogramming and exit counseling, sometimes seen as one and the same, are distinct approaches to convincing a person to leave a cult.{{explain|date=September 2018}}

Proponents of the distinction, however, state that deprogramming entails coercion and confinement, while exit counseling assures the subject of the freedom to leave at any time. Deprogramming typically costs $10,000 or more, mainly because of the expense of a security team. Exit counseling typically costs $2,000 to $4,000, including expenses, for a three- to five-day intervention, although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more (estimated in 1993). Deprogramming, especially when it fails, entails considerable legal and psychological risk (for example, a permanent alienation of the subject from his or her family). The psychological and legal risks in exit counseling are significantly reduced. Although deprogrammers do prepare families for the process, exit counselors tend to work with them directly, expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute more to the process; that is, exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin. Because deprogramming relies on coercion, which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical, deprogrammers' critiques of the unethical practices of cults tend to be less credibility to the subject than the arguments of exit counselors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0121a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Hassan]], author of the book ''[[Combatting Cult Mind Control]]'', states that he took part in a number of deprogrammings in the late 1970s, and has spoken out against them since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomofmind.com/stevehassan/refuting/ Refuting the Disinformation Attacks Put Forth by Destructive Cults and their Agents], by Steven Hassan&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan states that he has not participated in any deprogrammings since then, although on page 114 of ''Combatting'', Hassan states that deprogrammings should be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail to transform the individual. Hassan is one of the major proponents of exit counseling as a form of intercession, and he refers to his method as "strategic intervention therapy".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">The '''driver scheduling problem''' (DSP) is type of problem in [[operations research]] and [[theoretical computer science]].

The DSP consists of selecting a set of duties (assignments) for the drivers or pilots of vehicles (e.g., buses, trains, boats, or planes) involved in the transportation of passengers or goods.&lt;ref name="VoßDaduna2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voß|first1=Stefan|last2=Daduna|first2=Joachim R.|title=Computer Aided Scheduling of Public Transport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsvzwUiUBIsC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540422433|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salvendy2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salvendy|first=Gavriel|title=Handbook of Industrial Engineering: Technology and Operations Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjY3IZ9Unv0C&amp;pg=PA813|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2001-05-25|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471330578|pages=813–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This very complex problem involves several constraints related to labour and company rules and also different evaluation criteria and objectives. Being able to solve this problem efficiently can have a great impact on costs and quality of service for public transportation companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borndörfer|first=Ralf|author2=Martin Grötschel | author2-link = Martin Grötschel |author3=Marc E. Pfetsch |title=Public transport to the fORe|journal=OR/MS Today|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2|pages=30–40|url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-4-06/frtransport.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large number of different rules that a feasible duty might be required to satisfy, such as
*Minimum and maximum stretch duration
*Minimum and maximum break duration
*Minimum and maximum work duration
*Minimum and maximum total duration
*Maximum extra work duration
*Maximum number of vehicle changes
*Minimum driving duration of a particular vehicle
[[Operations research]] has provided [[optimization]] models and [[algorithm]]s that lead to efficient solutions for this problem. Among the most common models proposed to solve the DSP are the [[Set covering|Set Covering]] and Set Partitioning Models (SPP/SCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lourenço|first=H.R. |author2=Paixão, J.P. |author3=Portugal, R.|title=Driver Scheduling Problem Modelling|journal=Public Transport: Planning and Operations|year=2009|volume=1|issue=2|pages=103–120|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12469-008-0007-0|doi=10.1007/s12469-008-0007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lourenço|first=H.R. |author2=Paixão, J.P. |author3=Portugal, R.|title=The crew-scheduling module in the GIST system|journal=Economic Working Papers Series, Department of Economics and Business, Universitat Pompeu Fabra|year=2001|volume=547|url=http://www.econ.upf.edu/en/research/onepaper.php?id=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the SPP model, each work piece (task) is covered by only one duty. In the SCP model, it is possible to have more than one duty covering a given work piece.
In both models, the set of work pieces that needs to be covered is laid out in rows, and the set of previously defined feasible duties available for covering specific work pieces is arranged in columns. The DSP resolution, based on either of these models, is the selection of the set of feasible duties that guarantees that there is one (SPP) or more (SCP) duties covering each work piece while minimizing the total cost of the final schedule.

An '''equitable right''' is a [[legal right]] guaranteed by [[Equity (law)|equity]] as opposed to a legal right which derives authority from a legal source. An example of an equitable right could be seen in [[Land law]], where mention is made of a beneficial interest i.e. vested interests in an estate which are protected by equity. In essence, a contributor to the purchase of a [[property]], has an equitable right to that property albeit not being the registered proprietor.

The German '''''{{Lang|de|Fach}}''''' '''system''' ({{IPA-de|fax}}; literally "compartment" or "subject of study", here in the sense of "vocal specialization") is a method of classifying singers, primarily [[opera]] singers, according to the [[Vocal range|range]], [[Vocal weight|weight]], and [[tone color|color]] of their voices. It is used worldwide, but primarily in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries and by [[Repertory theatre|repertory]] opera houses.

The ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' system is a convenience for singers and opera houses. It prevents singers from being asked to sing roles which they are incapable of performing. Opera companies keep lists of available singers by ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' so that when they are casting roles for an upcoming production, they do not inadvertently contact performers who would be inappropriate for the part.

Below is a list of ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}'' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɛçɐ}}), their ranges as written on [[sheet music]], and roles generally considered appropriate to each. When two names for the ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' are given, the first is in more common use today. Where possible, an English and/or Italian equivalent of each ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' is listed; however, not all ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}'' have ready English or Italian equivalents. Note that some roles can be sung by more than one ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' and that many singers do not easily fit into a ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'': for instance some sopranos may sing both ''{{Lang|de|Koloratursopran}}'' and ''{{Lang|de|Dramatischer Koloratursopran}}'' roles. In addition, roles traditionally more difficult to cast may be given to a voice other than the traditional ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}''. For instance, the "[[The Magic Flute|Queen of the Night]]" is more traditionally a dramatic [[coloratura]] role, but it is difficult to find a dramatic coloratura to sing it (particularly given the extreme range). Therefore, the role is often sung by a lyric coloratura.

=== {{Lang|de|Lyrischer Koloratursopran / Koloratursoubrette}} ===
[[File:Soprano C to F.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[coloratura soprano]] or [[Coloratura soprano#Lyric coloratura soprano|lyric coloratura soprano]]
* Range: From about middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to the F two-and-a-half octaves above middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Usually (but not always) a light soprano who has a high voice. Can often have small voices lacking the richness and resonance of a dramatic soprano. Must be able to do fast acrobatics with easy high notes. Many have extremely high ranges (with notes above the F of the "[[Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Queen of the Night]]"), but there are also singers in this ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' who do not regularly sing higher than the high E{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Roles:
** Adina, ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' ([[Gaetano Donizetti]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=899}}
** Aminta, ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' ([[Richard Strauss]]){{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== {{Lang|de|Dramatischer Koloratursopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano C to F.svg|right|200px]]
*English equivalent: [[Coloratura soprano#Dramatic coloratura soprano|Dramatic coloratura soprano]]
*Range: From about middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to the F two and a half octaves above middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
*Description: The same as above, only with a more dramatic, rich voice. Often heavier and more lyrical than a coloratura soprano. Must also be able to do fast vocal acrobatics and reach high notes, such as the F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; of the "[[Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Queen of the Night]]".
*Roles:
**Abigalle, ''[[Nabucco]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Donna Anna, ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Elvira, ''[[I puritani]]'' (Vincenzo Bellini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Fiordiligi, ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
** Gilda, ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Konstanze, ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}

**The Queen of the Night, ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Violetta, ''[[La traviata]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
One must not mistake the Mozartian dramatic coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and are most often sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.

=== {{Lang|de|Deutsche Soubrette / Charaktersopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano C to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[Soubrette]]
* Range: From about [[middle C]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: A beautiful, sweet light lyric voice usually capable of executing florid passages similarly to that of a coloratura. The range is usually intermediate between that of a coloratura and lyric soprano. Most sopranos start out as soubrettes, changing fach as the voice matures.
* Roles:
** Barbarina, ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=899}}
** Papagena, ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=899}}

[[File:Soprano B to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[Lyric soprano#Full lyric soprano|lyric soprano]]
* Range: From about B below middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: A more supple soprano, capable of [[legato]], [[portamento]], and some agility; generally has a more soulful and sensuous quality than a soubrette, who tends to be largely flirtatious and somewhat tweety. The voice is very common; thus the purity and character of the basic timbre is essential. It is the "basic" soprano voice which is at neither extremes of the soprano range of voices; it is not known for having particular vocal attributes such as power, stamina, technical prowess, or agility. However, there are several lyric sopranos that possess a quantity of many of these vocal attributes, thus allowing them to sing a broader variety of roles. Nevertheless, the core of the true fundamentally lyric voice does not encompass such traits. Innocence, vulnerability and pathos are usually conveyed in the music written for the characters portrayed by the lyric soprano because of this endearing simplicity. This fach is also famous because the voices usually remain especially fresh until advanced age.
* Roles:
** Gretel, ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' ([[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}

=== {{Lang|de|Jugendlich dramatischer Sopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano A to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[spinto soprano|lyric dramatic soprano]]
* Range: From about A below middle C (A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: The Italian version of this fach is the ''[[spinto]]'', which literally translated means pushed. However this is not accurate in terms of these singers' vocal production. A lyric dramatic soprano has a lyric instrument that can also create big sounds, cutting through an orchestral or choral climax. This voice is sometimes referred to as a "young" or "youthful" dramatic soprano although this term doesn't necessarily refer to the singer's age but rather to the tonal quality of the voice. This fach is more clearly delineated in the German system than in the American system. Depending on the singer, however, this voice type can be versatile, as it lies at neither extreme of the soprano spectrum. Spintos are occasionally able to take on lighter mezzo roles, or, conversely, lyric and even coloratura roles.
* Roles:
** Agathe, ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' ([[Carl Maria von Weber]]){{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== {{Lang|de|Dramatischer Sopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano A to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[dramatic soprano|full dramatic soprano]]
* Range: From about the A below middle C (A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Characterized by their rich, full sounding voices, dramatic sopranos are expected to project across large orchestras, a feat that requires a powerful sound. Dramatic sopranos are not expected to have the vocal flexibility of the lighter ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}''. Although most dramatic sopranos have a darker, more robust quality to the voice, there are some that possess a lighter lyrical tone. In these instances, however, the substantial amount of volume and endurance normally associated with the dramatic soprano voice is still present. The darker voiced dramatic soprano may even make a foray into the dramatic mezzo-soprano territory with great success.
* Roles:
** Ariadne, ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' ([[Richard Strauss]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Cassandre, ''[[Les Troyens]]'' ([[Hector Berlioz]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Leonore, ''[[Fidelio]]'' ([[Ludwig van Beethoven]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Marschallin, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' ([[Richard Strauss]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Minnie, ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' (Giacomo Puccini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Salome, ''[[Salome (opera)| Salome]]'' (Richard Strauss)
** Santuzza, ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' ([[Pietro Mascagni]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Tosca, ''[[Tosca]]'' (Giacomo Puccini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}

Two roles mentioned above, Salome and the Marschallin, are relatively high dramatic sopranos and require that the soprano can endure long stretches of very high tessitura. Richard Strauss himself said that Salome should be sung by someone with the flexibility of a dramatic coloratura due to the high tessitura.

=== {{Lang|de|Hochdramatischer Sopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano F to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[dramatic soprano|High dramatic soprano]]
* Range: From about the F below middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: A voice capable of answering the demands of operas of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s maturity. The voice is substantial, very powerful, and even throughout the registers. It is immense, stentorian and even larger than the voice of the "normal" dramatic soprano. Although the two voices are comparable and are sometimes hard to distinguish between, this voice has even greater stamina, endurance and volume than the former. The top register is very strong, clarion and bright. Successful ''{{Lang|de|hochdramatische}}'' are rare.

== [[Mezzo-soprano]] and [[Contralto]] ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}'' ==

=== {{Lang|de|Koloratur-Mezzosopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano G to B.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[Mezzo-soprano#Coloratura|coloratura mezzo-soprano]]
* Range: From about the G below middle C (G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the B two octaves above middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Found especially in [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s operas, these roles were written originally for altos with agility and secure top notes. Today they are often played by mezzo-sopranos and sometimes even by sopranos. At times a lyric or full [[lyric soprano]] with a flexible voice will assume the roles as written while a true coloratura soprano will sing the same music transposed  to a higher key.
* Roles:
** Angelina, ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' (Gioachino Rossini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Isabella, ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' (Gioachino Rossini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Rosina, ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' ([[Gioachino Rossini]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}

* Range: From about the G below middle C (G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the B two octaves above middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* English equivalent: [[mezzo-soprano#Lyric|lyric mezzo-soprano]]
* Description: A lyric soprano's instrument in a lower range; the resulting sound is less piercing, more lachrymose and rather sensitive. The voices are similar, giving rise to the term 'short soprano' i.e. a soprano without the highest notes. In fact, many lyric mezzos with strong extensions to their upper vocal registers make the transition to singing as sopranos at some point in their careers.
* Roles:
** Cherubino, ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}

* Range: From about the G below middle C (G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the B two octaves above middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Dramatic mezzo-sopranos have ranges very similar to a dramatic soprano. The main difference is the endurance and ease in which the two voice-types sing – a mezzo will concentrate singing most of the time in her middle and low registers and will go up to notes like high B-flat only at the dramatic climax. Consequently, many dramatic mezzo-sopranos have success in singing some dramatic soprano roles that are written with a lower [[tessitura]].
* Roles:

* Range: From about the F below middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the G or A two octaves above (G–A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Stylistically similar to the dramatic mezzo, just lower. Sings usually around the break between the chest voice and middle voice. Many mezzos tried their luck in these roles, yet real altos fare better. A deep, penetrating low female voice. This is a very rare voice type with a darker, richer sound than that of a typical alto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14785">'''Fear-potentiated startle (FPS)''' is a reflexive physiological reaction to a presented stimulus, and is an indicator of the fear reaction in an organism. The FPS response can be elicited in the face of any threatening stimulus (e.g., any object, person or situation that would cause someone to experience feelings of fear), but it can also be elicited by a neutral stimulus as a result of [[fear conditioning]], a process that occurs when a benign stimulus comes to evoke [[fear]] and [[anxiety]] upon being paired with a traumatic or fear-provoking event. The stimulus in question is usually of auditory (e.g., loud noise) or visual (e.g., bright light) nature, and startle response measures include eyeblink rates and [[pulse]]/[[heart rate]].&lt;ref name="Grillon"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grillon, C. |author2= Davis, M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Fear-potentiated startle conditioning in humans: Explicit and contextual cue conditioning following paired versus unpaired training |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=34 |pages=451–458|year=1997 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1997.tb02389.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative impact of heightened FPS in the face of neutral stimuli can be treated pharmacologically, using psychotropic medications that are typically used to reduce [[anxiety]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davis, M. |author2=Falls, W.

==Neurobiology of FPS==

The central brain structure through which fear-associated responses are mediated has been determined to be the [[amygdala]], which is located in the brain’s [[temporal lobe]]. When the central nucleus of the amygdala is stimulated - what is popularly referred to as the “[[fight-or-flight]]” response is activated - the organism in question reacts passively (is rendered frozen in its tracks, becomes hyper-vigilantly attentive, etc.), or displays a physiological reaction geared toward facilitating an aggressive reaction (e.g., increased heart-rate/pulse, rapid breathing). These fear-induced reactions result from communication between the amygdala and a variety of other brain regions (such as the [[brain stem]] and [[hypothalamus]]), resulting in a variety of physiological responses in the organism. For instance, communication between an activated amygdala and the lateral hypothalamus results in increased [[blood pressure]] and dilation of the pupils; the initiation of the [[central grey]] via communication from the amygdala results in the organism's becoming frozen in its tracks; communication between the activated amygdala and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus releases hormones associated with [[stress (biology)]].&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lang, P. J. |author2=Davis, M. |author3= Ohman, A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Fear and Anxiety: Animal Models and Human Cognitive Psychophysiology |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=61 |pages=137–159|year=2000 |doi=10.1016/s0165-0327(00)00343-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature has linked the FPS response to interplay between the central nucleus of the amgydala and both the central grey and nucleus reticular pontis caudalis. Insult (e.g., [[traumatic brain injury]]) to these brain areas inhibits any display of FPS response in humans. In addition, a distinction has been made concerning neural activity of the reflexive FPS response, and that which occurs in the face of exposure to a fear-inducing stimulus over a long period of time, such as [[abuse]] or [[combat]] or to a place or situation. Literature suggests that, in such situations, FPS is caused by activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminals.&lt;ref name="V"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vaidyanathan, U. |author2=Patrick, C.

==Measuring the Startle Response and Utilization of FPS Data==

The most common physiological response measured to gauge FPS response in humans is eyeblink, or the reflexive act of blinking. Currently, the most widely accepted/used means with which to measure the eyeblink reflex is by using a technology called electromyographic recording ([[Electromyography|EMG]]). EMG provides eyeblink rate data by measuring and recording activity of the eyelid muscles using two electrodes. In order to obtain an optimal reading, the person’s skin must be cleaned, dried, and covered with a thin layer of electrode gel in only the spots where the measures will be taken; one electrode is placed in the center of the person’s forehead above the nose, and two recording electrodes are placed directly underneath the eye, approximately two centimeters apart. The participant should be looking forward for the duration of data collection. If noises are used as the catalyst for the FPS response in a study (acoustic startle), the volume must be both controlled and reported, as noises around 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz can compromise the accuracy of the recordings taken by the EMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blumenthal, T. D. |author2=Cuthbert, B. N. |author3=Filion, D. L. |author4=Hackley, S. |author5=Lipp, O. V. |author6= Van Boxtel, A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Committee report: Guidelines for Human Startle Eyeblink Electromyographic Studies |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=1–15|year=2005 |pmid=15720576 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2005.00271.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically measuring FPS response in studies of fear is highly practical, as the experimental and baseline measures of an individual’s startle response can be partitioned, and [[variance]] in startle can, in turn, be attributed to fear (or lack thereof, in the case that extinction of fear is variable of interest), allowing illusory correlates (other variables that can also appear to cause an effect on our variable of interest) to be ruled out.&lt;ref name="Lang" /&gt; There are several experimental climates that can be used to examine the FPS response. Eyeblink FPS response is typically gauged by presenting participants with pleasant and unpleasant (as well as neutral) emotionally evocative stimuli, paired with a loud noise or a flash of bright lights. The presented stimuli can be replaced by having participants imagine emotionally evocative stimuli of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral natures. FPS response is typically most exaggerated in response to emotionally unpleasant stimuli, followed by pleasant and then neutral stimuli, in members of the general population.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;

In addition, FPS response in research concerning fear conditioning (and extinction of a conditioned aversion to a previously neutral stimulus) is also commonly examined; such studies will present noise or light startle probes with unpleasant stimuli to condition the FPS to occur in the presence of that stimuli. Measurements of FPS response in response to both the conditioned stimuli and the neutral stimuli (in the absence of light or sound probes) are then taken,&lt;ref name="V" /&gt; with the measured difference in the size of startle response being the variable of interest, as this difference score indicates alteration of naturally occurring and conditioned FPS response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Filion, D. L. |author2=Dawson, M. E. |author3= Schell, A. M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=The Psychological Significance of Human Startle Eyeblink Modification: A Review |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=1–43|year=1998 |pmid=9505132 |doi=10.1016/s0301-0511(97)00020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting data from such studies can be used to examine both FPS response in light of conditioned fear, and an individual’s ability to break the conditioned fear reactions (extinction).

==FPS and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder==

A heightened (or abnormally overactive) startle response in the face of benign stimuli/settings is often seen in individuals suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pole, N. |author2=Neylan, T. C. |author3=Best, S. R. |author4=Orr, S. P. |author5= Marmar, C.

Heightened FPS response has also been implicated in the following disorders, falling under the current DSM-IV-TR classification of anxiety disorders: [[phobia]] (social and specific) and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. On the converse, mood disorders such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] have been shown to cause weakened FPS responses in diagnosed individuals.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;

==Treatment options==

As exaggerated FPS responses can lend to the pathology associated with PTSD and other disorders of the anxiety disorder classification, decreasing the startle response in humans may be of benefit in the treatment of these psychological disorders. Several forms of medication acting on different neurotransmitters (e.g., [[GABA]], [[dopamine]]) in the brain have been shown to cause significant reductions in startle response; the medications that are effective in treating conditioned fear are those typically used in the treatment of anxiety.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=all}}

'''Freedom of religion''' is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or [[belief]] in teaching, practice, [[worship]], and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[human right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|accessdate=5 December 2006|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201105738/http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|archivedate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ANDmIIpAmwC&amp;pg=PA29734|title=Congressional Record #29734 – 19 November 2003|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with a [[state religion]], freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not [[religious persecution|persecute]] believers in other faiths.
Freedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.

==History==
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Minerva als Symbol der Toleranz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Minerva]] as a symbol of enlightened wisdom protects the believers of all religions ([[Daniel Chodowiecki]], 1791)]]
Historically, ''freedom of religion'' has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while ''freedom of worship'' has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom ''from'' religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution.  Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of [[dhimmi]]s, literally "protected individuals" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.]]
In [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.

[[Cyrus the Great]] established the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the [[Cyrus Cylinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html Cyrus Cylinder], [http://www.livius.org/ livius.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard A. Taylor|author2=E. Ray Clendenen|title=Haggai, Malachi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC|date=15 October 2004|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8054-0121-9|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC&amp;pg=PA31 31–32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, [[Zoroastrianism]], Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the [[trial of Socrates]] in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token [[sacrifice]] was similar to refusing to take an [[oath of allegiance]]. This was the core for resentment and the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of early Christian communities]].

Freedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]] by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

Greek-Jewish clashes at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in 73 AD and 117 AD and in [[Alexandria]] in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.

The Romans tolerated most religions, including [[Judaism]] and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate [[Christianity]] until it was legalised by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]] in 311. The [[Edict of Milan]] guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.

===Muslim world===
Following a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of [[Medina]] (then known as ''Yathrib''), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] was declared by [[Muhammad]] in the [[Constitution of Medina]]. The Islamic [[Caliphate]] later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept ''[[dhimmi]]'' status and their adult males pay the punitive ''[[jizya]]'' tax instead of the ''[[zakat]]'' paid by Muslim citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Njeuma|first=Martin Z.|title=Fulani Hegemony in Yola (Old Adamawa) 1809-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQA4Q6fX7EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;ots=8pyCFSKL0V&amp;dq=Fulani%20Hegemony%20in%20Yola%20(Old%20Adamawa)%201809-1902&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-726-95-0|page=82|quote=Of all the various forms of taxation known to Islamic communities, it seems only two{{snd}} the zakat and the jixya were of importance in Adamawa.

Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The French scholar Gustave Le Bon (the author of ''La civilisation des Arabes'') writes "that despite the fact that the incidence of taxation fell more heavily on a Muslim than a non-Muslim, the non-Muslim was free to enjoy equally well with every Muslim all the privileges afforded to the citizens of the state. The only privilege that was reserved for the Muslims was the seat of the caliphate, and this, because of certain religious functions attached to it, which could not naturally be discharged by a non-Muslim." Mun'im Sirry (2014), ''Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions'', p.179. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0199359363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abou El Fadl|first1=Khaled|authorlink=Khaled Abou El Fadl|title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists|date=2007|publisher=[[HarperOne]]|isbn=978-0061189036|page=204|quote = According the dhimma status system, non-Muslims must pay a poll tax in return for Muslim protection and the privilege of living in Muslim territory.

In Islamic history, non-Muslims did occupy high positions, especially in matters that related to fiscal policies or tax collection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious pluralism]] existed in classical [[Islamic ethics]] and [[Sharia]], as the [[religious law]]s and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=C.

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order.&lt;ref name="al-Qattan-99"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0020743800055501|first=Najwa|last=al-Qattan|title=Dhimmis in the Muslim Court: Legal Autonomy and Religious Discrimination|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=31|issue=3|pages=429–44|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=1999|issn=0020-7438|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

Despite Dhimmis enjoying special statuses under the Caliphates, they were not considered equals, and sporadic persecutions of non-Muslim groups did occur in the history of the Caliphates.&lt;ref&gt;A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility {{ISBN|0-8050-7932-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/morocjews.html|title=The Jews of Morocco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{Main article|Freedom of religion in India}}
Ancient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Who are the Jews of India? – The S. Mark Taper Foundation imprint in Jewish studies. University of California Press. 2000. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21323-4}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWX6pF2PTJwC&amp;pg=PA26.; "When the Portuguese arrived in 1498, they brought a spirit of intolerance utterly alien to India. They soon established an Office of Inquisition at Goa, and at their hands Indian Jews experienced the only instance of anti-Semitism ever to occur in Indian soil."&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of religion [[edicts]] have been found written during [[Ashoka the Great]]'s reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.

Although India is an 80% [[Hindu]] country, India is a secular state without any [[state religion]]s.

Many scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, [[Hinduism]], has long been a most tolerant religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Ludden|title=Contesting the Nation: Religion, Community, and the Politics of Democracy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1585-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC&amp;pg=257 257–58]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajni Kothari]], founder of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] has written, "[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajni Kothari|title=Communalism in Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Rainbow Publishers|isbn=978-81-86962-00-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22foundations+of+a+civilisation+that+is+fundamentally+non–religious%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]], the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the [[Mahabharata]], has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. "Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition," the Dalai Lama said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/42229/indias-religious-tolerance-lauded.html|title=India's religious tolerance lauded|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) ([[Ashoka]]). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a [[Edicts of Ashoka|just and humane society]]. Later he promoted the principles of [[Buddhism]], and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.

The importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of [[Ashoka]]:
{{Quote|King Piyadasi (Ashok) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, one must not exalt one's creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.}} 

On the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.

After the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-knapp.com/christian_persecution_in_india.htm|title=Christian Persecution in India: The Real Story|publisher=Stephen-knapp.com|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=The Constitution of India |format=PDF |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] counters this argument by saying that [[evangelical]] Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.

In September 2010, the Indian state of [[Kerala]]'s State Election Commissioner announced that "Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers".&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orthodoxherald.com/2010/09/18/%E2%80%98using-places-of-worship-for-campaigning-in-kerala-civic-polls-is-violation-of-poll-code%E2%80%99/|title='Using places of worship for campaigning in Kerala civic polls is violation of poll code'|newspaper=Indian Orthodox Herald|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"/&gt;

Even today, most Indians celebrate all religious festivals with equal enthusiasm and respect. [[Hindu]] festivals like [[Deepavali]] and [[Holi]], Muslim festivals like [[Eid al-Fitr]], [[Eid-Ul-Adha]], [[Muharram]], Christian festivals like Christmas and other festivals like [[Buddha Purnima]], [[Mahavir Jayanti]], Gur Purab etc. are celebrated and enjoyed by all [[Indian people|Indians]].

===Europe===

====Religious intolerance====
[[File:CONGRESS COLUMN-BRUSSELS-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (13).jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth century allegorical statue on the [[Congress Column]] in Belgium depicting religious freedom]]
Most Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews]] from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the [[Inquisition]] for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.

However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As early as 1380, [[John Wycliffe]] in England denied [[transubstantiation]] and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a [[Papal Bull]] in 1410, and all his books were burned.

In 1414, [[Jan Hus]], a [[Bohemia]]n preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the [[Council of Constance]]. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.

After the fall of the city of [[Granada]], Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the [[Treaty of Granada]], but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The [[Morisco]]s (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by [[Philip III of Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)|Philip III]].

[[Martin Luther]] published his famous 95 Theses in [[Wittenberg]] on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:

* The Bible only is infallible.
* Every Christian can interpret it.
* Human sins are so wrongful that no deed or merit, only God's grace, can lead to salvation.

In consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of [[indulgence]]s and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the [[Diet of Worms]] before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the [[Wartburg]] in the possessions of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], where he translated the [[New Testament]] into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.

However, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. [[Huldrych Zwingli]] preached reform in [[Zürich]] from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England]] was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and [[Thomas More]], who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.

In 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the [[Bern]]ese imposed the reformation on the canton of [[Vaud]] by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in [[Lausanne]] and destroyed all its art and statuary. [[John Calvin]], who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.

The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when [[Mary I of England]] returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England]] was to restore the [[Church of England]] in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The [[King James Bible]] commissioned by King [[James I of England]] and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.

In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the [[Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day]] on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the "Michelade" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.

Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and [[Utraquism|Utraquists]]. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the meantime, in Germany [[Philip Melanchthon]] drafted the [[Augsburg Confession]] as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the [[Peace of Augsburg]]. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.

In France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France]]. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The [[French Revolution]] then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Early laws and legal guarantees for religious freedom===

====Principality of Transylvania====
In 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's [[Edict of Torda]] declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of [[List of Hungarian monarchs|King of Hungary]], and [[List of Princes of Transylvania|Prince of Transylvania]] [[John Sigismund Zápolya]] (John II.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/103.html|title=History of Transylvania.

However, it was more than a religious tolerance; it declared the equality of the religions, prohibiting all kinds of acts from authorities or from simple people, which could harm other groups or people because of their religious beliefs. The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe. Therefore, the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lightbringers.net/content/story-francis-david-and-king-john-sigismund-establishment-transylvanian-unitarian-church|title=The Story of Francis David and King John Sigismund: The Establishment of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church|work=Lightbringers|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''His majesty, our Lord, in what manner he{{snd}} together with his realm{{snd}} legislated in the matter of religion at the previous Diets, in the same matter now, in this Diet, reaffirms that in every place the preachers shall preach and explain the Gospel each according to his understanding of it, and if the congregation like it, well.

Therefore none of the superintendents or others shall abuse the preachers, no one shall be reviled for his religion by anyone, according to the previous statutes, and it is not permitted that anyone should threaten anyone else by imprisonment or by removal from his post for his teaching.

Four religions ([[Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Unitarianism]]) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxs]], [[Sabbatarians]] and [[Anabaptists]] were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mult-kor.hu/20051125_erdely_es_a_habsburg_vallaspolitika_a_17_szazad_utolso_evtizedeiben "Kovács Kálmán: Erdély és a Habsburg valláspolitika a 17. század utolsó évtizedeiben"] ''Mult-Kor'' (25 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

This religious freedom ended however for some of the religions of Transylvania in 1638. After this year the [[Szekler Sabbatarians|Sabbatarians]] begun to be persecuted, and forced to convert to one of the accepted religions of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/192.html|title=History of Transylvania.

=====Habsburg rule in Transylvania=====
Also the Unitarians (despite of being one of the "accepted religions") started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/290.html|title=History of Transylvania.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Union of Utrecht]] (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), pp. 396–97&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Ciffs, N.J., p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding [[Plymouth Colony]] in Massachusetts in 1620. [[William Penn]], the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Poland====
[[File:Konfederacja Warszawska.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Original act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] 1573. The beginning of religious freedom in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]
The General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the [[Statute of Kalisz]] was issued by the Duke of [[Greater Poland]] [[Bolesław the Pious|Boleslaus the Pious]] on 8 September 1264 in [[Kalisz]]. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir III of Poland]] in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453 and [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]] in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinkoff|first=Nancy|title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-KmeZgY2hIC|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-930675-16-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f–KmeZgY2hIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=1539 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
{{Main article|Warsaw Confederation}}
The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Zamoyski, Adam. ''The Polish Way''. New York: Hippocrene Books, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Freedom of religion in the United States}}
Most of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] found it necessary to found a new colony in [[Rhode Island]] to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were the most active of the New England persecutors of [[Quakers]], and the persecuting spirit was shared by [[Plymouth Colony]] and the colonies along the [[Connecticut river]].&lt;ref name=PER/&gt; In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker [[Mary Dyer]], who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.&lt;ref name=PER&gt;Rogers, Horatio, 2009.

The Act allowed freedom of worship for all [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christians in Maryland, but [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] anyone who denied the divinity of [[Jesus]]. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J.

It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and the other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded the disestablishment of state churches{{snd}} [[Anglican]] and [[Congregationalist]]{{snd}} and the protection of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], written in 1779 by [[Thomas Jefferson]], proclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those sentiments also found expression in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the national constitution, part of the United States' [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] established the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.

Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide [[reasonable accommodation]] to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a [[Sikh]] [[turban]], when there is a ''[[bona fide]]'' occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a [[hard hat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-60-e.htm#a6 Freedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere. 2.2.2 Headcoverings].

This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/36/a36r055.htm|title=A/RES/36/55. Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief|publisher=United Nations|date=25 November 1981|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states in its Article 14: ''"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.{{snd}} States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.{{snd}} Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr2int.htm Religious Rights – International Legal Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs===
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fb22.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal secular===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued in favour of freedom of religion.|alt=A man posing for a print]]
The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] noted in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'', that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country.  That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians. Letters on the English.|last=Voltaire|first=François Marie Arouet de.|date=1909–14|website=www.bartleby.com|publisher=The Harvard Classics|page=|orig-year=1734|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Adam Smith]], in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (using an argument first put forward by his friend and contemporary [[David Hume]]), states that in the long run it is in the best interests of society as a whole and the [[Magistrate|civil magistrate]] (government) in particular to allow people to freely choose their own religion, as it helps prevent [[civil unrest]] and reduces [[Religious intolerance|intolerance]]. So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this [[free competition]] amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.

Smith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 643–49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hinduism===
Hinduism is one of the more broad-minded religions when it comes to religious freedom.&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/beliefs.htm|title=Hindu Beliefs|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It respects the right of everyone to reach God in their own way. [[Hindus]] believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal. One of the famous Hindu sayings about religion is: "Truth is one; sages call it by different names."&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com/&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Lesley and Rachel Detained.jpg|thumb|Women detained at Western Wall for wearing prayer shawls; photo from Women of the Wall]]
[[Judaism]] includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, [[Reform Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Humanistic Judaism]]. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as  peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Erica|last2=Galperin|first2=Misha|title=The Case for Jewish Peoplehood: Can We be One?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=978-1-58023-401-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC&amp;pg=PA71 71]|quote=The 'hood' is not only a geographic reference; it is a shared identity that may be characterized by joint assumptions, body language, certain expressions, and a host of familial-like behaviors that unite an otherwise dispirate groupe of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.

After the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not [[ Israeli apartheid| equal ]] with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.

Possibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.

The State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current{{clarify timeframe|date=January 2017}} government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem.  Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having "high" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Global restrictions on Religion (2009" http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women, including [[Anat Hoffman]], have been arrested at the [[Western Wall]] for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. [[Women of the Wall]] have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-arrest-5-women-at-Western-Wall-for-wearing-tallitot-309436 "Police arrest 5 women at Western Wall for wearing tallitot"] ''Jerusalem Post'' (11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the [[Knesset]] synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: "paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel." MK [[Dov Lipman]] expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view "an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Maltz | first=Judy | title=Non-Orthodox Jews prohibited from praying in Knesset synagogue | date=26 November 2014 | newspaper=Haaretz | url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.628571 | accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.

===Christianity===
[[File:Worship-monument.jpg|left|thumb|Part of the [[Oscar Straus (politician)|Oscar Straus]] Memorial in Washington, D.C. honoring the right to worship]] According to the Catholic Church in the [[Vatican II]] document on religious freedom, ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'', "the human person has a right to religious freedom", which is described as "immunity from coercion in civil society".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |title=Declaration on religious freedom – ''Dignitatis humanae'' |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211202206/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of religious freedom "leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In addition, this right "is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Prior to this, [[Pope Pius IX]] had written a document called the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]. ''The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of "condemned propositions". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: "[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true" (15); "[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship"; "[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM|title=The Syllabus|author=[[Pope Pius IX]]|publisher=[[EWTN]]}}, [http://www.ewtn.com/ Global Catholic Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some [[Baptists]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Mainline (Protestant)|main line]] churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also affirms religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may"'', [http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng the eleventh Article of Faith].&lt;/ref&gt;

However others, such as African scholar [[Makau Mutua]], have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, "Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions."&lt;ref&gt;Mutua, Makau. 2004.

In their book ''[[Breaking India]]'', [[Rajiv Malhotra]] and [[Aravindan Neelakandan]] discussed the "US Church" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to "save" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise{{snd}} a "network" of organizations, individuals, and churches{{snd}} that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India. They suggest that this nexus of players includes not only church groups, government bodies, and related organizations, but also private think tanks and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingindia.com/introduction/|title=Introduction|work=Breaking India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joel Spring]] has written about the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the ''Imperium romanum''. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be "civilized" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, "just as the ''civitas''; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human{{snd}} to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature{{snd}} one had now also to be Christian." After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis|author=Joel H.

[[Conversion to Islam]] is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert  from Islam to another religion. Certain [[Muslim-majority countries]] are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries{{who|date=February 2012}} having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United States |first=Department of State|title=2010 International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/index.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012|reason=this may be supportable, but I don't see clear support in the source cited}} 

Islamic theologians{{Who|date=October 2009}} quote the [[Qur'an]] ({{Cite quran|2|256|expand=no|q=There is no compulsion in religion}} and {{Cite quran|109|1|end=6|expand=no|q=Say: O you who reject faith, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship...To you be your religion, and to me be mine}}, i.e., Sura [[Al-Kafirun]]) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.

{{Cite quran|2|190|end=194|style=nosup}}, referring to the war against Pagans during the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[Medina]], indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them ([[right of self-defense]]) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.

In Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that [[Muhammad]] to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, "Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good." In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.

In addition, {{Cite quran|5|3|style=nosup}}, which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and {{Cite quran|53|38|end=39|style=nosup}} states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the [[afterlife]]. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/789970_3b7987b974024c298f48d68986fe0c80.pdf Islam and Belief: At Home with Religious Freedom], Abdullah Saeed (2014): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; "The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.{{cn span|However, many Muslims believe that this hadith was written in the context of war and therefore Prophet Muhammad stipulated that whichever Muslim rejects his religion, leaves from the main body of Muslims and betrays the Muslims in war should be executed as a punishment for his treachery towards the community of Muslims.

===Changing religion===
{{Main article|Religious conversion}}
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion ([[apostasy]]), and the right to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51555.htm|title=US State Department report on Greece|publisher=State.gov|date=8 November 2005|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar [[Makau Mutua]] criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls "proselytizing universalist faiths" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.&amp;nbsp;652):

{{Quote|...the (human) rights regime incorrectly assumes a level playing field by requiring that African religions compete in the marketplace of ideas. The rights corpus not only forcibly imposes on African religions the obligation to compete{{snd}} a task for which as nonproselytizing, noncompetitive creeds they are not historically fashioned{{snd}} but also protects the evangelizing religions in their march towards universalization ... it seems inconceivable that the human rights regime would have intended to protect the right of certain religions to destroy others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutua  |first=Makau |title=Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook |year=2004 |publisher= Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief|isbn=978-90-04-13783-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct quote should have page number.

Some Indian scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf|format=PDF|title=Re-examining Religious Freedom|first=Sankrant|last=Sanu|publisher=Manushi|year=2006|accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]], a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online2.church123.com/attach.asp?clientURN=christiansolidarityworldwide2&amp;attachFileName=09ae125dba76986113441ef1463aca8e.attach&amp;attachOriginalFileName=CSW_Briefing_Apostasy_April_2008.pdf|title=No place to call home|date=29 April 2008|publisher=Christian Solidarity Worldwide|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, apostasy is called "''ridda''" ("turning back") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a "''murtad fitri''" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a "''murtad milli''" (apostate from the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }} from "Leaving Islam: Apostates speak out" by Ibn Warraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be [[Apostasy in Islam#Execution|put to death]] unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], and [[Hanbali]] schools of [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni [[Hanafi]] school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Heffening, W.|article=Murtadd| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online Edition|editor1=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an [[imam]].&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd" /&gt; At the same time, all schools of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adbul Qadir Oudah|title=Kitab Bhavan|year=1999|isbn=81-7151-273-9|publisher=Kitab Bhavan|location=New Delhi}}, Volume II. pp. 258–62; Volume IV. pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. A. Rahman|authorlink=S. A. Rahman|title=Punishment of Apostasy in Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC|year=2007|publisher=The Other Press|isbn=978-983-9541-49-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=PA132 132–42]|chapter=Summary and Conclusions|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=Pa132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though [[polygamy]] is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early [[LDS Church]] and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of [[psychedelic substance]]s by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.

In 1955, Chief Justice of California [[Roger J. Traynor]] neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: "Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not."&lt;ref&gt;''Pencovic v. Pencovic'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/45C2d97.htm 45 Cal. 2d 67] (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case of the ''[[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]'' in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and Procedure'', Daniel E. Hall. Cengage Learning, July 2008. p. 266. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KnBnknQAHlkC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=religious+beliefs+need+not+be+acceptable,+logical,+consistent+or+comprehensible+to+others+in+order+to+merit+First+Amendment+protection&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3ePeXVLZHE&amp;sig=v8SQRTZB0z8n5YNCA_kf98FlyPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UeS-T76tC4TQgAfd1czyCQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20beliefs%20need%20not%20be%20acceptable%2C%20logical%2C%20consistent%20or%20comprehensible%20to%20others%20in%20order%20to%20merit%20First%20Amendment%20protection&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Kim Davis]], a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]]. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the ''[[Miller v. Davis]]'' lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] to state that "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=15 October 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale|title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v. Vitale|work=United States Courts|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/abington-school-district-v-schempp|title=Abington School District V Schempp - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/epperson-v-arkansas|title=Epperson V Arkansas - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's rights==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2017}}
The law in Germany provides the term of "religious majority" (''Religiöse Mündigkeit'') with a minimum age for [[Minor (law)|minors]] to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don't share those or don't approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/kerzg/BJNR009390921.html|title=Gesetz über die religiöse Kindererziehung|publisher=Bundesrecht.juris.de|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar laws in Austria&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familienrecht.at/fileadmin/gesetze/abgb/rekerz.pdf Bundesgesetz 1985 über die religiöse Kindererziehung] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze.ch/sr/210/210_025.htm|title=Schweizerisches Zivilgesetzbuch Art 303: Religiöse Erziehung|publisher=Gesetze.ch|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Religious Freedom Day==
27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the [[Boston martyrs]], a group of [[Quakers]] executed by the [[Puritans]] on [[Boston Common]] for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] between 1659–1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margery Post Abbott|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7088-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US proclaimed 16 January Religious Freedom Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060113-9.html Religious Freedom Day, 2006 – A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/library/hot_releases/January_16_2001_6.html Religious Freedom Day, 2001 – Proclamation by the President of the United States of America 15 January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern concerns==
In its 2011 annual report, the ''[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]]'' designated fourteen nations as "countries of particular concern". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were [[Rohingya people|Burma]], China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission's watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=10154|title=US commission names 14 worst violators of religious freedom|accessdate=11 July 2011|publisher=Christianity Today|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;^ {{Cite press release|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3595|title=USCIRF Identifies World's Worst Religious Freedom Violators: Egypt Cited for First Time|publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;

There are concerns about the restrictions on public religious dress in some European countries (including the [[Hijab]], [[Kippah]], and [[Christian cross]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/france.passes.religious.symbol.ban/17.htm|title=France Passes Religious Symbol Ban|accessdate=29 April 2011|publisher=Christianity Today|date=9 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5414098.stm|title=The Islamic veil across Europe

Retrieved 4 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of religion as a legal concept is related to, but not identical with, religious toleration, [[separation of church and state]], or [[secular state]] (''[[laïcité]]'').

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===
[[File:Religiousfreedom.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Freedom of religion by country (Pew Research Center study, 2009). Light yellow: low restriction; red: very high restriction on freedom of religion.]]
The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the [[United States State Department]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="prc-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2" /&gt; This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of [[communal violence]] and [[Religious terrorism|religion-related terrorism]].

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt;

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of ''government'' and ''social'' restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the ''overall'' highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high ''government'' restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to ''social'' hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in ''social'' hostilities but moderate in terms of ''government'' actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center]]. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the "very high" category of social hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx|title=Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion|date=20 September 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-05 |title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country |year=2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gapjil''' ([[Hangul]]: 갑질) refers to the arrogant and authoritarian attitude or actions of people in [[South Korea]] who have positions of power over others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opendict.korean.go.kr/dictionary/view?sense_no=1295950&amp;viewType=confirm|title=우리말샘 - 내용 보기|publisher=opendict.korean.go.kr|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gapjil is a [[neologism]] made by combining the word '''Gap''' (갑; 甲)—which is used to introduce the first party in a contract, but also refers to a party's superior status—and '''jil''' (-질), a [[suffix]] that negatively refers to particular actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.econovill.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=277288|title=끊이지 않는 '갑질'의 역사, 유형을 진단해 보면 - 이코노믹리뷰|date=2016-01-12|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2070466&amp;cid=55570&amp;categoryId=55570|title=갑을관계|access-date=2017-12-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a phenomenon associated with the hierarchical nature of Korean society and work culture—a structure which results in the social superiority of those with higher wealth. Various incidents, such as the [[nutrage|nut rage]], have brought this phenomenon to the attention of the world media.

== Causes ==
Song Jae-ryung, a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Kyung Hee University|Kyunghee University]], points out that Gapjil is not simply a matter of an individual's [[morality]], but a societal problem. As the bottom of Korean society is constituted by the repressive role of Gap and submissive attitude of Eul, individuals follow the [[culture]] of the elite. In other words, the cause of gapjil is a cultural tendency for people to merely perform the roles which are shaped by the high [[power distance]] in Korea. This is why an individual who was Eul in another situation is doing the same thing (gapjil) in another relationship when he or she becomes another Gap. In order to solve the gapjil problem, Prof. Song says, each individual needs to admit the social position that is different horizontally, not vertically, and the social atmosphere that fosters this awareness needs to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kukinews.com/news/article.html?no=359870|title=[기획] "돈이면 다냐?" 갑갑한 대한민국… 갑(甲)질 공통점 살펴보니…|publisher=news.kukinews.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of gapjil ==
According to an article in Economic Review, a Korean magazine, there are some obvious types of gapjil depending on the context: owner gapjil, push-driven distribution gapjil, and passion-pay.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Owner gapjil ===
'Owner gapjil' is the most common type of gapjil, where representatives or [[Chaebol|executive family members of a company]] treat their employees with contempt, using abusive language or even assault. Owner gapjil reflects the mistaken view that employers can treat employees however they want because of the extreme vertical relationship between the two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 'Monggo Food' Kim Man-sik scandal ====
On 23 December 2015, there was a report that Kim Man-sik, honorary president of Monggo Food, had used abusive language and assaulted his [[chauffeur]] 'B'. The assaulted employee said, "President Kim indulges in violence and hurl abuses almost like a habit, if his mood is bad". After Monggo Food posted an apology on its website on 23 December, Kim Man-sik and Kim Hyeon-seung, CEO of the firm, apologized to the public and to the person directly involved, on 25 December in a press conference. Although there had been a disagreement with victims concerning a problem of reinstatement, an amicable settlement was made with the victims of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilyosisa.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=92779|title=몽고식품 '긴박했던 4박5일' 풀스토리 - 일요시사|date=2015-12-31|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2016, the Masan Branch of the Changwon District Public Prosecutor's Office requested that Kim Man-sik issue a summary order of 7,000,000 [[South Korean won|won]] (about 6,000 dollars as of July 2018) in fines relating to habitual assaults, violence and violation of labour standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sisafocus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=144705|title='회장님 갑질' 몽고식품 김만식 전 회장 벌금형|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 'M&amp;M' Choi Cheol-won scandal ====
In October 2010, Choi Cheol-won, the CEO of M&amp;M, called a tank truck driver—who had gone on a demonstration in front of the [[SK Group|SK]] headquarters—to his office and assaulted them with such things as a baseball bat. As a result, the driver suffered injuries requiring two weeks of medical treatment. This incident was reported in the [[editorial]] program of [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], which aired on 28 November 2010. Huge amounts of public criticism, particularly resulting from a memorandum that had been written to certify that the driver was given 20,000,000 won (about 20,000 dollars as of July 2018) as compensation for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/778110|title="SK 최태원 회장 사촌동생, 야구방망이로 노동자 폭행"|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Choi Cheol-won had been charged on 30 November, the police started to investigate the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00003&amp;news_seq_no=1016552|title=경찰 '맷값 폭행' 최철원 입국 통보 요청|publisher=mbn.mk.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2011, the [[Seoul]] Central District [[Court]] sentenced him to 18 months in prison and the appellate tribunal sentenced him to 18 months in prison with three years of [[probation]] and 120 hours of community service. The judgement of the court's decision saying, "Social criticism is a reason for the sentence" caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fnnews.com/news/201102081101576523?t=y|title='맷값 폭행'최철원 징역 1년6월|date=2011-02-08|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 'Korean Air' Cho Hyun-min scandal ====
When [[Korean Air]] executive ‘Cho Hyun-min’ allegedly sprayed water on company's employees, foreign media paid attention. In March 2018, the allegations of yelling and spraying water to an advertising agent caused rising controversy. When concerns over Cho's behavior became widespread, Korean Air explained, “It is true that during the meeting, the water rose and splashed when the bucket fell on the floor, but it did not spray water on the staff”.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Cho apologized for her behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2018/04/15/0302000000AEN20180415000800320.html|title=Korean Air heiress returns home amid probe into violent tantrum|work=Yonhap News Agency|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident caused many foreign media to start using the word "gapjil" directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/world/asia/nut-rage-sister-korean-air.html|title=Sister of Korean ‘Nut Rage’ Heiress Accused of Throwing Her Own Tantrum|last=Sang-Hun|first=Choe|date=2018-04-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Push-driven distribution gapjil ===
'Push-driven distribution gapjil' is a type of gapjil where large corporations make pressing delivery (or supply) demands to small businesses (franchises).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Namyang Dairy Products Corporation high-pressure sales to franchises scandal ====
[[File:Namyang logo.png|thumb|logo of Namyang]]
In May 2013, Namyang Co. was criticised following an accusation that the firm had pressed local franchises to buy products for a long time, as well as a tape-recording of rough words to local owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktv.go.kr/content/view?content_id=462589|title='밀어내기' 전방위 조사···남양유업 '사과'|publisher=ktv.go.kr|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namyang Co. caused more than 20 billion wons' worth (about 18 million dollars as of July 2018) of damage through illegal activities—such as high-pressure sales and shifting wages of salesmen to local franchises—for the past seven years, for which the Seoul Central District Court convicted it in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?code=940301&amp;artid=201401242119415|title=법원 "남양유업 '밀어내기' 모두 유죄 인정"|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this case, the chronic gapjil problem in Korean society became a public social issue. There was also a boycott against Namyang Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201305101519365078|title=남양유업 사과, 진정성이 없다 [YTN FM]|publisher=www.ytn.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hyundai Mobis high-pressure sales scandal ====
[[File:Hyundai Mobis Logo.svg|thumb|Hyundai Mobis Logo]]
In September 2017, [[Hyundai Mobis]] was suspected of pressure to achieve sales goals and forced sales by 1600 branches of local maintenance shops from January 2010 to November 2013. The manager of the local shops was pressed to buy unnecessary parts of an automobile under the name of "Random Sales" and "Negotiated Sales" in order to achieve the goal of the head office. Hyundai Mobis admitted carrying out these acts and since then has been establishing a plan to ensure they do not reoccur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20170911/86278451/1|title=현대모비스 '물량 밀어내기' 혐의 인정… 공정위 "미흡하다"|date=2017-09-12|work=동아닷컴|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Passion-pay ===
[[File:Lee Sang-Bong from acrofan.jpg|thumb|Lie Sang Bong]]
Passion-pay is a type of labour extortion where the corporation pays less than minimum wage, or even nothing, for the labor of young job seekers who have trouble finding a job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Lie Sang Bong Design Studio's passion-pay scandal ====

In January 2015, Lie Sang Bong design studio, which is managed by Korean fashion designer Lie Sang Bong, was embroiled in controversy about passion-pay. Although the studio imposed excessive workloads on workers, the studio offered relatively low wages: 100,000 won (about 100 dollars as of July 2018) for apprentices, 300,000 won (about 300 dollars) for interns and 1,100,000 won (about 1,100 dollars) for regular workers. After the controversy, Lie Sang Bong said "I deeply apologized to the youths of the fashion industry who get hurt with working environment and treatment, and I'll try to improve the overall problem of the fashion industry in this opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201501151554510194|title='열정페이' 논란 이상봉 결국 사과|publisher=www.ytn.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seoul National University Hospital.jpg|thumb|Seoul National University Hospital]]

==== Seoul National University Hospital nurse passion-pay scandal ====
In September 2017, [[Seoul National University Hospital]] (SNUH) was in a controversy because it did passion-pay on newly graduated nurses for five years since 2012, for "probationary education period". It turned out that SNUH only paid 360,000 won (about 360 dollars as of July 2018) for 24 days work to 1,212 nurses in their period of education. Based on an eight hour working day, the sum of 360,000 won is equivalent to an hourly rate of 1,800 won (about 2 dollars), which is far below the [[minimum wage]] of 6,470 won (about 6 dollars). The hospital explained that they did not know whether they should pay full wages during the training session. In addition, they plan to provide retroactive payment to nurses under three years, which is a period appointed by the recent labor standard law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0011807211&amp;code=61121211&amp;sid1=o|title=서울대병원 첫 월급 36만원…용돈보다 적은 간호사 열정페이|publisher=news.kmib.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social responses ==
=== Boycott ===
[[Boycott]] can be defined as a movement of consumers' refusal to buy a particular item in order to accomplish a specific purpose.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1104927&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=31614|title=불매운동|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike gapjil (which is a structural problem between 'Gap' and 'Eul', like the franchise-maker and the retailer), the boycott campaign showed that it can explode instantly when the problem touches consumer's feelings.&lt;ref name="갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.the-pr.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24561|title=갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알|date=2017-10-02|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because consumers think that not consuming products of gapjil firms is the best thing they can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insight.co.kr/news/78758|title=소비자 불매운동 불러온 대한민국 '갑질' 7|work=인사이트|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement suggests that the gapjil of company owners or executives is becoming a 'self-harm' activity which decreases corporate profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news2day.co.kr/82049|title=[뉴투기획] 똘똘 뭉친 소비자들, 갑질기업에 불매운동으로 응징|publisher=www.news2day.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts emphasize that in order to reduce corporate ethical problems, such as gapjil, consumers need to change their perception as a consumer in a larger frame of mind. Corporations will be changed when consumer involvement such as resentment at gapjil and boycott is increased.&lt;ref name="갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알"/&gt; A consumer movement group staged boycott campaigns and received favourable responses from consumers, but there has not yet been a massive and organised boycott.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 24-hour call center for reporting damages by gapjil ===
On 11 April 2016, the Korean [[civil society organisation]] Public Welfare Committee (PWC) opened a 24-hour [[call centre]] for reporting gapjil damages and behavior. It is operated for rooting out irregular practices. PWC explained that the purpose of the call center was to prevent gapjil behavior, which is prevalent in South Korean society, and to conduct criminal and civil measures through case verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/739236.html#csidxb1f9587a88ced499d98289a45266476|title="잘못된 갑질 신고하세요"시민단체 24시간 콜센터|date=2016-04-11|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governmental responses ==

=== Investigation of gapjil ===
[[File:Emblem of the Korea Fair Trade Commission (South Korea) (English).svg|thumb|Korean Fair Trade Commission Logo]]
After Kim Sang-jo was inaugurated as chairperson of the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Korean Fair Trade Commission]] (FTC), the FTC started an investigation of all industrial head offices and franchises to resolve all gapjil cases in four major areas: [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]], subcontract, and [[Franchising|franchise]].

Beginning 10 August 2017, the FTC began investigating the transactions between headquarters and agencies, which targeted about 4,800 headquarters, 70 franchises and group of franchises of all domestic industry. The investigation was conducted as a survey targeting the headquarters between August and September, and since then targeted the franchises and groups of franchises from September to December. The FTC said the purpose of the investigation was to secure basic data to prevent unfair trade practices between headquarters and franchises, in order to prepare policies and improve the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressian.com/news/article.html?no=165286|title=공정위, '갑질' 정조준...70만개 대리점 전수조사|publisher=www.pressian.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ombudsman ===
In July 2017, the FTC established an [[ombudsman]] for permanent surveillance of protection measures about franchises. The ombudsman was organised with former and current merchants with experience in franchise trading and 13 members of the FTC. They planned to expand the members to 30, including wholesale, retail, and service sectors. The ombudsman regularly monitors trading practices in franchise sectors and reports to the FTC when signs of unfair trade are detected. In addition, they state their opinion in policy enforcement, and they suggest ideas to improve the system by collecting problems information on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/804522.html|title=프랜차이즈 갑질, 공정위가 상시 감시한다|date=2017-07-27|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unfair damage counseling center in Seoul ===
[[File:Seal of Seoul Metropolitan Government.png|thumb|Seal of Seoul|alt=|150x150px]]
For the first time in local government, the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] started to eradicate unfair practices in the franchise industry, declaring, "2016 economic democratisation city, Seoul". The Seoul Metropolitan Government has operated an unfair damage counselling centre, where anyone who suffered from unfair damages can report their case through the member's office.

Not only the franchiser who is operating the franchise but also an ex-franchiser and even a group of franchisers can report and gather unfair cases of members. When the report is received, first, the government identifies the exact facts of the incident through an in-depth consultation with the franchiser who reported the incident, then meeting with a group of franchisers. According to the issue, the government recommends to the headquarters of the franchise a voluntary corrective action or handles arrangements. Depending on the degree of violation of the law, the investigation request to the FTC or the prosecution are reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ecomedia.co.kr/news/newsview.php?ncode=1065594442127896|title=서울시, 프랜차이즈 가맹정 '갑(甲)질 피해' 실태점검|work=환경미디어}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media responses ==
In December 2014, the [[nut rage incident]] was covered by numerous international media, and gapjil reached a level of global prominence. In February 2015, the [[Reuters]] news agency reported about Korean gapjil culture and the judgement of the nut rage incident. According to the article, it seemed that Korean gapjil culture originates from a traditional vertical hierarchy in Korean society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-nuts-backlash/nut-rage-prompts-south-korea-to-consider-law-against-high-handed-conduct-idUSKBN0LJ05Z20150215|title='Nut rage' prompts South Korea to consider law against high-handed conduct|date=February 15, 2015|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, ''[[The Independent]]'', British newspaper, reported on the No-Look Pass issue of Korean politician [[Kim Moo-sung]], and pointed out that most gapjil is done by Korean adult men, especially middle aged men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/south-korean-politician-kim-moo-sung-suitcase-push-viral-video-entitled-middle-aged-men-a7753041.html|title=Politician's suitcase incident goes viral for summing up entitled middle-aged men|date=2017-05-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later interpretations such as that done by Landsberger suggested that the novelty of being research subjects and the increased attention from such could lead to temporary increases in workers' productivity. This interpretation was dubbed "the Hawthorne effect".

== History ==
[[File:Hawthorne, Illinois Works of the Western Electric Company, 1925.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Hawthorne Works, ca. 1925]] 
The term was coined in 1958 by Henry A. Landsberger&lt;ref name=HRev/&gt; when he was analyzing earlier experiments from 1924–32 at the [[Hawthorne Works]] (a [[Western Electric]] factory outside Chicago). The Hawthorne Works had commissioned a study to see if its workers would become more productive in higher or lower levels of light. The workers' productivity seemed to improve when changes were made, and slumped when the study ended.  It was suggested that the productivity gain occurred as a result of the [[motivation]]al effect on the workers of the interest being shown in them.

This effect was observed for minute increases in illumination. In these lighting studies, light intensity was altered to examine its effect on worker productivity. Most industrial/occupational psychology and organizational behavior textbooks refer to the illumination studies.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%2004/pdf/413_023to039.pdf The Industrial Organization Psychologist]'', Volume 41, ''What We Teach Students About the Hawthorne Studies'', Santa Clara University 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Only occasionally are the rest of the studies mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%2004/pdf/413_023to039.pdf |title=What We Teach Students About the Hawthorne Studies: A Review of Content Within a Sample of Introductory I-O and OB Textbooks |access-date=2007-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103164852/http://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%2004/pdf/413_023to039.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although illumination research of workplace lighting formed the basis of the Hawthorne effect, other changes such as maintaining clean work stations, clearing floors of obstacles, and even relocating workstations resulted in increased productivity for short periods. Thus the term is used to identify any type of short-lived increase in productivity.&lt;ref name="HRev"&gt;

&lt;!-- Interpretations and views vary. [[H. McIlvaine Parsons]] defines the Hawthorne effect as "the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do" (i.e. performance is affected – possibly unconsciously – by possible positive or negative personal consequences not considered by the experimenter).&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; [[Elton Mayo]] describes it in terms of a positive emotional effect due to the perception of a sympathetic or interested observer. Clark and Sugrue say that uncontrolled [[novelty effect]]s cause on average 30% of a [[standard deviation]] (SD) rise (i.e. 50–63% score rise), which decays to small level after eight weeks.&lt;ref name=ClarkSugrue1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark |first=Richard E. |last2=Sugrue |first2=Brenda M. |year=1991 |chapter=30.

=== Relay assembly experiments ===
In one of the studies, researchers chose two women as test subjects and asked them to choose four other workers to join the test group.  Together the women worked in a separate room over the course of five years (1927–1932) assembling telephone [[relay]]s.

Output was measured mechanically by counting how many finished relays each worker dropped down a chute. This measuring began in secret two weeks before moving the women to an experiment room and continued throughout the study. In the experiment room they had a supervisor who discussed changes with their productivity. Some of the variables were:

* Giving two 5-minute breaks (after a discussion with them on the best length of time), and then changing to two 10-minute breaks (not their preference). Productivity increased, but when they received six 5-minute rests, they disliked it and reduced output.
* Providing food during the breaks.
* Shortening the day by 30 minutes (output went up); shortening it more (output per hour went up, but overall output decreased); returning to the first condition (where output peaked).

Changing a variable usually increased productivity, even if the variable was just a change back to the original condition. However it is said that this is the natural process of the human being adapting to the environment, without knowing the objective of the experiment occurring. Researchers concluded that the workers worked harder because they thought that they were being monitored individually.

Researchers hypothesized that choosing one's own coworkers, working as a group, being treated as special (as evidenced by working in a separate room), and having a sympathetic supervisor were the real reasons for the productivity increase. One interpretation, mainly due to [[Elton Mayo]],&lt;ref name="Mayo"&gt;Mayo, Elton (1945) [https://archive.org/details/socialproblemsof00mayo ''Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization'']. Boston: Division of Research, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; was that "the six individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation in the experiment." (There was a second relay assembly test room study whose results were not as significant as the first experiment.)

=== Bank wiring room experiments ===
The purpose of the next study was to find out how payment incentives would affect productivity. The surprising result was that productivity actually decreased.  Workers apparently had become suspicious that their productivity may have been boosted to justify firing some of the workers later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| edition = 9th | publisher = [[Pearson Education]] | year = 2008 | page = 140 | isbn = 978-0-205-57023-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was conducted by [[Elton Mayo]] and [[W. Lloyd Warner]] between 1931 and 1932 on a group of fourteen men who put together telephone switching equipment. The researchers found that although the workers were paid according to individual productivity, productivity decreased because the men were afraid that the company would lower the base rate. Detailed observation of the men revealed the existence of informal groups or "cliques" within the formal groups. These cliques developed informal rules of behavior as well as mechanisms to enforce them.  The cliques served to control group members and to manage bosses; when bosses asked questions, clique members gave the same responses,  even if they were untrue. These results show that workers were more responsive to the social force of their peer groups than to the control and incentives of management.

== Interpretation and criticism ==
[[Richard Nisbett]] has described the Hawthorne effect as "a glorified anecdote", saying that "once you have got the anecdote, you can throw away the data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kolata |first=G. |title=Scientific Myths That Are Too Good to Die |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=December 6, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/06/weekinreview/scientific-myths-that-are-too-good-to-die.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have attempted to explain the effects with various interpretations.

Adair warns of gross factual inaccuracy in most secondary publications on Hawthorne effect and that many studies failed to find it.&lt;ref name="Adair"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=J.G. |title=The Hawthorne Effect: A reconsideration of the methodological artifact |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=69 |issue=2 |year=1984 |pages=334–345 |url=http://www.psicologia.unimib.it/getFile.php/23195/Adair%20Hawthorne.pdf |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.69.2.334 |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215070615/http://www.psicologia.unimib.it/getFile.php/23195/Adair%20Hawthorne.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that it should be viewed as a variant of [[Martin Theodore Orne|Orne]]'s (1973) experimental [[demand effect]]. So for Adair, the issue is that an experimental effect depends on the participants' interpretation of the situation; this is why [[manipulation checks]] are important in social sciences experiments. So he thinks it is not awareness ''per se'', nor special attention ''per se'', but participants' interpretation that must be investigated in order to discover if/how the experimental conditions interact with the participants' goals.  This can affect whether participants believe something, if they act on it or do not see it as in their interest, etc.{{vague|date=August 2016}}

Possible explanations for the Hawthorne effect include the impact of feedback and motivation towards the experimenter. Receiving feedback on their performance may improve their skills when an experiment provides this feedback for the first time.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. M. |last=Parsons |year=1974 |title=What happened at Hawthorne?: New evidence suggests the Hawthorne effect resulted from operant reinforcement contingencies |journal=Science |volume=183 |issue=4128 |pages=922–932 |doi=10.1126/science.183.4128.922 |pmid=17756742  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the [[demand effect]] also suggests that people may be motivated to please the experimenter, at least if it does not conflict with any other motive.&lt;ref name="SteeleJohnson2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steele-Johnson |first=D. |year=2000 |title=Goal orientation and task demand effects on motivation, affect, and performance |journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=724–738 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.85.5.724 |first2=Russell S. |last3=Hoover |first3=Paul B. |last4=Schmidt |first4=Aaron M. |pmid=11055145 |last2=Beauregard }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be suspicious of the purpose of the experimenter.&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt; Therefore, Hawthorne effect may only occur when there is usable feedback or a change in motivation.

Parsons defines the Hawthorne effect as "the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do" [i.e. learning effects, both permanent skill improvement and feedback-enabled adjustments to suit current goals]. His key argument is that in the studies where workers dropped their finished goods down chutes, the participants had access to the counters of their work rate.&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt;

Mayo contended that the effect was due to the workers reacting to the sympathy and interest of the observers. He does say that this experiment is about testing overall effect, not testing factors separately. He also discusses it not really as an [[experimenter effect]] but as a management effect: how management can make workers perform differently because they feel differently. A lot to do with feeling free, not feeling supervised but more in control as a group. The experimental manipulations were important in convincing the workers to feel this way: that conditions were really different. The experiment was repeated with similar effects on [[mica]]-splitting workers.&lt;ref name=Mayo /&gt;

Clark and Sugrue in a review of [[educational research]] say that uncontrolled [[novelty effect]]s cause on average 30% of a [[standard deviation]] (SD) rise (i.e. 50%–63% score rise), which decays to small level after 8 weeks. In more detail: 50% of a SD for up to 4 weeks; 30% of SD for 5–8 weeks; and 20% of SD for &gt; 8 weeks, (which is &lt; 1% of the variance).&lt;ref name=ClarkSugrue1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark |first=Richard E. |last2=Sugrue |first2=Brenda M. |year=1991 |chapter=30. Research on instructional media, 1978-1988 |editor=G.J.Anglin |title=Instructional technology: past, present, and future |pages=327–343 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=Englewood, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|333}}

[[Harry Braverman]] points out that the Hawthorne tests were based on industrial psychology and were investigating whether workers' performance could be predicted by pre-hire testing.  The Hawthorne study showed "that the performance of workers had little relation to ability and in fact often bore an inverse relation to test scores...".&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book |last=Braverman |first=Harry |title=Labor and Monopoly Capitalism |year=1974 |publisher=Monthly Review Press |location=New York |pages=144–145 |isbn=0853453403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braverman argues that the studies really showed that the workplace was not "a system of bureaucratic formal organisation on the [[Max Weber|Weberian model]], nor a system of informal group relations, as in the interpretation of Mayo and his followers but rather a system of power, of class antagonisms". This discovery was a blow to those hoping to apply the behavioral sciences to manipulate workers in the interest of management.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The economists [[Steven Levitt]] and [[John A. List]] long pursued without success a search for the base data of the original illumination experiments, before finding it in a microfilm at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4 programme ''More Or Less'', "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01j5xb1 The Hawthorne Effect]", broadcast 12 October 2013, presented by Tim Harford with contributions by John List&lt;/ref&gt;  Re-analysing it, they found slight evidence for the Hawthorn effect over the long-run, but in no way as drastic as suggested initially &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=List |first2=John A. |year=2011 |title=Was There Really a Hawthorne Effect at the Hawthorne Plant?

It is also possible that the illumination experiments can be explained by a longitudinal learning effect. Parsons has declined to analyse the illumination experiments, on the grounds that they have not been properly published and so he cannot get at details, whereas he had extensive personal communication with Roethlisberger and Dickson.&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some postulate that, beyond just attention and observation, there may be other factors involved, such as slightly better care; slightly better [[compliance (medicine)|compliance/adherence]]; and [[selection bias]]. The latter may have several mechanisms: (1) Physicians may tend to recruit patients who seem to have better adherence potential and lesser likelihood of future [[lost to follow-up|loss to follow-up]]. (2) The inclusion/exclusion criteria of trials often exclude at least some [[comorbidity|comorbidities]]; although this is often necessary to prevent [[confounding]], it also means that trials may tend to work with healthier patient subpopulations.

== Secondary observer effect ==

Despite the observer effect as popularized in the Hawthorne experiments being perhaps falsely identified (see above discussion), the popularity and plausibility of the observer effect in theory has led researchers to postulate that this effect could take place at a second level. Thus it has been proposed that there is a secondary observer effect when researchers working with secondary data such as survey data or various indicators may impact the results of their scientific research. Rather than having an effect on the subjects (as with the primary observer effect), the researchers likely have their own idiosyncrasies that influence how they handle the data and even what data they obtain from secondary sources. For one, the researchers may choose seemingly innocuous steps in their statistical analyses that end up causing significantly different results using the same data; e.g., weighting strategies, factor analytic techniques, or choice of estimation. In addition, researchers may use software packages that have different default settings that lead to small but significant fluctuations. Finally, the data that researchers use may not be identical, even though it seems so. For example, the OECD collects and distributes various socio-economic data; however, these data change over time such that a researcher who downloads the Australian GDP data for the year 2000 may have slightly different values than a researcher who downloads the same Australian GDP 2000 data a few years later. The idea of the secondary observer effect was floated by Nate Breznau in a thus far relatively obscure paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breznau|first=Nate|date=2016-05-03|title=Secondary observer effects: idiosyncratic errors in small-N secondary data analysis|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2014.1001221|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=301–318|doi=10.1080/13645579.2014.1001221|issn=1364-5579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although little attention has been paid to this phenomenon, the scientific implications are very large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Yuan|last2=Sorenson|first2=Olav|last3=Waguespack|first3=David|date=2017-01-30|title=Temporal Issues in Replication: The Stability of Centrality-Based Advantage|url=https://www.sociologicalscience.com/articles-v4-5-107/|journal=Sociological Science|language=en-US|volume=4|pages=107–122|doi=10.15195/v4.a5|issn=2330-6696}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this effect may be seen in recent studies that assign a particular problem to a number of researchers or research teams who then work independently using the same data to try and find a solution. This is a process called crowdsourcing data analysis and was used in a groundbreaking study by Silberzahn, Rafael, Eric Uhlmann, Dan Martin and Brian Nosek et al. (2015) about red cards and player race in football (i.e., soccer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osf.io/j5v8f/|title=OSF {{!}} Crowdsourcing Analytics - Final Manuscript.pdf|website=osf.io|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://policyandpoliticsblog.com/2015/03/26/crowdsourcing-data-to-improve-macro-comparative-research/|title=Crowdsourcing Data to Improve Macro-Comparative Research|date=2015-03-26|newspaper=Policy and Politics Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Sun Oil pipeline spill in Ambler, [[Pennsylvania]] spurred the first commercial usage of in situ bioremediation in 1972 to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-34-waste-containment-and-remediation-technology-spring-2004/lecture-notes/lecture12.pdf|title=Lecture 12 Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Course Work Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was filed in 1974 by Richard Raymond, Reclamation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Ground Waters, which provided the basis for the commercialization of in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications of In situ Bioremediation ==

===Accelerated===
Accelerated in situ bioremediation is defined when a specified microorganism is targeted for growth through the application of either nutrients or an electron donor to the contaminated site. Within aerobic metabolism the nutrient added to the soil can be solely Oxygen. Anaerobic in situ bioremediation often requires a variety of electron donors or acceptors such as [[benzoate]] and lactate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioprocess.pnnl.gov/resour/rt3d.in.situ.bioremediation.htm#advant|title=In Situ Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=bioprocess.pnnl.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides nutrients, microorganisms can also be introduced directly to the site within accelerated in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=David E.|last2=Lutz|first2=Edward J.|last3=Odom|first3=J. Martin|last4=Buchanan|first4=Ronald J.|last5=Bartlett|first5=Craig L.|last6=Lee|first6=Michael D.|last7=Harkness|first7=Mark R.|last8=DeWeerd|first8=Kim A.|date=1 June 2000|title=Bioaugmentation for Accelerated In Situ Anaerobic Bioremediation|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=34|issue=11|pages=2254–2260|doi=10.1021/es990638e|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of extraneous microorganisms to a site is termed [[bioaugmentation]] and is used when a particular microorganism is effective at degrading the pollutant at the site and is not found either naturally or at a high enough population to be effective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accelerated in situ bioremediation is utilized when the desired population of microorganisms within a site is not naturally present at a sufficient level to effectively degrade the pollutants. It also is used when the required nutrients within the site are either not at a concentration sufficient to support growth or are unavailable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Raymond Process====
The Raymond Process is a type of accelerated in situ bioremediation that was developed by Richard Raymond and involves the introduction of nutrients and electron acceptors to a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This process is primarily used to treat polluted groundwater. In the Raymond process a loop system is created. Contaminated [[Groundwater]] from downstream of the groundwater flow is pumped to the surface and infused with nutrients and an electron donor, often oxygen. This treated water is then pumped back down below the [[water table]] upstream of where it was originally taken. This process introduces nutrients and electron donors into the site allowing for the growth of a determined microbial population.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=====Oxygen Injection=====
In contaminated sites where the desired microbial metabolism is aerobic the introduction of oxygen to the site can be used to increase the population of targeted microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Bioremediation/cat/Aerobic_Bioremediation_(Direct)/|title=CLU-IN {{!}} Technologies &gt; Remediation &gt; About Remediation Technologies &gt; Bioremediation &gt; Aerobic Bioremediation (Direct)|last=|first=|date=|website=clu-in.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection of Oxygen can occur through a variety of processes. Oxygen can be injected into the subsurface through injection wells. It can also be introduced through an injection gallery. The presence of oxygen within a site is often the limiting factor when determining the time frame and efficacy of a proposed in situ bioremediation process.

====== Ozone Injection ======
Ozone injected into the subsurface can also be a means of introducing oxygen into a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Despite being a strong oxidizing agent and potentially having a toxic effect on subsurface microbial populations, ozone can be an efficient means of spreading oxygen throughout a site due to its high solubility.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Within twenty minutes after being injected into the subsurface, fifty percent of the ozone will have decomposed to Oxygen.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Ozone is commonly introduced to the soil in either a dissolved or gaseous state.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

=====Accelerated Anaerobic In situ Bioremediation=====
Within accelerated anaerobic in situ bioremediation electron donors and acceptors are introduced into a contaminated site in order to increase the population of anaerobic microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA)===
Monitored Natural Attenuation is in situ bioremediation that occurs with little to no human intervention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_monitored_natural_attenuation.pdf|title=A Citizen's Guide to Monitored Natural Attenuation|last=|first=|date=September 2012|website=Contaminated Sites Clean up Information|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process relies on the natural microbial populations sustained within the contaminated sites to over time reduce the contaminants to a desired level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During monitored natural attenuation the site is monitored in order to track the progress of the bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monitored natural attenuation is used in sites where the source of contamination is no longer present, often after other more active types of in situ bioremediation have been conducted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Uses of In situ bioremediation==
===Hydrocarbon Degradation===

Naturally occurring within the soil are microbial populations that utilize [[hydrocarbons]] as a source of energy and Carbon.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.bren.ucsb.edu/~keller/courses/esm223/SuthersanCh05Bioremediation.pdf|title=IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION|last=Suthersan|first=Susan|date=1999|website=University of California Barbara|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is [[cometabolism]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The fungus genus [[Phanerochaete]] under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syed|first=Khajamohiddin|last2=Yadav|first2=Jagjit S.|date=1 November 2012|title=P450 monooxygenases (P450ome) of the model white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=339–363|doi=10.3109/1040841X.2012.682050|issn=1040-841X|pmc=3567848|pmid=22624627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorinated Compounds===
====Chlorinated Aliphatic Compounds====

A variety of metabolic modes exist capable of degrading chlorinated [[aliphatic compounds]]. Anaerobic reduction, oxidation of the compound, and cometabolism under aerobic conditions are the three main metabolic modes utilized by microorganisms to degrade chlorinated aliphatic compounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Organisms that can readily metabolize chlorinated aliphatic compounds are not common in the environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One and two carbons that have little chlorination are the compounds most effectively metabolized by soil microbial populations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The degradation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds is most often performed through cometabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
[[File:Reacciotriclorur.png|thumb|Synthesis and general structure of polychlorinated byphenyls.]]

====Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbons====

Chlorinated [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] hydrocarbons are resistant to bioremediation and many microorganisms lack the ability to degrade the compounds. Chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are most often degraded through a process of reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) are primarily degraded through cometabolism. There are also some fungi that can degrade the compounds as well.  Studies show an increase in PCB degradation when biphenyl is added to the site due to cometabolic affects the enzymes used to degrade [[biphenyl]] have on PCBs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Due to in situ bioremediation taking place at the site of contamination there is a lessened risk of cross contamination as opposed to ex situ bioremediation where the polluted material is transported to other sites. In situ bioremediation can also have lower costs and a higher rate of decontamination than ex situ bioremediation.

{{Merge|Recursive data type|date=January 2018}}

In [[type theory]], a system has '''inductive types''' if it has facilities for creating a new type along with constants and functions that create terms of that type.  The feature serves a role similar to [[data structure]]s in a programming language and allows a type theory to add concepts like [[number]]s, [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], and [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]].  As the name suggests, inductive types can be self-referential, but usually only in a way that permits [[structural recursion]].

The standard example is encoding the [[natural number]]s using [[Peano axioms|Peano's encoding]].
&lt;source lang="coq"&gt;
 Inductive nat : Type :=
   | 0 : nat
   | S : nat -&gt; nat.
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, a natural number is created either from the constant "0" or by applying the function "S" to another natural number.  "S" is the [[successor function]] which represents adding 1 to a number.  Thus, "0" is zero, "S 0" is one, "S (S 0)" is two, "S (S (S 0))" is three, and so on.

Since their introduction, inductive types have been extended to encode more and more structures, while still being [[Impredicative|predicative]] and supporting structural recursion.

== Elimination ==

Inductive types usually come with a function to prove properties about them.  Thus, "nat" may come with:
&lt;source lang="coq"&gt;
 nat_elim : (forall P : nat -&gt; Prop, (P 0) -&gt; (forall n, P n -&gt; P (S n)) -&gt; (forall n, P n)).
&lt;/source&gt;
This is the expected function for structural recursion for the type "nat".

== Implementations ==

=== W- and M-types ===

W-types are [[Well-founded relation|well-founded]] types in [[intuitionistic type theory]] (ITT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://intuitionistic.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/martin-lof-tt.pdf|title=Intuitionistic type theory|last=Martin-Löf|first=Per|date=1984|publisher=Bibliopolis|others=Sambin, Giovanni|isbn=8870881059|location=Napoli|oclc=12731401}}&lt;/ref&gt; They generalize natural numbers, lists, binary trees, and other "tree-shaped" data types. Let {{var|U}} be a [[Universe (mathematics)#In type theory|universe of types]]. Given a type {{var|A}} : {{var|U}} and a [[Dependent type|dependent family]] {{var|B}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|U}}, one can form a W-type &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{W}_{(a:A)} B(a)&lt;/math&gt;. The type {{var|A}} may be thought of as "labels" for the (potentially infinitely many) constructors of the inductive type being defined, whereas {{var|B}} indicates the (potentially infinite) [[arity]] of each constructor. W-types (resp. M-types) may also be understood as well-founded (resp. non-well-founded) trees with nodes labeled by elements {{var|a}} : {{var|A}} and where the node labeled by {{var|a}} has {{var|B}}({{var|a}})-many subtrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Ahrens|first=Benedikt|last2=Capriotti|first2=Paolo|last3=Spadotti|first3=Régis|date=2015-04-12|title=Non-wellfounded trees in Homotopy Type Theory|eprint=1504.02949|class=cs.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let '''0''', '''1''', '''2''', etc. be finite types with inhabitants 1&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt; : '''1''', 1&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;, 2&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;:'''2''', etc. One may define the natural numbers as the W-type

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\mathbb{N}:= \mathsf{W}_{(x:\mathbf{2})} f(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

with {{var|f}} : '''2''' → {{var|U}} is defined by {{var|f}}(1&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''0''' (representing the constructor for zero, which takes no arguments), and {{var|f}}(2&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''1''' (representing the successor function, which takes one argument).

One may define lists over a type {{var|A}} : {{var|U}} as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{List}(A) := \mathsf{W}_{(x:\mathbf{1}+A)} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  f(\operatorname{inl}(1_{\mathbf{1}})) &amp;= \mathbf{0} \\
  f(\operatorname{inr}(a)) &amp;= \mathbf{1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and 1&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sole inhabitant of '''1'''. The value of &lt;math&gt;f(\operatorname{inl}(1_{\mathbf{1}}))&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the constructor for the empty list, whereas the value of &lt;math&gt;f(\operatorname{inr}(a))&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the constructor that appends {{var|a}} to the beginning of another list.

The constructor for elements of a generic W-type &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{W}_{(a:A)} B(a)&lt;/math&gt; has type
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\mathsf{sup}:\prod_{(a:A)}\Big(B(a)\to\mathsf{W}_{(x:A)}B(x)\Big)\to \mathsf{W}_{(x:A)} B(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
We can also write this rule in the style of a [[natural deduction]] proof,
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\frac{
  a:A
  \qquad
  f:B(a)\to\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a)
}{
  \mathsf{sup}(a,f):\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a)
}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The elimination rule for W-types works similarly to [[structural induction]] on trees. If, whenever a property (under the [[Curry–Howard correspondence|propositions-as-types]] interpretation) {{var|C}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|U}} holds for all subtrees of a given tree it also holds for that tree, then it holds for all trees.

:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\frac{
  w:\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a)
  \qquad
  a:A, \; f:B(a)\to\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a), \;
  c:\prod_{b:B(a)} C(f(b))
  \;\vdash\; h(a,f,c):C(\mathsf{sup}(a,f))
}{
  \mathsf{elim}(w, h):C(w)
}
&lt;/math&gt;

In extensional type theories, W-types (resp. M-types) can be defined up to [[isomorphism]] as [[initial algebra]]s (resp. final coalgebras) for [[polynomial functor]]s. In this case, the property of initiality (res. finality) corresponds directly to the appropriate induction principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=Representing inductively defined sets by wellorderings in Martin-Löf's type theory|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(96)00145-4|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=176|issue=1–2|pages=329–335|doi=10.1016/s0304-3975(96)00145-4|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In intensional type theories with the [[univalence axiom]], this correspondence holds up to homotopy (propositional equality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Awodey|first=Steve|last2=Gambino|first2=Nicola|last3=Sojakova|first3=Kristina|date=2012-01-18|title=Inductive types in homotopy type theory|eprint=1201.3898|class=math.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Ahrens|first=Benedikt|last2=Capriotti|first2=Paolo|last3=Spadotti|first3=Régis|date=2015-04-12|title=Non-wellfounded trees in Homotopy Type Theory|eprint=1504.02949|class=cs.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Awodey|first=Steve|last2=Gambino|first2=Nicola|last3=Sojakova|first3=Kristina|date=2015-04-21|title=Homotopy-initial algebras in type theory|eprint=1504.05531 |class=math.LO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M-types are [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to W-types, they represent [[Coinduction|coinductive]] (potentially infinite) data such as [[Stream (computer science)|streams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Berg|first=Benno|last2=Marchi|first2=Federico De|title=Non-well-founded trees in categories|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apal.2006.12.001|journal=Annals of Pure and Applied Logic|volume=146|issue=1|pages=40–59|doi=10.1016/j.apal.2006.12.001|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-types can be derived from W-types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Michael|last2=Altenkirch|first2=Thorsten|last3=Ghani|first3=Neil|title=Containers: Constructing strictly positive types|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2005.06.002|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=342|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2005.06.002|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mutually inductive definitions ===

This technique allows ''some'' definitions of multiple types that depend on each other. For example, defining two [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] predicates on [[natural number]]s using two mutually inductive types in [[Coq]]:

&lt;source lang="coq"&gt;
Inductive even : nat -&gt; Prop :=
  | zero_is_even : even O
  | S_of_odd_is_even : (forall n:nat, odd n -&gt; even (S n))
with odd : nat -&gt; Prop :=
  | S_of_even_is_odd : (forall n:nat, even n -&gt; odd (S n)).
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Induction-recursion ===

[[Induction-recursion (type theory)|Induction-recursion]] started as a study into the limits of ITT.  Once found, the limits were turned into rules that allowed defining new inductive types.  These types could depend upon a function and the function on the type, as long as both were defined simultaneously.

[[Universe type]]s can be defined using induction-recursion.

=== Induction-induction ===

[[Induction-induction]] allows definition of a type and a family of types at the same time.  So, a type {{mvar|A}} and a family of types &lt;math&gt;B : A \to Type&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Higher inductive types ===

This is a current research area in [[Homotopy type theory|Homotopy Type Theory]] (HoTT).  HoTT differs from ITT by its identity type (equality).  Higher inductive types not only define a new type with constants and functions that create the type, but also new instances of the identity type that relate them.

A simple example is the {{mvar|circle}} type, which is defined with two constructors, a basepoint;

:{{math|''base'' : ''circle''}}

and a loop;

:{{math|1=''loop'' : ''base'' = ''base''.}}

The existence of a new constructor for the identity type makes {{mvar|circle}} a higher inductive type.

The United Nations coordinated an '''International Conference on Population and Development''' (ICPD) in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5–13 September 1994. Its resulting Programme of Action is the steering document for the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).

Some 20,000 delegates from various governments, UN agencies, NGOs, and the media gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including immigration, [[infant mortality]], [[birth control]], [[family planning]], the [[female education|education of women]], and protection for women from unsafe abortion services.

The conference received considerable media attention due to disputes regarding the assertion of [[reproductive rights]]. The [[Holy See]] and several predominantly [[Islam]]ic nations were staunch critics, and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] received considerable criticism from [[Conservatism|conservatives]] for his participation, considering the fact that president [[Ronald Reagan]] did not attend or fund the previous conference held in Mexico City in 1984. The official spokesman for the Holy See was archbishop [[Renato Martino]].

According to the official ICPD release, the conference delegates achieved consensus on the following four qualitative and quantitative goals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/public/site/global/publications/pid/1973 "Report of the International Conference on Population and Development"], [[UNFPA]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Universal education''': Universal primary education in all countries by 2015. Urge countries to provide wider access to women for secondary and higher level education as well as vocational and technical training.
#'''Reduction of infant and [[child mortality]]''': Countries should strive to reduce infant and under-5 child mortality rates by one-third or to 50–70 deaths per 1000 by the year 2000. By 2015 all countries should aim to achieve a rate below 35 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality rate below 45 per 1,000. 	
#'''Reduction of [[maternal mortality]]''': A reduction by {{sfrac|1|2}} the 1990 levels by 2000 and {{sfrac|1|2}} of that by 2015. Disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups should be narrowed. 	
#'''Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning''': Family-planning counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility, prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, infertility, and delivery should be made available. Active discouragement of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).

==ICPD and abortion==
During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term 'reproductive health' in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. 
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council's commitment to promote 'reproductive health' did not include the promotion of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term 'reproductive health' include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” – Antonione, Council: “No.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

"The term 'reproductive health' was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of 'reproductive health' to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''."&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
With regard to the US, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President [[Al Gore]], had stated for the record:
 
"Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning."&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, [[Ellen Sauerbrey]], when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: 
"nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion".&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She added: "There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition".&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ye principal clovris of ye clanne Stewart tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|thumb|"Ancient" Scottish [[clan tartan]]s are an example of an invented tradition created in the 19th century.]]
The '''invention of tradition''' is a concept made prominent in the eponymous 1983 book edited by British [[Marxist]] intellectual [[E. J. Hobsbawm]] and [[Terrence Ranger|T. O. Ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Invention of Tradition | editor = Eric Hobsbawm &amp; Terence Ranger | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0521246453}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their Introduction the editors argue that many "[[tradition]]s" which "appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented."&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm &amp; Ranger (1983), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They distinguish the "invention" of traditions in this sense from "starting" or "initiating" a tradition which does not then claim to be old. The phenomenon is particularly clear in the modern development of the [[nation]] and of [[nationalism]], creating a national identity promoting national unity, and legitimising certain institutions or cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;The articles in the volume include Hugh Trevor-Roper's "The invention of tradition: the Highland tradition of Scotland," Prys Morgan's "From a death to a view: the hunt for the Welsh past in the romantic period," David Cannadine's "The context, performance and meaning of ritual: the British monarchy and the 'invention of tradition', c. 1820-1977," Bernard S. Cohen's "Representing authority in Victorian India," Terence Ranger's "The invention of tradition in colonial Africa," and Eric Hobsbawm's "Mass-producing traditions: Europe, 1870-1914."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of the term and paradox==
The concept and the term have been widely applied to cultural phenomena such as the Bible and Zionism,&lt;ref&gt;Nur Masalha, ''The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-Colonialism in Palestine-Israel''(London; New York: Zed Books 2007). {{LCCN|2006031826}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84277-761-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; the [[martial arts of Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vlastos, ed.,  ''Mirror of Modernity: Invented Traditions of Modern Japan'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[Tartanry|highland myth]]" in Scotland,&lt;ref name="Sievers2007"&gt;M. Sievers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_U-5sq5MDBQC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=tartan+highland+romantic&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=JqATTq_bD5Gy8QOpk7H8Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEIQ6wEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tartan%20highland%20romantic&amp;f=false ''The Highland Myth as an Invented Tradition of 18th and 19th Century and Its Significance for the Image of Scotland''] (GRIN Verlag, 2007), {{ISBN|3-638-81651-6}}, pp. 22-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and the traditions of [[Major religious groups|major religions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tomoko |last=Masuzawa |title=The Invention of World Religions|location=Chicago [[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-50989-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mention only a few. The concept was influential on the use of related concepts, such as [[Benedict Anderson]]'s [[imagined communities]] and the [[pizza effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderion, Benedict. "The origins of national consciousness." Nationalism: Critical Concepts in Political Science 1 (2000): 316, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

One implication of the term is that the sharp distinction between "tradition" and "[[modernity]]" is often itself invented. The concept is "highly relevant to that comparatively recent historical innovation, the 'nation,' with its associated phenomena: nationalism, the nation-state, national symbols, histories, and the rest." Hobsbawm and Ranger remark on the "curious but understandable paradox: modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion."&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa (2005), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Another implication is that the concept of "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]" is also to be questioned.

==Criticism==
One reviewer noted that the "'invention of tradition' is a splendidly subversive phrase," but it "hides serious ambiguities."  Hobsbawm "contrasts invented traditions with what he calls 'the strength and adaptability of genuine traditions.' But where does his 'adaptability', or his colleague Ranger's 'flexibility' end, and invention begin? Given that all traditions change, is it possible or useful to attempt to discriminate the 'genuine' antiques from the fakes?"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/571469 "Review"], ''The English Historical Review'' 101.398 (1986): 316-317.&lt;/ref&gt; Another also praised the high quality of the articles but had qualifications. "Such distinctions" (between invented and authentic traditions) "resolve themselves ultimately into one between the genuine and the spurious, a distinction that may be untenable because all traditions (like all symbolic phenomena) are humanly created ("spurious") rather than naturally given ("genuine")."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Handler, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/679222 "Review"], ''American Anthropologist'' 86.4  (1984): 1025-1026.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5211">In [[computer science]], the '''Krauss matching wildcards algorithm''' is a [[pattern matching]] algorithm. Based on the [[wildcard character|wildcard syntax]] in common use, e.g. in the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[command-line interface]], the algorithm provides a non-[[Recursion|recursive]] mechanism for matching patterns in software applications, based on syntax simpler than that typically offered by [[regular expression]]s.

== History ==
The algorithm is based on a history of development, correctness and performance testing, and programmer feedback that began with an unsuccessful search for a reliable non-recursive algorithm for matching wildcards. An initial algorithm, implemented in a single while loop, quickly prompted comments from software developers, leading to improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2008| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-algorithm/210200888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing comments and suggestions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=wild card searching| publisher=alt.os.development| year=2008| url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.os.development/8-rIaarASu8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=T.J.| title=wild card matching in text string| year=2014| publisher=Stack Overflow| url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21409588/wild-card-matching-in-text-string}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminated in a revised algorithm still implemented in a single while loop but refined based on a collection of [[test case]]s and a [[profiling (computer programming)|performance profiler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Empirical Way to Tame an Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2014| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-empirical-way-to-t/240169123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience tuning the single while loop using the profiler prompted development of a two-loop strategy that achieved further performance gains, particularly in situations involving empty input strings or input containing no wildcard characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Improved Algorithm for Big Data| publisher=Develop for Performance| year=2018| url=http://www.developforperformance.com/MatchingWildcards_AnImprovedAlgorithmForBigData.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-loop algorithm is available for use by the [[open-source software]] development community, under the terms of the [[Apache License]] v. 2.0, and is accompanied by test case code.

== Usage ==
The algorithm made available under the Apache license is implemented in both [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]-based [[C++]] and portable C++ (implemented without pointers). The test case code, also available under the Apache license, can be applied to any algorithm that provides the pattern matching operations below. The implementation as coded is unable to handle [[Variable-width encoding|multibyte character sets]] and poses problems when the text being searched may contain multiple incompatible character sets.

== Pattern matching operations ==
The algorithm supports three pattern matching operations:
* A one-to-one match is performed between the pattern and the source to be checked for a match, with the exception of asterisk ([[*]]) or question mark ([[?]]) characters in the pattern.
* An asterisk ([[*]]) character matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
* A question mark ([[?]]) character matches any single character.

== Examples ==
* ''*foo*''  	  matches any string containing "foo".
* ''mini*''       matches any string that begins with "mini" (including the string "mini" itself).
* ''???*''        matches any string of three or more letters.

== Applications ==
The original algorithm has been ported to the [[DataFlex]] programming language by Larry Heiges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Data Access Worldwide Code Library| last=Heiges| first=Larry| title=Text compare function - generalTextCompare.txt| year=2008| url=https://support.dataaccess.com/Forums/showthread.php?1064-Text-compare-function-generalTextCompare-txt-(0-1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use with [[Visual DataFlex|Data Access Worldwide]] code library. It has been posted on GitHub in modified form as part of a log file reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Deniskore| work=Popular repositories| title=Deniskore/wildcard/CLogReader.cpp| publisher=GitHub| year=2013| url=https://github.com/Deniskore/wildcard/blob/master/CLogReader.cpp}} Lines 173-279.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 algorithm is part of the Unreal Model Viewer built into the Epic Games [[Unreal Engine]] [[game engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=gildor2| work=Unreal Engine Model Viewer (UE Viewer)| title=UModel/Core/Core.cpp| publisher=GitHub| year=2016| url=https://github.com/gildor2/UModel/blob/master/Core/Core.cpp}} Lines 334-435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=gildor2| work=Unreal Engine Model Viewer (UE Viewer)| title=History for UModel/Core/Core.cpp| year=2016| url=https://github.com/gildor2/UModel/commits/master/Core/Core.cpp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37631">'''Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development''' constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist [[Jean Piaget]]. [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the [[University of Chicago]]&lt;ref name="Crain"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crain |first=William C. |title=Theories of Development |edition=2Rev |url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1985 |isbn=0-13-913617-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1958 and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.

The theory holds that [[moral reasoning]], the basis for [[ethics|ethical]] behavior, has six identifiable [[constructivism (learning theory)|developmental stages]], each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor.&lt;ref name="highest stage"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment | journal=Journal of Philosophy | volume=70 | year=1973 | pages=630–646 | doi=10.2307/2025030 | issue=18 | publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18 | jstor=2025030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget,&lt;ref name="piaget"&gt;{{cite book | last=Piaget | first=Jean | title=The Moral Judgment of the Child | publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co. | location=London | year=1932 |isbn=0-02-925240-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt; Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime,&lt;ref name="dissertation"&gt;{{cite thesis | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Development of Modes of Thinking and Choices in Years 10 to 16 | type=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=University of Chicago | year=1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.&lt;ref name="philmoral"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= Essays on Moral Development, Vol. I: The Philosophy of Moral Development |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco, CA |year=1981 |isbn=0-06-064760-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | authorlink=Lawrence Kohlberg |author2=Charles Levine |author3=Alexandra Hewer  | title=Moral stages : a current formulation and a response to critics | publisher=Karger | location=Basel, NY | year=1983 |isbn=3-8055-3716-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels of morality: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional morality.

For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the [[Heinz dilemma]], and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion,&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt; and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.&lt;ref name="istoought"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= From ''Is'' to ''Ought'': How to Commit the Naturalistic Fallacy and Get Away with It in the Study of Moral Development |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |editor-first=T. | editor-last=Lickona |title=Moral Development and Behavior: Theory, Research and Social Issues |publisher=Rinehart and Winston |location=Holt, NY |year=1976 |chapter= Moral stages and moralization: The cognitive-developmental approach }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement"&gt;{{cite book |last=Colby |first=Anne |author2=Kohlberg, L.  |title=The Measurement of Moral Judgment Vol. 2: Standard Issue Scoring Manual |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1987 | isbn=0-521-24447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring;&lt;ref name="gilligan"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gilligan | first=Carol | title=[[In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and Morality]] | journal=Harvard Educational Review | volume=47 | issue=4 | year=1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly ''post hoc'' rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists) of essentially intuitive decisions.&lt;ref name=Haidt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=J|title=The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to  moral judgment|journal=Psychological Review|year=2001|volume=108|pages=814–834 |url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/home.html|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.4.814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory,&lt;!-- incomplete citation: "Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Reasoning
Encyclopedia of Childhood and Adolescence" Dianne K. Daeg de Mott --&gt; and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haggbloom | first1 = S.J. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 139–15 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm Section on Kohlberg's stages from "Theories of Development" by W.C. Crain (1985)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
Kohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt; Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a [[Theory of cognitive development#Piaget's four stages|stage model]], as described in his [[theory of cognitive development]], it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Lawrence, J. |date=February 1989 |title=A longitudinal study of moral reasoning |journal=Child Development |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=157–166 |doi=10.2307/1131081 |pmid=2702866 |publisher=Child Development, Vol. 60, No. 1 |jstor=1131081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colby"&gt;

===Pre-conventional===
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement"/&gt;

In '''Stage one''' (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." The worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.&lt;ref name="socialpersonalitydev"&gt;{{cite book | last=Shaffer | first=David R. | title=Social and Personality Development | edition=5th | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | year=2004 |isbn=0-534-60700-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.&lt;ref name="edmoraldevfaith"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=Education, Moral Development and Faith | journal=Journal of Moral Education | volume=4 | date=Oct 1974 | pages=5–16 | doi=10.1080/0305724740040102 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is "deference to superior power or prestige".&lt;ref name="edmoraldevfaith" /&gt;

An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.

'''Stage two''' (self-interest driven) expresses the "what's in it for me" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or [[intrinsic]] respect, but rather a "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality.&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt; The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as [[moral relativism|morally relative]].

An example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, "what's in it for me?" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.

===Conventional===
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of [[adolescents]] and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt;

In '''Stage three''' (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a "good boy" or "good girl" to live up to these expectations,&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt; having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the "[[ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]]". "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that "they mean well".&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt;

In '''Stage four''' (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, [[dictum]]s, and [[social convention]]s because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; [[culpability]] is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt;

===Post-conventional===
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual's own perspective may take precedence over society's view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt;

In '''Stage five''' (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as [[social contract]]s rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet "the greatest good for the greatest number of people".&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; This is achieved through [[majority decision]] and inevitable [[compromise]]. [[Democratic government]] is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.

In '''Stage six''' (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on [[abstraction|abstract reasoning]] using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. [[Natural and legal rights|Legal rights]] are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for [[deontology|deontic]] moral action. Decisions are not reached [[hypothetical imperative|hypothetically]] in a conditional way but rather [[categorical imperative|categorically]] in an absolute way, as in the [[Kantian ethics|philosophy of Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="kant"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]] | title=[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]| publisher=Harper and Row Publishers, Inc | year=1964| isbn=0-06-131159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another's shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true.&lt;ref name="rawls"&gt;* {{cite book | last=Rawls | first=John | authorlink=John Rawls | title=[[A Theory of Justice]] | publisher=Belkap Press of Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, MA | year=1971 |isbn=0-674-01772-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; Touro College Researcher Arthur P. Sullivan helped  support the accuracy of Kohlberg's first five stages through data analysis, but could not provide statistical evidence for the existence of Kohlberg's sixth stage. Therefore, it is difficult to define/recognize as a concrete stage in moral development.

===Further stages===
In his empirical studies of individuals throughout their life, Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. &lt;!-- This was a startling result, which conflicted with his view of the stages as rigid and invariant. --&gt; This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to five, that shared characteristics of both.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt;

Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kohlberg | first1= Lawrence | last2=Power| first2=Clark | editor-first=Lawrence | editor-last=Kohlberg| title=Essays on Moral Development Vol. I: Philosophy of Moral Development | publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco, CA | year=1981 |isbn=0-06-064760-4 |chapter= Moral Development, Religious Thinking, and the Question of a Seventh Stage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining [[empirical evidence]] for even a sixth stage,&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.&lt;ref name="philmoral" /&gt;

==Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)==

Kohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral ''reasonings'' adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the ''form and structure'' of moral arguments is independent of the ''content'' of those arguments, a position he calls "[[formalism (philosophy)|formalism]]".&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;

Kohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of [[Deontological ethics|deontology]]&lt;ref name="kant" /&gt; and [[eudaimonia]].

Kohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as "[[moral universalism]]"):&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt; there can be no [[moral relativism|relativism]]. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are [[prescriptivity|prescriptive]]. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.

According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five).&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last.&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.

===Formal elements===
[[Image:Kohlberg moral stages vop.gif|right]]

Progress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called "[[justice operation]]". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: "[[egalitarianism|equality]]", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and "[[ethic of reciprocity|reciprocity]]", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as "moral [[musical chairs]]").&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt;

Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's "view of persons" and their "social perspective level", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The "view of persons" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely [[Allocentrism|socio-centric]].&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt; Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.

==Examples of applied moral dilemmas==
Kohlberg established the ''Moral Judgement Interview'' in his original 1958 dissertation.&lt;ref name="dissertation" /&gt; During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded [[structured interview|semi-structured interview]], the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of [[open-ended question]]s, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.&lt;ref name="dissertation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt;

A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the [[Heinz dilemma|druggist's dilemma]]: ''Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe''.&lt;ref name="philmoral" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
One criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. [[Carol Gilligan]] has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly [[androcentrism|androcentric]].&lt;ref name="gilligan"/&gt; Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women.&lt;ref name=Woolfolk&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolfolk|first=Anita|title=Educational Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780132893589|pages=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zp6aMQEACAAJ&amp;dq=anita+woolfolk+educational+psychology+12th+edition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g2ycUJr7KLCz0QGblIC4BA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved.&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waller|first=Bruce|title=Consider Ethics: Theory, Readings, and Contemporary Issues|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0321202805|pages=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZujkAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=consider+ethics+waller+2005&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QbapU8m3AoePqga8tYDwAQ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the [[ethics of care|ethics of caring]].&lt;ref name="gilligan" /&gt; Critics such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, ''The War Against Boys''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures.&lt;ref name="Crain" /&gt; Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.&lt;ref name="Harkness"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Harkness| first1=Sara | first2=Carolyn P. | last2=Edwards | first3=Charles M. | last3=Super | title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment | journal=Developmental Psychology | volume=17 | year=1981 | pages=595–603 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.5.595 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.&lt;ref name="Crain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kohlberg/gilligan"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= The Adolescent as a Philosopher: The Discovery of the Self in a Postconventional World |publisher= Daedalus |year= 1971|author2=Carol Gilligan  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements.&lt;ref name=Parke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parke|first1=R. D.|last2=Gauvain|first2=M.|last3=Schmuckler|first3=M. A.|title=Child psychology : a contemporary viewpoint|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|location=Whitby, ON|isbn=0070782385|edition=3rd Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e. stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e. stage four).&lt;ref name=Parke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carpendale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpendale|first=J|title=Kohlberg and Piaget on Stages and Moral Reasoning|journal=Developmental Review|date=1 June 2000|volume=20|issue=2|pages=181–205|doi=10.1006/drev.1999.0500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning.&lt;ref name=Parke/&gt; Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules.&lt;ref name=Carpendale/&gt; This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives.&lt;ref name=Parke/&gt; Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=Dennis L.|author2=Denton, Kathy |title=Toward a More Pragmatic Approach to Morality: A Critical Evaluation of Kohlberg's Model.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 2005|volume=112|issue=3|pages=629–649|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.3.629|url=https://www.sfu.ca/psyc/faculty/krebs/publications/Toward%20a%20More%20Pragmatic%20Approach%20to%20Morality.pdf|pmid=16060754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of [[formal reasoning]]. [[Social intuitionism|Social intuitionists]] such as [[Jonathan Haidt]], for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, [[human rights]], or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other [[rationalist]] psychologists could be considered ''[[post hoc theorizing|post hoc]]'' rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.&lt;ref name=Haidt /&gt;

==Continued relevance==
Kohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the ''[[Defining Issues Test]]'' (''DIT'') created in 1979 by [[James Rest]],&lt;ref name="judgingmoralissues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |title=Development in Judging Moral Issues |year=1979 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-0891-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview.&lt;ref name="DIT-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rest |first1=James |authorlink1=James Rest |last2=Narvaez|first2=D.|last3=Bebeau|first3=M.|last4=Thoma|first4=S. |year=1999 |title=DIT-2: Devising and testing a new instrument of moral judgment |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=644–659 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.4.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the [[Test validity|validity]] criteria by using a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] test, the [[Likert scale]], to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's.&lt;ref name="CSEDdilemma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforthestudyofethicaldevelopment.net/DIT%20--Sample%20Dilemma.htm |title=Center for the Study of Ethical Development |accessdate=2006-12-05 |format=Website |work=DIT --Sample Dilemma: Heinz and the Drug |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629030232/http://www.centerforthestudyofethicaldevelopment.net/DIT%20--Sample%20Dilemma.htm |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of "post-conventional thinking".&lt;ref name="neokohlbergian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rest |first1=James |authorlink1=James Rest |last2=Narvaez|first2=D.|last3=Bebeau|first3=M.|last4=Thoma|first4=S. |year=1999 |title=A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach: The DIT and Schema Theory |journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=291–324 |doi=10.1023/A:1022053215271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="postconventional"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rest |first1=James |authorlink1=James Rest |last2=Narvaez|first2=D.|last3=Bebeau|first3=M.|last4=Thoma|first4=S. |title=Postconventional Moral Thinking: A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach |year=1999 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3285-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the ''DIT'' was revised as the ''DIT-2'';&lt;ref name="DIT-2" /&gt; the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required,&lt;ref name="restresearchtheory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |others=In collaboration with Barnett, R.; Bebeau, M.; Deemer, D.; Getz, I.; Moon, Y.; Spickelmeier, J.; Thoma, S. and Volker, J. |title=Moral development: Advances in research and theory |year=1986 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |isbn=0-275-92254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as divinity, politics, and medicine.&lt;ref name="DITdivinitystudents"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bunch |first=Wilton H. |year=2005|title=Changing moral judgement in divinity students |journal=Journal of Moral Education |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=363–370|doi=10.1080/03057240500211543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DITpolitical"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muhlberger |first=P. |year=2000 |title=Moral reasoning effects on political participation |journal=Political Psychology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=667–695 |doi=10.1111/0162-895X.00212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIThealthstudents"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hedl |first1=John J.|last2=Glazer|first2=H.|last3=Chan|first3=F.|year=2005 |title=Improving the Moral Reasoning of Allied Health Students |journal=Journal of Allied Health |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=121–122 |pmid=16032920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32153">This is a '''list of bordering countries with the greatest relative differences in GDP (PPP) per person'''; specifically those pairs of neighbouring countries where the richer country is at least twice as wealthy on a per capita basis than the poorer. These statistics however do not consider differences in other economic indicators that measure welfare, such as their [[human development index]], or inequality within countries.

== Characteristics ==
The greatest cases of inequity typically would involve an impoverished and politically unstable country neighbouring a resource-rich and relatively stable one, although neither may be recognised as a [[high-income economy]]. As an extreme example, the GDP per capita for [[Saudi Arabia]], is over 42 times greater to that of its neighbour [[Yemen]]. In the four biggest ratios, the poorer country is either [[Yemen]] or [[North Korea]].


Due to lack of economic data, the [[Vatican City]] (which is surrounded by [[Italy]]), [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] (which shares the island of [[Saint Martin]] with [[Sint Maarten]]) and the [[British Overseas Territory|British Overseas Territories]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] located in the island of [[Cyprus]], are not included in this list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13447">In [[formal ontology]], a branch of [[metaphysics]], and in [[ontology (computer science)|ontological computer science]], '''mereotopology''' is a [[first-order theory]], embodying [[mereology|mereological]] and [[topological]] concepts, of the relations among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]] between parts. 

==History and motivation==
Mereotopology begins in philosophy with theories articulated by [[A. N. Whitehead]] in several books and articles he published between 1916 and 1929, drawing in part on the mereogeometry of De Laguna (1922). The first to have proposed the idea of a point-free definition of the concept of topological space in mathematics was [[Karl Menger]] in his book ''Dimensionstheorie'' (1928) -- see also his (1940). The early historical background of mereotopology is documented in Bélanger and Marquis (2013) and Whitehead's early work is discussed in Kneebone (1963: chpt. 13.5) and Simons (1987: 2.9.1).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Peter Simons, "Whitehead and Mereology", in Guillaume Durand et [[Michel Weber]] (éditeurs), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279950/Les_principes_de_la_connaissance_naturelle_dAlfred_North_Whitehead_-_Alfred_North_Whiteheads_Principles_of_Natural_Knowledge Les principes de la connaissance naturelle d’Alfred North Whitehead — Alfred North Whitehead’s Principles of Natural Knowledge]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, ontos verlag, 2007. See also the relevant entries of [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond, (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Whitehead's 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'' augmented the part-whole relation with topological notions such as [[contact (mathematics)|contiguity]] and [[connected space|connection]]. Despite Whitehead's acumen as a mathematician, his theories were insufficiently formal, even flawed. By showing how Whitehead's theories could be fully formalized and repaired, Clarke (1981, 1985) founded contemporary mereotopology.&lt;ref&gt;Casati &amp; Varzi (1999: chpt. 4) and Biacino &amp; Gerla (1991) have reservations about some aspects of Clarke's formulation.&lt;/ref&gt; The theories of Clarke and Whitehead are discussed in Simons (1987: 2.10.2), and Lucas (2000: chpt. 10). The entry [[Whitehead's point-free geometry]] includes two contemporary treatments of Whitehead's theories, due to Giangiacomo Gerla, each different from the theory set out in the next section.

Although mereotopology is a mathematical theory, we owe its subsequent development to [[logic]]ians and theoretical [[computer science|computer scientists]]. Lucas (2000: chpt. 10) and Casati and Varzi (1999: chpts. 4,5) are introductions to mereotopology that can be read by anyone having done a course in [[first-order logic]]. More advanced treatments of mereotopology include Cohn and Varzi (2003) and, for the mathematically sophisticated, Roeper (1997). For a mathematical treatment of [[point-free geometry]], see Gerla (1995).  [[lattice (order)|Lattice]]-theoretic ([[algebraic structure|algebraic]]) treatments of mereotopology as [[contact algebra]]s have been applied to separate the [[topology|topological]] from the [[mereology|mereological]] structure, see Stell (2000), Düntsch and Winter (2004).

==Applications==
[[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] (1996), Anthony Cohn, [[Achille Varzi (philosopher) | Achille Varzi]] and their co-authors have shown that mereotopology can be useful in [[formal ontology]] and [[ontology (computer science)|computer science]], by allowing the formalization of relations such as [[contact (mathematics)|contact]], [[connected space|connection]], [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], [[interior (topology)|interior]]s, holes, and so on. Mereotopology has been applied also as a tool for qualitative [[spatial-temporal reasoning]], with constraint calculi such as the [[Region Connection Calculus]] (RCC). It provides the starting point for the theory of fiat boundaries developed by Smith and Varzi (2000), which grew out of the attempt to distinguish formally between 
*boundaries (in geography, geopolitics, and other domains) which reflect more or less arbitrary human demarcations and
*boundaries which reflect bona fide physical discontinuities (Smith 1995, 2001). 
Mereotopology is being applied by Salustri in the domain of digital manufacturing (Salustri, 2002) and by Smith and Varzi to the formalization of basic notions of ecology and environmental biology (Smith and Varzi, 1999, 2002). It has been applied also to deal with vague boundaries in geography (Smith and Mark, 2003), in [[ecological psychology]] (Smith, 2000), and in the study of vagueness and granularity (Smith and Brogaard, 2002, Bittner and Smith, 2001, 2001a).

==Preferred approach of Casati &amp; Varzi==
Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt.4) set out a variety of mereotopological theories in a consistent notation. This section sets out several nested theories that culminate in their preferred theory '''GEMTC''', and follows their exposition closely. The mereological part of '''GEMTC''' is the conventional theory '''[[mereology|GEM]]'''. Casati and Varzi do not say if the [[model theory|models]] of '''GEMTC''' include any conventional [[topological space]]s.

We begin with some [[domain of discourse]], whose elements are called [[individual]]s (a [[synonym]] for [[mereology]] is "the calculus of individuals"). Casati and Varzi prefer limiting the ontology to physical objects, but others freely employ mereotopology to reason about geometric figures and events, and to solve problems posed by research in [[machine intelligence]].

An upper case Latin letter denotes both a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] and the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] letter referring to that relation in [[first-order logic]]. Lower case letters from the end of the alphabet denote variables ranging over the domain; letters from the start of the alphabet are names of arbitrary individuals. If a formula begins with an [[atomic formula]] followed by the [[biconditional]], the subformula to the right of the biconditional is a definition of the atomic formula, whose variables are [[bound variable|unbound]]. Otherwise, variables not explicitly quantified are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]]. The axiom '''Cn''' below corresponds to axiom '''C.n''' in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 4).

We begin with a topological primitive, a [[binary relation]] called ''connection''; the atomic formula ''Cxy'' denotes that "''x'' is connected to ''y''." Connection is governed, at minimum, by the axioms:

'''C1'''. &lt;math&gt;\ Cxx.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Reflexive relation|reflexive]])

'''C2'''. &lt;math&gt; Cxy \rightarrow Cyx.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Symmetric relation|symmetric]])

Now posit the binary relation ''E'', defined as:

&lt;math&gt;Exy \leftrightarrow [Czx \rightarrow Czy].&lt;/math&gt;

''Exy'' is read as "''y'' encloses ''x''" and is also topological in nature. A consequence of '''C1-2''' is that ''E'' is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]], and hence a [[preorder]]. If ''E'' is also assumed [[axiom of extensionality|extensional]], so that:

&lt;math&gt; (Exa \leftrightarrow Exb) \leftrightarrow (a=b),&lt;/math&gt;

then ''E'' can be proved [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and thus becomes a [[partial order]]. Enclosure, notated ''xKy'', is the single primitive relation of the [[Whitehead's point-free geometry|theories in Whitehead (1919, 1925)]], the starting point of mereotopology. 

Let ''parthood'' be the defining primitive [[binary relation]] of the underlying [[mereology]], and let the [[atomic formula]] ''Pxy'' denote that "''x'' is part of ''y''". We assume that ''P'' is a [[partial order]]. Call the resulting minimalist mereological theory '''M'''. 

If ''x'' is part of ''y'', we postulate that ''y'' encloses ''x'':

'''C3'''. &lt;math&gt;\ Pxy \rightarrow Exy.&lt;/math&gt;

'''C3''' nicely connects [[mereology|mereological]] parthood to [[topological]] enclosure.

Let ''O'', the binary relation of mereological ''overlap'', be defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Oxy \leftrightarrow \exist z[Pzx \land\ Pzy].&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''Oxy'' denote that "''x'' and ''y'' overlap." With ''O'' in hand, a consequence of '''C3''' is:

&lt;math&gt;Oxy \rightarrow Cxy.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the [[Conversion (logic)|converse]] does not necessarily hold. While things that overlap are necessarily connected, connected things do not necessarily overlap. If this were not the case, [[topology]] would merely be a model of [[mereology]] (in which "overlap" is always either primitive or defined).

Ground mereotopology ('''MT''') is the theory consisting of primitive ''C'' and ''P'', defined ''E'' and ''O'', the axioms '''C1-3''', and axioms assuring that ''P'' is a [[partial order]]. Replacing the '''M''' in '''MT''' with the standard [[axiom of extension|extensional]] mereology '''[[mereology|GEM]]''' results in the theory '''GEMT'''.

Let ''IPxy'' denote that "''x'' is an internal part of ''y''." ''IP'' is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;IPxy \leftrightarrow (Pxy \land (Czx \rightarrow Ozy)).&lt;/math&gt;

Let σ''x'' φ(''x'') denote the mereological sum (fusion) of all individuals in the domain satisfying φ(''x''). σ is a [[bound variable|variable binding]] [[Substring|prefix]] operator. The axioms of '''GEM''' assure that this sum exists if φ(''x'') is a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]]. With σ and the relation ''IP'' in hand, we can define the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''x'', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}x,&lt;/math&gt; as the mereological sum of all interior parts ''z'' of ''x'', or:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}x =&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sigma z[IPzx].&lt;/math&gt;

Two easy consequences of this definition are:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}W = W,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the universal individual, and

'''C5'''.&lt;ref&gt;The axiom '''C4''' of Casati and Varzi (1999) is irrelevant to this entry.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\ P(\mathbf{i}x)x.&lt;/math&gt; ([[inclusion (set theory)|Inclusion]])

The operator '''i''' has two more axiomatic properties:

'''C6'''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{i}x) = \mathbf{i}x.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Idempotence]])

'''C7'''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}(x \times y) = \mathbf{i}x \times \mathbf{i}y,&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''a''&amp;times;''b'' is the mereological product of ''a'' and ''b'', not defined when ''Oab'' is false. '''i''' distributes over product.

It can now be seen that '''i''' is [[isomorphic]] to the [[interior operator]] of [[topology]]. Hence the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of '''i''', the topological [[closure operator]] '''c''', can be defined in terms of '''i''', and [[Kuratowski]]'s axioms for '''c''' are theorems. Likewise, given an axiomatization of '''c''' that is analogous to '''C5-7''', '''i''' may be defined in terms of '''c''', and '''C5-7''' become theorems.  Adding '''C5-7''' to '''GEMT''' results in Casati and Varzi's preferred mereotopological theory, '''GEMTC'''.

''x'' is ''self-connected'' if it satisfies the following predicate:

&lt;math&gt; SCx \leftrightarrow ((Owx \leftrightarrow (Owy \lor Owz)) \rightarrow Cyz).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the primitive and defined predicates of '''MT''' alone suffice for this definition. The predicate ''SC'' enables formalizing the necessary condition given in [[A. N. Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Process and Reality]]'' for the mereological sum of two individuals to exist: they must be connected. Formally:

'''C8'''. &lt;math&gt; Cxy \rightarrow \exist z[SCz \land Ozx \land (Pwz \rightarrow (Owx \lor Owy)).&lt;/math&gt;

Given some mereotopology '''X''', adding '''C8''' to '''X'''  results in what Casati and Varzi call the ''Whiteheadian extension'' of '''X''', denoted '''WX'''. Hence the theory whose axioms are '''C1-8''' is '''WGEMTC'''.

The converse of '''C8''' is a '''GEMTC''' theorem. Hence given the axioms of '''GEMTC''', ''C'' is a defined predicate if ''O'' and ''SC'' are taken as primitive predicates.

If the underlying mereology is [[Atomic formula|atom]]less and weaker than '''GEM''', the axiom that assures the absence of atoms ('''P9''' in Casati and Varzi 1999) may be replaced by '''C9''', which postulates that no individual has a [[boundary (topology)|topological boundary]]:

'''C9'''. &lt;math&gt; \forall x \exist y[Pyx \land (Czy \rightarrow Ozx) \land \lnot (Pxy \land (Czx \rightarrow Ozy))].&lt;/math&gt;

When the domain consists of geometric figures, the boundaries can be points, curves, and surfaces. What boundaries could mean, given other ontologies, is not an easy matter and is discussed in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 5).

'''Mind monkey''' or '''monkey mind''', from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''xinyuan'' and [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] ''shin'en'' 心猿 [lit. "heart-/mind-monkey"], is a [[Buddhist]] term meaning "unsettled; restless; capricious; whimsical; fanciful; inconstant; confused; indecisive; uncontrollable". In addition to Buddhist writings, including Chan or [[Zen]], [[Consciousness-only]], [[Pure Land]], and [[Shingon]], this "mind-monkey" psychological metaphor was adopted in [[Taoism]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], poetry, drama, and literature. "Mind-monkey" occurs in two reversible [[Chengyu|four-character idioms]] with ''yima'' or ''iba'' 意馬 [lit. "thought-/will-horse"], most frequently used in Chinese ''xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 and Japanese ''ibashin'en'' 意馬心猿. The "Monkey King" [[Sun Wukong]] in the ''[[Journey to the West]]'' personifies the mind-monkey. Note that much of the following summarizes Carr (1993).

==Linguistic and cultural background==
"Mind-monkey" 心猿 is an exemplary [[animal metaphor]]. Some figures of speech are cross-linguistically common, verging upon [[linguistic universal]]s; many languages use "monkey" or "ape" words to mean "mimic", for instance, Italian [[Wikt:scimmiottare|scimmiottare]] "to mock; to mimic" &lt; [[Wikt:scimmia|scimmia]] "monkey; ape", Japanese ''sarumane'' 猿真似 [lit. "monkey imitation"] "copycat; superficial imitation", and English ''[[monkey see, monkey do]]'' or ''[[Wikt:ape|to ape]]''). Other animal metaphors have culture-specific meanings; compare English ''[[Wikt:chickenhearted|chickenhearted]]'' "cowardly; timid'; easily frightened" and Chinese ''jixin'' 雞心 [lit. "chicken heart"] "heart-shaped; cordate".

The four [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] elements of Chinese ''xinyuanyima'' or Japanese ''shin'en'iba'' are ''xin'' or ''shin'' 心 "heart; mind", ''yi'' or ''i'' 意 "thought", ''yuan'' or ''en'' 猿 "monkey", and ''ma'' or ''ba'' 馬 "horse"'.

===The 心 "heart; mind" and 意 "idea; will"===
The psychological components of the "mind-monkey will-horse" metaphor are Chinese ''xin'' or Sino-Japanese ''shin'' or ''kokoro'' [[Wikt:心|心]] "heart; mind; feelings, affections; center" and ''yi'' or ''i'' [[Wikt:意|意]] 'thought, idea; opinion, sentiment; will, wish; meaning'. This [[Chinese character]] 心 was graphically simplified from an original [[pictogram]] of a heart, and 意 "thought; think" is an [[ideogram]] combining 心 under ''yin'' [[Wikt:音|音]] "sound; tone; voice" denoting "sound in the mind; thought; idea".

In [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''xin''/''shin'' 心 "heart; mind" generally translates [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Wikt:citta|citta]]'' "the mind; state of mind; consciousness" and ''yi''/''i'' 意 translates Sanskrit ''[[Wikt:manas|manas]]'' "the mental organ; deliberation". Some Buddhist authors have used 心 and 意 interchangeably for "mind; cognition; thought". Compare these ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'' glosses 
*心 "Spirit, motive, sense. The mind as the seat of intelligence, mentality, idea. (Skt. ''citta'') … Thought, intellect, feeling; (Skt. ''mānasa'')"
*意 "Thought, intellect; (Skt. ''manas''; Tib. ''yid''); the mind; (Skt. ''citta''; Tib. ''sems'')".
For example, take the Buddhist word Chinese ''xin-yi-shi'' or Japanese ''shin-i-shiki'' 心意識 [lit. "mind, thought, and cognition"] that compounds three near-synonyms. [[Abhidharma]] theory uses this word as a general term for "mind; mentality", but [[Yogacara]] theory of [[Eight Consciousnesses]] distinguishes ''xin''/''shin'' 心 "[[store consciousness]]", ''yi''/''i'' 意 "''manas'' consciousness", and ''shi''/''shiki'' 識 "six object-contingent consciousnesses".

''Xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 [lit. "mind-monkey idea-horse"] "distracted; indecisive; restless" is comparable with some other Chinese [[collocation]]s.
*''xinmanyizu'' 心滿意足 ["heart-full mind-complete"] "perfectly content; fully satisfied"
*''xinhuiyilan'' 心灰意懶 ["heart-ashes mind-sluggish"] "disheartened; discouraged; hopeless" (or ''xinhuiyileng'' 心灰意冷 with ''leng'' "cold; frosty")
*''xinhuangyiluan'' 心慌意亂 ["heart-flustered mind-disordered"] "alarmed and hysterical; perturbed"
*''xinfanyiluan'' 心煩意亂 ["heart-vexed mind-disordered"] "terribly upset; confused and worried"

===The 猿 "monkey" and 馬 "horse"===
[[File:Marbleized Clay, Tri-Color Glazed of Monkey Piggy-Back on Horse.JPG|thumb|[[Sancai|Tri-color glaze]] porcelain, showing 猿 "monkey" and 馬 "horse". [[Tang dynasty]].]]
[[File:Chinesischer Maler des 10. Jahrhunderts (I) 001.jpg|thumb|''Gibbons and horses'', 10th-century [[Song dynasty]] painting]]
The animal components of the "mind-monkey will-horse" metaphor are Chinese ''yuan'' or Japanese ''en'' [[Wikt:猿|猿]] "gibbon; monkey; ape" and ''ma'' or ''ba'' [[Wikt:馬|馬]] "horse".

Chinese ''yuan'' 猿 (''yuan'' [[Wikt:猨|猨]] or ''nao'' [[Wikt:猱|猱]]) originally meant the "[[agile gibbon]], black-handed gibbon, ''Hylobates agilis''" but now generally means "ape; monkey" (e.g., ''yuanren'' 猿人 ["ape-man"] "[[Homo erectus]]; anthropoid apes'"). [[Robert van Gulik]] (1967:33) concludes that until about the 14th century, ''yuan'' designated the gibbon, but due to extensive deforestation, its habitat shrank to remote southern mountains; from then on, "the majority of Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids." Other common Chinese "monkey" names include ''feifei'' 狒狒 "[[hamadryas baboon]], ''Papio hamadryas''", ''hou'' [[Wikt:猴|猴]] "monkey; ape", and ''mihou'' 獼猴 (''muhou'' 母猴) or ''husun'' 猢猻 "[[rhesus macaque]], rhesus monkey, ''Macaca mulatta''", [[Victor H. Mair]] (1990:36) reconstructs Old Sinitic *''mug-gug'', which "probably ultimately derives from the same African word as English 'macaque'" and is reminiscent of Sanskrit "maraṭāsana ('monkey posture')" (see [[Hanumanasana]]). These "monkey; ape" characters combine the [[Wikt:犭|犭]] "dog [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]" with different [[phonetic]] elements, such as the ''yuan'' [[Wikt:袁|袁]] phonetic in ''yuan'' 猿.

In [[Chinese mythology]], ''yuan'' "gibbons" were supposedly long-lived because they could ''yinqi'' 引氣 ["pull [[qi]]"] "absorb life-force", which is a ''[[Tao Yin|daoyin]]'' 導引 ["guiding and pulling"] "Daoist gymnastic technique". [[Chinese classic texts]] mentioned "monkey leaping" and "monkey bowing" yoga (Miura 1989:354). One of the 2nd-century BCE [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] depicts 28 Daoist gymnastic exercises, many of which are named after animals, including number 22 ''muhou'' "macaque". In the present day, ''houquan'' 猴拳 ["monkey fist/boxing"] "[[Monkey Kung Fu]]" is a [[Chinese martial arts]] style and ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" is a Daoist breath meditation technique. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When one breathes in and out, one's concentration causes the generative force to rise and fall (in the microcosmic orbit) thus slowly turning the wheel of the law. Count from one to ten and then from ten to one hundred breaths with the heart (mind) following the counting to prevent it from wandering outside. When the heart and breathing are in unison, this is called ''locking up the monkey heart'' and ''tying up the running horse of intellect''. (Luk 1990:48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Japanese [[kanji]] 猿 is pronounced as Sino-Japanese ''en'' &lt; ''yuan'' or native ''saru'' "monkey", especially the indigenous "[[Japanese macaque]], ''Macaca fuscata''". In Japanese [[Shinto]] tradition, the monkey deity [[Sarutahiko]] was a divine messenger. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:41) contrasts how, "in earlier periods the dominant meaning of the monkey was that of mediator between deities and humans. Later in history, its meaning as a scapegoat became increasingly dominant."

Chinese ''ma'' 馬 "horse", which was the linguistic source for Sino-Japanese ''ba'' or ''ma'' 馬 "horse", originally referred to [[Przewalski's horse]] and later the [[Mongolian horse]], [[Ferghana horse]], etc. Horses were considered divine animals in both China (see Creel 1968) and Japan. For the Chinese, [[Edward H. Schafer]] says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was invested with sanctity by ancient tradition, endowed with prodigious qualities, and visibly stamped with the marks of his divine origin. A revered myth proclaimed him a relative of the dragon, akin to the mysterious powers of water. Indeed, all wonderful horses, such as the steed of the pious Hsüan-tsang which, in later legend [see the ''Xiyouji'' below], carried the sacred scriptures from India, were avatars of dragons, and in antiquity the tallest horses owned by the Chinese were called simply "dragons." (1963:59) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
For the Japanese, the ancient Shinto practice of offering ''shinme'' 神馬 "sacred (esp. white) horses" to shrines has evolved into the modern donation of symbolic ''[[Shinto]] [[Ema (Shinto)|ema]]'' 絵馬 [lit. "picture horse"] "votive tablets"'.

Besides the "mind-monkey idea-horse" metaphor, monkeys and horses have further associations. In [[Chinese astrology]], ''wu'' [[Wikt:午|午]] "[[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]]" and ''shen'' [[Wikt:申|申]] "[[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]]" are the 7th and 9th of the 12 zodiacal animals. In Chinese animal mythology, monkeys supposedly bring good health to horses. The ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (tr. Read 1931, no. 400) records the "custom of keeping a female monkey in the horse's stable to ward off sickness (the menstrual discharge of the monkey is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious diseases)".

==Early literary history of "mind-monkeys"==
This section summarizes Chinese and Japanese developments of ''xinyuan'' or ''shin'en'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''yima'' or ''iba'' 意馬 "idea-horse" collocations and their synonyms. The earliest known textual usages are presented chronologically.

===Chinese "mind monkey" collocations===
Chinese authors coined "mind monkey" expressions from the [[Later Qin|Later Qin Dynasty]] (384-417 CE) through the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE). In modern usage, some terms are considered [[Classical Chinese]], but others like ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" are [[Modern Standard Chinese]]. Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:154-159).

The c. 406 ''Weimojie suoshuo jing'' 維摩詰所說經 was [[Kumarajiva]]'s groundbreaking CE Chinese translation of the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]''. It introduced "mind-monkey" in the [[simile]] ''xin ru yuanhou'' 心如猨猴 "heart/mind like a monkey/ape" (with ''yuan'' 猿's [[variant Chinese character]] 猨). "Since the mind of one difficult to convert is like an ape, govern his mind by using certain methods and it can then be broken in" (tr. Dudbridge 1970:168). Carr (1993:169) suggests the subsequent line about ''xiang ma'' 象馬 "elephants and horses" having unruly natures could have affected the later ''yima'' "idea-horse" term.

The ''Mengyu chanhui shi'' 蒙預懺悔詩 "Poem Repenting Foolish Pleasure" is attributed to [[Emperor Jianwen of Liang]] (503-550 CE), who was a renowned author. This poem has the oldest known usage of ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey", but with (the possibly miscopied) ''aima'' 愛馬 "love-horse" instead of ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse". "The [三循/修] three disciplines/cultivations expel the [愛馬] love-horse, and the [六意/念] six recollections/ideas still the [心猿] mind-monkey." This Buddhistic poem has numerous graphic variants, including these ''sanxun'' 三循 "three disciplines" for ''sanxiu'' 三修 "three cultivations" (meditation on impermanence, awareness, and selflessness) and ''liuyi'' 六意 "six ideas" for ''liunian'' 六念 "six recollections" (mindfulness about [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[dharma]], [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]], precepts, almsgiving, and heaven). Based on these contextual graphic inconsistencies, Carr (1993:156) suggests the possibility that a [[scribe]] transposed Jianwen's original ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse" as ''aima'' 愛馬 "love-horse".

The ''Daci'ensi sanzang fashizhuan'' 大慈恩寺三藏法師傳 "Biography of the Tripitaka Dharma Master of the Temple of Great Compassionate Blessings" is a biography of [[Xuanzang]] (see the ''Xiyouji'' below) written by his disciple [[Kuiji]] (or Ci'en, the namesake temple in [[Luoyang]], see [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]]). This record of the Consciousness-Only ([[Yogacara]]) Buddhism, has a memorial dated 657 CE that parallels ''yima'' "idea-/will-horse" with ''qingyuan'' 情猿 "emotion-/feeling-monkey": "Now if you wish to entrust your thoughts to the Chan sect, you must make your mind as pure as still water, control your emotion-monkey's indolence and fidgeting, and restrain your idea-horse's haste and galloping."

The [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Xu Hun]] 許渾 ([[floruit|fl.]] 832-844) wrote the first known parallel between "mind-monkey" and "idea-horse." His ''Zengti Du yinju'' 贈題杜隱居 "Poem Written for Sir Du the Recluse" says: "Nature exhausts the mind-monkey's hiding, spirit disperses the idea-horse's moving/stopping. Guests who come ought to know this: both self and world are unfeeling."

The common ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" phrase dates back to a ''[[bianwen]]'' 變文 "[[Vernacular Chinese]] transformation text" narrative version of the ''Weimojie suoshuo jing'' (above) that was discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]]. This ''jiangjingwen'' 講經文 "sutra lecture text" dated 947 CE says: "Within the indeterminable and unfathomable depths, the mind-monkey and idea-horse cease their craziness." 

The 1075 CE ''[[Wuzhen pian]]'', which is a [[Daoist]] classic on ''[[Neidan]]''-style [[internal alchemy]], used ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey" without "horse".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thoroughly understanding the mind-monkey, the machinations in the heart, by three thousand achievements one becomes a peer of heaven. There naturally is a crucible to cook the dragon and tiger; Why is it necessary to support a household and be attached to spouse and children? (tr. Cleary 1987:118) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cleary (1987:198) glosses ''xinyuan'' as "the unruly mind, jumping from one object to another."

The Song Dynasty poet Zhu Yi 朱翌 (1098–1186 CE) reversed the Tang lyrical ''xinyuanyima'' expression into ''yimaxinyuan'' "will-horse mind-monkey". His ''Shuixuanshi'' 睡軒詩 "Sleeping Porch Poem" says: "Haste is useless with the idea-horse and mind-monkey, so take off your baggage someplace deep within dreamland."

The c. 1200 ''Nan Tang shu'' 南唐書 "History of the [[Southern Tang]]" used the simile ''yi ru ma xin ru nao'' 意如馬心如猱 "ideas like a horse and mind like a gibbon/monkey". Congshan 從善 (939-987), seventh son of the figurehead [[Emperor Yuanzong of Southern Tang]], confesses: "Long ago in my youth, my ideas were like a horse and my mind was like a monkey. I was indolent with happiness and enjoyed lust, was pleased with rewards and forgot toil." 

 [[Image:Xiyou.PNG|160px|thumb|illustration of Sun Wukong]]
The c. 1590 ''Xiyouji'' 西遊記 "''[[Journey to the West]]''" (or "''[[Monkey (novel)|Monkey]]''") popularized "mind-monkey" more than any other text. This famous Chinese novel centers upon the pilgrimage of [[Xuanzang]] to India, and frequently uses ''xinyuan'' and ''yima'' expressions (Dudbridge 1970:167, Chang 1983:200). Many are found in the couplet titles of chapters, for instance, 30 "The evil demon attacks the true Dharma; The Horse of the Will recalls the Monkey of the Mind". The preeminent translator [[Anthony C. Yu]] (1977:59) describes controlling the mind-monkey and will-horse as "a theme central to the entire narrative and which receives repeated and varied developments." Chapter 7 has this exemplary poem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A monkey's transformed body weds the human mind. Mind is a monkey – this, the truth profound. The Great Sage [Buddha], Equal to Heaven, is no idle thought. For how could the post of [Bima "Assistant of Horses"] justly show his gifts? The Horse works with the Monkey – and this means both Mind and Will, Must firmly be harnessed and not ruled without. All things return to Nirvāna, taking this one course: In union with Tathāgata [Buddha] to live beneath twin trees. (tr. Yu 1977:168)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many ''Xiyouji'' scholars allegorically interpret ''xinyuan'' "heart-/mind-monkey" as the protagonist monkey-man [[Sun Wukong]] and ''yima'' "idea-/will-horse" as the dragon prince White Horse that enters the story in chapter 15. There are long-standing scholarly disagreements over whether Sun Wukong evolved from [[Hanuman]], the monkey hero in the (3rd century BCE) ''[[Ramayana]]''. It is "imagistically proper" for Sun to be a monkey, says Mair (1989:662), because "Zen thought symbolizes the restless and unbridled mind of man as an "ape/monkey-mind" 心猿."

Japanese Buddhist monks not only imported [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]] such as ''shin'en'' &lt; ''xinyuan'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''iba'' &lt; ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse", but also invented analogous Japanese words like ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea-monkey" and ''shinba'' 心馬 "mind-horse". Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:159-161). The earliest known usages of relevant "mind-monkey" terminology are shown in the table below.

During the [[Heian period]] (794-1185 CE), the Chinese "mind-monkey" and "idea-horse" were paraphrased as ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea-monkey" and ''shinba'' 心馬 "mind-horse". The 797 CE ''[[Sangō Shiiki]]'' 三教指帰 "Indications of the [[Three teachings]] (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism)" was written by [[Kūkai]], who founded esoteric [[Shingon Buddhism]]. Two passages introduced Japanese "mind-monkey" and "will-horse" [[neologism]]s. One used ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea/will monkey" with the common word ''nouma'' 野馬 "wild horse": "The four great difficulties overexcite the wild horse's fast gallop, the twenty-six contributory causes mislead the plans of the idea-monkey." Another passage used ''shinba'' 心馬 "heart/mind horse" and ''isha'' 意車 "idea-chariot": "Whip the mind-horse to gallop off in the eight directions, grease the idea chariot and gambol within the nine heavens."

[[File:Mori Sosen BaikaEnkou-zu.jpg|thumb|left|''Monkeys in a plum tree'' by [[Mori Sosen]] (1747–1821)]]
During the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333 CE), [[Pure Land Buddhism]] introduced the Sino-Japanese terms ''shin'en'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''iba'' 意馬 "idea-horse", and an early travelogue popularized them. The ''Genkyū hōgo'' 元久法語 "[[Genkyū]] era (1204–1206) Buddhist Sermons" is a collection of writings by [[Hōnen]], the founder of the [[Jodo Shu|Jōdo Shū]]. His c. 1205 "Tozanjō 登山状 "Mountain Climbing Description"  (tr. adapted from Carr 1993:159) uses ''iba'' with ''shin'en'': "When you wish to enter the gate of determined goodness, then your idea-horse runs wild within the bounds of the six sense objects [''rokujin'' 六塵 &lt;  [[Ayatana]]: "form, sound, smell, taste, tangibility, and [[dharma]]"]. When you wish to enter the gate of scattered goodness, then your mind-monkey gambols and jumps across the branches of the ten evil deeds [''jūaku'' 十悪: killing, stealing, adultery, lying, cursing, slandering, equivocating, coveting, anger, and false views]." The 1223 ''Kaidōki'' 海道記 "Record of Coast Road Travels" was a travelogue of the [[Tōkaidō (road)]] from [[Kyoto]] to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. It used ''shinsen'' 心船 "heart/mind boat" meaning "imaginary journey" with ''iba'' 意馬 "idea/will horse" and wrote ''arasaru'' 荒猿 "wild monkey" for ''arasu'' 荒す "treat roughly/wildly": "I rowed the mind-boat for make-believe. As yet, I neither poled across myriad leagues of waves on the Coast Road, nor roughly rode the idea-horse to urge it on through clouds of the distant mountain barrier." 

During the early [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), the four-character Chinese collocations ''yimashinen'' 意馬心猿 and ''shinenyima'' 心猿意馬 were introduced into Japanese. The 1675 ''Man'an kana hōgo'' 卍庵仮名法語, which was a vernacular collection of [[Zen]] sermons, first used ''shin'en'iba'' 意馬心猿. "For this reason, even if you reside somewhere with remote mountain streams and desolate tranquillity, and sit in silent contemplation, you will only be passing idle time because you are isolated from the road of the mind-monkey and idea-horse." The 1699 [[Kabuki]] play ''Wakoku gosuiten'' 和国五翠殿 "Japan's Five Green Palaces" repeatedly used ''ibashin'en''. For instance, the first act described two prisoners tied to a tree: "They are the idea-horse and mind-monkey themselves. So if this pine tree is the pole of Absolute Reality, then these two prisoners are a greedy monkey – no, a cat – and a horse running wild; and they are just like the idea-horse and mind-monkey."

=="Mind-monkey" in English==
'''Mind monkey''' and '''monkey mind''' both occur in English usage, originally as translations of ''xinyuan'' or ''shin'en'' and later as culturally-independent images. Michael Carr concludes,
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Xinyuan-yima'' 心猿意馬 "monkey of the heart/mind and horse of the ideas/will" has been a successful metaphor. What began 1500 years ago as a Buddhist import evolved into a standard Chinese and Japanese literary phrase. Rosenthal (1989:361) says a proverb's success "'depends on certain imponderables," particularly rhythm and phrasing. Of the two animals in this metaphor, the "monkey" phrase was stronger than the "horse" because ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey" was occasionally used alone (e.g., ''Wuzhenpian'') and it had more viable variants (e.g., ''qingyuan'' 情猿 "emotion-monkey" in ''Ci'en zhuan''). The "mental-monkey" choice of words aptly reflects restlessness, curiosity, and mimicry associated with this animal. Dudbridge (1970:168) explains how "the random, uncontrollable movements of the monkey symbolise the waywardness of the native human mind before it achieves a composure which only Buddhist discipline can effect." (1993:166) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Translations===
English translations of Chinese ''xinyuan'' or Japanese ''shin'en'' commonly include "mind monkey", "monkey mind", and "monkey of the mind".

This first list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 5 Chinese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 11 bilingual [[Chinese dictionaries]] translate ''xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 and ''yimaxinyuan'' 意馬心猿.
*【意馬心猿】 his will is like a horse's, and his heart like an ape's; inconstant and strong (''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'', Williams 1874)
*【心猿意馬】 gibbon heart and horse ideas, – unsettled and wandering (''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', Giles 1919)
*【心猿意馬】 irresolute; vacillating; fluctuating ... Inconstant; fickle in the mind (''A Complete Chinese–English Dictionary'', Tsang 1920, cf. next)
*【意馬心猿】 Unsettled in mind; fluctuating; wavering in purpose (''A Complete Chinese–English Dictionary'')
*【意馬心猿】The intents of the mind and heart are like the horse and ape – very difficult to bring under control; undecided (''Zhonghua Han-Ying dacidian'', Lu 1931, cf. next)
*【心猿意馬】 Restless and unsettled (''Zhonghua Han-Ying dacidian'')
*【心猿意馬】 the intents of the mind and heart are like the horse and the ape – very difficult to bring under control; undecided (''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', Mathews 1943)
*【心猿意馬】 cannot make up one's mind; indecision; procrastination (''A New Practical Chinese- English Dictionary'', Liang 1971)
*【心猿意馬】 prone to outside attractions, temptations; in a restless and jumpy mood (''[[Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' 1972)
*【心猿意馬】 restless and whimsical; fanciful and fickle; capricious (''The Chinese–English Dictionary'', Beijing 1979)
*【心猿意馬】 in a restless and jumpy mood / capricious (''A New Chinese–English Dictionary'', Ding 1985)
*【心猿意馬】 restless and whimsical; fanciful and fickle; capricious; when one meant gibbon, he thinks of a horse (''A Modern Chinese–English Dictionary'', Beijing 1988)
*【心猿意馬】 ① capricious; restless ② indecisive (''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', DeFrancis 1996, cf. next)
*【意馬心猿】 indecisive; wavering (''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'')
Six of these 11 Chinese–English dictionaries enter only the common ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey idea-horse," 2 only the reverse ''yimaxinyuan'', and 3 enter both. Three translation equivalents give English "ape" rather than "gibbon" or "monkey" for ''yuan'' 猿, and "ape" sounds metaphorically stronger than "monkey." Note how several of these dictionaries have identical translations. 

This second list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 7 Japanese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 9 bilingual [[Japanese dictionaries]] translate ''ibashin'en'' 意馬心猿, none enters ''shin'en'iba'' 心猿意馬.
*【意馬心猿】 Clamorous demands of passion (''Takenobu's Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takenobu 1918)
*【意馬心猿】 overmastering passion (''A Standard Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takehara 1924)
*【意馬心猿】Passions hard of control; uncontrollable passions (''Saito's Japanese–English Dictionary'', Saito 1930)
*【意馬心猿】Clamorous demands of passion; [uncontrollable] passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takenobu 1931)
*【意馬心猿】 clamorous demands of passion; [uncontrollable] passions; wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Katsumata 1954)
*【意馬心猿】 uncontrollable passions (''The Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary'', Nelson 1974)
*【意馬心猿】 clamorous demands of passion; (uncontrollable) passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Masuda 1974)
*【意馬心猿】 (uncontrollable) passions (''Japanese Character Dictionary'', Spahn and Hadamitzky 1989)
*【意馬心猿】 the clamorous demands of passion; (uncontrollable) passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Watanabe 2003)

All 9 Japanese–English dictionaries mention "passion" or "passions." Note how Saito's "uncontrollable passions" first appeared in 1930 and was copied into 6 other dictionaries. The 5 editions of [[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese–English Dictionary]] illustrate lexicographical modifications. Editors copied the "clamorous demands of passion" phrase from the 1st edition (''Takenobu's …'' 1918) into all the subsequent versions. The 2nd (1931) first added "uncontrollable" to "passions," which was copied in later editions. The 3rd edition (1954) included a literal translation "wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires", but this was omitted from the 4th (1974) and 5th (2003, which added the [[definite article]] "the").

===Popular culture===
Examples of "mind monkey" are predictably common in Chinese [[popular culture]]. For instance, ''Sam yuen yi ma'' 心猿意馬 – the [[Cantonese (language)|Cantonese]] pronunciation of ''Xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" –  was a 1999 Hong Kong movie (known in English as "The Accident") by [[Stanley Kwan]]. However, examples of "mind monkey" are surprisingly widespread in modern English culture. For instance, there are [[blog]]s named "Mind Monkey!", "Mind of the Monkey", "Monkey Mind", and "No monkey mind". Author Steve Michael Reedy explores the concept of the Monkey Mind through his collection of children's fantasy stories in [["Tales For Your Monkey's Mind."]]

In English-language publishing, fewer books are titled with "mind monkey", such as ''Master the Mind Monkey'' (Patkar 2007), than "monkey mind". "Taming" is common among ''Taming the Monkey Mind'' (Chodron 1999), ''Taming the Monkey Mind; A Guide to Pure Land Practice'' (Cheng 2000), and ''Taming Our Monkey Mind: Insight, Detachment, Identity'' (Krystal 2007). Other examples of book titles include ''Samba and the Monkey Mind'' (Williams 1965), ''Meeting the Monkey Halfway'' (Sumano and Popp 2000), ''Your Monkey Mind Connection'' (Antoinette 2007), and ''Still the Monkey'' (Alivia 2007). 

The originally Buddhist "mind monkey" metaphor is also known in popular English-language music. "Mad Melancholy Monkey Mind" is a band. There are albums entitled "Mind Monkey" (Bill Foreman 1999), "Monkey Mind" (Wonder Stump, 2003), and "Monkey Mind Control" (Jay Roulston 2003). Song titles include "The Monkey on the Mind" (Dave Wilkerson 1960) and "Monkey Mind" ([[Neil Rolnick]] 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12986">'''Motivated reasoning''' is an emotion-biased decision-making phenomenon studied in [[cognitive science]] and [[social psychology]]. This term describes the role of motivation in cognitive processes such as decision-making and attitude change in a number of paradigms, including:

* Evaluation of evidence related to one's own outcomes&lt;ref name="oleary"/&gt;

==Cognitive strategy==
The processes of motivated reasoning are a type of inferred justification strategy which is used to mitigate [[cognitive dissonance]]. When people form and cling to false beliefs despite overwhelming evidence, the  phenomenon is labeled "motivated reasoning".  In other words, "rather than search rationally for information that either confirms or disconfirms a particular belief, people actually seek out information that confirms what they already believe".&lt;ref&gt;Begley, Sharon. [http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/24/lies-of-mass-destruction.html  "Lies of Mass Destruction,"] ''Newsweek'' (US). August 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is "a form of implicit emotion regulation in which the brain converges on judgments that minimize negative and maximize positive affect states associated with threat to or attainment of motives".&lt;ref name="westen"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==

Early research on the evaluation and integration of information supported a cognitive approach consistent with [[Bayesian probability]], in which individuals weighted new information using rational calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Annual Review of Political Science |title=Misperceptions about Perceptual Bias |year=1999 |last1=Gerber |first1=Alan |last2=Green |first2=Donald  |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=189–2100 |issn=1094-2939}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent theories endorse cognitive processes as partial explanations of motivated reasoning but have also introduced motivational&lt;ref name="kunda"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kunda | first1 = Z. | title = The case for motivated reasoning | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 480–498 | year = 1990 | pmid =  2270237| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or affective processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hot Cognition or Cool Consideration |year=2002 |last1=Redlawsk |first1=D |journal=The Journal of Politics |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=1021–1044 |issn=0022-3816 |doi=10.1111/1468-2508.00161}}&lt;/ref&gt; to further illuminate the mechanisms of the bias inherent in cases of motivated reasoning. To further complicate the issue, the first neuro-imaging study designed to test the neural circuitry of individuals engaged in motivated reasoning found that motivated reasoning "was not associated with neural activity in regions previously linked with cold reasoning tasks [Bayesian reasoning] and conscious (explicit) emotion regulation".&lt;ref name="westen"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Westen | first1 = D. | last2 = Blagov | first2 = P.

This section focuses on two theories that elucidate the mechanisms involved in motivated reasoning. Both theories distinguish between mechanisms present when the individual is trying to reach an accurate conclusion, and those present when the individual has a directional goal.

=== Goal-oriented motivated reasoning ===

One review of the research develops the following theoretical model to explain the mechanism by which motivated reasoning results in bias.&lt;ref&gt;Ziva Kunda 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The model is summarized as follows:

Motivation to arrive at a desired conclusion provides a level of arousal, which acts as an initial trigger for the operation of cognitive processes. Historically, motivated reasoning theory identifies that directional goals enhance the accessibility of knowledge structures (memories, information, knowledge) that are consistent with desired conclusions. This theory endorses previous research on accessing information, but adds a procedural component in specifying that the motivation to achieve directional goals will also influence which rules (procedural structures such as inferential rules) and which beliefs are accessed to guide the search for information. In this model the beliefs and rule structures are instrumental in directing which information will be obtained to support the desired conclusion.

In comparison, Milton Lodge and Charles Taber (2000) introduce an empirically supported model in which affect is intricately tied to cognition, and information processing is biased toward support for positions that the individual already holds.

This model has three components:

# On-line processing in which when called on to make an evaluation, people instantly draw on stored information which is marked with affect;
# Affect is automatically activated along with the cognitive node to which it is tied;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fazio |first= Russell |editors= Richard E. Petty, Jon A. Krosnick |title= Attitude Strength: Antecedents and Consequences |publisher= [[Mahwah, NJ]] |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-8058-1086-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A "[[heuristic]] mechanism" for evaluating new information triggers a reflection on "How do I feel?" about this topic. The result of this process results in a bias towards maintaining existing affect, even in the face of other, disconfirming information.

This theory of motivated reasoning is fully developed and tested in Lodge and Taber's ''The Rationalizing Voter'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rationalizing Voter|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|author=Milton Lodge|author2=Charles Taber}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Redlawsk (2002) found that the timing of when disconfirming information was introduced played a role in determining bias. When subjects encountered incongruity during an information search, the automatic assimilation and update process was interrupted. This results in one of two outcomes: subjects may enhance attitude strength in a desire to support existing affect (resulting in degradation in decision quality and potential bias) or, subjects may counter-argue existing beliefs in an attempt to integrate the new data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | chapter = Three steps toward a theory of motivated political reasoning
  | year = 2000
  | isbn = 0-521-65329-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second outcome is consistent with the research on how processing occurs when one is tasked with accuracy goals.

=== Accuracy-oriented motivated reasoning ===

Kunda asserts that accuracy goals delay the process of coming to a premature conclusion, in that accuracy goals increase both the quantity and quality of processing—particularly in leading to more complex inferential cognitive processing procedures.
When researchers manipulated test subjects motivation to be accurate by informing them that the target task was highly important or that they would be expected to defend their judgments, it was found that subjects utilized deeper processing, and that there was less biasing of information. This was true when accuracy motives were present at the initial processing and encoding of information. Tetlock (1983, 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accountability and the perseverance of first impressions |year=1983 |last1=Tetlock |first1=P |journal=Social Psychology Quarterly |volume= 46  |issue=4 |pages=285–292 |issn=0190-2725 |doi=10.2307/3033716|jstor=3033716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accountability: A social check on the fundamental attribution error |year=1985 |last1=Tetlock |first1=P |journal=Social Psychology Quarterly |volume=48  |issue=3 |pages=227–236 |issn=0190-2725 |doi=10.2307/3033683|jstor=3033683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In reviewing a line of research on accuracy goals and bias, Kunda concludes, "several different kinds of biases have been shown to weaken in the presence of accuracy goals".&lt;ref&gt;Kunda (1990) p. 482&lt;/ref&gt; She asserts that for accuracy to reduce bias the following conditions must be present. 
#Subjects must possess appropriate reasoning strategies
#They must view these as superior to other strategies,
#And be capable of using them at will.

These last two conditions introduce the construct that accuracy goals include a conscious process of utilizing [[cognitive strategy|cognitive strategies]] in motivated reasoning. This construct is called into question by later neuroscience research that concludes that motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning (in instances when there is no strong emotional stake in the outcomes), (Weston, 2006 ).&lt;ref name="westen"/&gt;

In summary, both models differentiate between accuracy goals, and goal directed processing. They differ in that Redlawsk identifies a primary role for affect in guiding cognitive processes and in maintaining bias. In contrast, Kunda identifies a primary role for cognitive processes such as memory processes, and the use of rules in determining biased information selection. At least one study in neuroscience does not support the use of cognitive processes in motivated reasoning, lending greater support to affective processing as a key mechanism in supporting bias. 
Of interest, neuroscience is consistent with Freud's (1933)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Freud |first= Sigmund  |title= New Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis |publisher= [[Hogarth Press]] |year= 1933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; theory of "defensive processing" which occurred in the unconscious, and was seen as a mechanism to avoid feelings of anxiety and guilt.

==Research==
Neuroscientific research suggest that "motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning when people do not have a strong emotional stake in the conclusions reached."&lt;ref name="westen"/&gt;

Social science research suggests that reasoning away contradictions is psychologically easier than revising feelings. In this sense, emotions are shown to color how "facts" are perceived. Feelings come first, and evidence is used mostly in service of those feelings. Evidence that supports what is already believed is accepted, that which contradicts it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Redlawsk |first=David P. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/21/barack-obama-and-the-psychology-of-the-birther-myth/a-matter-of-motivated-reasoning |title=A Matter of Motivated 'Reasoning' |work=New York Times |date=April 22, 2011}} citing {{Cite journal | last1 = Redlawsk | first1 = D.

==Outcomes==
The outcomes of motivated reasoning derive from "a biased set of cognitive processes—that is, strategies for accessing, constructing, and evaluating beliefs. The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion."&lt;ref name="kunda"/&gt;

Research on motivated reasoning tested accuracy goals (i.e., reaching correct conclusions) and directional goals (i.e., reaching preferred conclusions).  Factors such as these affect perceptions; and results confirm that motivated reasoning affects decision-making and estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nir | first1 = L. | title = Motivated Reasoning and Public Opinion Perception | doi = 10.1093/poq/nfq076 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 504 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanskrit word '''Nishtha''' (निष्ठा), in [[Hindu philosophy]], refers to faith, steadiness, devotion and the culmination, and in [[Sanskrit grammar]], to the affixes of the Past Participles - ''kta'' and ''katavatu''. 

==Meaning==

'''Nishtha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: निष्ठ or निष्ठा) means – 'being in or on', 'situated on', 'depending or 'resting on', 'referring' or 'relating to', 'devoted or attached to', 'practicing', 'intent on', 'skilled in', 'believing in', 'conducive to', 'effecting', 'position', 'condition', 'state', 'basis', 'foundation', 'fixity', 'fixedness', 'steadiness', 'devotion', 'application', 'close attachment', 'belief', 'firm adherencev, 'faith', 'excellence', 'skill', 'proficiency', 'perfection', conclusion', 'end', 'termination', 'the catastrophe or end of a drama', 'accomplishment', 'completion', 'the culminating point', 'death', 'destruction', 'disappearance from the world at the fixed time', 'fixed or certain knowledge', 'certainty', 'begging', 'suffering', 'trouble', 'distress', 'anxiety', 'a technical term for past participial terminations', and is one of the many names of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit dictionary|url=http://sanskritdictionary.com/ni%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADha/18819/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Philosophical significance==

On the battle-field of [[Kurukshetra]], [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]]:

: लोकेऽस्मिन् द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयाऽनघ |
: ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् ||

: "O sinless one! Two kinds of disciplines in this world were set forth by Me in times of yore – for the ''Samkhyas'' the discipline of knowledge (''Jnana-nishtha''), and for the ''yogins'', that of works (''Karma-nishtha''). "  – ([[Bhagavad Gita]] III.3)

In his commentary on this ''sloka'', [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] states – "तत्र का सा द्विविधा निष्ठा इति? आह - What is this two-fold discipline? Listen: (i) The discipline of knowledge (ज्ञानयोग),….(for) the renouncers of the ''Paramhamsa order'' who have established themselves in the ultimate Reality, and (ii) The discipline of works (कर्मयोग)…. (for) the performers of works…the discipline of works may promote life’s ends by endowing the agent with the fitness to adopt the discipline of knowledge, and not independently, by itself, whereas the discipline of knowledge, generated by that of works, is totally independent means to life’s supreme end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sri Sankaracarya|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=101-103|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[Shloka|Sloka]], the word ''Nishtha'' means ‘devoted to’, ‘established in’. Faith with trust and dedication is called ''[[Śraddhā|shraddha]]''; faith with trust and confidence is ''nishtha'', in this ''sloka'', [[Krishna]] speaks about the twofold path of faith and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita: The Elixir of Life|author=T.N.Dhar|publisher=Mittal Publications|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8jlfTJ_0OMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Nishtha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ft44U63VOcmxrgfw2oCgCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-knowledge (''atma jnana'') can exist when self-knowledge is not fully established; ''Jnana-nishtha'' refers to self-knowledge that is fully assimilated and established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free From “Me”: Vedanta Notes|author=Paul Bahder|publisher=Vision of Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92&amp;dq=Nishtha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feA4U8WbIcmJrQfK4IGoAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanatkumara]] tells [[Narada]] ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VII.xx.1 and VII.xxi.1) that when one serves devotedly, then one becomes endowed with faith; without serving devotedly one does not acquire faith, and that when one acts, then one serves devotedly. The word ''Nishtha'' or 'devotion', appearing in the former passage, is used to mean - 'steadiness'. Even though the text says nothing about a teacher, to Sankara it indicates the steadfast seeking of a teacher’s wisdom for acquiring knowledge of [[Brahman]]; and to [[Swami Prabhavananda|Prabhavananda]] it indicates gain of faith by attending on a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishad – Commentary-full|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNzTC6Nmy6gC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=nishtha+++upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vRE5U4XoDImzrAeXmIHgAg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nishtha%20%20%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara states – A distinction has been made between ''Jnana-nishtha'' (ज्ञान-निष्ठा) and ''Karma-nishtha'' (कर्म-निष्ठा).Vedic works are intended for him only who has desires; the renunciation of these works is enjoined on him who seeks only the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Vedanta Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0XRJ8zZT8cC&amp;pg=PA560&amp;dq=Nishtha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feA4U8WbIcmJrQfK4IGoAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Vivekananda]] the word ''Nishtha'' meant –'singleness of attachment'; he states –" That singleness of attachment (Nishtha) to a loved object, without which no genuine love can grow, is very often also the cause of the denunciation of everything else. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta Philosophy: Lectures on Raja Yoga|author=Vivekananda|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWipfV9zHJgC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=Nishtha+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feA4U8WbIcmJrQfK4IGoAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Grammatical significance==

[[Sutra]] I.i.26 of [[Pāṇini]] in his [[Ashtadhyayi]] defines ''Nishta'' in ''Sukta'' I.i.26 which reads - क्तक्तवतू निष्ठा – that the affixes of the Past Participles - ''kta'' and ''katavatu'', are called ''Nishtha''. In this text, Panini in accordance with the context of their use and application expounds and explains many rules relating to the duplication and reduplication of many words. The actual affixes are त, तवत्, the क and उ being indicatory; they being कित् are liable to कित् affixes such as - कृतः, कृतवान्, भुक्तः, भुक्तवान्, in accordance with rule I.i.5, the force of indicatory उ  to indicate that in forming the feminine of nouns ending in an affix having an indicatory vowel of uk pratyahara – उ, ऋ, लृ  ङीप् (ई) must be added such as – कृतवत् (masculine), कृतवती (feminine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbzVy6vqyCkC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Nishtha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ft44U63VOcmxrgfw2oCgCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When the ''nishta'' follows (निष्ठावान्) there is vocalization such as in the case of वचिस्वपियजादिनां किति (VI.1.15) – The semivowels of the roots वच्, स्वप् and यजादि verbs are vocalized when followed by an affix having an indicatory क; thus with the Past Participle क्त and क्तवतु, उक्तः, उक्तवान्; सुप्तः, सुप्तवान्; इष्टः, इष्टवान्; or as in the case of सत्यः पूर्वस्य (VI.1.23) – The verb स्त्या (स्त्यै and ष्ठ्यै) when preceded by प्र changes its semivowel to vowel, when a ''nishtha'' affix follows, प्रस्तीतः or प्रस्तीतवान् ||, then,  त is optionally changed to  न as प्रस्तीनः and प्रस्तीनवान् ||.The substitute of the ''nishtha'' is considered ''siddha'' or 'effective' when applying rules relating to the change of  letter to प, to accent, to affix and to the addition of the augment इट्.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Ashtadhyayi of Panini Vol.2|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=1047,1051,1048|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTChci828qoC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Nishtha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zt04U-HeI4rGrAe1xoE4&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Nishtha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule - श्वीदितः निष्ठायाम् (VII.2.14) states that when following the verbal root श्वि or any root which has ईकारः as a इत्, a निष्ठा does not take the augment इट्. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tattvabodhini|publisher=Sanskrit.org|url=http://avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=sutras:7-2-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[metaphysics]], '''object-oriented ontology''' ('''OOO''') is a 21st-century [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to what it calls the "anthropocentrism" of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican Revolution]], as accepted by most other current metaphysics, in which [[phenomenal]] objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition.&lt;ref name="bryant1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Onticology–A Manifesto for Object-Oriented Ontology, Part 1|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/object-oriented-ontology-a-manifesto-part-i/|work=Larval Subjects|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented ontology maintains that objects exist independently (as Kantian [[noumena]]) of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for object-oriented ontologists, all relations, including those between nonhumans, distort their related objects in the same basic manner as human consciousness and exist on an equal footing with one another.&lt;ref name="harman1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=Graham|title=Guerrilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things|year=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Peru, Illinois|isbn=0-8126-9456-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Object-oriented ontology is often viewed as a subset of [[speculative realism]], a contemporary school of thought that criticizes the post-Kantian reduction of philosophical enquiry to a correlation between thought and being, such that the reality of anything outside of this correlation is unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented ontology predates speculative realism, however, and makes distinct claims about the nature and equality of object relations to which not all speculative realists agree. The term "object-oriented philosophy" was coined by [[Graham Harman]], the movement's founder, in his 1999 doctoral dissertation "Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman|first=Graham|title=Brief SR/OOO Tutorial|url=http://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/brief-srooo-tutorial/|work=Object-Oriented Philosophy|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogost"&gt;Bogost's "Understanding the 'Experience' of Objects," in: ''Humanistic Perspectives in a Technological World'', ed. Richard Utz, Valerie B. Johnson, and Travis Denton (Atlanta: School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014), pp. 69-71, provides a quick general definition.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Levi Bryant]] rephrased Harman's original designation as "object-oriented ontology", giving the movement its current name.

==Founding of the movement==

The term "object-oriented philosophy” was coined by speculative philosopher Graham Harman in his 1999 doctoral dissertation "Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects" (later revised and published as ''Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Harman, Heideggerian ''[[Heideggerian terminology|Zuhandenheit]]'', or readiness-to-hand, refers to the withdrawal of objects from human perception into a reality that cannot be manifested by practical or theoretical action.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_1"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthering this idea, Harman contends that when objects withdraw in this way, they distance themselves from other objects, as well as humans.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"/&gt; Resisting pragmatic interpretations of Heidegger's thought, then, Harman is able to propose an object-oriented account of metaphysical substances. Following the publication of Harman's early work, several scholars from varying fields began employing object-oriented principles in their own work. Levi Bryant began what he describes as "a very intense philosophical email exchange" with Harman, over the course of which Bryant became convinced of the credibility of object-oriented thought.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"/&gt;  Bryant subsequently coined the term "object-oriented ontology" in 2009 to distinguish those ontologies committed to an account of being composed of discrete beings from Harman's object-oriented philosophy, thus marking a difference between object-oriented philosophy (OOP) and object-oriented ontology (OOO).&lt;ref&gt;Graham Harman, "Series Editor's Preface", in Levi R. Bryant, ''Onto-Cartography:  An Ontology of Machines and Media'', IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==

While object-oriented philosophers reach different conclusions, they share common precepts, including a critique of anthropocentrism and correlationism and a rejection of "preservation of finitude", "withdrawal", and philosophies that undermine or "overmine" objects.

===Rejection of anthropocentrism===

Anthropocentrism is the privileging of humans as "subjects" over and against nonhuman beings as "objects". The widespread tendency frequently limits attributes such as mind, autonomy, moral agency, reason, and the like to humans, while contrasting all other beings as variations of "object", or things obeying deterministic laws, impulses, stimuli, instincts, and so on. Beginning with Kant's epistemology, modern philosophers began articulating a ''transcendent'' anthropocentrism, whereby the Kantian argument that objects are unknowable outside of the imposed, distorting categories of the human mind in turn shores up discourses wherein objects frequently become effectively reduced to mere products of human cognition.&lt;ref name="bryant1"/&gt; In contrast to Kant's view, object-oriented philosophers maintain that objects exist independently of human perception, and that nonhuman object relations distort their related objects in the same fundamental manner as human consciousness. Thus, all object relations, human and nonhuman, are said to exist on equal ontological footing with one another.&lt;ref name="harman1"/&gt;

===Critique of correlationism&lt;!--'Correlationism' redirects here--&gt;===

Related to 'anthropocentrism', object-oriented thinkers reject '''correlationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which the French philosopher [[Quentin Meillassoux]] defines as "the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Quentin|title=After Finitude|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-4411-7383-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because object-oriented ontology is the realist philosophy, it stands in contradistinction to the anti-realist trajectory of correlationism, which restricts philosophical understanding to the correlation of being with thought by disavowing any reality external to this correlation as inaccessible, and, in this way, fails to escape the ontological reification of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Graham Harman|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/06/26/interview-graham-harman.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection of undermining and "overmining"===

Object-oriented thought holds that there are two principal strategies for devaluing the philosophical import of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, one can undermine objects by claiming that they are an effect or manifestation of a deeper, underlying substance or force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, one can "overmine" objects by either an idealism which holds that there is nothing beneath what appears in the mind or, as in [[social constructionism]], by positing no independent reality outside of language, discourse or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dar.aucegypt.edu/handle/10526/3466|title=Undermining, overmining, and duomining: a critique|first=Harman,|last=Graham|date=28 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented philosophy rejects both undermining and "overmining".

===Preservation of finitude===

Unlike other speculative realisms, object-oriented ontology maintains the concept of finitude, whereby relation to an object cannot be translated into direct and complete knowledge of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=Graham|title=Quentin Meillassoux: Philosophy in the Making|year=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-4080-5|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since all object relations distort their related objects, every relation is said to be an act of translation, with the caveat that no object can perfectly translate another object into its own nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented ontology does not restrict finitude to humanity, however, but extends it to all objects as an inherent limitation of relationality.

===Withdrawal===

Object-oriented ontology holds that objects are independent not only of other objects, but also from the qualities they animate at any specific spatiotemporal location. Accordingly, objects cannot be exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects in theory or practice, meaning that the reality of objects is always present-at-hand.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_1"/&gt; The retention by an object of a reality in excess of any relation is known as ''withdrawal''.

==Metaphysics of Graham Harman==

In ''Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects'', Graham Harman interprets the tool-analysis contained in [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] ''Being and Time'' as inaugurating an ontology of objects themselves, rather than the valorization of practical action or networks of signification.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_1"/&gt; According to Harman, Heideggerian ''Zuhandenheit'', or readiness-to-hand, indicates the withdrawal of objects from both practical and theoretical action, such that objectcal{{clarify|date=January 2018}} reality cannot be exhausted by either practical usage or theoretical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman further contends that objects withdraw not just from human interaction, but also from other objects. He maintains:

{{quote| If the human perception of a house or a tree is forever haunted by some hidden surplus in the things that never becomes present, the same is true of the sheer causal interaction between rocks or raindrops. Even inanimate things only unlock each other's realities to a minimal extent, reducing one another to caricatures...even if rocks are not sentient creatures, they never encounter one another in their deepest being, but only ''as present-at-hand''; it is only Heidegger's confusion of two distinct senses of the as-structure that prevents this strange result from being accepted.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"/&gt; }}

From this, Harman concludes that the primary site of ontological investigation is objects and relations, instead of the post-Kantian emphasis on the human-world correlate. Moreover, this holds true for all entities, be they human, nonhuman, natural, or artificial, leading to the downplayment of ''dasein'' as an ontological priority. In its place, Harman proposes a concept of substances that are irreducible to both material particles and human perception, and "exceed every relation into which they might enter".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupling Heidegger's tool-analysis with the phenomenological insights of [[Edmund Husserl]], Harman introduces two types of objects: ''real objects'' and ''sensual objects''. Real objects are objects that withdraw from all experience, whereas sensual objects are those that exist only in experience.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_49"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Harman suggests two kinds of qualities: ''sensual qualities'', or those found in experience, and ''real qualities'', which are accessed through intellectual probing.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_49"/&gt; Pairing sensual and real objects and qualities yields the following framework:

* '''Sensual Object/Sensual Qualities''': Sensual objects are present, but enmeshed within a "mist of accidental features and profiles".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sensual Object/Real Qualities''': The structure of conscious phenomena are forged from eidetic, or experientially interpretive, qualities intuited intellectually.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_50"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Real Object/Sensual Qualities''': As in the tool-analysis, a withdrawn object is translated into sensual apprehension via a "surface" accessed by thought and/or action.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_50"/&gt;
* '''Real Object/Real Qualities''': This pairing grounds the capacity of real objects to differ from one another, without collapsing into indefinite substrata.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_50"/&gt;

To explain how withdrawn objects make contact with and relate to one another, Harman submits the theory of ''vicarious causation'', whereby two hypothetical entities meet in the interior of a third entity, existing side-by-side until something occurs to prompt interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman compares this idea to the classical notion of formal causation, in which forms do not directly touch, but influence one another in a common space "from which all are partly absent". Causation, says Harman, is always vicarious, asymmetrical, and buffered:

{{quote| 'Vicarious' means that objects confront one another only by proxy, through sensual profiles found only on the interior of some other entity. 'Asymmetrical' means that the initial confrontation always unfolds between a real object and a sensual one. And 'buffered' means that [real objects] do not fuse into [sensual objects], nor [sensual objects] into their sensual neighbors, since all are held at bay through unknown firewalls sustaining the privacy of each. from the asymmetrical and buffered inner life of an object, vicarious connections arise occasionally...giving birth to new objects with their own interior spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Thus, causation entails the connection between a real object residing within the directionality of consciousness, or a unified "intention," with another real object residing outside of the intention, where the intention itself is also classified as a real object.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; From here, Harman extrapolates five types of relations between objects. ''Containment'' describes a relation in which the intention "contains" both the real object and sensual object. ''Contiguity'' connotes relations between sensual objects lying side-by-side within an intention, not affecting one another, such that a sensual object's bystanders can be rearranged without disrupting the object's identity. ''Sincerity'' characterizes the absorption of a real object by a sensual object, in a manner that "takes seriously" the sensual object without containing or being contiguous to it. ''Connection'' conveys the vicarious generation of intention by real objects indirectly encountering one another. Finally, ''no relation'' represents the typical condition of reality, since real objects are incapable of direct interaction and are limited in their causal influence upon and relation to other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==

Since its inception by Graham Harman in 1999, many authors in a variety of disciplines have adapted and expanded upon Harman's ideas.

===Onticology (Bryant)&lt;!--'Onticology' redirects here--&gt;===

Like Harman, Levi Bryant opposes [[post-Kantian]] [[anthropocentrism]] and philosophies of access.&lt;ref name="bryant1"/&gt; From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention that reality is accessible to human knowledge because it is structured by human cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the mechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He states:

{{quote| For, in effect, the Copernican Revolution will reduce philosophical investigation to the interrogation of a ''single'' relation: the human-world gap. And indeed, in the reduction of philosophy to the interrogation of this single relation or gap, not only will there be excessive focus on how humans relate to the world to the detriment of anything else, but this interrogation will be profoundly ''asymmetrical''. For the world or the object related to through the agency of the human will becomes a mere prop or vehicle for human cognition, language, and intentions ''without contributing anything of its own''.&lt;ref name="bryant1"/&gt;}}

To counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an object-oriented philosophy called '''onticology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, grounded in three principles. First, the ''Ontic Principle'' states that "there is no difference that does not make a difference".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following from the premises that questions of difference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to create differences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to engagement with difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, for Bryant, the thesis that there is a thing-in-itself which we cannot know is untenable because it presupposes forms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference predicated upon negation&amp;mdash;that which objects are not or lack when placed in comparison with one another&amp;mdash;are dismissed as arising only from the perspective of consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms independent being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the ''Principle of the Inhuman'' asserts that the concept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human, sociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of difference as independent of knowledge and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans exist as difference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore, without holding any special position with respect to other differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the ''Ontological Principle'' maintains that if there is no difference that does not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal condition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, "if a difference is made, then the being is".&lt;ref name="Bryant_269"&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant further contends that differences produced by an object can be ''inter-ontic'' (made with respect to another object) or ''intra-ontic'' (pertaining the internal constitution of the object).&lt;ref name="Bryant_269"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bryant2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=The Mug Blues|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/the-mug-blues/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: bright objects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. ''Bright objects'' are objects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects, such as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures.&lt;ref name="Coffield"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Levi Bryant|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/06/29/interview-levi-bryant.aspx|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dim objects'' lightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt; ''Dark objects'' are objects that are so completely withdrawn that they produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Dark Objects|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/dark-objects/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rogue objects'' are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead wander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages into which they enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Rogue Objects|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/rogue-objects/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by breaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in order to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior assemblage. Additionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness ontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human privilege.

===Hyperobjects (Morton)===

[[Timothy Morton]] became involved with object-oriented ontology after his ecological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. In ''The Ecological Thought'', Morton introduced the concept of ''hyperobjects'' to describe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has subsequently enumerated five characteristics of hyperobjects:

# '''Viscous:''' Hyperobjects adhere to any other object they touch, no matter how hard an object tries to resist. In this way, hyperobjects overrule ironic distance, meaning that the more an object tries to resist a hyperobject, the more glued to the hyperobject it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Hyperobjects are Viscous|url=http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2010/10/hyperobjects-are-viscous.html|work=Ecology Without Nature|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Molten:''' Hyperobjects are so massive that they refute the idea that spacetime is fixed, concrete, and consistent.&lt;ref name="coffield1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Timothy Morton|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/07/05/interview-timothy-morton.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Nonlocal:''' Hyperobjects are massively distributed in time and space to the extent that their totality cannot be realized in any particular local manifestation. For example, global warming is a hyperobject that impacts meteorological conditions, such as tornado formation. According to Morton, though, objects don't feel global warming, but instead experience tornadoes as they cause damage in specific places. Thus, nonlocality describes the manner in which a hyperobject becomes more substantial than the local manifestations they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Hyperobjects are Nonlocal|url=http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2010/11/hyperobjects-are-nonlocal.html|work=Ecology Without Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Phased:''' Hyperobjects occupy a higher dimensional space than other entities can normally perceive. Thus, hyperobjects appear to come and go in three-dimensional space, but would appear differently to an observer with a higher multidimensional view.&lt;ref name="coffield1"/&gt;
# '''Interobjective:''' Hyperobjects are formed by relations between more than one object. Consequently, objects are only able to perceive to the imprint, or "footprint," of a hyperobject upon other objects, revealed as information. For example, global warming is formed by interactions between the Sun, fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide, among other objects. Yet, global warming is made apparent through emissions levels, temperature changes, and ocean levels, making it seem as if global warming is a product of scientific models, rather than an object that predated its own measurement.&lt;ref name="coffield1"/&gt;

According to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of ecological crisis, but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Sublime Objects|journal=Speculations|year=2011|volume=II|pages=207–227|url=http://www.speculations-journal.org/storage/Morton_Sublime%20Objects_v2.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the existential capacity of hyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values, coupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter gives them a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future societies may become indistinguishable from reverential care.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien phenomenology (Bogost)===

[[Ian Bogost]], a video game researcher at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and founding partner of [[Persuasive Games]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Georgia Tech Homepage|title=Faculty Page|url=http://digitallounge.gatech.edu/faculty/index.html?id=14|work=Georgia Tech Digital Lounge|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has articulated an "applied" object-oriented ontology, concerned more with the being of specific objects than the exploration of foundational principles.&lt;ref name="Coffield_Bogost"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Ian Bogost|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/07/09/20110709.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost calls his approach ''alien phenomenology'', with the term "alien" designating the manner in which withdrawal accounts for the inviolability of objectal experience. From this perspective, an object may not recognize the experience of other objects because objects relate to one another using metaphors of selfhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gratton|first=Peter|title=Ian Bogost: The Interview|url=http://philosophyinatimeoferror.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/ian-bogost-the-interview/|work=Philosophy in a Time of Error|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alien phenomenology is grounded in three "modes" of practice. First, ''ontography'' entails the production of works that reveal the existence and relation of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bogost|first=Ian|title=Latour Litanizer|url=http://www.bogost.com/blog/latour_litanizer.shtml|work=Ian Bogost Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, ''metaphorism'' denotes the production of works that speculate about the "inner lives" of objects, including how objects translate the experience of other objects into their own terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bogost|first=Ian|title=Alien Phenomenology|url=http://www.bogost.com/blog/alien_phenomenology.shtml|work=Ian Bogost Blog|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, ''carpentry'' indicates the creation of artifacts that illustrate the perspective of objects, or how objects construct their own worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bogost|2012|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost sometimes refers to his version of object-oriented thought as a ''tiny ontology'' to emphasize his rejection of rigid ontological categorization of forms of being, including distinctions between "real" and "fictional" objects.&lt;ref name="Coffield_Bogost"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Some commentators contend that object-oriented ontology degrades meaning by placing humans and objects on equal footing. Matthew David Segall has argued that object-oriented philosophers should explore the theological and anthropological implications of their ideas in order to avoid "slipping into the nihilism of some speculative realists, where human values are a fluke in an uncaring and fundamentally entropic universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segall|first=Matthew David|title=Cosmos, Anthropos, and Theos in Harman, Teilhard, and Whitehead|url=http://footnotes2plato.com/2011/07/12/cosmos-anthropos-and-theos-in-harman-teilhard-and-whitehead/|work=Footnotes to Plato|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critical commentators such as David Berry and [[Alexander R. Galloway|Alexander Galloway]] have commented on the historical situatedness of an ontology that mirrors computational processes and even the metaphors and language of computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berry|first=David Michael|title=Critical Theory and the Digital|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/critical-theory-and-the-digital-9781441166395/|work= Critical Theory and the Digital|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galloway|first=Alexander R|title=A response to Graham Harman’s "Marginalia on Radical Thinking"|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/a-response-to-graham-harmans-marginalia-on-radical-thinking/|work= An und für sich|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural critic [[Steven Shaviro]] has criticized object-oriented ontology as too dismissive of [[process philosophy]]. According to Shaviro, the process philosophies of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]] account for how objects come into existence and endure over time, in contrast to the view that objects "are already there" taken by object-oriented approaches.&lt;ref name="Shaviro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaviro|first=Steven|title=Processes and Powers|url=http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=995|work=The Pinocchio Theory|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaviro also finds fault with Harman's assertion that Whitehead, Simondon, and [[Iain Hamilton Grant]] undermine objects by positing objects as manifestations of a deeper, underlying substance, saying that the antecedence of these thinkers, particularly Grant and Simondon, includes the "plurality of actually existing objects", rather than a single substance of which objects are mere epiphenomena.&lt;ref name="Shaviro"/&gt;

In September 2006, 10 Nobel Peace Laureates and more than 3,000 young people traveled from all over the world to Denver, Colorado, to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the PeaceJam Foundation. The [[14th Dalai Lama]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]], President [[Oscar Arias]], [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], Mairead Maguire, [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]], [[José Ramos-Horta]], [[Jody Williams]], and [[Shirin Ebadi]] came together in the largest gathering of Nobel Peace Laureates ever held in U.S. history. They announced plans for a 10-year campaign, now known as the '''One Billion Acts of Peace''' campaign, designed to tackle what they perceive as the 10 greatest challenges to the survival of humanity and the well-being of our planet today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jennifer|title=10 Nobel Prize winners gather for PeaceJam|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4340405?source=rss|accessdate=2011-07-07|newspaper=Denver Post|date=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Diana|title=H+K helps PeaceJam launch One Billion Acts of Peace campaign|url=http://www.prweek.com/article/1296734/h+k-helps-peacejam-launch-one-billion-acts-peace-campaign|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=PR Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Campaign==
On May 29, 2014, the PeaceJam Foundation launched the One Billion Acts of Peace Campaign at the United Nation’s Social Innovation Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H+K Strategies Helps Launch PeaceJam Foundation's "One Billion Acts of Peace" Campaign|url=http://www.hkstrategies.com/blogs/character/hk-strategies-helps-launch-peacejam-foundation%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cone-billion-acts-peace%E2%80%9D-campaign|website=Hill and Knowlton|publisher=Hill and Knowlton|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of peace are thoughtful actions critical to creating world peace which are based on one of ten key issues defined by the Nobel Peace Laureates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1baop|url=http://www.1billionacts.org/our-story/|website=1baop|publisher=1baop}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter for Compassion|url=http://charterforcompassion.org/node/8498|website=Charter for Compassion|publisher=Charter for Compassion|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign website has been visited by global citizens from 192 of the 195 nations on Earth. By October 1, 2017, more than 33 Million Acts of Peace had been logged onto the One Billion Acts of Peace website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15255">The '''out-group homogeneity effect''' is one's perception of [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]] members as more similar to one another than are in-group members, e.g. "they are alike; we are diverse".&lt;ref name="Quattrone &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quattrone|first1=George A.|last2=Jones|first2=Edward E.|title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=1|year=1980|pages=141–152|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "outgroup homogeneity effect", "outgroup homogeneity bias" or "relative outgroup homogeneity" has been explicitly contrasted with "outgroup homogeneity" in general,&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Haslam | first1 = Alex | last2 = Oakes | first2 = Penny | last3 = Turner | first3 = John | last4 = McGarty | first4 = Craig | editor-last = Sorrentino | editor-first = Richard | editor2-last = Higgins | editor2-first = Edward | year = 1996 |chapter = Social identity, self-categorization, and the perceived homogeneity of ingroups and outgroups: The interaction between social motivation and cognition |title = Handbook of Motivation and Cognition: Foundations of Social Behavior | volume = 3 | pages = 182–222 | location = New York | publisher = Guilford Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEQvoK-213MC|ISBN=9781572300521}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter referring to perceived outgroup variability unrelated to perceptions of the ingroup.

The out-group homogeneity effect is part of a broader field of research that examines perceived group variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | year = 2012 | title = They're all the same!...but for several different reasons: A review of the multicausal nature of perceived group variability | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 367–372 | doi = 10.1177/0963721412457363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area includes in-group homogeneity effects as well as out-group homogeneity effects, and it also deals with perceived group variability effects that are not linked to in-group/out-group membership, such as effects that are related to the power, status, and size of groups.

The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups.&lt;ref name=Rubin2004&gt;Rubin, M., Hewstone, M., Crisp, R. J., Voci, A., &amp; Richards, Z. (2004). Gender out-group homogeneity: The roles of differential familiarity, gender differences, and group size. In V. Yzerbyt, C. M. Judd, &amp; O. Corneille (Eds.), The psychology of group perception: Perceived variability, entitativity, and essentialism (pp. 203-220). New York: Psychology Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA9Qg-fDga8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=rubin+gender+out-group+homogeneity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZQQxT7-AAo6ZiQen14j3BA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rubin%20gender%20out-group%20homogeneity&amp;f=false [View&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of this effect on [[stereotyping]] have been noted.&lt;ref name="Rubin &amp; Badea (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rubin| first=Mark| last2=Badea | first2=Constantina| title=Why Do People Perceive Ingroup Homogeneity on Ingroup Traits and Outgroup Homogeneity on Outgroup Traits?| journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin| date=2007| volume=33| issue=1| pages=31–42| doi=10.1177/0146167206293190| pmid=17178928}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perceivers tend to have impressions about the diversity or variability of group members around those central tendencies or typical attributes of those group members. Thus, outgroup stereotypicality judgments are overestimated, supporting the view that out-group stereotypes are overgeneralizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Judd|first1=Charles M.|last2=Ryan|first2=Carey S.|last3=Park|first3=Bernadette|title=Accuracy in the judgment of in-group and out-group variability|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=3|year=1991|pages=366–379|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.3.366|pmid=1941509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outgroup homogeneity effect is sometimes referred to as "outgroup homogeneity bias". Such nomenclature hints at a broader [[Self-categorization theory#Meta-theoretical debate|meta-theoretical debate]] that is present in the field of [[social psychology]]. This debate centres on the validity of heightened perceptions of ingroup and outgroup homogeneity, where some researchers view the homogeneity effect as an example of cognitive bias and error, while other researchers view the effect as an example of normal and often adaptive social perception.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;

==Empirical support==
Another example of this phenomenon comes from a study where researchers asked 90 sorority members to judge the degree of within-group similarity for their own and 2 other groups. It was found that every participant judged their own sorority members to be more dissimilar than the members of the other groups.&lt;ref name="Park &amp; Rothbart (1982)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Bernadette | last2 = Rothbart | first2 = Myron | year = 1982 | title = Perception of out-group homogeneity and level of social categorization | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1051–1068 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.42.6.1051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial investigation===
{{Main|Cross-race effect}}

In an experiment, researchers revealed that people of other races do seem to look more alike than members of one's own race. When white students were shown faces of a few white and a few black individuals, they later more accurately recognized white faces they had seen and often falsely recognized black faces not seen before. The opposite results were found when subjects consisted of black individuals.&lt;ref name="Chance &amp; Goldstein (1981)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chance | first1 = June| last2 = Goldstein | first2 = Alvin | year = 1981 | title = Depth of processing in response to own and other race faces | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 475–480 | doi=10.1177/014616728173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
This bias was found to be unrelated to the number of group and non-group members individuals knew. One might think that people thought members of their own groups were more varied and different simply because they knew them better and thus have more information about ingroups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linville|first=Patricia W.|last2=Fischer |first2=Gregory W.|last3=Salovey|first3=Peter|title=Perceived distributions of the characteristics of in-group and out-group members: Empirical evidence and a computer simulation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989 | volume=57| issue=2| pages=165–188| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.165|pmid=2760805}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is actually not the case. The out-group homogeneity bias was found between groups such as "men" and "women" who obviously interact frequently.&lt;ref name=Rubin2004/&gt;

Elsewhere, this difference is attributed to differences in how people store or process in-group versus out-group information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Bernadette|last2=Judd |first2=Charles M.|title=Measures and models of perceived group variability|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1990|volume=59|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Thomas M.|last2=Carpenter |first2=Sandra L. |last3=Sedikides |first3=Constantine| last4=Li|first4=Fan|title=Differential processing of in-group and outgroup information.| journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| date=1993| volume=64| issue=1| pages=21–34| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.1.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this concept has been challenged due to some cases in which in-groups view themselves as homogeneous.  Researchers have postulated that such an effect is present when viewing a group as homogeneous helps to promote in-group solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lee| first=Yueh-Ting| last2=Ottati | first2=Victor| title=Determinants of ingroup and outgroup perceptions of heterogeneity: An investigation of Sino-American stereotypes.| journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology| date=1993| volume=24| issue=3| pages=298–318| doi=10.1177/0022022193243003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments on the topic found that in-group homogeneity is displayed when people who highly identify with a group are presented with stereotypical information about that group.&lt;ref name="De Cremer 138–146"&gt;{{cite journal| last=De Cremer| first=David| title=    Perceptions of group homogeneity as a function of social comparison: The mediating role of group identity| journal=Current Psychology| date=2001| volume=20| issue=2| pages=138–146| doi=10.1007/s12144-001-1021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A self-categorization theory account===

[[Self-categorization theory]] attributes the outgroup homogeneity effect to the differing contexts that are present when perceiving outgroups and ingroups.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."&gt;{{cite book |last=McGarty |first=C. |year=1999 |title=Categorization in social psychology |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi |isbn=0-7619-5953-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For outgroups, a perceiver will experience an intergroup context and therefore attend to differences between the two groups. Consequently, less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. When perceiving ingroup members a perceiver may experience either an intergroup context or an ''intragroup'' context. In an intergroup context the ingroup would also be predicted to be seen as comparatively homogeneous as the perceiver attends to the differences between “us” and “them” (in other words, depersonalization occurs). However, in an intragroup context the perceiver may be motivated to attend to differences with the group (between “me” and “others in the group”) leading to perceptions of comparative ingroup [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]. As perceivers are less often motivated to perform intra-group outgroup comparison, this leads to an overall outgroup homogeneity effect.

The self-categorization theory account is supported by evidence showing that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup will be perceived as more homogenous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup will be perceived as comparatively heterogeneous.&lt;ref name=" Haslam, et al. (1995)."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haslam |first=S. A. |last2=Oakes |first2=P. J. |last3=Turner |first3=J. C. |last4=McGarty |first4=C. |year=1995 |title=Social categorization and group homogeneity: changes in the perceived applicability of stereotype content as a function of comparative context and trait favourableness |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=139–160 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1995.tb01054.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt; The self-categorization theory account eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outgroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the [[minimal group paradigm]].&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;

===A social identity theory account===

Another body of research looked at ingroup and outgroup homogeneity from the perspective of [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt; While complementary to the self-categorization theory account, this body of research was concerned more with specific homogeneity effects associated with the motivations of perceivers. They derived from social identity theory the prediction that comparative ''ingroup'' homogeneity will at times arise due to demands to establish a positive and distinct social identity. For example, members of [[minority group]]s would be particularly likely to accentuate intragroup solidity through the emphasis of ingroup homogeneity. This is because minority group members, due to their minority status, are likely to experience threat to their self-esteem.

In [[standardization]], a '''profile''' is a subset internal to a [[specification]]. Aspects of a complex technical specification may necessarily have more than one interpretation, and there are probably many optional features. These aspects constitute a profile of the standard. Two implementations engineered from the same description may not interoperate due to having a different profile of the standard.  Vendors can even ignore features that they view as unimportant, yet prevail in the long run.  

The use of profiles in these ways can force one interpretation, or create de facto standards from official standards. Engineers can design or procure by using a profile to ensure interoperability.  For example, the International Standard Profile, ISP, is used by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in their ISO ISP series of standards; in the context of [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI networking]], Britain uses the UK-GOSIP profile and the US uses US-[[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile|GOSIP]]; there are also various mobile profiles adopted by the [[W3C]] for web standards. In particular, implementations of standards on mobile devices often have significant limitations compared to their traditional desktop implementations, even if the standard which governs both permits such limitations. 

In [[structural engineering]] a '''profile''' means a [[Hot rolling|hot rolled]] [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|structural steel]] shape like an [[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]].

In [[civil engineering]], a '''profile''' consists of a plotted line which indicates grades and distances (and typically depths of cut and/or elevations of fill) for excavation and grading work. Constructors of [[road]]ways, [[Rail transport|railways]] (and similar works) normally chart the profile along the centerline. A profile can also indicate the vertical slope(s) (changes in elevation) in a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] or similar structure. Civil engineers always depict profile as a side ([[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]) view (as opposed to an overhead ([[Plan view|plan]]) view).

== Material fabrication ==
In [[fabrication (metal)|fabricating]], a '''profile''' consists of the more-or-less complex outline of a shape to be cut in a sheet of material such as laminated plastic, aluminium alloy or [[steel]] [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|plate]]. In modern practice, a drawing office determines the shape and dimensions required to fit the sheet into a larger work and feeds directions to a computer controlling a [[profile cutter]]. This then cuts the shape from a standard-sized sheet. The cutting head may use a rotating cutter like that of a [[Wood router#Similar tools|spindle router]] or (in the case of steel plate) a torch which burns [[oxyacetylene|oxy-acetylene]] or other oxy-gas.

The rebirth doctrine in Buddhism, sometimes referred to as reincarnation or metempsychosis, asserts that rebirth does not necessarily take place as another human being, but as an existence in one of the six ''Gati'' (realms) called ''[[Bhavachakra]]''.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The six realms of rebirth include Deva (heavenly), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human), Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (resident of hell).&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Obeyesekere|first=Gananath| authorlink = Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|page=127|year=2005|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|ISBN=978-8120826090}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|This is discussed in many Suttas of different Nikayas.

The rebirth doctrine has been a subject of scholarly studies within Buddhism since ancient times, particularly in reconciling the rebirth doctrine with its ''[[Anatman_(Hinduism)|Anatman]]'' (no self, no soul) doctrine.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McClelland2010p227"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Wendy Doniger]]|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC|year=1999|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist traditions have disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn, as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after each death.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neufeldt1986p123"/&gt; Some Buddhist traditions assert that "no self" doctrine means that there is no perduring self, but there is ''avacya'' (inexpressible) self which migrates from one life to another.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The majority of Buddhist traditions, in contrast, assert that [[Vijnana]] (a person's consciousness) though evolving, exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes rebirth, rebecoming and redeath.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;{{Sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}}&lt;ref&gt;"Post-Classical Developments in the Concepts of Karma and Rebirth in Theravada Buddhism." by Bruce Matthews. in ''Karma and Rebirth: Post-Classical Developments'' State Univ of New York Press: 1986 {{ISBN|0-87395-990-6}} pg 125;&lt;br&gt;Collins, Steven.

== Buddhist terminology and doctrine ==
There is no word corresponding exactly to the English terms "rebirth", "metempsychosis", "transmigration" or "reincarnation" in the traditional Buddhist languages of Pāli and Sanskrit. Rebirth is referred to by various terms, representing an essential step in the endless cycle of ''samsara'', terms such as "re-becoming" or "becoming again"(Sanskrit: punarbhava, Pali: punabbhava), re-born (''punarjanman''), re-death (''punarmrityu''), or sometimes just "becoming" (Pali/Sanskrit: [[bhava]]), while the state one is born into, the individual process of being born or coming into the world in any way, is referred to simply as "birth" (Pali/Sanskrit: [[Jati (Buddhism)|jāti]]).&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=71-73}} The entire universal process of beings being reborn again and again is called "wandering about" (Pali/Sanskrit: [[Samsara (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]]).

Some English-speaking Buddhists prefer the term "rebirth" or "re-becoming" (Sanskrit: ''punarbhava''; Pali: ''punabbhava'') to "[[reincarnation]]" as they take the latter to imply an entity (soul) that is reborn.&lt;ref name="McClelland2010p227"/&gt; Buddhism denies there is any such soul or self in a living being, but does assert that there is a cycle of transmigration consisting of rebirth and redeath as the fundamental nature of existence.&lt;ref name="McClelland2010p227"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;&lt;ref name=6sourcesatmanfmt/&gt;

== Historical context ==
Before the time of the Buddha, many ideas on the nature of existence, birth and death were in vogue. The ancient Indian [[Vedic]] and [[Sramana]] schools affirmed the idea of soul, karma and cycle of rebirth. The competing Indian materialist schools denied the idea of soul, karma and rebirth, asserting instead that there is just one life, there is no rebirth, and death marks complete annihilation.{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|pp=38-43, 138-140}} From these diverse views, Buddha accepted the premises and concepts related to rebirth,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=708}} but introduced innovations.&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"/&gt; According to various Buddhist scriptures, Buddha believed in other worlds,

{{Quote|
Since there actually is another world (any world other than the present human one, i.e. different rebirth realms), one who holds the view 'there is no other world' has wrong view...
|Buddha, Majjhima Nikaya i.402, Apannaka Sutta|translated by Peter Harvey&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"/&gt;}}

Buddha also asserted that there is karma, which influences the future suffering through the cycle of rebirth, but added that there is a way to  end the cycle of karmic rebirths through ''nirvana''.&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neufeldt1986p123"/&gt; The Buddha introduced the concept that there is no soul (self) tying the cycle of rebirths, in contrast to themes asserted by various Hindu and Jaina traditions, and this central concept in Buddhism is called ''[[Anatman|anattā]]''; Buddha also affirmed the idea that all compounded things are subject to dissolution at death or ''[[Impermanence|anicca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma's review of [[Hajime Nakamura]]'s ''A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy'', Philosophy East and West, Vol. 37, No. 3 (Jul., 1987), page 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha's detailed conception of the connections between action (karma), rebirth and causality is set out in the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Doniger1999"/&gt;

== Ideas of rebirth ==
There are many references to rebirth in the early Buddhist scriptures. These are some of the more important; Mahakammavibhanga Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 136); Upali Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 56); Kukkuravatika Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 57); Moliyasivaka Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 36.21); Sankha Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 42.8).

The texts report that on the night of his enlightenment the Buddha gained the ability to recall his previous lives. It is said that he remembered not just one or two, but a vast number, together with the details of what his name, caste, profession, and so forth had been in each life. Elsewhere, the Buddha states that he could remember back 'as far as ninety one eons' (''[[Majjhima Nikaya]]'' i.483), one eon being roughly equal to the lifespan of a solar system.

Rebirth is discussed in Buddhist scriptures with various terms, such as ''Āgati-gati'', ''Punarbhava'' and others. The term ''Āgati'' literally means 'coming back, return', while ''Gati'' means 'going away' and ''Punarbhava'' means 're-becoming'.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|pages=94–95, 281–282, 294–295, 467, 499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1azdAAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-78329-6|pages=95–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Āgati-gati'' in the sense of rebirth and re-death appears in many places in early Buddhist texts, such as in Samyutta Nikaya III.53, Jataka II.172, Digha Nikaya I. 162, Anguttara III.54-74 and Petavatthu II.9.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"/&gt; ''Punarbhava'' in the sense of rebirth, similarly appears in many places, such as in Digha II.15, Samyutta I.133 and 4.201, Itivuttaka 62, Sutta-nipata 162, 273, 502, 514 and 733.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"/&gt; Numerous other terms for rebirths are found in the Buddhist scriptures, such as ''Punagamana'', ''Punavasa'', ''Punanivattati'', ''Abhinibbatti'', and words with roots of ''*jati'' and ''*rupa''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"/&gt;

===Mechanism===
While all Buddhist traditions except [[Navayana]] accept some notion of rebirth, they differ in their theories about rebirth mechanism and precisely how events unfold after the moment of death. The early Buddhist texts suggest that Buddha faced a difficulty in explaining what is reborn and how rebirth occurs, after he innovated the concept that there is "no self" ([[Anatta]]).&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p115"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|pages=115–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The texts also suggest that the ''Anicca'' theory led to difficulties in explaining that there is a permanent consciousness that moves from life to life.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p115"/&gt; Later Buddhist scholars such as Buddhaghosa suggested that the lack of a self or soul does not mean lack of continuity; and the rebirth across different realms of birth – such as heavenly, human, animal, hellish and others – occurs in the same way that a flame is transferred from one candle to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William H.

The [[Sautrantika]] sub-school of the Saravastivada Buddhist tradition, that emerged in 2nd century BCE, and influenced the 4th-century CE [[Yogacara]] school of Buddhism, introduced the idea of "transmigrating substratum of consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Sautrantika Sautrāntika], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that each personal act "perfumes" the individual and leads to the planting of a "seed" that would later germinate as a good or bad karmic result.

The [[Pudgalavada]] school of early Buddhism accepted the core premise of Buddhism that there is no ''attā'' (ātman, soul, self), but asserted that there is a "personal entity" (''pudgala'', ''puggala'') that retains a karma balance sheet and is mechanistically involved in rebirth; this personal entity, stated Pudgalavada Buddhists, is neither different nor identical to the five aggregates (skandhas).&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p168"/&gt; This concept of personal entity to explain rebirth by Pudgalavada Buddhists was polemically attacked by Theravada Buddhists in early 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p168"/&gt; The personal entity concept was rejected by the mid-1st millennium CE Pali scholar [[Buddhaghosa]], who attempted to explain rebirth mechanism with "rebirth-linking consciousness" (''patisandhi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Mathews|editor=Ronald Wesley Neufeldt|title=Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaRWtgXjplQC|year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-990-2|pages=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p168"&gt;{{cite book|author=James McDermott|editor=Wendy Doniger|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C&amp;pg=PA169|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03923-0|pages=168–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebirth realms ===
In traditional [[Buddhist cosmology]] the rebirth, also called reincarnation or metempsychosis, can be in any of six realms. These are called the ''Gati'' in cycles of re-becoming, ''[[Bhavachakra]]''.&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The six realms of rebirth include three good realms – Deva (heavenly, god), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human); and three evil realms – Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (hellish).&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt; The realm of rebirth is conditioned by the [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] (deeds, intent) of current and previous lives;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Obeyesekere|first=Gananath|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|page=127|year=2005|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|ISBN=978-8120826090}}&lt;/ref&gt; good karmas will yield a happier rebirth into good realm, bad karmas is believed to produce rebirth which is more unhappy and evil .&lt;ref name="buswelllopezp708"/&gt;

== Buddhist arguments for rebirth ==

=== Parapsychological evidence ===
Ancient Buddhists as well as some [[Buddhist modernism|moderns]] cite the reports of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and his disciples of having gained direct knowledge into their own past lives as well as those of other beings through a kind of [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] ability or [[extrasensory perception]] (termed [[Abhijñā|''abhiñña'']]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Bhikkhu Analayo]], Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research, Foreword by [[Henepola Gunaratana|Bhante Gunaratna]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Narada Thera, Buddhism in a nutshell, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Buddhist philosophers have defended the concept of special yogic perception (''yogipratyakṣa'') which is able to empirically verify the truth of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tillemans (2011), Dharmakirti, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Buddhists have also pointed to [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] phenomena as possible empirical evidence for rebirth, mainly [[Near-death experience|near-death experiences]], [[past life regression]], [[reincarnation research]] and [[xenoglossy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Analayo]], Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research, section III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Martin, Rebirth and the Western Buddhist, Wisdom Publications London, 1987, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical arguments ===
Besides defending the status of the Buddha as an epistemically authoritative or reliable person (''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]] puruṣa''), Indian [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosophers]] like [[Dignāga|Dignaga]] (c. 480–540 CE) and [[Dharmakirti]] (fl. c. 6th or 7th century), as well as [[Buddhist logico-epistemology#Dignaga-Dharmakirti school|later commentators on their works]], also put forth philosophical arguments in favor of rebirth and especially directed against the [[Reductionism|reductionist]] [[Materialism|materialist]] philosophy of the [[Charvaka|Carvaka]] school.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hayes, Richard P. Dharmakirti on punarbhava,1993.&lt;/ref&gt; To defend rebirth, Dharmakirti initially focuses on refuting the materialist doctrine of the Carvaka school, which held that the support (''asraya'') for cognition is the body and that when the body is destroyed, cognition is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, Dharmakīrti on compassion and rebirth, Arbeitskreis für Tibetische und Buddhistische Studien, Universität Wien, 1997, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard P. Hayes]], Dharmakirti denied that mental events were a mere byproduct of the body, instead holding that "both mental events and physical events can be seen as effects of the same set of causal conditions."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For Dharmakirti, all events are dependent on multiple causes, and they must be preceded by an "antecendent causal condition" of the same class. This means that all mental events ''must have'' a previous mental event as part of its causal nexus (presumably stretching back before one's birth). According to Hayes, Dharmakirti holds therefore that "both physical factors and nonphysical factors play a role in the formation of mental events", if not there would be no difference between sentient beings and inanimate matter.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eli Franco mentions that for Dharmakirti, the position that cognition "can arise from the body alone, independent of their similar causes" at the moment of birth is irrational. That is, if the mind is not being conditioned by a previous cognitive event, then it cannot arise from inert matter.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, Dharmakīrti on compassion and rebirth, Arbeitskreis für Tibetische und Buddhistische Studien, Universität Wien, 1997, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmakirti also argues that mental events can causally condition physical events, and thus there is no reason to privilege matter as being primary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Martin Willson, this kind of argument is the most commonly used in the Tibetan philosophical tradition to establish the truth of rebirth and in its most simple form can be put as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Martin, Rebirth and the Western Buddhist, Wisdom Publications London, 1987, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;With respect to the knowing (consciousness or mind) of an ordinary being just born: &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;it is preceded by earlier knowing; because it is knowing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Willson notes that this relies on two further assumptions, the first is that any mental continuum must have previous causes, the second is that [[materialism]] is false and that mind cannot emerge solely from matter ([[emergentism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Martin, Rebirth and the Western Buddhist, Wisdom Publications London, 1987, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Indian Buddhist philosophers who argued in this way attempted to disprove the theories of materialists ([[Charvaka|Carvaka]]).

[[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] makes a similar argument. According to the Abhidhamma teacher Nina van Gorkom, physical and mental events (''[[Dhamma theory|dhammas]]'') both depend on each other and on previous events of the same category (i.e. mental events must also be conditioned by previous mental events, and so on). In Abhidhamma, the mental event (''citta'') which arises at the first moment of life is called the rebirth consciousness or ''patisandhi-citta.'' According to van Gorkom, "there isn’t any citta which arises without conditions, the ''patisandhi-citta'' must also have conditions. The ''patisandhi-citta'' is the first ''citta'' of a new life and thus its cause can only be in the past."&lt;ref&gt;van Gorkom, Nina, Abhidhamma in Daily Life, 2009 p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pragmatic arguments and wager theories ===
Various Buddhists and interpreters of the Buddhist texts such as [[David Kalupahana]] and [[Étienne Lamotte|Etienne Lamotte]], have argued that the Buddha is a kind of [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] regarding truth, and that he saw truths as important only when they were [[Soteriology|soteriologically]] useful.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poussin; Bouddhisme, Third Edition, Paris, 1925, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David J. Ethics in Early Buddhism, 1995, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Buddhist position on rebirth could be defended on pragmatic grounds instead of empirical or logical grounds. Some modern Buddhists have taken this position.

The American monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] has argued for the acceptance of the Buddhist idea of rebirth as a type of pragmatic [[Pascal's Wager|wager argument]] ([[Pali]]: ''apaṇṇaka'', "safe bet" or "guarantee"). Thanissaro argues that "the Buddha stated that it's a safe wager to assume that actions bear results that can affect not only this lifetime for also lifetimes after this than it is to assume the opposite."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, The Truth of Rebirth and Why it Matters for Buddhist Practice © 2012 https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thanissaro cites [[Majjhima Nikaya]] 60 (''Apaṇṇaka sutta'') where the Buddha says that if there is an afterlife, those who perform bad actions have "made a bad throw twice" (because they are harmed in this world and in the next) while those who perform good actions will not, and thus he calls his teaching a "safe-bet teaching".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Thanissaro:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Buddha's main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his teachings, one would be likely to pay careful attention to one's actions, so as to do no harm. This in and of itself is a worthy activity regardless of whether the rest of the path was true. When applying this argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results, the Buddha sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles Pascal's wager: If one practices the Dhamma, one leads a blameless life in the here-and-now. Even if the afterlife and karmic results do not exist, one has not lost the wager, for the blamelessness of one's life is a reward in and of itself. If there is an afterlife with karmic results, then one has won a double reward: the blamelessness of one's life here and now, and the good rewards of one's actions in the afterlife. These two pragmatic arguments form the central message of this sutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.060.than.html|title=Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Apannaka Sutta: A Safe Bet, 2008|last=|first=|date=|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] Buddhist philosopher [[K. N. Jayatilleke|K.N. Jayatilleke]] writes that the Buddha's "wager argument" in MN 60 is that a rational person (''viññu puriso'') would reason as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 375, 406-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9551">'''Regression''' ({{lang-de|Regression}}), according to [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]], is a [[defense mechanism]] leading to the temporary or long-term reversion of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more [[adaptive]] way. The defense mechanism of regression, in psychoanalytic theory, occurs when an individual's personality reverts to an earlier stage of development, adopting more childish mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;

==Freud, regression, and neurosis==

Freud saw development, [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]], and regression as centrally formative elements in the creation of a neurosis. Arguing that 'the [[Libido|libidinal]] function goes through a lengthy development', he assumed that 'a development of this kind involves two dangers - first, of ''inhibition'', and secondly, of ''regression'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibitions produced fixations; and the 'stronger the fixations on its path of development, the more readily will the function evade external difficulties by regressing to the fixations'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurosis for Freud was thus the product of a flight from an unsatisfactory reality 'along the path of involution, of regression, of a return to earlier phases of sexual life, phases from which at one time satisfaction was not withheld. This regression appears to be a twofold one: a ''temporal'' one, in so far as the libido, the erotic needs, hark back to stages of development that are earlier in time, and a ''formal'' one, in that the original and primitive methods of psychic expression are employed in manifesting those needs'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 19950 p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;Behaviors associated with regression can vary greatly depending upon which [[Psychosexual development#Freud.27s_model_of_psychosexual_development|stage]] the person is fixated at:
An individual fixated at the [[oral stage]] might begin eating or smoking excessively, or might become very verbally aggressive.
A fixation at the anal stage might result in excessive tidiness or messiness. Freud recognised that 'it is possible for several fixations to be left behind in the course of development, and each of these may allow an irruption of the libido that has been pushed off - beginning, perhaps, with the later acquired fixations, and going on, as the lifestyle develops, to the original ones'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (Penguin Freud Library 9) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the service of the ego==

[[Ernst Kris]] supplements Freud's general formulations with a specific notion of "regression in the service of the ego"...the specific means whereby preconscious and unconscious material appear in the creator's consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Rothenberg/Carl R. Hausman, ''The Creativity Question'' (Duke UP 1976) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Kris thus opened the way for [[ego psychology]] to take a more positive view of regression. [[Carl Jung]] had earlier argued that 'the patient's regressive tendency...is not just a relapse into infantilism, but an attempt to get at something necessary...the universal feeling of childhood innocence, the sense of security, of protection, of reciprocated love, of trust'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Practice of Psychotherapy'' (London 1993) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Kris however was concerned rather to differentiate the way that 'Inspiration -...in which the ego controls the primary process and puts it into its service - needs to be contrasted with the opposite...condition, in which the ego is overwhelmed by the primary process'.&lt;ref&gt;Kris, quoted in Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (Harvard 1988) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless his view of regression in the service of the ego could be readily extended into a quasi-[[Romanticism|Romantic]] image of the creative process, in which 'it is only in the fiery storm of a profound regression, in the course of which the personality undergoes both dissolution of structure and reorganization, that the genius becomes capable of wresting himself from the traditional pattern that he had been forced to integrate through the identifications necessitated and enforced by the [[oedipal]] constellation'.&lt;ref&gt;Eissler, quoted in Solomom, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it was perhaps only a small step to the 1960s valorisation of regression as a positive good in itself. 'In this particular type of journey, the direction we have to take is ''back'' and ''in''....They will say we are regressed and withdrawn and out of contact with them. True enough, we have a long, long way to back to contact the reality'.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (Middlesex 1984) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Jungians had however already warned that 'romantic regression meant a surrender to the non-rational side which had to be paid for by a sacrifice of the rational and individual side';&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Adler, ''Studies in Analytical Psychology''(London 1999) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and Freud for his part had dourly noted that 'this extraordinary plasticity of mental developments is not unrestricted in direction; it may be described as a special capacity for involution - regression - since it may well happen that a later and higher level of development, once abandoned, cannot be reached again'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later views==

[[Anna Freud]] (1936) ranked regression first in her enumeration of the defense mechanisms',&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balint, ''The Basic Fault'' (1992) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly suggested that people act out behaviors from the stage of psychosexual development in which they are fixated. For example, an individual fixated at an earlier developmental stage might cry or sulk upon hearing unpleasant news.

[[Michael Balint]] distinguishes between two types of regression: a nasty "malignant" regression that the Oedipal level neurotic is prone to... and the "benign" regression of the basic-fault patient.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; The problem then is what the analyst can do 'to ensure that his patient's regression should be therapeutic and any danger of a pathological regression avoided'.&lt;ref&gt;Balint, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have highlighted the technical dilemmas of dealing with regression from different if complementary angles. On the one hand, making premature 'assumptions about the patient's state of regression in the therapy...regarded as still at the breast', for example, might block awareness of more adult functioning on the patient's part: of ''the patient's view of the therapist'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite mistake would be 'justifying a retreat from regressive material presented by a patient. When a patient begins to trust the analyst or therapist it will be just such disturbing aspects of the internal world that will be presented for understanding - not for a panic retreat by the therapist'.&lt;ref&gt;Casement, p. 180-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Blos suggested that 'revisiting of early psychic positions...helps the adolescent come out of the family envelope', and that 'Regression during [[adolescence]] thus advances the cause of development'.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Olinick speaks of 'regression in the service of the other' on the part of the analyst 'during his or her clinical work. Such ego regression is a pre-condition for [[empathy]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
* A clear example of regressive behavior in fiction can be seen in [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. Holden constantly contradicts the progression of time and the aging process by reverting to childish ideas of escape, unrealistic expectations and frustration produced by his numerous shifts in behavior. His tendencies to reject responsibility and society as a whole because he 'doesn't fit in' also pushes him to prolonged use of [[reaction formation]], unnecessary generalizations, and compulsive lying.
* A similar example occurs in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]''. Krapp is fixated on reliving earlier times, and reenacts the fetal condition in his 'den'. He is unable to form mature relationships with women, seeing them only as replacements for his deceased mother. He experiences physical ailments that are linked to his fetal complex, struggling to perform digestive functions on his own. This literal [[anal retentive]]ness exemplifies his inefficacy as an independent adult.

It may also refer to ''[[Northern Catalonia]]'' ({{italics correction|{{lang-ca|Catalunya Nord|links=no}}}}) or ''[[French Catalonia]]'', the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers.

==History==
Its name is derived from Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello), a small fortified place near modern-day [[Perpignan]] where Gaulish chieftains met to consider [[Hannibal]]'s request for a conference. The region formed part of the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] from 121 BC to AD 462, when it was ceded with the rest of [[Septimania]] to the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] [[Theodoric II]]. His successor, [[Amalaric]], on his defeat by [[Clovis I]] in 531, retired to [[Hispania]], leaving a governor in [[Septimania]].

In 719, the [[Saracens]] crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and maintained political hegemony of Septimania until their final defeat in 759 by [[Pepin the Short]], who went on to occupy Roussillon after [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|conquering Narbonne]]. Roussillon was occupied by the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]] in 760. On the invasion of Hispania in 778, [[Charlemagne]] found the [[Marca Hispanica]] wasted by war and the inhabitants settled in the mountains. He granted some lands in the plains to Visigothic refugees from [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Hispania]] and founded several monasteries. In 792, the Saracens again invaded France, but they were repulsed by Count [[William of Gellone|Guillaume]] of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]] - regent of the child [[Louis the Pious]], King of [[Kingdom of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] - whose hegemony extended into [[History of Catalonia|Catalonia]].

The different portions of his kingdom in time grew into [[Allod|allodial fiefs]] and, in 893, [[Sunyer II]] became the first hereditary [[Count]] of [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]]. But his rule only extended over the eastern part of what became the later province. The western part, the [[Cerdanya]] (French, Cerdagne), was ruled in 900 by [[Miro the Elder|Miró]] as first count, and one of his grandsons, Bernat, became the first hereditary count of the middle portion, or [[Besalú]]. The Counts of Roussillon were allied to their cousins the Counts of [[County of Empúries|Empúries]] in a centuries-long conflict with the surrounding great nobles. Count [[Girard I]] participated in the [[First Crusade]] in the following of [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond IV]] of [[Count of Toulouse|Toulouse]], and was one of the first to set foot in [[Jerusalem]] when it was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. At the beginning of the 12th century, the prestige of the [[County of Barcelona|Counts of Barcelona]] began to rise to such a height that the Counts of Roussillon had no choice but to swear fealty to them.

In 1111, [[Ramon Berenguer III]], Count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Besalú, to which was added in 1117 [[Cerdanya]]. The possession of Roussillon by its last count, [[Girard II of Roussillon|Girard II]], was challenged by his illegitimate brothers. To ensure that his brothers would not inherit his territories, in his will Girard II left all his lands to [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], who took possession in 1172. Under the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese monarchs]], economic and demographic growth of the region continued, and [[Collioure]] ({{lang-ca|Cotlliure}}), the port of [[Perpignan]], became an important locus of [[Mediterranean]] trade.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

As the French and Spanish crowns grew in power, the region of Roussillon, forming part of the border between them, was frequently a site of military conflict. By the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)]], [[Louis IX of France]] formally surrendered sovereignty over Roussillon and his claim to the title of Count of Barcelona to the Crown of Aragon, recognizing a centuries-old reality.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[James I of Aragon]] had wrested the [[Balearic Isles]] from the [[Moors]] and joined these islands with Roussillon to create the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], with its capital at Perpignan. In 1276, James I granted this kingdom to his son, who became [[James II of Majorca|James II]]. The subsequent disputes of this monarch with his brother [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] were exploited by [[Philip III of France]] in his quarrel with Peter III for the crown of the [[Two Sicilies]]. Philip III espoused James II's cause and led an army into Aragon but, retreating, died at [[Perpignan]] in 1285. Lacking the resources to continue the struggle, James then became reconciled to his brother Peter, and in 1311 the former was succeeded by his son Sanç I, or [[Sancho I of Majorca|Sancho I]], who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His successor, [[James III of Majorca]], refused to do homage to [[Philip VI of France]] for the seigneury of [[Montpellier]], and applied to [[Peter IV of Aragon]] for aid. Peter not only refused, but declared war and seized [[Majorca]] and Roussillon in 1344.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The province was now reunited to the [[Crown of Aragon]], and it enjoyed peace until 1462. In that year, the disputes between [[John II of Aragon]] and [[Charles, Prince of Viana|his son]] over the [[Kingdom of Navarre|Crown of Navarre]] spurred [[Louis XI of France]] to support John against his subjects, who had risen in revolt. The province, having been pledged as collateral to Louis for 300,000 crowns, was occupied by French troops until 1493, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] evacuated the region as part of a settlement with the [[Catholic Monarchs]] ([[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I]] of the [[Crown of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] of the [[Crown of Aragon]], they were second-cousins, creators of the [[House of Trastámara|Trastamara]] dynasty that ruled over the two Crowns).

During a subsequent war between France and the Trastamara dynasty (1496–1498), the people suffered equally from the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] garrisons and the French invaders.

The [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] dynasty took control of both the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1516 and the two crowns were for the first time ruled by the same physical person. This was under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (called Charles I of Spain), grandson of the Catholic Monarchs.

The dislike caused by the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilians]] during the Trastamara rule was effaced in the pride of sharing the glory of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. When [[Perpignan]] was [[Siege of Perpignan (1542)|besieged]] by the forces of [[Henry II of France|Henry]], [[Dauphin of France]] in 1542, the inhabitants were loyal to Charles V. Perpignan earned the royal sobriquet of "Fedelissima" ("Most Faithful City").

When the [[Catalans]] rose against the Spanish Crown in 1641, [[Louis XIII of France]] entered the conflict on the side of the former. After a protracted war, the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) secured [[Languedoc-Roussillon|Roussillon]] and part of the [[Cerdanya]] (Cerdagne) to the French crown, creating the French province of Roussillon.

The next fifty years saw a concerted effort by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] both to ensure the political allegiance of his new subjects and to alter their cultural identity.''' '''He was''' '''successful in the former but failed in the latter. Outside the capital of [[Perpignan]], [[Catalan language|Roussillon]] remained distinctly [[Catalonia|Catalan]] in outlook and culture until the late nineteenth century, when industrialization began to replace Catalan identity with French.

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Ancien Régime]] province of Roussillon was abolished and a new department, the Department of Pyrénées-Orientales, was created instead. This department corresponds roughly to the old Roussillon, with the addition of the [[comarca]] of [[Fenouillèdes]]. [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] is the name by which this department is officially known in France. The old name of Roussillon did contribute to the French ''[[regions of France|région]]'' of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6600">The '''Social Distance Corollary''' is a [[theory]] in communication research that concerns the tendency of people to perceive others to be more susceptible to media influence than they actually are.

This tendency is at the heart of the third-person effect, a phenomenon first defined and investigated by Davison (1983). Since then, much research has born out Davidson’s (1983) statement that “in the view of those trying to evaluate the effects of communication, its greatest impact will not be on “me” or “you,” but on “them”—the third persons.” Although “me” and “you” are put in one category, it is implied that some degree of distance exists between self and such close others as friends and lovers (Tsfati &amp; Cohen, 2004). More explicit remoteness exists between “me” and ”you” as a single unit and “them,” or others.

==Social distance==

The notion of [[social distance]] was first introduced by the [[sociologist]] Emory Bogardus (1925), who referred to it as the degrees of understanding and feeling that people experience regarding each other. Considering the social distance phenomenon an aspect of Davison’s (1983) third-person perception, Perloff (1993) articulated it as a complex variable including perceived similarity, familiarity, and identification, and pointed that there are at least two different ways to conceptualize social distance. First, social distance is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] going from “just like me” to “not at all like me.” Second, social distance reflects the [[heterogeneity]] and size of the audience. Perloff (1993), reviewing 16 studies of the third-person effect, acknowledged that the phenomenon is magnified when the hypothetical others are defined in broad terms. Thus, in Perloff’s (2002) terms, social distance corollary is “the notion that self-other disparities grow in magnitude with increases in perceived distance between self and comparison others.” 

The social distance corollary is not dependent on whether there are media effects or not; rather, it is a perceptual phenomenon. To measure estimates of effects on self and others, Brosius and Engel (1996) constructed a questionnaire comprising three independent variables: First person; Third person, close distance; and Third person, remote distance. In other words, Brosius and Engel varied psychological distance and found that perceived effects were greater for “remote” others. Also it was found that third-person effects reveal itself most strongly among people of higher age and education. 

Cohen, Mutz, Price, and Gunther (1988) found that [[Stanford]] students perceived media effects to be less on themselves than on other Stanford students; also, other Californians were considered to be more susceptible to media impact than “other Stanford students.” A similar study (Gunther, 1991) was done at the [[University of Minnesota]], and the social distance phenomenon was supported. As groups became more broadly defined (other University of Minnesota students, other [[Minnesota]] residents), participants’ perception of media effects on the groups increased. 

Investigating the third-person effect in regard to political identification, Duck, Hogg, and Terry (1995) found that perception of self-other differences in media vulnerability are influenced by the subjectively salient social relationship between self and other, and are governed by motivational needs, such as [[self-esteem]], social-identity, and differentiation from others. Other researchers (e.g., Burger, 1981; Schlenker &amp; Miller, 1977) suggested that [[self-serving bias]]es consider close friends and relatives as an extension of self, whereas such a vague category as “other” might evoke [[stereotype]]s in people’s minds (Perloff &amp; Fetzer, 1986).  

After several studies, the notion of [[social distance]] was enshrined as the “social distance corollary” (Meirick, 2005). According to Perloff’s review (1999), of the 11 studies that have tested the social-distance notion, 9 confirmed it, articulating this phenomenon as “another factor on which the strength of the third-person effect hinges.”

The '''Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC)''' was a student activist group in the southern [[United States]] during the 1960s, which focused on many political and social issues including:   African-American [[civil rights]], opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], worker's rights, and feminism. It was intended, in part, to be [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] for Southerners and [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] for white students{{snd}} at a time when it was [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|dangerous]] for SDS to attempt to organize in the Deep South and when SNCC was starting to discuss expelling white volunteers. It was felt that students at the traditionally white and black colleges in the South could be more effectively organized separately than in an integrated student civil rights organization; however, this was controversial and initially opposed by advisors like Anne Braden. Sue Thrasher and Archie Allen of the Christian Action Fellowship were among the founders of the group, with the support of [[Robert Parris Moses|Bob Moses]] and others.&lt;ref name="struggle-better-south"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Michel|first=Gregg|title=Struggle for a Better South: The Southern Student Organizing Committee, 1964-1969.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60256-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7_0GgAACAAJ&amp;dq=southern+student+organizing+committee&amp;ei=BMNrS4WtJY-INqSFsZQL&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its inception, the group had close ties to controversial Louisville, Kentucky radicals Carl and [[Anne Braden]] and their organization, the [[Southern Conference Education Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6259523/The-not-so-silent-minority.html Ernst, John and Baldwin, Yvonne. "The not so silent minority: Louisville's antiwar movement, 1966-1975"] ''Journal of Southern History'' (February 2007). Retrieved April 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but a deliberate effort was later  made to put some distance between the SSOC and the Bradens to avoid the appearance that the SSOC was a Communist front.

After its founding, SSOC came to be formally tied to the SDS as a fraternal organization with a regional mandate in the South, and joint SDS-SSOC chapters existed at some schools like the [[University of North Carolina]]. A monthly organ,''The New South Student'', was published on a regular basis. In 1967, SSOC organizers led by [[The Great Speckled Bird (newspaper)|Gene Guerrero]] and [[Lynn Wells]], worked with [[TWUA]] on a unionization drive in North Carolina textile mills, involving more than 300 students in the campaign. In 1968, Gene Guerrero and Howard Romaine were among the SSOC activists involved in founding Atlanta's widely circulated [[underground press|underground newspaper]], [[The Great Speckled Bird (newspaper)|The Great Speckled Bird]].

SSOC considered itself a distinctly Southern organization and sometimes embraced traditional [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] symbols and language. In 1968, SSOC staged a series of antiwar protests called "Southern Days of Secession," in which they urged Southerners to "secede" from the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="new-left-revisited-48"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Left Revisited|editor=John Campbell McMillian, Paul Buhle|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2003|pages=48|isbn=978-1-56639-976-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=southern+student+organizing+committee&amp;ei=BMNrS4WtJY-INqSFsZQL&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=southern%20student%20organizing%20committee&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSOC button was a Confederate flag with black and white hands shaking in front of it. The hands were modeled on a handshake between SSOC organizer Archie Allen and SNCC chairman John Lewis.  It was designed by an artist on the SNCC staff.

SSOC had an extensive literature program, printing thousands of copies of pamphlets on civil rights, the Vietnam war, poverty and campus reform that were sold on campus literature tables across the south.  The bestseller was entitled "Vietnam: The Myth and Reality of American Policy."  During the school year, it published a monthly magazine called The New South Student, copies now sell for a high premium on the internet. One of the magazine's features was a series called "The Roots of Southern Radicalism", which featured stories on historic predecessors of SSOC back to slave revolts, the American revolution, the abolition movement, the Populists, the union organizing drives of the 1930s, and institutions and organizations like Highlander Center, Koinonia Farms, and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare.  SSOC also organized a conference in Atlanta on Radical Southern History.

SSOC had four chairmen during its five-year history: Gene Guerrero, Howard Romaine, Steve Wise, and Tom Gardner. During its last year, it changed the post to two secretaries, Mike Welch and Lyn Wells, and added a newspaper called The Phoenix, to SSOC's list of publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/docs/64_ssoc_about.pdf|format=PDF|title=THE SOUTHERN STUDENT ORGANIZING COMMITTEE (SSOC) was organized in response to an urgent and growing need for communication and education in the South.|website=Crmvet.org|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSOC leased the historic camp at Buckeye Cove in Swannanoa, North Carolina from the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen and held many conferences there. SSOC conferences had a variety of topics but were a way for southern activists, who often felt isolated on the conservative and largely segregated campuses of the time to meet like-minded students from other places and draw strength and inspiration from their activities.

Through a traveling teach-in on Vietnam and American foreign policy that toured southern states between 1967 and 1969, SSOC helped to organize the antiwar movement in the south. The appearance of SSOC delegations at national antiwar marches always resulted in enthusiastic applause.

For some Southern schools, even though SSOC had a presence, the numbers were so small in comparison to the size of the student bodies that it could not gain traction as anything but protest theatre. For example, SSOC organizers came to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, connected with a few individuals and left buttons and flyers with them and then departed. Of the 26,000 students on campus, only about ten were recruited.

Early in 1969 these individuals gathered in a highly resonant hallway and staged an "organizational meeting". On audiotape it sounded like hundreds were attending and a motion was made to follow SDS's example at Columbia University and take over the campus Administration building the next day.

The tape was "leaked" to the Administration of U.T. and, to the surprise of the participants, the next morning the campus was flooded with police, the windows of the Administration building were shuttered with wooden boards, and a truck was backed up to the doorway blocking entry while keeping the Administration locked inside. One of the members volunteered to brandish a toy water-pistol machine gun and parade back and forth in front of the building. Everyone else stayed out of sight. The individual was arrested and subsequently released. Nothing more happened.&lt;ref&gt;Personal recollection of Russ Reina&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, radicals in SDS increasingly saw SSOC as too liberal and too timid. SSOC finally dissolved itself in 1969 as the result of an internal struggle with members of [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor]], a Maoist sect, after members of PL had successfully passed a resolution at an SDS convention condemning SSOC's "anachronistic" regionalism and breaking the ties between the organizations.&lt;ref name="sds"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SDS|author=Kirkpatrick Sale|publisher=Random House|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''The Kudzu'': Birth and Death in Underground Mississippi" by David Doggett, in ''Voices from the Underground: Insider Histories of the Vietnam Era Underground Press'' ed. by Ken Wachsberger (Tempe, AZ: Mica's Press, 1993), p. 213-232. Doggett, who was at one point a candidate for president of SSOC, states that the conflict inside SSOC was a power struggle between a clique of SSOC headquarters staffers who were secretly Communist Party members, and insurgents from the Progressive Labor Party who had gotten control of some of the local branches.&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakup of SSOC came in 1969, the same year that its counterpart New Left Organizations, SNCC and SDS, collapsed—in part because of the COINTELPRO efforts, but in larger part because the movement had grown so widespread that the organizational forms of the early 1960s were no longer able to handle it. What SSOC organizer Ed Hamlett called "the radical beer-drinking five" on southern campuses became the long-haired pot-smoking hundreds (or thousands), and instead of getting ideas from mimeographed pamphlets, they could turn on the nightly news and see massive demonstrations and dramatic trials like those of the Chicago 7.

In the bitterness following the breakup of SSOC, the organization's papers were taken and burned, lest they fall into the hands of the FBI. This also threatened the memory of the organization and its efforts with becoming historically extinct. However, in the 1990s, a graduate student at the University of Virginia, Gregg Michel, decided to write his dissertation on SSOC and began contacting and interviewing old activists, and organized a reunion of them in Charlottesville, VA in 1994.  It turned out that many people had saved SSOC material, and were willing to donate them to an archive that was established at the University of Virginia Library.  Michel's dissertation was published as "Struggle for a Better South" in 2004 and the memory of the organization was brought back from the brink of historic oblivion. The book was launched with a panel at the American Studies Association convention in Atlanta in 2004 that brought together many SSOC and SNCC activists (including all four SSOC chairmen).

After the breakup of SSOC, two former members, Howard Romaine and Sue Thrasher, were instrumental in forming the [[Institute for Southern Studies]] with [[Julian Bond]].

[[Raymond Luc Levasseur]], later the leader of the [[United Freedom Front]], worked with the SSOC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EVpIpSuP1TkC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;ots=_8X4xjiciX&amp;dq=%22Southern%20Student%20Organizing%20Committee%22%20levasseur&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Southern%20Student%20Organizing%20Committee%22%20levasseur&amp;f=false "Raymond Luc Levasseur"] ''Imprisoned Intellectuals''.

* '''An abstract definition''': a (projective&lt;ref name=projectivealgebra&gt;There is another notion, an '''injective stereotype algebra''', which is defined as a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in the [[Stereotype space#Category of stereotype spaces|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces with the dual tensor product, &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;. The class of these algebras is much narrower.&lt;/ref&gt;) '''stereotype algebra'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=271}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2005}} is a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in the [[Stereotype space#Category of stereotype spaces|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces with the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;.

* '''An analytic definition''': let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a [[stereotype space]] (over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers&lt;ref&gt;...or the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers&lt;/ref&gt;) and suppose it is endowed with a bilinear operation &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in A\times A\mapsto x\cdot y\in A&lt;/math&gt; that turns &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into a [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra]] (over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;). Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a (projective) '''stereotype algebra'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=271}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=483}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=147}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017|p=594}} if the multiplication &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in A\times A\to A&lt;/math&gt; is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_space#Universality_of_'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-0000014E-QINU%60%22' continuous bilinear map in the stereotype sense], i.e. if for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;S\cdot V\subseteq U\quad \&amp;\quad V\cdot S\subseteq U.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The requirement on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the analytic definition of stereotype algebra can be equivalently expressed as follows: for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each [[Net (mathematics)|net]] &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; tending to zero in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
y_i\overset{A}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}}0
&lt;/math&gt; 
the nets &lt;math&gt;x\cdot y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_i\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; tend to zero in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;x\in S&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;
x\cdot y_i\overset{A}{\underset{x\in S}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\rightrightarrows}}}0
\quad \&amp;\quad y_i\cdot x\overset{A}{\underset{x\in S}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\rightrightarrows}}}0.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''morphism of stereotype algebras'' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous unital&lt;ref&gt;A homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''unital'' if it preserves unit: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1_A)=1_B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:A\to B&lt;/math&gt;.

Stereotype algebras form a subclass in the class of ''separately continuous'' [[topological algebra]]s.

== Examples ==

:1. All [[Fréchet algebra]]s are stereotype. In particular, all [[Banach algebra]]s are stereotype.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}}  
:2. For each [[stereotype space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the stereotype space of operators &lt;math&gt;X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;, is a stereotype algebra with respect to the operation of composition.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}}
:3. The main examples of ''functional algebras''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}} in Analysis and Geometry are stereotype algebras: 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[continuous function]]s on a [[paracompact space|paracompact]] [[locally compact topological space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[smooth function]]s on a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[holomorphic function]]s on a [[Stein manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[polynomials]] (regular functions) on an [[affine algebraic variety]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. 
:4. [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|Stereotype group algebras]]. In the case when the space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in the previous examples has a structure of a [[topological group]], the [[Stereotype space#Definition|dual stereotype spaces]] to the functional algebras on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are stereotype algebras with respect to the operation of [[convolution#Convolution of measures|convolution]]:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}} 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Radon measure]]s with compact support on a [[locally compact group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite locally compact group then the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of measures on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[Fréchet algebra]]. In the case when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is compact, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Smith space]]. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact, then &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Brauner space]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s with compact support on a [[real Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic functionals on a Stein group&lt;ref name=Stein-group&gt;A ''Stein group'' is a [[complex Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which is a [[Stein manifold]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of currents on an [[affine algebraic group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.
:In contrast to the other models of group algebras in functional analysis, the stereotype group algebras possess the [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|universal property]]&lt;ref&gt;I.e. the homomorphisms of stereotype algebras &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)\to A&lt;/math&gt; are in one-to-one correspondence with the continuous representations &lt;math&gt;G\to A&lt;/math&gt; of the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and the same is true for the algebras &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; with the smooth, holomorphic and polynomial representations of the corresponding groups.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=275}} and the structure of [[Hopf algebra]]{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=507}}.

== Stereotype modules ==

A stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''left stereotype module'' over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, if a bilinear operation &lt;math&gt;(a,x)\in A\times X\mapsto a\cdot x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is defined that turns &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a left [[module (mathematics)|module]] over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and this operation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_space#Universality_of_'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-0000014E-QINU%60%22' continuous bilinear map in the stereotype sense]: for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;
S\cdot V\subseteq U,
&lt;/math&gt;

and at the same time for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;W\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;
W\cdot T\subseteq U.
&lt;/math&gt;

The notion of a ''right stereotype module'' over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined by analogy.

The theory of stereotype algebras allows to simplify the formulations in the theory of [[topological algebra]]s and to bring this field closer to [[abstract algebra]]. The following two results (which do not hold for general jointly or separately continuous algebras) are typical illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Other illustrations are the already mentioned [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|universality property for the stereotype group algebras]]{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=275}} and the structure of [[Hopf algebra]] on them{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=507}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem'''.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=283}} ''A stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a structure of left (right) module over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a stereotype module over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the operation of multiplication &lt;math&gt;(a,x)\in A\times X\mapsto a\cdot x\in X&lt;/math&gt; (respectively, &lt;math&gt;(x,a)\in X\times A\mapsto x\cdot a\in X&lt;/math&gt;) defines a continuous map (a representation) &lt;math&gt;A\to X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Here &lt;math&gt;X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stereotype space#Ste as a *-autonomous category|stereotype space of operators &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem'''.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=289}} ''For each stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the categories &lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''Ste''' and '''Ste'''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of left and right stereotype modules over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are [[Enriched category|enriched categories]] over the [[Stereotype space#Ste as a *-autonomous category|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces.''

== Applications ==

The notion of stereotype algebra is used in the generalizations{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}} of the [[Pontryagin  duality]] theory to the classes of non-commutative groups based on the notion of [[Envelope (category theory)|envelope]]: the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous envelopes of stereotype algebras lead respectively to the constructions of the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous dualities in ''big geometric disciplines'' – [[complex geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[topology]] – for certain classes of (not necessarily commutative) topological groups considered in these disciplines ([[affine algebraic group]]s, and some classes of [[Lie group]]s and Moore groups).{{sfn|Akbarov|2009}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}

A '''system of measurement''' is a collection of [[units of measurement]] and rules relating them to each other. Systems of measurement have historically been important, regulated and defined for the purposes of [[science]] and [[commerce]]. Systems of measurement in modern use include the [[metric system]], the [[imperial system]], and [[United States customary units]].

==History==
{{main article|History of measurement}}

The [[French Revolution]] gave rise to the [[metric system]], and this has spread around the world, replacing most customary units of measure. In most systems, [[length]] (distance), [[mass]], and [[time]] are ''base quantities''.

Later science developments showed that either [[electric charge]] or [[electric current]] could be added to extend the set of base quantities by which many other [[Metrology|metrological units]] could be easily defined. (However, electrical units are not necessary for such a set. [[Gaussian units]], for example, have only length, mass, and time as base quantities, and the ampere is defined in terms of other units.) Other quantities, such as [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[speed]], are derived from the base set: for example, speed is distance per unit time. Historically a wide range of units was used for the same type of quantity: in different contexts, length was measured in [[inch]]es, [[Foot (length)|feet]], [[yards]], [[fathom]]s, [[Rod (unit)|rods]], [[Chain (unit)|chains]], [[furlong]]s, [[mile]]s, [[nautical mile]]s, [[stadia (length)|stadia]], [[League (unit)|leagues]], with conversion factors which were not powers of ten. Such arrangements were satisfactory in their own contexts.

The preference for a more universal and consistent system (based on more rational base units) only gradually spread with the growth of science. Changing a measurement system has substantial financial and cultural costs which must be offset against the advantages to be obtained from using a more rational system. However pressure built up, including from scientists and engineers for conversion to a more rational, and also internationally consistent, basis of measurement.

In antiquity, ''systems of measurement'' were defined locally: the different units might be defined independently according to the length of a king's thumb or the size of his foot, the length of stride, the length of arm, or maybe the weight of water in a keg of specific size, perhaps itself defined in ''hands'' and ''knuckles''. The unifying characteristic is that there was some definition based on some standard. Eventually ''[[cubit]]s'' and ''[[yard|strides]]'' gave way to "customary units" to meet the needs of merchants and scientists.

In the metric system and other recent systems, a single basic unit is used for each base quantity. Often secondary units (multiples and submultiples) are derived from the basic units by multiplying by powers of ten, i.e. by simply moving the [[decimal point]]. Thus the basic metric unit of length is the [[metre]]; a distance of 1.234&amp;nbsp;m is 1,234&amp;nbsp;millimetres, or 0.001234&amp;nbsp;kilometres.

===Current practice===
{{main article|Metrication}}
Metrication is complete or nearly complete in almost all countries. [[US customary units]] are heavily used in the [[United States]] and to some degree in [[Liberia]]. Traditional [[Burmese units of measurement]] are used in [[Burma]]. U.S. units are used in limited contexts in Canada due to the large volume of trade; there is also considerable use of Imperial weights and measures, despite ''de jure'' Canadian conversion to metric.

A number of other jurisdictions have laws mandating or permitting other systems of measurement in some or all contexts, such as the United Kingdom – whose [[road signage legislation (UK)|road signage legislation]], for instance, only allows distance signs displaying [[imperial units]] (miles or yards)&lt;ref name=TSRGD&gt;{{cite web

In the United States, metric units are used almost universally in science, widely in the military, and partially in industry, but customary units predominate in household use. At retail stores, the liter is a commonly used unit for volume, especially on bottles of beverages, and milligrams, rather than grains, are used for medications. Some other standard non-[[SI]] units are still in international use, such as [[nautical mile]]s and [[knot (unit)|knots]] in aviation and shipping.

==Metric system==
{{Main article|Metric system|International System of Units}}
[[File:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|thumb|upright|A baby bottle that measures in three measurement systems—metric, imperial (UK), and US customary.]]

[[Metric system]]s of units have evolved since the adoption of the first well-defined system in France in 1795. During this evolution the use of these systems has spread throughout the world, first to non-English-speaking countries, and then to English speaking countries.

Multiples and submultiples of metric units are related by powers of ten and their names are formed with [[SI prefix|prefixes]]. This relationship is compatible with the decimal system of numbers and it contributes greatly to the convenience of metric units.

In the early metric system there were two base units, the [[metre]] for length and the [[gram]] for mass. The other units of length and mass, and all units of area, volume, and derived units such as density were derived from these two base units.

[[Mesures usuelles]] ([[French language|French]] for ''customary measurements'') were a system of measurement introduced as a compromise between the metric system and traditional measurements. It was used in France from 1812 to 1839.

A number of variations on the metric system have been in use. These include [[gravitational metric system|gravitational systems]], the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimetre–gram–second systems]] (cgs) useful in science, the [[metre–tonne–second system of units|metre–tonne–second system]] (mts) once used in the USSR and the [[metre–kilogram–second system of units|metre–kilogram–second system]] (mks).

The current international standard metric system is the [[International System of Units]] (''Système international d'unités'' or SI) It is an mks system based on the [[metre]], [[kilogram]] and [[second]] as well as the [[kelvin]], [[ampere]], [[candela]], and [[mole (unit)|mole]].

The SI includes two classes of units which are defined and agreed internationally. The first of these classes includes the seven [[SI base unit]]s for length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity and amount of substance. The second class consists of the [[SI derived unit]]s. These derived units are defined in terms of the seven base units. All other quantities (e.g. work, force, power) are expressed in terms of SI derived units.

==Imperial and US customary units==
{{Main article|Imperial and US customary measurement systems|Imperial units|US customary units}}
Both [[imperial unit]]s and [[United States customary units|US customary units]] derive from earlier [[English unit]]s. Imperial units were mostly used in the former [[British Empire]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], but in all these countries they have been largely supplanted by the metric system. They are still used for some applications in the United Kingdom but have been mostly replaced by the metric system in [[commerce|commercial]], [[scientific]], and [[industry|industrial]] applications.
US customary units, however, are still the main system of measurement in the [[United States]]. While some steps towards [[metrication]] have been made (mainly in the late 1960s and early 1970s), the customary units have a strong hold due to the vast industrial infrastructure and commercial development.

While imperial and US customary systems are closely related, there are a number of [[Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems|differences between them]]. Units of length and area (the [[inch]], [[foot (unit)|foot]], [[yard]], [[mile]] etc.) are identical except for surveying purposes.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} The [[Avoirdupois]] units of mass and weight differ for units larger than a [[pound (mass)|pound]] (lb). The imperial system uses a stone of 14&amp;nbsp;lb, a long [[hundredweight]] of 112&amp;nbsp;lb and a long [[ton]] of 2240&amp;nbsp;lb. The stone is not used in the US and the hundredweights and tons are short: 100&amp;nbsp;lb and 2000&amp;nbsp;lb respectively.

Where these systems most notably differ is in their units of volume. A US [[fluid ounce]] (fl&amp;nbsp;oz), about 29.6 [[millilitre]]s (ml), is slightly larger than the imperial fluid ounce (about 28.4&amp;nbsp;ml). However, as there are 16&amp;nbsp;US&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz to a US [[pint]] and 20&amp;nbsp;imp&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz per imperial pint, the imperial pint is about 20% larger. The same is true of [[quart]]s, [[gallon]]s, etc. Six US gallons are a little less than five imperial gallons.

The [[Avoirdupois]] system served as the general system of mass and weight. In addition to this there are the [[Troy weight|Troy]] and the [[Apothecaries' system]]s. Troy weight was customarily used for [[precious metal]]s, [[black powder]] and [[gemstone]]s. The troy ounce is the only unit of the system in current use; it is used for precious metals. Although the troy ounce is larger than its Avoirdupois equivalent, the pound is smaller. The obsolete troy pound was divided into 12 ounces, rather than the 16 ounces per pound of the Avoirdupois system. The Apothecaries' system was traditionally used in [[pharmacology]], but has now been replaced by the metric system; it shared the same pound and ounce as the troy system but with different further subdivisions.

==Natural units==
[[Natural units]] are [[Physics|physical]] [[units of measurement]] defined in terms of universal [[physical constants]] in such a manner that selected physical constants take on the numerical value of one when expressed in terms of those units.  Natural units are so named because their definition relies on only properties of [[nature]] and not on any human construct. Various systems of natural units are possible.

Some other examples are as follows:
* [[Geometrized unit system|Geometric unit systems]] are useful in [[Theory of relativity|relativistic physics]]. In these systems the base physical units are chosen so that the [[speed of light]] and the [[gravitational constant]] are set equal to unity.
* [[Planck units]] are a form of geometric units obtained by also setting [[Boltzmann's constant]], the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force constant]] and the [[reduced Planck constant]] to unity. They are based only on properties of [[free space]] rather than any object or particle.
* [[Natural units#Stoney units|Stoney units]] are similar to Planck units but set the [[elementary charge]] to unity and allow Planck's constant to float (i.e. it is a number that has to be determined by experiment).
* [[Natural units#"Schrödinger" units|"Schrödinger" units]] are also similar to Planck units and also set the elementary charge to unity, but allow the speed of light to float.
* [[Atomic units]] are a system of units used in [[atomic physics]], particularly for describing the properties of [[electron]]s. The atomic units have been chosen such that several the constants relating to the electron are all equal to one. They are similar to "Schrödinger" units but set the [[electron mass]] to unity and allow the gravitational constant to float. The unit of [[energy]] in this system is the total energy of the [[electron]] in the [[Bohr atom]] and called the [[Hartree energy]]. The unit of length is the [[Bohr radius]].
* [[Natural units#Electronic system of units|Electronic units]] are similar to Stoney units but set the [[electron mass]] to unity and allow the gravitational constant to float. They are also similar to atomic units but set the speed of light to unity and allow Planck's constant to float.
* [[Natural units#Quantum electrodynamical system of units|Quantum electrodynamical units]] are similar to the electronic system of units except that the [[proton mass]] is normalised rather than the electron mass.

==Non-standard units==
[[List of unusual units of measurement|Non-standard measurement units]], sometimes found in books, newspapers etc., include:

===Area===
* The [[American football#Field and players|American football field]], which has a playing area {{convert|100|yd|m|1|lk=in}} long by {{convert|160|ft|m|1}} wide. This is often used by the [[United States|American]] public media for the sizes of large buildings or parks. It is used both as a unit of length ({{convert|100|yd|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}, the length of the playing field excluding goal areas) and as a unit of area ({{convert|57600|sqft|m2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), about {{convert|1.32|acre|ha|lk=on}}.
* British media also frequently uses the [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] for equivalent purposes, although [[soccer]] pitches are not of a fixed size, but instead can vary within defined limits ({{convert|100|-|130|yd|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} long, and {{convert|50|-|100|yd|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide, giving an area of {{convert|5000|to|13000|sqyd|m2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). However the [[UEFA Champions League]] field must be exactly {{convert|105|by|68|m|yd|2|abbr=on}} giving an area of {{convert|7140|m2|ha|abbr=on}} or {{convert|8539|sqyd|acre|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Example: [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2698634.ece HSS vessels are aluminium catamarans '''about the size of a football pitch'''... - Belfast Telegraph 23 June 2007]
* Larger areas are sometimes expressed as a multiple of the areas of certain American states, or subdivisions of the UK etc.

===Energy===
* A ton of [[TNT equivalent]], and its multiples the kiloton, the megaton, and the gigaton. Often used in stating the power of very energetic events such as [[explosion]]s and [[volcanic]] events and [[earthquakes]] and [[asteroid]] impacts. A [[gram]] of TNT as a unit of [[energy]] has been defined as 1000 thermochemical calories ({{convert|1000|cal|J|0|abbr=on|lk=on|disp=or}}).
* The [[Little Boy|atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima]]. Its force is often used in the [[public media]] and popular [[books]] as a unit of energy. (Its yield was roughly 13 kilotons, or 60 TJ.)
* One stick of [[dynamite]]

==Units of currency==
A unit of measurement that applies to [[money]] is called a [[unit of account]] in economics and unit of measure in accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fasri.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Johnso2007n--Unit-of-Acct-Paper.pdf Financial Accounting Standards Research Initiative: The Unit of Account Issue]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally a [[currency]] issued by a [[country]] or a fraction thereof; for instance, the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] and US cent ({{frac|100}} of a dollar), or the [[euro]] and euro cent.

[[ISO 4217]] is the international standard describing three letter codes (also known as the currency code) to define the names of currencies established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

A '''temporal paradox''', '''time paradox''', or '''time travel paradox''' is a [[paradox]], an apparent contradiction, or a logical contradiction that is associated with the idea of time and time travel. In physics, temporal paradoxes fall into two broad groups: consistency paradoxes exemplified by the [[grandfather paradox]]; and [[causal loop]]s.&lt;ref name="lobo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0206078v2.pdf |title= Time, Closed Timelike Curves and Causality |page=2 |author=Francisco Lobo |year=2002 |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, a variation of the Fermi paradox also applies to [[time travel]].

==Causal loop==
{{main|Causal loop}}
A causal loop is a paradox of time travel that occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn is the cause of the future event. Both events then exist in [[spacetime]], but their origin cannot be determined. A causal loop may involve an event, a person or object, or information.&lt;ref name="lobo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standford-encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel/index.html#CauLoo |author=[[Nicholas J.J. Smith]] |date=2013 |title=Time Travel |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms boot-strap paradox, predestination paradox or ontological paradox are sometimes used in fiction to refer to a causal loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |page=6 |author= Leora Morgenstern |year=2010 |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klosterman2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486 |page=60 |edition=1st Scribner hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZurDFJtAWwC&amp;pg=PA60 |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Grandfather paradox==
{{main|Grandfather paradox}}
The consistency paradox or grandfather paradox occurs when the past is changed in any way, thus creating a contradiction. A time traveler ''can'' do anything that ''did'' happen, but ''can't'' do anything that ''didn't'' happen. Doing something that didn't happen results in a contradiction.&lt;ref name="standford-encyclopedia" /&gt; Consistency paradoxes occur whenever changing the past is possible.&lt;ref name="lobo" /&gt;

==Fermi paradox==
{{main|Time travel#Absence of time travelers from the future}}
The [[Fermi paradox]] can be adapted for time travel, and phrased "if time travel were possible, where are all the visitors from the future?" Answers vary, from time travel not being possible, to the possibility that visitors from the future can not reach any arbitrary point in the past, or that they disguise themselves to avoid detection.&lt;ref name="sagan-nova"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/time/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan Ponders Time Travel|work=NOVA|date=December 10, 1999|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought''''' is a book on [[Modernism]] by historian [[William Everdell]], published in 1997 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. A ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book of 1997, ''The First Moderns'' suggests that "the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/books/notable-books-of-the-year-1997.html, "Notable Books of the Year 1997"], ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1997. Accessed July 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 351&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Everdell, Dean of Humanities at [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in Brooklyn Heights,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/books/it-s-about-time-it-s-about-space.html "It's About Time. It's About Space."], ''The New York Times,'' August 17, 2003. Accessed July 28 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Modernism first emerged in the field of mathematics rather than the arts, specifically in the work of German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who, in 1872, demonstrated that mathematicians operate without a continuum; this represents the formalization of Everdell's axiom of "ontological discontinuity," which he goes on to examine in a multiplicity of contexts. He examines this emerging framework of discreteness in science ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s mechanics, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Cajal]]'s neuroscience, [[Hugo de Vries]]'s conception of the gene and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s quantum work, [[Einstein]]'s physics); mathematics, logic, and philosophy ([[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and the linguistic turn, [[Husserl]] and the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]); in addition to the arts ([[James Joyce]]'s novels, [[Picasso]]'s [[Demoiselles d'Avignon|''Demoiselles D'Avignon'']], [[Schoenberg]]'s twelve-tone music).

==Reviews==

Critics largely reviewed ''The First Moderns'' favorably, appreciating Everdell's interdisciplinary approach, in publications including the [[New york review of books|''New York Review of Books'']], the ''New York Times,'' the [[Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times,'']] and the [[Washington Post Book World|''Washington Post''.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/05/20/infinitesimally-yours/ "Infinitesimally Yours"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''New York Review of Books,'' May 20, 1999. "Drawing together such disparate manifestations as Seurat's pointillism, Muybridge's stop-motion photography, the poetry of Whitman, Rimbaud, and Laforgue, the tone rows of Schoenberg, and the novels of Joyce, the author [Everdell] makes an engrossing and persuasive case for his claim that 'the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/970629.29kennert.html "A Change of Mind], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought'', ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1997. "The change started to happen in the 1870's [sic], and not, as William R. Everdell arrestingly demonstrates in ''The First Moderns,'' in painting or in literature but in number theory. He's aware that word-focused people will be startled: ''Everyone who has heard of modernism has heard of Picasso. Most have heard of Joyce. But who has heard of Dedekind?'' Yet it was an 1872 pamphlet of Richard Dedekind's that first, to use the terminology of 19th-century positivism, ''rigorized'' modernism's generic concept -- which, as Everdell reveals, is discontinuity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Morton]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/20/books/bk-14342 "Deconstructing Modernism"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''Los Angeles Times'', July 20, 1997. "''The First Moderns'' brilliantly maps the beginning of a path at whose end loom as many diasporas as there are men."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">A '''torture museum''' is a [[museum]] that exhibits instruments of [[torture]] and provides tutorials on the history of torture and its use in human society. Several museums dedicated to the history of torture are located in [[Europe]].

==Torture museums==
Examples of the torture museums in Europe include: 
* Museo della Tortura di Siena in [[Siena]], [[Italy]]; 
* the [[Torture Museum, Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]; 
* Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments,  Amsterdam, Netherlands;
* the [[Torture Museum Oude Steen]] in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]; 
* the [[Rüdesheim am Rhein#Museums|Mediaeval Torture Museum]] (''Mittelalterliches Foltermuseum'') in [[Rüdesheim am Rhein]], Germany; 
* the Medieval Crime Museum (''das Kriminalmuseum'') in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber#Museums|Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], [[Germany]]; 
* the Medieval Criminal and Torture Museum (''Museo della Tortura e di Criminologia Medievale'') in [[San Gimignano]], [[Italy]];
* the Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. 
* and the Tortureum - Museum of Torture in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]

The Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments was opened in 2012. It uses human size wax figures to increase the interactive learning of what the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] considered to be torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com|title=Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments Amsterdam|work=Torture Museum Amsterdam|accessdate=9 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133744/http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''revaluation of all values''' or "'''transvaluation'''" is a [[concept]] from the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy]] of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

Elaborating the concept in ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', Nietzsche asserts that  [[Christianity]], not merely as a religion but also as the predominant moral system of the Western world, inverts nature, and is "hostile to life".  As "the religion of pity", it elevates the weak over the strong, exalting that which is "ill-constituted and weak" at the expense of that which is full of life and vitality.

Nietzsche compares Christianity to [[Buddhism]]. He posits that Christianity is "the struggle against sin", whereas Buddhism is "the struggle against suffering"; to Nietzsche, Christianity limits and lowers humankind by assailing its natural and inevitable instincts as depraved ("[[sin]]"), whereas Buddhism advises one merely to eschew [[dukkha|suffering]]. While Christianity is full of "revengefulness" and "antipathy" (e.g., the [[Last Judgment]]), Buddhism promotes "benevolence, being kind, as health-promoting."  Buddhism is also suggested to be the more "honest" of the two religions, for its being strictly "[[phenomenalism|phenomenalistic]]", and because "Christianity makes a thousand promises but ''keeps none''."  [[Martyrdom]], rather than being a moral high ground or position of strength, is indicative of an "''obtuseness'' to the question of truth."

Similarly, Nietzsche contrasts 19th-century European morality to that of pre-Christian Greek civilization. Because sex is, in Nietzsche's thought, a fundamental affirmation of life, for its being the very process by which human life is created, Christianity's elevation of chastity (including, for example, the story of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]'s virginal pregnancy) is counter to the natural instincts of humanity, and therefore a contradiction of "natural values".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Nietzsche's enthusiasm for what he called "transvaluation" stemmed from his contempt for Christianity and the entirety of the moral system that flowed from it: indeed, "contempt of man", as Nietzsche states near the end of ''The Antichrist''. Nietzsche perceived the moral framework of Christian civilization to be oppressive:  
* Reproduction derided as sinful
* Life as a mere investment for the hollow promise of an illustrious afterlife
* Death valued over life

Transvaluation would mean the exaltation of life rather than the exaltation of suffering, and an acceptance of every instinct or lust as organic and therefore valid{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, and so beyond the scope of moral condemnation. What one desires would be merely what one desires, rather than either sinful or pious. What one desires would be the product of stimuli rather than the product of "will".

{{quote|I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct for revenge for which no expedient&amp;nbsp;''(i.e. A means of attaining an end, especially one that is convenient but considered improper or immoral)''&amp;nbsp;is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, ''petty''&amp;nbsp;—I call it the one immortal blemish of mankind…&lt;br /&gt;

And one calculates time from the ''dies nefastus'' on which this fatality arose—from the ''first'' day of Christianity! ''Why not rather from its last? From today?'' Revaluation of all values!|sign=Nietzsche|source=Conclusion, ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |authorlink=Friedrich Nietzsche |title=The Antichrist |chapter=Conclusion |edition=2005 Cosimo |date=1895 |isbn=978-1-59605-681-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Revaluation of All Values]]'' was also the working title of a series of four books Nietzsche was planning to write, only the first of which—''The Antichrist''—he ever completed. However, one of his schemas for ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' used "The Revaluation of All Values" as a subtitle, and it was this scheme that his sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] used to assemble his notes into the final book with that title.

{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
'''Treaty rights''' are certain rights that were reserved by [[indigenous peoples]] when they signed [[treaties]] with [[settler societies]] in the wake of [[European colonization]].  This applies to the rights of [[Alaska Natives]] and [[Native Americans in the United States]] and [[First Nations in Canada]], as well as to a smaller number of [[Inuit]] and [[Metis in Canada]] who have entered into treaties.

Treaty rights are not the only [[Aboriginal rights|rights claimed by indigenous peoples]].  Indigenous people claim inherent rights to [[self-determination]], which implies that they be recognized as [[rights-bearing]] groups (called "tribes", "bands", or "nations" depending on the place and time) capable of [[self-determination]] and [[cultural survival]].&lt;ref name="AJI"&gt;AJI Report, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the state recognizes that there is another [[body corporate]] with [[legal personality]] capable of making binding agreements on behalf of its members, then negotiations can begin for mutual exchange and aid: a treaty.  The earliest of these agreements, between [[colonialism|colonial powers]] such the French, British, and the Dutch and various indigenous peoples of the [[Atlantic world|Atlantic coastal regions]] had the character of [[military alliances]], as between peers.  Later treaties, however, were generally about the [[cession of land]] from weakened Aboriginal peoples to expanding settler states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100028602/1100100028603|title=Treaty Rights|last=Branch|first=Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Communications|date=|website=www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] [[the Crown|the British Crown (i.e. the state)]] declared that individual British subjects could not buy land from native nations; only the Crown could obtain land from native nations through treaty, which it could then redistribute to individuals.  This principle, which was adopted by both Canada and the United States upon gaining independence from Britain, became the legal impetus for all subsequent treaties in North America.

By signing treaties, indigenous peoples traded vast amounts of their land and resources in exchange for reserved areas of land ([[Indian reservation]]s [US terminology] and [[Indian reserves]] [Canadian terminology]) and things like protection (from attacks on their lands), [[Treaty 6|health care]], [[:Category:Indigenous education|education]], and [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], protection of hunting and fishing rights, and sometimes some monies as well. Because [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] of the [[United States Constitution]] declares treaties to be the supreme law of the land, treaties are just as valid today as they were the day they were signed, and treaty rights are still legally binding as well.  Likewise treaty rights were enshrined in Canada under [[section 35]] by the [[patriation|package of constitutional reforms of 1982]].

A common critique of the treaty relationship is that treaty rights are [[In-group favoritism|"special" rights]] given to indigenous people by the state because of their [[racial preference|racial status]].  Defenders of the treaty system argue however, that the government does not "give" treaty rights to anyone – native people reserved them when they signed treaties in a government-to-government relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arcbc.tripod.com/marshall-Rights.htm|title=What are treaty rights?|last=|first=|date=|website=arcbc.tripod.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treaty rights are frequently subject to public debate, particularly hunting and fishing rights. Many Native nations have reserved rights to hunt and fish in their [[ancestral domain|accustomed places]], which are often lands that was given up at the treaty signing, or "ceded land". This leads to conflict with sports and commercial hunters and fishers, who are competing for the same [[Resource|limited resource]] in the same place.

Another common source of conflict is [[land management|management decisions about the land or rivers]] on which Native people have rights. Things like dams and logging have huge effects on fish and wildlife populations.  In Canadian law, government how have a court-mandated "[[duty to consult]]" indigenous peoples regarding the management process of these lands and rivers.  In the United States, no such mandate exists.

=== Spearfishing in Northern Wisconsin ===
{{Main|Wisconsin Walleye War}}
Beginning in the 1980s and extending into the early 1990s, Northern Wisconsin was rife in protests against [[Ojibwe]] spearfishing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glifwc.org/minwaajimo/Papers/3%20-%20Pierson%20--%20The%20Spearfishing%20Civil%20Rights%20Case%20(GLIFWC).pdf|title=The Spearfishing Civil Rights Case: Lac Du Flambeau Band v.

Spearheaded by groups like Stop Treaty Abuse (STA),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; often violent and racially discriminatory protests against spearfishing covered boat landings across northern [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to the case ''[[Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa|Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians]] v. Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin'', which culminated with Judge [[Barbara Brandriff Crabb|Barbara Crabb]] upholding the Voigt decision and many members, donors, and politicians distancing themselves from the STA, which many believed was racist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Whaling in Washington ===
The right to hunt North Pacific [[Gray whale|Gray Whales]] has been a contentious issue for the [[Makah]] people in Washington state.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/noaa-study-could-set-stage-for-resumption-of-tribal-whaling/|title=NOAA study could set stage for Makah whaling to resume|last=|first=|date=2015-03-06|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2017-04-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://environs.law.ucdavis.edu/volumes/32/2/brand.pdf|title=The Struggle to Exercise a Treaty Right: An Analysis of the Makah Tribe's Path to Whale|last=Brand|first=Emily|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nwtreatytribes.org/makah-tribe-continues-pursuit-of-treaty-whaling-right/|title=Makah Tribe pursues treaty right to whale|last=|first=|date=2015-05-04|work=Northwest Treaty Tribes|access-date=2017-04-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Makah people ceded much of their traditional lands in the Treaty of Neah Bay in 1855, but retained the right to whale.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The tribe voluntarily gave up this practice in 1915 because of decimated Grey Whale populations, but once the species was taken off the Federal [[Endangered species|Endangered Species]] List in 1993, the tribe sought to continue whaling. In 1999, they killed one whale, but faced immediate backlash from environmental groups and animal rights groups.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) believed that the Makah tribe’s quota of harvesting up to five whales a year would not hurt the recovering population.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because of a number of new studies garnishing evidence for and against this practice, the issue has been tied up in court since 1999, with the tribe being unable to exercise the right given to them in the Treaty of Neah Bay.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Annexation of Hawaii ===
{{Main|Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii}}
Throughout the nineteenth century, the United States made a number of treaties with the then [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], the final being in 1887. These treaties recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii as being sovereign and independent. In 1893, [[John L. Stevens]], US minister assigned to the Kingdom of Hawaii, led a group of non-indigenous people to overthrow [[Queen Lili‘uokalani]], which was backed by United States naval forces. They established a Provisional government, which then declared itself the Republic of Hawaii. In 1899, the US annexed Hawaii. Many Hawaiian sovereignty activists feel that because of the aforementioned treaties, Hawaii should today be its own Nation instead of part of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.hawaii.edu/sites/www.law.hawaii.edu/files/content/Faculty/NHRts-HSBJ806.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Rights of the Native Hawaiian People|last=Van Dyke|first=Jon|last2=MacKensie|first2=Melody|date=July 2006|website=University of Hawaii at Mānoa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dakota Access Pipeline ===
{{Main|Dakota Access Pipeline|Dakota Access Pipeline protests}}
The Indigenous people of [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock reservation]] in North and South Dakota believe that the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]], which runs near their main source of water, could contaminate that source of water should it leak. The also cite the Fort Laramie Treaties of [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|1851]] and [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|1868]], which promised the land that DAPL runs through to the Sioux Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/treaty-resonates-in-dapl-discussion/article_e9bd6a47-e14e-507e-bb0a-8ee29eb30c9e.html|title=1851 Treaty Resonates in DAPL Discussion|last=Schlecht|first=Jenny|date=November 10, 2016|work=Bismarck Tribune|access-date=2017-04-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lands were seized in 1877 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ndstudies.gov/gr8/content/unit-iii-waves-development-1861-1920/lesson-4-alliances-and-conflicts/topic-2-sitting-bulls-people/section-6-after-battle-little-big-horn|title=Section 6: After the Battle of the Little Big Horn {{!}} North Dakota Studies|website=ndstudies.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;(8) and 1887 with the [[Dawes Act|Dawes Allotment Act]] that broke up reservations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&amp;doc=50|title=Our Documents - Dawes Act (1887)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ourdocuments.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (9). Some call for these treaties to be reinstated and enforced today, which would put the course of the DAPT straight through Sioux lands.

The '''turnpike model of money'''  explains valued money as a way to facilitate trade between agents who meet as strangers in spatially separated isolated markets with no communication or transactions between the markets at any time.

In the standard [[Frictionless market|frictionless]] [[Arrow-Debreu model]], since the nonmonetary competitive equilibria are already [[Pareto optimal]], money can't facilitate exchange or is at best useless. A common approach in [[monetary economics]] is to either require that agents hold money for institutional reasons (for example, to pay taxes, or because the government forces individuals to accept it), to enter money holdings directly into individual's utility functions (the so-called "money in utility" or [[Miguel Sidrauski|Sidrauski model]]), or to impose an arbitrary [[Cash-in-advance constraint]] (the so-called [[Robert Clower|Clower constraint]]). However all of these approaches are somewhat ad hoc and do not explain why intrinsically worthless money can have value as medium of exchange. The turnpike model of money is one of the possible resolutions of this theoretical problem.&lt;ref name=freshwater&gt;Townsend R.  Models of Money with Spatially Separated Agents, in Models of Monetary Economies, John Kareken and Neil Wallace, eds., Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1980, 265-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wren &amp; Martin''''' refers to a single book ''High School English Grammar and Composition'' or collectively, a series of English [[grammar]] textbooks written jointly by [[P. C. Wren]] and [[H. Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhatia|first=Sidharth|title=Looking for my copy of Wren &amp; Martin|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/opinion/column_looking-for-my-copy-of-wren-and-martin_1273151|newspaper=DNA|date=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written primarily for the children of [[British_Army|British officers]] residing in [[India]], these books were widely adopted by [[India|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] schools in the post-colonial era and missionary schools in [[Burma]]. The books were published in 1935, with a discussion on [[Composition (language)|composition]] added later. The content in the books is largely based on ''[[The Manual of English Grammar and Composition]]'' by [[J. C. Nesfield]].

Other books in this series are ''Elementary English Grammar'', ''A First Book of English Grammar and Composition'', ''High School English Grammar and Composition'' and ''A Final Course of Grammar &amp; Composition''. The series of textbooks is still in use at many Indian schools.  While [[semantic change]] has dated the original books, they continue to enjoy considerable popularity and updated versions are now in common use. Copies of the different versions of this series are available online.&lt;ref&gt;
