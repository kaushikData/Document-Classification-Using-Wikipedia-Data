Miller, 105–118. Athens: Ohio University Press, 2009. (p. 114.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and works==

The main source for ‘Arīb's life is the tenth-century ''[[Kitab al-Aghani|Kitāb al-Aghānī]]'' of [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani|Abū ’l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī]]:&lt;ref&gt;al-Iṣfahīnī, Abu l-Faraj, ''Kitāb al-aghānī'', Dār al-Fikr, 21 parts and Index in 9 vols., equivalent to the edition Kairo 1322/1905–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like her peers, he tells us, ‘Arīb was versed in poetry, composition and music performance, along with sundry other skills, backgammon, chess and calligraphy among them. Her chosen instrument was the oud, a preference she would pass on to her students, but, above all, it was her singing and composition that stood out. Citing one of his key sources, [[Abdallah ibn al-Mu'tazz|Ibn al-Mu‘tazz]], Abū ’l-Faraj refers to a collection of notebooks (''dafātir'') and loose sheets (''ṣuḥuf'') containing her songs. These are said to have numbered around 1,000. As regards her singing, Abū ’l-Faraj declares that she knew no rival among her peers. He groups her, alone among them, with the legendary divas of the earliest Islamic period, the singers known collectively as the ''Ḥijāzīyāt''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Gordon, 'The Place of Competition: The Careers of ‘Arīb al-Ma’mūnīya and ‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī, Sisters in Song', in ''‘Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of ‘Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6-10 July 2002'', ed. by James E. Montgomery (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), pp. 61-81 (p. 64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Born in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], ‘Arīb was rumoured in the Middle Ages to be the daughter of vizier [[Barmakids|Ja'far al-Barmaki]], a key member of the [[Barmakids]], and one of the family's domestic servants, Fāṭima. This parentage has been questioned by modern scholars. Either way, she was clearly a slave for important portions of her early life, whether born into slavery or sold into slavery as a ten-year-old following her family's downfall. ‘Arīb's own poetry twice protests at her servile status, and she was manumitted by [[Al-Mu'tasim|Abū Isḥāq al-Mu‘taṣim]] (r. 833-42).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Gordon, 'The Place of Competition: The Careers of ‘Arīb al-Ma’mūnīya and ‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī, Sisters in Song', in ''‘Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of ‘Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6-10 July 2002'', ed. by James E. Montgomery (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), pp. 61-81 (pp. 64-65). https://www.academia.edu/358518/.&lt;/ref&gt; She allegedly rose to being the favourite singer of Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun|al-Maʾmūn]] (r. 813-33).&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Poems by Arab Women: A Bilingual Anthology'', ed. and trans. by Abdullah al-Udhari (London: Saqi Books, 1999), p. 140 {{ISBN|086356-047-4}}; books.google.co.uk/books/about/Classical_poems_by_Arab_women.html?id=WniBAAAAIAAJ&amp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

‘Arīb's surviving oeuvre and associated anecdotes suggest not ony her poetic skills, but also a life in which she had a number of relationships with male lovers and patrons, indicating 'that ‘Arīb, like many of her peers, was a concubine as well as a singer when circumstances required'. It appears that she came to maintain a substantial entourage of her own and was a landowner. One of the most famous stories attached to her concerns a singing contest which she and her singing-girls won against her younger rival [[Shāriyah]] and her troupe.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Imhof, 'Traditio vel Aemulatio? The Singing Contest of Sāmarrā’, Expression of a Medieval Culture of Competition', ''Der Islam'', 90 (2013), 1-20 (with a translation pp. 4-7), DOI 10.1515/islam-2013-0001, http://www.goedoc.uni-goettingen.de/goescholar/bitstream/handle/1/10792/Traditio%20vel%20Aemulatio.pdf?sequence=1.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence suggests a figure who was 'willful, deeply intelligent, impatient with those of lesser wits and, perhaps inevitably, bemused and often cynical'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Gordon, 'The Place of Competition: The Careers of ‘Arīb al-Ma’mūnīya and ‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī, Sisters in Song', in ''‘Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of ‘Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6-10 July 2002'', ed. by James E. Montgomery (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), pp. 61-81 (pp. 65-66). https://www.academia.edu/358518.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ‘Arīb's verse is the following:

::To you treachery is a virtue, you have many faces and ten tongues.
::I'm surprised my heart still clings to you in spite of what you put me through.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah al-Udhari, ''Classical Poems by Arab Women'' (London: Saqi, 1999), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the early biographical information is correct, ‘Arīb died at the age of 96.

'''''Artikulation''''' is an [[electronic composition]] by [[György Ligeti]]. Composed and notated in January and February 1958, the piece was prepared and recorded on [[magnetic tape]] from February to March with the assistance of [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s assistant, [[Cornelius Cardew]], at the [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Studio for Electronic Music]] of the [[West German Radio]] (WDR) in Cologne.&lt;ref name="Schott"&gt;György Ligeti, Rainer Wehinger (1970).

Mainz: Schott.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece consists of various types of sounds, "in conditions of aggregation."&lt;ref name="Schott"/&gt; It "can be heard as a conversation without words."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Morin. ed. (2002). ''Classical Music: The Listener's Companion'', p.515. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9780879306380}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ligeti explains in notes to the listening score (see below):

{{quote|The piece is called '[[Articulation (phonetics)|Artikulation]]' because in this sense an artificial language is articulated: [[call and response (music)|question and answer]], high and low voices, [[mixed language|polyglot]] speaking and interruptions, impulsive outbreaks and humor, [[charring]] and [[whispering]].&lt;ref name="Schott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phidelity"&gt;kris (Aug. 22, 2009).

"He escaped the Soviet invasion of Budapest in 1956."&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Artikulation'' is the only one of three electronic pieces written in Cologne which remain in Ligeti's [[catalogue (music)|catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;Louise Duchesneau and Wolfgang Marx (2011). ''György Ligeti: Of Foreign Lands and Strange Sounds'', p.130, n.33. Boydell &amp; Brewer. {{ISBN|9781843835509}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
He completed only two works in the electronic medium, however—''Glissandi'' (1957) and ''Artikulation'' (1958)—before returning to instrumental music. A third work, originally entitled ''Atmosphères'' but later known as ''Pièce électronique Nr. 3'', was planned, and though the technical limitations of the time prevented Ligeti from realizing it completely, it was finally realized in 1996 by the Dutch composers Kees Tazelaar and Johan van Kreij of the [[Institute of Sonology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Joy Iverson, " [https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/6905 Historical Memory and György Ligeti's Sound-Mass Music 1958–1968]", PhD diss (Austin: University of Texas at Austin, Butler School of Music, 2009): 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
See: [[List of compositions by György Ligeti]]. In composing ''Artikulation'' Ligeti, like many composers around him, was inspired by, "the age-old question of the relationship between music and speech," their approach greatly inspired by phoneticist [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]].&lt;ref name="Taruskin"&gt;Richard Taruskin (2009). ''Music in the Late Twentieth Century: The Oxford History of Western Music'', Vol. 6, p.52. Oxford. {{ISBN|9780199796007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''AllMusic'''s Blair Sanderson describes ''Artikulation'' as, "difficult to judge from its brevity and similarity to other tape experiments of the time."&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;

==Composition==
Ligeti used both [[chance music|chance]], such as in selection of sound segments, and an overall plan; all related to [[phonetics]].&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Thom Holmes (2012). ''Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music, and Culture'', p.368-70. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781136468957}}.&lt;!--"Ligeti took a path that diverged from Stockhausen's serial approach in which every minute detail was managed by an overall scheme."--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Part serial, part empirical, part aleatoric."&lt;ref name="Steinitz"&gt;Richard Steinitz (2011). ''Gyorgy Ligeti: Music of the Imagination'', page unmarked. Faber &amp; Faber. {{ISBN|9780571261116}}. "syllables", "words", "sentences", "language".&lt;/ref&gt; Ligeti used technology including [[sine wave]], [[white noise]], and [[impulse generator]]s, as well as [[audio filter|filters]].&lt;ref name="Steinitz"/&gt;

{{Quote|First I chose types [of noise, or artificial phonemes] with various group-characteristics and various types of internal organization, as: grainy, friable, fibrous, slimy, sticky and compact materials. An investigation of the relative permeability of these characters indicated which could be mixed and which resisted mixture.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;}}

Having conceived of many various possible and artificial phonemes, created recordings of them, and grouped them into various categories and bins, Ligeti created a formula (and many tables) to determine the maximum length of each tape used (the louder the shorter), and then went through a process of grabbing randomly, without-looking, similar "phonemes" out of their bins, combining them into "texts", and then cutting these in half, down to "words".&lt;ref name="Steinitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Antokoletz (2014). ''A History of Twentieth-Century Music in a Theoretic-Analytical Context'', p.371. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781135037307}}. "Sounds to texts to words to languages to ''Articulation''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this process, the piece has been described as, "spontaneous, even witty,"&lt;ref name="Steinitz"/&gt; "humorous,"&lt;ref&gt;Antokoletz (2014), p.420.&lt;/ref&gt; and as, "influential."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.polarmusicprize.org/laureates/gyorgy-ligeti/ György Ligeti]", ''PolarMusicPrize.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes argues that though Ligeti abandoned electronic music after ''Glissandi'' and ''Artikulation'', "it seems clear he could not have conceived some of his later works [such as ''Atmosphères''] had he not learned the techniques of composing with slowly modulating textures and timbres that came with producing tape music."&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

==Listening score==
[[Fred Lerdahl]]&lt;!--{{harvtxt|Lerdahl|1992|loc=112–13}}--&gt; argues that discretization is necessary not only for [[musical analysis]] but also for perception even by learned listeners, and thus that pieces such as ''Artikulation'' are inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Lerdahl (1988/1992). "Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems", p.235. ''Contemporary Music Review'' 6, no. 2:97–121.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in 1970 [[graphic designer]] [[Rainer Wehinger]] ([[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart]]) created a "[[Hörpartitur]]" or "score for listening" for the piece, representing different sonorous effects with specific graphic symbols much like a [[transcription (music)|transcription]]. Despite Ligeti's original [[Graphic notation (music)|notation]], consisting of a large number of charts and tables,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Toop (1999). ''György Ligeti'', p.60. Phaidon. {{ISBN|9780714837956}}. ''Artikulation'' is, "an essentially lively cheerful work."&lt;/ref&gt; this score, approved by the composer, has been described as having, "a unique and appealing aesthetic," and as being, "easy to follow when viewed aligned with the music."&lt;ref&gt;Yotam Mann. "[http://vis.berkeley.edu/courses/cs294-10-sp10/wiki/images/5/5e/YotamFinalPaper.pdf Artikulate: Ligeti Style for Any Audio]", ''Vis.Berkeley.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the key to the score:
{{quote|Wehinger...focuses on the main sonic characteristics: uses a timeline measured in seconds; shapes and colors instead of the notes on a staff; different colors that represent variations in [[timbre]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]]; dots that are standing for [[attack (music)|impulses]] and [[comb filter|combs]] for [[noise (music)|noise]].&lt;ref name="Foldvari"/&gt;}}
The depiction of frequency using the y-axis may be, "[[loudness war|very approximate]]&lt;!--...only holds the lowest and highest frequencies as a reference--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Christian Dimpker (2013). ''Extended Notation: The Depiction of the Unconventional'', p.214. LIT Verlag Münster. {{ISBN|9783643903020}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The score was later synced to the music and posted on YouTube.&lt;ref name="Phidelity"/&gt; Though Holmes finds, "the artistic value in visualizing this work...plain to see,"&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt; [[Richard Taruskin|Taruskin]] argues the score is, "decorative or celebratory...rather than...practical."&lt;ref name="Taruskin"/&gt;

Tom Service of ''The Guardian'' argues that even prior to Wehinger's score and its [[animation]], "Ligeti himself imagined the sounds of ''Artikulation'' conjuring up images and ideas of labyrinths, texts, dialogues, insects, catastrophes, transformations, disappearances."&lt;ref name="Service"/&gt;

{{double image|right|CMYK color swatches.svg|150| CMYK subtractive color mixing.svg |150|Color printing typically uses ink of four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. |When CMY “primaries” are combined at full strength, the resulting “secondary” mixtures are red, green, and blue.

}}
The '''CMYK color model''' ('''process color''', '''four color''') is a [[Subtractive color|subtractive]] [[color model]], used in [[color printing]], and is also used to describe the printing process itself. '''CMYK''' refers to the four inks used in some color printing: [[cyan|'''c'''yan]], [[magenta|'''m'''agenta]], [[yellow|'''y'''ellow]], and [[black|blac'''k''']].

The CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colors on a lighter, usually white, background. The ink reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected. Such a model is called ''subtractive'' because inks "subtract" the colors red, green and blue from white light. White light minus red leaves cyan, white light minus green leaves magenta, and white light minus blue leaves yellow.

In [[additive color]] models, such as [[RGB color model|RGB]], white is the "additive" combination of all [[primary colors|primary]] colored lights, while black is the absence of light. In the CMYK model, it is the opposite: white is the natural color of the paper or other background, while black results from a full combination of colored inks. To save cost on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, [[saturation (color theory)|unsaturated]] and dark colors are produced by using black ink instead of the combination of cyan, magenta, and yellow.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

== Halftoning ==
[[File:Halftoningcolor.svg|thumb|This diagram shows three examples of color halftoning with CMYK separations, as well as the combined halftone pattern and how the human eye would observe the combined halftone pattern from a sufficient distance.]]
{{main|Halftone}}
With CMYK printing, ''[[halftone|halftoning]]'' (also called ''screening'') allows for less than full saturation of the primary colors; tiny dots of each primary color are printed in a pattern small enough that humans [[color vision|perceive]] a solid color. Magenta printed with a 20% halftone, for example, produces a pink color, because the eye perceives the tiny magenta dots on the large white paper as lighter and less saturated than the color of pure magenta ink.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Without halftoning, the three primary process colors could be printed only as solid blocks of color, and therefore could produce only seven colors: the three primaries themselves, plus three secondary colors produced by layering two of the primaries: cyan and yellow produce green, cyan and magenta produce blue, yellow and magenta produce red (these subtractive secondary colors correspond roughly to the additive primary colors), plus layering all three of them resulting in black. With halftoning, a full continuous range of colors can be produced.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

=== Screen angle ===
[[File:CMYK screen angles.svg|thumb|Typical halftone screen angles.]]
{{main|Screen angle}}
To improve print quality and reduce [[moiré pattern]]s, the screen for each color is set at a different angle. While the angles depend on how many colors are used and the preference of the press operator, typical CMYK process printing uses any of the following screen angles:&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Alastair. The Designer's Lexicon. 2000 Chronicle, San Francisco. p 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCue, Claudia. Real World Print Production. 2007 Peachpit, Berkeley. p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Why black ink is used}}

== Benefits of using black ink ==
[[Image:Barns grand tetons.jpg|thumb|400px|A color photograph of the [[Teton Range]].]]
{{double image|valign=top|right|CMYK separation – no black.jpg|197|CMYK separation – maximum black.jpg|197|The image above, separated for printing with process cyan, magenta, and yellow inks.|The same image, this time separated with maximum black, to minimize colored-inks use.}}

The "black" generated by mixing commercially practical cyan, magenta, and yellow inks is unsatisfactory, so four-color printing uses black ink in addition to the subtractive primaries. Common reasons for using black ink include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = WWW.Color | author = Roger Pring | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq-hLlV-h7sC&amp;pg=PT178&amp;dq=cmyk+key+black+subtractive+model&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1| publisher = Watson–Guptill | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8230-5857-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In traditional preparation of color separations, a red keyline on the black line art marked the outline of solid or tint color areas. In some cases a black keyline was used when it served as both a color indicator and an outline to be printed in black. Because usually the black plate contained the keyline, the K in CMYK represents the keyline or black plate, also sometimes called the key plate.
* Text is typically printed in black and includes fine detail (such as [[serif]]s), so to reproduce text or other finely detailed outlines, without slight blurring, using three inks  would require impractically accurate [[printing registration|registration]].
* A combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks soaks the paper with ink, making it slower to dry, causing bleeding, or (especially on cheap paper such as [[newsprint]]) weakening the paper so much that it tears.
* Although a combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks should, in theory, completely absorb the entire [[visible spectrum]] of light and produce a perfect black, practical inks fall short of their ideal characteristics and the result is actually a dark muddy color that does not quite appear black.  Adding black ink absorbs more light and yields much better blacks.
* Using black ink is less expensive than using the corresponding amounts of colored inks.

When a very dark area is desirable, a colored or gray CMY "bedding" is applied first, then a full black layer is applied on top, making a rich, deep black; this is called ''[[rich black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Guild Handbook of Scientific Illustration |author=R. S. Hodges |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWaOBSjevD0C&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=cmyk+rich-black|year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-471-36011-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A black made with just CMY inks is sometimes called a ''composite black''.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The amount of black to use to replace amounts of the other ink is variable, and the choice depends on the technology, paper and ink in use. Processes called [[under color removal]], [[under color addition]], and [[gray component replacement]] are used to decide on the final mix; different CMYK recipes will be used depending on the printing task.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Other printer color models ==
CMYK or process color printing is contrasted with [[spot color]] printing, in which specific colored inks are used to generate the colors appearing on paper. Some printing presses are capable of printing with both four-color process inks and additional spot color inks at the same time. High-quality printed materials, such as marketing brochures and books, often include photographs requiring process-color printing, other graphic effects requiring spot colors (such as metallic inks), and finishes such as varnish, which enhances the glossy appearance of the printed piece.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

CMYK  are  the process printers which often have a relatively small color [[gamut]]. Processes such as [[Pantone]]'s proprietary six-color (CMYKOG) [[Hexachrome]] considerably expand the gamut. Light, saturated colors often cannot be created with CMYK, and light colors in general may make visible the halftone pattern. Using a [[CcMmYK color model|CcMmYK process]], with the addition of light cyan and magenta inks to CMYK, can solve these problems, and such a process is used by many [[inkjet]] printers, including desktop models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop Elements 2 in 24 Hours | author = Carla Rose | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=odUPNtVGBzcC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=light-magenta+light-cyan| publisher = Sams Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-672-32430-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with RGB displays ==
[[File:CIE1931xy gamut comparison.svg|thumb|Comparison of some RGB and CMYK color gamut on a [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] xy chromaticity diagram.]]
Comparisons between [[RGB]] displays and CMYK prints can be difficult, since the color reproduction technologies and properties are very different. A computer monitor mixes shades of red, green, and blue light to create color pictures. A CMYK printer instead uses light-absorbing cyan, magenta, and yellow inks, whose colors are mixed using [[dithering]], [[halftoning]], or some other optical technique.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Similar to monitors, the inks used in printing produce a color gamut that is "only a subset of the visible spectrum" although both color modes have their own specific ranges. As a result of this, items which are displayed on a computer monitor may not completely match the look of items which are printed if opposite color modes are being combined in both mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Damien van Holten, print international.org, "RGB Vs CMYK" http://www.printernational.org/rgb-versus-cmyk.php&lt;/ref&gt; When designing items to be printed, designers view the colors which they are choosing on an RGB color mode (their computer screen), and it is often difficult to visualize the way in which the color will turn out post-printing because of this.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

=== Spectrum of printed paper ===
To reproduce color, the CMYK color model codes for absorbing light rather than emitting it (as is assumed by RGB). The 'K' component absorbs all wavelengths and is therefore achromatic. The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow components are used for color reproduction and they may be viewed as the inverse of RGB. Cyan absorbs Red, Magenta absorbs Green, and Yellow absorbs Blue (-R,-G,-B).{{fact|date=May 2017}}

[[File:CMYK Spectrum printed paper.pdf|thumb|center|800px|Spectrum of the visible wavelengths on printed paper (SCA Graphosilk). Shown is the transition from Red to Yellow. White, red, blue, and green are shown for reference. Readings from a white orchid flower, a rose (red and yellow petals), and a red cyclamen flower are shown for comparison. The units of spectral power are simply raw sensor values (with a linear response at specific wavelengths).]]

== Conversion ==
[[File:NIEdot367.jpg|thumb|Early representation of the three-color process (1902).]]
Since RGB and CMYK spaces are both device-dependent spaces, there is no simple or general conversion formula that converts between them. Conversions are generally done through [[color management]] systems, using [[color profile]]s that describe the spaces being converted. Nevertheless, the conversions cannot be exact, particularly where these spaces have different [[gamut]]s.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The problem of computing a colorimetric estimate of the color that results from printing various combinations of ink has been addressed by many scientists.&lt;ref name = Sharma&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Color Imaging Handbook | author = Gaurav Sharma | year = 2003 | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 0-8493-0900-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AkByHKRGTsQC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=intitle:color+inauthor:sharma+cmyk+halftone-printers#PPA67,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A general method that has emerged for the case of halftone printing is to treat each tiny overlap of color dots as one of 8 (combinations of CMY) or of 16 (combinations of CMYK) colors, which in this context are known as ''[[Neugebauer primary|Neugebauer primaries]]''. The resultant color would be an area-weighted colorimetric combination of these primary colors, except that the ''Yule–Nielsen'' effect of scattered light between and within the areas complicates the physics and the analysis; empirical formulas for such analysis have been developed, in terms of detailed dye combination absorption spectra and empirical parameters.&lt;ref name = Sharma/&gt;

The [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] or [[commanding officer]]  would occupy the "great cabin" that normally spanned width of the [[stern]] with large windows. On a warship, it would be separated from the rest of the ship, and further subdivided into day and night cabins with movable panels that could be removed in time of battle to leave the deck clear the whole length of the ship.

In most modern [[warship]]s, the commanding officer has a main cabin—the '''in-port cabin''', often adjacent to the ship's central control room ([[operations room]])—and a '''sea cabin''' adjacent to the [[Bridge (ship)|bridge]]. Thus, when likely to be called from sleep or attending to administration, the CO can go to the sea cabin and thereby be able to appear at the Bridge or Ops room immediately. The sea cabin is sparsely equipped, containing just a bunk, a desk, and basic toilet facilities. The in-port cabin is more lavishly furnished, with separate bedroom and combination [[sitting room]]/office, and more elaborate toiletry facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Carriers at War|page=201|author=James L.

Snelling Robinson|page=11|publisher=The Kent State University Press|date=2000|isbn=978-0-87338-698-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ships intended to act as [[flagship]]s, like the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|USS ''Lexington'']], the admiral also has a sea cabin (adjacent to the captain's sea cabin) and an in-port cabin, in addition to the captain's cabins. [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Admiral Fletcher]]'s sea cabin in the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}} in World War II had a bed, an easy chair, a table, and a shower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Carrier Lexington|author=Hugh Irvin Power|page=100|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|date=1996|isbn=978-0-89096-681-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=83|title=Black Shoe Carrier Admiral: Frank Jack Fletcher at Coral Sea, Midway, and Guadalcanal|author=John B.

Officers will normally have their own cabins, which double as their offices. Some senior [[petty officer]]s may have cabins for similar reasons.

Sailors sleep in [[Berth (sleeping)|berthing areas]].

==Passenger ships==
In ships carrying [[passenger]]s, they are normally accommodated in cabins, taking the terminology familiar to seafarers. First-class cabins were traditionally referred to as staterooms, and today many cruise lines now prefer to refer to passenger cabins as staterooms or suites.

==Cabin crawl==
In [[cruise ship]] terms, a cabin crawl is an event where [[passenger]]s tour the cabins of fellow passengers. A cruise ship may also offer a cabin crawl of cabins or suites which did not sell for a particular sailing. The purpose of a cabin crawl is to give passengers an idea of the space and layout of various cabin options for their next cruise. Cabin crawls are normally organized prior to a cruise, through cruise-fan websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cruise Critic Board|url=http://www.cruisecritic.com|website=Cruise Critic|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabin Crawl|url=http://www.cabincrawl.com|website=Cabin Crawl|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft==
Inside [[spacecraft]], the cabins are required to fully supply food and [[oxygen]] for their crew. On missions lasting a year or longer, the cabins have to be self-sustaining, i.e. replenish their own water and oxygen. The space cabin for any long-range manned mission is expected to be reasonably spacious, with approximately 28 cubic metres allotted to each occupant. In addition, cabins have life support systems that should have the capability to meet a variety of off-nominal conditions, including cabin fires, depressurization, and component shutdown or failure. Frequently, these conditions occur so quickly that recovery can be provided only by automatic control systems. In the late 1960s, several experimental ground facilities were developed to evaluate regenerative life support systems for crewed space flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Averill|first=R.D.|title=A systems analysis of a regenerative cabin atmosphere control system|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19690010288|work=Langley Research Center|publisher=NASA|publicationdate=1968|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CleanFeed.png|thumb|250px|Generation of both Program and Clean Feed. The ''clean'' signal has no graphics keyed over it.]]

In television technology, a '''clean feed''' is a video signal that does not have added graphics and text. This video signal is used in sport production to allow different [[television station]]s to add their own [[digital on-screen graphic]] image on a common signal, or in [[news broadcast]]ing to produce two or more different streams, each one with the same picture but in different languages.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

A clean feed is a signal which has not come from the main output of the [[video switcher]], such as the output of a [[vision mixer]] before the downstream [[keying (graphics)|keyer]] stage - the clean feed is identical to the main program output but without any captions keyed into it. Modern production equipment can actually put different keys on multiple outputs, allowing them to go to the clean feed or not. The most sophisticated vision mixers (or production switchers, according to the American nomenclature) can generate a clean feed output for any of their mix/effects (ME) buses.

The term "clean feed" is also used to refer to [[backhaul (broadcasting)|backhaul]] feeds of television programming sent via [[communication satellite]] or other transport (such as a national [[fiber-optic network]]) sent from another TV station or remote television [[production truck]] on-location,  which does not carry any [[television advertisement]]s or [[break bumper]]s, or in some cases, [[lower-third]] graphics or superimposed [[Lower third|chyron]] text.

Within the [[vernacular]] of [[counter-terrorism]] agents and police officers, a '''cleanskin''' is an undercover operative whose identity is not known to the forces he or she is tasked to infiltrate.  This is usually because such an agent has not conducted any prior undercover activity.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

The phrase entered wide currency with a slightly different meaning in the [[United Kingdom]] following the [[London bombings of 7 July 2005]]. The four bombers involved in those bombings were reported in the press to be "cleanskins", according to police sources, meaning that their profiles did not fit the expected profile of bombers.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

[[List of designated terrorist groups|Terrorist groups]], [[smugglers]], and others performing secretive activities prefer to subvert cleanskins as there is less chance that they will arouse suspicion. For example, a person with previous convictions for importing drugs is more likely to be detained than a person never convicted.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

A [[Bilingualism|bilingual]] person can traditionally be defined as an individual who uses (understands and produces) two (or more) languages on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psycholinguistics of Bilingualism|last=Grosjean|first=François | last2 = Li | first2 = Ping | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013 |location=Malden, MA|pages=7|isbn=978-1-4443-3279-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bilingual person's initial exposure to both languages may have started in early childhood, e.g. before age 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Colin | last = Baker | name-list-format = vanc | title = Foundations of bilingual education and bilingualism | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but exposure may also begin later in life. While some people assume that bilinguals must be equally proficient in their languages, perfectly equal proficiency is rarely attested, and proficiency typically varies by domain. For example, a bilingual person may have greater proficiency for work-related terms in one language, and family-related terms in another language.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
[[File:Language_Learning.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Language_Learning.jpg|alt=|thumb|Wakuni City, Japan]]
Being bilingual has been linked to a number of [[cognitive]] benefits. Research has studied how a bilingual individual's [[first language]] (L1) and [[second language]] (L2) interact, and it has been shown that both languages have an influence on the function of one another, and on cognitive function outside of language. Research on executive functions such as working memory, perception, and attentional and inhibitory control, has suggested that bilinguals can benefit from significant cognitive advantages over monolingual peers in various settings. There are also age-related benefits, which seem to help older adults on the battle against cognitive decline.

Throughout the history of research into the '''cognitive advantages of bilingualism''', views have shifted from a subtractive to an additive perspective;&lt;ref name="CookReview"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=The consequences of bilingualism for cognitive processing|journal=Tutorials in Bilingualism: Psycholinguistic Perspectives|pages=279–300|author=Cook V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is from believing that being bilingual detracts from one's abilities, to believing that being bilingual adds to an individual's abilities.

There is, however, strong disagreement over how findings on this subject should be interpreted. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies in the field have found no evidence for cognitive advantages in healthy adults and that reporting is subject to [[publication bias]], which has therefore given a distorted view of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konnikova|first1=Maria|title=Is Bilingualism Really an Advantage?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/bilingual-advantage-aging-brain|website=The New Yorker|date=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehtonen2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehtonen M, Soveri A, Laine A, Järvenpää J, de Bruin A, Antfolk J | title = Is bilingualism associated with enhanced executive functioning in adults?

==History==

Over the course of the past few years, the prevalence of bilinguals in the United States has increased dramatically. While the [[United States Census Bureau]] does not directly poll for bilingualism, they do poll for what languages are used in an individual's home, and if it is a language other than English, they then poll for how well that same individual speaks English. In 2012, [[François Grosjean]], a professor of Linguistics from the University of Neuchâtel, interpreted the results from the Census Bureau as follows: 11% of the population was bilingual in 1980, 14% in 1990, and 20% in 2012.&lt;ref name=":114"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-bilingual/201205/bilinguals-in-the-united-states|title=Bilinguals in the United States|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This positive increase raised a question into the depth of cognitive activity in bilinguals and whether or not there were benefits in multilingualism to be found.&lt;ref name=":163"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583091/|title=The Cognitive Benefits of Being Bilingual|last=Marian|first=Viorica|date=2012|website=The Dana Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Singapore Management University ([[Singapore Management University|SMU]]) School of Social Sciences, research before the 1960s on bilingual individuals was varied, but commonly supporting the idea that there were disadvantages to bilingualism. A general opinion was that bilinguals would have smaller vocabularies, stunted cognitive abilities and that children learning two languages from a young age would be spending too much of their energy differentiating and building the two languages to become competent in either one.&lt;ref name="ArsenianReview2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bilingualism and mental development: a study of the intelligence and the social background of bilingual children in New York city.|author=Arsenian S.|year=1902|location=New York: Teachers college Columbia university}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HakutaDiaz2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children's Language, vol.5|last=Hakuta K.|first=Diaz R.

Erlbaum. pp. 320–344&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Rafael M. Diaz, from Yale University mentions that perspectives like these were in part believed to have been influenced by variables that had impacted or changed how a society functioned. 

In 1977, the (American Institute for Research) published an influential study which discussed bilingualism as it relates to education and what effects there are on a child's performance maintaining with the class.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz|first=M.

While historically relevant and necessary, in context of meeting todays modern methodological standards, these studies in particular are argued to be missing necessary pieces of data that create controversy over their credibility. With current research and data suggesting benefits to bilingualism, the soundness of the former studies conclusions are in brought into question.&lt;ref name="Darcy53"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Darcy NT|year=1953|title=A review of the literature on the effects of bilingualism upon the measurement of intelligence|journal=The Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology|volume=82|issue=1|pages=21–57|doi=10.1080/08856559.1953.10533654}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Darcy6"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Darcy NT|year=1963|title=Bilingualism and the measurement of intelligence: Review of a decade of research|journal=The Journal of Genetic Psychology|volume=103|issue=2|pages=259–282|doi=10.1080/00221325.1963.10532521}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to "The Journal of Genetic Psychology," the many of these studies employed unstandardized and subjective definitions of bilingualism and of a bilingual individual (''e.g.'', labeling a person as bilingual or monolingual through assumptions based on the national origin of that person's parents or even based on that person's family name), raising the concern that there is no way of determining whether their samples were truly representative of a bilingual population. Another element that contrasted with more modern researching techniques was the lack of a [[Controlling for a variable|control]] for [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) and many of them administered verbal-intelligence tests to non-proficient speakers of a second language in that second language.

In 1962, Peal and Lambert published a study highlighting the importance of controlling for such factors as age, sex, and [[Socioeconomic status|SES]], as well as of having a standardized measure for bilingualism when selecting a sample of bilinguals to be studied. In their study they carefully matched bilingual to monolingual participants, and found that the bilinguals appeared to have significant advantages to that of their monolingual peers outperforming in both verbal and non-verbal tests, more specifically in the non-verbal tests. In continuation of this study, and studies alike, the literature after this point began to undergo a shift of focus erring more particularly into areas of cognitive development and aptitude such as: perception and [[Executive functions|executive functioning]].&lt;ref name="HakutaDiaz3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children's Language, vol.5|last=Hakuta K.|first=Diaz R.

== Executive functions ==
[[Executive functions|Executive function]] is the domain of high-level cognitive processes that assists in goal-oriented tasks, such as problem solving, mental flexibility, attentional control, inhibitory control, and task switching. Much of the current research on cognitive effects of bilingualism investigate a correlation between bilingualism and alterations in the brain. A study titled "Bilingualism, aging, and cognitive control" amongst various similarly conducted studies released data suggesting that monolinguals and bilinguals were found having varying ability in the executive function part of the brain. From these tests, bilinguals showed a higher executive control than their monolingual peers. When matched in age and other background factors (e.g. socio-economic status), indications of a possible correlation between the demands on the 

brain that learning multiple languages requires and higher executive functioning skills.&lt;ref name=":622"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialystok E, Craik FI, Klein R, Viswanathan M | title = Bilingualism, aging, and cognitive control: evidence from the Simon task | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 290–303 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15222822 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.19.2.290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialystok E, Craik F, Luk G | title = Cognitive control and lexical access in younger and older bilinguals | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 859–73 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18605874 | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.34.4.859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa A, Hernández M, Sebastián-Gallés N | title = Bilingualism aids conflict resolution: evidence from the ANT task | journal = Cognition | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–86 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17275801 | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2006.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialystok E, Poarch G, Luo L, Craik FI | title = Effects of bilingualism and aging on executive function and working memory | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 696–705 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25244487 | pmc = 4274603 | doi = 10.1037/a0037254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adesope"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=A systematic review and meta-analysis of the cognitive correlates of bilingualism|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=80|issue=2|pages=207–245|doi=10.3102/0034654310368803| vauthors = Adesope OO, Lavin T, Thompson T, Ungerleider C }}&lt;/ref&gt; John R.

One of the more frequently tested aspects to language development has been in relation to a possible link between bilingualism and higher executive functioning skills.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In many studies bilingual groups outperformed monolingual control groups in executive function tasks. These findings suggest bilingualism is correlated with better control of attention and facilitates processing and functioning in several cognitive tasks.

There are two types of processing that aid children in language development: analysis, which involves the ability to represent and understand abstract information, and control, which involves the ability to selectively attend to specific aspects of structures whilst ignoring irrelevant information.&lt;ref name="BialystokMet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Systems of representation in children: Development and use|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1993|pages=211–233|chapter=Metalinguistic awareness: The development of children's representations of language|vauthors=Bialystok E |editor=Pratt C.|editor2=Garton, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aspect of control is linked to the bilingual effect on cognitive abilities.

In one study,&lt;ref name="BialystokCard1" /&gt; researchers administered a non-linguistic card-sorting task to participants that required flexibility in [[problem solving]], inhibiting irrelevant information, as well as recognizing the constancy of certain variables in the face of changes in the rules. Bilingual children significantly outperformed their monolingual peers in this task, suggesting early development of inhibitory function that aids solving problems which require the ability to selectively focus attention.

In a following study, researchers&lt;ref name="BialystokMartin" /&gt; aimed to determine what gave bilinguals an advantage in solving the card-sorting task (and generally an advantage in problem solving situations). Groups were equivalent in their ability to represent the stimuli (reflecting Worrall's findings, described below&lt;ref name="Anita"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1972|title=Bilingualism and cognitive development|journal=Child Development|volume=43|issue=4|pages=1390–1400|doi=10.2307/1127524|jstor=1127524|vauthors=Ianco-Worrall AD}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and both were equally able to inhibit learned motor responses. Bilinguals performed better on the task to measure conceptual inhibition; the ability to inhibit previous associations and create new mental representations of the stimulus according to task changes.

Another study used three language groups: native bilinguals, English [[Monolingualism|monolinguals]], and English speakers enrolled in an [[Language immersion|immersion program]]. The bilingual children's scores were similar to the other groups despite lower parent socioeconomic and education level and lower verbal scores. When the two groups were adjusted for age, parent income and education, and verbal scores, the bilingual children outperformed monolinguals on conflict tasks that required resolving multiple attention demands.&lt;ref name="Carlson SM 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlson SM, Meltzoff AN | title = Bilingual experience and executive functioning in young children | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 282–98 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18333982 | pmc = 3647884 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00675.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogulski, Rakoczy, Goodman, and Bialystok investigated how "lapsed bilinguals" (participants who used to be bilingual but are now monolingual) compared to monolinguals and fluent bilinguals in executive function tasks. The lapsed bilinguals tested better than monolinguals but worse than their fluent counterparts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/llba/docview/1738472108/41F4A83D273341D2PQ/4?accountid=14244|title=Executive control in fluent and lapsed bilinguals|vauthors=Bogulski CA, Rokoczy M, Goodman M, Bialystok E |date=July 2015|website=ProQuest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers demonstrate a contextual effect of sociocultural aspects of bilingualism. Others find these effects across various sociolinguistic settings such as comparison groups with bilingual children speaking a second regional and second migrant language &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blom E, Boerma T, Bosma E, Cornips L, Everaert E | title = Cognitive Advantages of Bilingual Children in Different Sociolinguistic Contexts | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 8 | pages = 552 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28484403 | pmc = 5399246 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00552 | url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00552/full }}&lt;/ref&gt; or bilingual children of low-income immigrant families and monolingual children of low-income non-immigrant families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Engel de Abreu PM, Cruz-Santos A, Tourinho CJ, Martin R, Bialystok E | title = Bilingualism enriches the poor: enhanced cognitive control in low-income minority children | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 1364–71 | date = 2012-10-08 | pmid = 23044796 | pmc = 4070309 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612443836 | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612443836 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analyses ====

David Green offered an explanation for this phenomenon with his "inhibitory control model."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=David W.|date=1998-08-01|title=Mental control of the bilingual lexico-semantic system|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/mental-control-of-the-bilingual-lexicosemantic-system/15AB73F1D03B283A475B6E4C6E9836AE|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=1|issue=2|pages=67–81|doi=10.1017/S1366728998000133|issn=1469-1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed in 1998, this model references a bilingual's constant need to suppress one language while using another. Because this task requires suppressing a source of distraction, this kind of control is then applied to other tasks. This assertion was bolstered by a study of unimodal bilinguals (bilinguals who communicated with two spoken languages) and bimodal bilinguals (bilinguals who used one spoken language and sign language). Because bimodal bilinguals can express themselves in both languages at the same time, they may require less inhibition. This idea was supported by the results of the study; only unimodal bilinguals were found to have an advantage, as measured by the flanker task (a cognitive task that measures attentional focus and inhibition). Bimodal bilinguals also switch languages less frequently, because they are more likely to use both languages at once than to completely switch from one to the other. For this reason, the researchers of this study hypothesized that it may be the switching between languages that gives unimodal bilinguals the advantage. Prior and Gollan conducted a study investigating this idea, and found that bilinguals who switched languages often had an advantage in task shifting over bilinguals who did not frequently switch languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior A, Gollan TH | title = Good language-switchers are good task-switchers: evidence from Spanish-English and Mandarin-English bilinguals | language = en-US | journal = Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 682–91 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 22882810 | doi = 10.1017/s1355617711000580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study did not control for similarity between the languages (languages that are more similar might require more attention to keep straight). When Verreyt, Woumans, Vandelanotte, Szmalec, and Duyck ran a similar study but with all participants having the same languages, they replicated the results of Prior and Gallan. Additionally, because their study looked at tasks measuring inhibition even though language switching should directly affect switching tasks, they argued that the effects of language-switching carry over multiple facets of executive control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verreyt |first=Nele |last2=Woumans |first2=Evy |last3=Vandelanotte |first3=Davy |last4=Szmalec |first4=Arnaud |last5=Duyck |first5=Wouter | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-01-01|title=The influence of language-switching experience on the bilingual executive control advantage |journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=181–190 |doi=10.1017/S1366728914000352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilinguals have different representations in each language for similar concepts and therefore need to constantly be aware of which language they are using and what the appropriate word is to be used in that context. This culminates in an advantage of cognitive control, since the ability to switch between languages and select the appropriate word for use is directly linked to the ability to better attend to relevant, or inhibit irrelevant, information.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Inhibitory control predicts language switching performance in trilingual speech production|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=15|issue=3|pages=651–662|doi=10.1017/S136672891100054X| vauthors = Linck JA, Schwieter JW, Sunderman G }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation refers to bilinguals' unique experience with using two languages in the same [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]] (spoken), differentiating them from monolingual peers, and requiring them to make the decision about how best to respond to a situation, as well as have better control over what they select.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Emmorey K, Luk G, Pyers JE, Bialystok E | title = The source of enhanced cognitive control in bilinguals: evidence from bimodal bilinguals | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 12 | pages = 1201–6 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19121123 | pmc = 2677184 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02224.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bilingualism vs. executive control  ====
Hakuta and Diaz,&lt;ref name="HakutaDiaz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children's Language, vol.5|last=Hakuta K.|first=Diaz R. M.|publisher=Erlbaum|year=1985|editor=Nelson K. E.|pages=320–344|chapter=The relationship between degree of bilingualism and cognitive ability: a critical discussion and some new longitudinal data.}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the chicken and egg question concerning bilinguals and their reported enhanced cognitive abilities; do children with greater cognitive abilities tend to learn more than one language, or could knowing more than one language contribute to enhanced cognitive ability? They administered a set of non-verbal tests that are designed to measure cognitive ability ([[Raven's Progressive Matrices]]) to a bilingual sample of children. From these tests, the results showed a higher correlation with the degree of bilingualism (how proficient the individuals were in each of their languages) of their sample and scores on the test, as well as bilingualism did in fact predict performance (and therefore cognitive ability). However, an important point to note, is that most native bilinguals haven't learnt a second language because they are more intelligent. In most cases, they have grown up in a family where use of the two languages is necessary and therefore it is unlikely that the child's intelligence will allow them to learn the second language.

=== Clarification: In opposition ===
There are findings that do not support cause and effect relationship between bilingualism and enhanced executive function and those who suggest publication bias from those that do.  

The methodology has been disputed. Virginia Valian finds correlations between bilingualism and executive function to be inconsistent. Executive function is not uniformly defined and different tasks contribute to executive function. Because some of these tasks are available to monolinguals and bilinguals may similarly participate in these tasks to varying degrees, she argues bilinguals cannot be assumed superior to monolinguals in executive function. She also notes bilinguals are not consistently better at all executive function tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/llba/docview/1660012826/41F4A83D273341D2PQ/8?accountid=14244|title=Bilingualism and cognition|last=Valian|first=Virginia|date=January 2014|website=ProQuest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramesh Kumar Mishra builds upon Valian's suggestions by arguing that research studies should shift to comparing bilinguals of different proficiencies instead of bilinguals to monolinguals. She argues things like exercising and video game playing can affect executive function, and since they are unrelated to language, they must be controlled for. Kaushanskaya and Prior respond to Valian that it is not only the lack of uniformity in defining executive function, but also the difficulty in defining bilingualism which make it problematic to draw strong conclusions about the effects of bilingualism on executive function.

Some researchers have found results with no connection. A meta-analysis of more than 150 studies comparing the performance of monolinguals and bilinguals on different cognitive tasks found no evidence of a bilingual advantage.
&lt;ref name="Lehtonen2018" /&gt; Another notable study with a large sample size of 252 Basque-Spanish bilingual children and 252 monolingual Spanish children compared inhibitory skills. Researchers used two Stroop tasks in which the participants had to ignore distracting information to complete the task. They found no differences or bilingual effects between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duñabeitia JA, Hernández JA, Antón E, Macizo P, Estévez A, Fuentes LJ, Carreiras M | title = The inhibitory advantage in bilingual children revisited: myth or reality? | journal = Experimental Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 234–51 | date = 2014-01-01 | pmid = 24217139 | doi = 10.1027/1618-3169/a000243 | url = https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1618-3169/a000243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paap and Greenberg assert bilinguals are not superior at executive processing. They assess their sample as similar in confounding variables and found that not only was there not evidence supporting an advantage for bilinguals, but that the evidence would argue against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/llba/docview/1650526430/41F4A83D273341D2PQ/10?accountid=14244|title=Are bilingual advantages dependent upon specific tasks or specific bilingual experiences?|vauthors=Paap KR, Johnson HA, Sawi O |date=August 2014|website=ProQuest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of publication bias dispute validity of findings supporting bilingualism and cognitive benefits of executive control. For example, a study examining abstracts of research on bilingualism and executive control between 1999 and 2012 found the research results in support of an advantage were published more often and results that did not support the theory were published least often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Bruin A, Treccani B, Della Sala S | title = Cognitive advantage in bilingualism: an example of publication bias? | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–107 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25475825 | doi = 10.1177/0956797614557866 | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614557866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of difference or dispute of sample size, measure, and statistical power suggests not error but publication bias.

=== Parallel activation of both languages ===
It has been found that a bilingual's two languages are simultaneously active, both phonologically and semantically, during language use.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kroll JF, Dussias PE, Bice K, Perrotti L | title = Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain | journal = Annual Review of Linguistics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 377–394 | date = 2015-01-01 | pmid = 28642932 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kroll JF, Bialystok E | title = Understanding the Consequences of Bilingualism for Language Processing and Cognition | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 497–514 | date = 2013-01-01 | pmid = 24223260 | pmc = 3820916 | doi = 10.1080/20445911.2013.799170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This activation is indicated by [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] measures of performance. Not only is a person's dominant language (L1) active when using the less dominant language (L2), but their L2 is also activated when using L1. This happens once the individual is adequately proficient in the L2.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Models of bilingual representation and processing.|vauthors=Kroll JF, Tokowicz N|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=531–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both active when listening to speech, reading words in either language or even planning speech in either language.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=Competing activation in bilingual language processing: within- and between language competition | journal=Biling.

Bilingualism studies have mostly looked at Spanish-English or Dutch-English bilinguals. These languages share the Roman alphabet, and there are many [[cognate]]s (words which have the same linguistic derivation e.g. 'piano' is the same in all 3 languages). Cross-language activation therefore seems less surprising. However, cross-language activation has also been reported in bilinguals whose two languages have different scripts (writing systems) and lexical forms (e.g. Japanese and English). A study by Hoshino &amp; Kroll (2008)&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoshino N, Kroll JF | title = Cognate effects in picture naming: does cross-language activation survive a change of script? | journal = Cognition | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 501–11 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17367774 | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2007.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that Japanese-English and Spanish-English bilinguals performed similarly in picture naming tasks even though the cognates for Spanish-English bilinguals shared phonological and orthographic (sound and spelling) information whereas the Japanese cognates were only phonologically similar (sound). Although the words were spelt and presented differently for Japanese-English bilinguals, this did not affect the simultaneous activation of both their languages.

In 2011, Wu and Thierry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu YJ, Thierry G | title = Event-related brain potential investigation of preparation for speech production in late bilinguals | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 114 | date = 2011-01-01 | pmid = 21687468 | pmc = 3108551 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00114 | url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00114/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study where Chinese-English bilinguals were shown picture pairs. Participants were asked to name the second picture in the pair when it was shown and then were asked to judge whether the word pairs corresponding to the pictured objects rhymed or not. Word pairs were designed so that they either rhymed in both L1 and L2 or only in one of the two languages. Electrophysiological measures (see [[Event-related potential]]) of the effect ([[Priming (psychology)|priming]]) of the sound repetition induced by the rhyming of the word pairs showed that even though the participants were performing the task in their L2, they showed a priming effect (albeit delayed) when those L2 words rhymed with words in the L1. This suggests that in regards to language use, both L1 and L2 are accessed and compete for selection during L2 production.&amp;nbsp;

In 2012, Hoshino and Thierry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoshino N, Thierry G | title = Do Spanish-English Bilinguals have Their Fingers in Two Pies - or is It Their Toes? An Electrophysiological Investigation of Semantic Access in Bilinguals | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 3 | pages = 9 | date = 2012-02-02 | pmid = 22347197 | pmc = 3270302 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  conducted a study where Spanish-English bilingual participants were shown word pairs in English, their L2, and asked to judge whether the word pairs were related. Sometimes, things presented would be "interlingual homographs," or words that sound the same in both languages but have a different meaning in each. These pairs would be primed by things relating to one of the meanings or to neither, and the effects of this priming were measured electrophysiologically. Participants judged whether the words in the pairs were related, and electrophysiological results revealed that semantic priming (facilitation of processing of the words) occurred when the words in the pairs were related to each other whether the meaning was interpreted in English or Spanish.

The two immediately preceding studies conclude that both languages of an individual are constantly unconsciously active and interfering with one another. The results, in regard to word processing, can help demonstrate how bilinguals have advantages over their monolingual peers when it comes to this area of study.

The fact that both languages are constantly activated means that they potentially compete for cognitive resources; bilinguals need to acquire a way to control or regulate the competition, so as to not use the wrong language at the wrong time. Inhibition refers to being able to ignore irrelevant information and therefore not be distracted by non-target stimuli. For example, a test that is widely used to assess this executive function is the [[Stroop task]], where the word for a colour is printed in a different colour than the name (e.g. the word 'red' printed in blue ink). This causes interference and distraction; reaction times are measured to see how distracted the individual is by the incongruent word and colour. Bilinguals compared to monolinguals have shown an advantage at this task, suggesting that bilinguals have a more developed inhibition process, potentially due to the constant inhibition of their non-target language.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blumenfeld HK, Marian V | title = Bilingualism influences inhibitory control in auditory comprehension | journal = Cognition | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–57 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21159332 | pmc = 3582323 | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2010.10.012 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027710002490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhibition has been suggested as the executive control system that allows successful linguistic selection even when both languages are co-activated in bilinguals. De Groot &amp; Christofells&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006|title=Language control in bilinguals: monolingual tasks and simultaneous interpreting | journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=9|issue=2|pages=189–201|doi=10.1017/s1366728906002537 | vauthors=De Groot AM, Christoffels IK}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006) proposed a distinction between two types of inhibition that may occur; global inhibition and local inhibition. Global inhibition refers to suppression of an entire language system, e.g. inhibiting Spanish when speaking English, and local inhibition refers to inhibition of a more specific competing vocabulary, e.g. the translation of the same word or phrase. Local inhibition mostly affects linguistic performance whereas global inhibition affects both linguistic and cognitive performance. Despite the apparent advantages for bilinguals in terms of non-linguistic cognitive processing, there seem to be some drawbacks for bilinguals in terms of linguistic cognitive processing: bilinguals have been shown to exhibit reduced speech fluency and speed of lexical access compared to monolinguals.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

=== Metalinguistic abilities ===
Bilingual individuals have also shown superiority in [[metalinguistic]] ability. This additional advantage seems closely tied to executive function. Metalinguistic awareness is the understanding of the separation between language's structure and its meaning. For example, being able to judge the grammaticality of a sentence regardless of whether it is sensical, or being able to separate the set of sounds comprising a word from the word's meaning. The ability to suppress distracting information, such as semantics, is an act of inhibition, meaning that it falls into executive function. This ability could also be exercised by being bilingual, given that a bilingual individual has to suppress their knowledge of another language system when operating in one of their languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psycholinguistics of Bilingualism | last1 = Grosjean | first1 = Francois | last2 = Li | first2 = Ping | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Blackwell Publishing, LTD|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4443-3279-7|location=|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bialystok also studied metalinguistic abilities in bilinguals versus monolinguals by having subjects judge whether a sentence was grammatical, regardless of its logical sense.

Studies by Leopold and Worrall investigated how being bilingual affected children's awareness of the fact that the connection between words and meaning is arbitrary. See language section below.

== Benefits in older age ==
There has been a surge in interest in the benefits of bilingualism against age-related cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=":622"/&gt; Klein &amp; Viswanathan&lt;ref name=":622"/&gt; found that the normal decrease in attention control observed in older adults was reduced in bilinguals, suggesting that bilingualism may be protective against the effects of cognitive aging. Elderly bilinguals have also been shown to be better at switching between tasks, ignoring irrelevant information and resolving conflicting cognitive alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bialystok|first=Ellen|year=2006|title=Effect of bilingualism and computer video game experience on the Simon task|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie expérimentale|volume=60|issue=1|pages=68–79|doi=10.1037/cjep2006008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingualism may be one of the environmental factors which contributes to '[[cognitive reserve]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stern Y | title = What is cognitive reserve?

To test the protection of bilingualism against Alzheimer's disease (AD), Bialystok et al. (2007)&lt;ref name="BialystokDem12"/&gt; examined the hospital records of monolingual and bilingual patients who had been diagnosed with various types of dementia. After controlling for various cognitive and other factors, the researchers found that bilinguals experienced the onset of symptoms and were diagnosed approximately 3–4 years later on average than monolinguals. This was replicated with patients all diagnosed with AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Craik FI, Bialystok E, Freedman M | title = Delaying the onset of Alzheimer disease: bilingualism as a form of cognitive reserve | journal = Neurology | volume = 75 | issue = 19 | pages = 1726–9 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21060095 | pmc = 3033609 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181fc2a1c }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to stress, however, that the studies did not show that bilingualism directly prevents one from having AD, but rather enables functional cognition for a longer period of time; it delays the onset of symptoms for those with the disease. This was confirmed by the finding that when monolingual and bilingual Alzheimer's patients' brains were scanned, bilinguals actually had more pathology (signs of disease) and damage than the monolingual patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schweizer TA, Ware J, Fischer CE, Craik FI, Bialystok E | title = Bilingualism as a contributor to cognitive reserve: evidence from brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Cortex; A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System and Behavior | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 991–6 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 21596373 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2011.04.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that active use of the two languages protects against the symptoms of the disease; areas of the brain that enable cognitive control may have benefited from the bilingual experience and so improve cognitive function in older age.&amp;nbsp;

The finding that bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve has also been replicated by several other studies&lt;ref name="Atkinson2016222"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2016|title=Does Bilingualism Delay the Development of Dementia?|url=http://jeps.efpsa.org/articles/10.5334/jeps.375/|journal=Journal of European Psychology Students|volume=7|issue=1|pages=43–50|doi=10.5334/jeps.375 |vauthors=Atkinson AL}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Abutalebi et al.

It is important to remember that this is a relatively small sample size; however, the results did confirm previous studies. According to the research, the bilinguals outperformed the monolinguals on all experimental tasks, and the researchers found that monolinguals' neural imaging showed higher signs of age-related effects on performance of tasks and decreased [[gray matter]] density. Meanwhile, the bilinguals' neural imaging showed higher levels of gray matter along the anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Because of these results, the investigators concluded that bilingualism aids in protection against cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The bilingual advantage in cognitive function has been demonstrated especially in children and older adults,&lt;ref name=":622"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gold BT, Kim C, Johnson NF, Kryscio RJ, Smith CD | title = Lifelong bilingualism maintains neural efficiency for cognitive control in aging | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 387–96 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23303919 | pmc = 3710134 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3837-12.2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the advantage in young adults has been rather variable.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paap KR, Greenberg ZI | title = There is no coherent evidence for a bilingual advantage in executive processing | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–58 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23370226 | doi = 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028513000029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions for this finding may be that young adults are at their peak cognitive function, so it may be difficult to show any bilingual advantages beyond that peak level, especially in simple executive function tasks.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; It is thought that the benefits may be particularly beneficial to individuals at points in their lives when they are more vulnerable, for example in early development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morales J, Calvo A, Bialystok E | title = Working memory development in monolingual and bilingual children | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–202 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23059128 | pmc = 3508395 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2012.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in life, when ordinary cognitive processes decline.

== Age of acquisition ==
A debate within the linguistic community is whether the age of acquiring one's L2 has effects on the cognitive advantages.&lt;ref name="Atkinson2016222"/&gt; A study on native bilingual vs late bilingual vs monolingual children in the USA revealed an overall bilingual advantage.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivera Mindt M, Arentoft A, Kubo Germano K, D'Aquila E, Scheiner D, Pizzirusso M, Sandoval TC, Gollan TH | title = Neuropsychological, cognitive, and theoretical considerations for evaluation of bilingual individuals | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–68 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18841477 | pmc = 2652412 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9069-7 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11065-008-9069-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlson SM 2008"/&gt; Furthermore, native bilingual children demonstrated better performance on a selection of [[executive function]] tasks compared with their late bilingual and monolingual counterparts. Participants were controlled for age, verbal ability, and socioeconomic status (indicated by parent education level). However, there are various methodological factors which may call into question the validity of these results. Firstly, a small sample size was used, with only 12 children in the bilingual group, 21 in the late bilingual group, and 17 in the monolingual group. 'Late bilingual' in this study was classified as a monolingual child who had been in a bilingual school for 6 months (where half the lessons were in English and half in Spanish or Japanese). This may be a poor representation of 'late bilinguals', as 6 months may not be enough time for cognitive changes and adaptations to the brain to have taken place, and these children will unlikely already be 'proficient' in the L2, therefore this may not an appropriate group sample to support the claims being made. In addition, the effect sizes on all the individual executive function tests were all small to moderate effect sizes (ƞ2= 0.01 to 0.2). In combination with the lack of power due to small sample size, strong conclusions cannot be drawn from this data.

Another study, Kapa and Columbo (2013) investigated the [[attentional control]] of monolingual children, Spanish-English bilingual children who had learned both languages before the age of 3, and Spanish-English children who had learned English after age 3.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kapa LL, Colombo J | title = Attentional Control in Early and Later Bilingual Children | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–246 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 24910499 | pmc = 4044912 | doi = 10.1016/j.cogdev.2013.01.011 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201413000178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attentional control is a cognitive skill in which one can ignore unnecessary or impertinent information to the task at hand. Children were tested using an Attention Network Test. Although all groups obtained the same accuracy rates, the researchers found that early L2 learners (those who learned both languages before the age of 3) had the fastest reaction time.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The late learners and monolinguals did not significantly differ in response time, illustrating that early L2 acquisition could be a decisive factor in executive control levels.

== Language ==

=== Language Use ===
As one of the pioneers to the study of child language and bilingualism, Werner F. Leopold often used his daughter, Hildegard, to record his observations on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Hakuta, Kenji. “An Interview with Werner F. Leopold.”&amp;nbsp;''Bilingual Research Group''. Working Papers, 1989. Web. 30 Mar. 2017.  https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED328056&lt;/ref&gt; In his studies, he observed that Hildegard had "loose connections" between the ([[phonetic]]) structure of words and their [[semantics]] (meaning) because of her frequent substitutions of English words with German words and vice versa. This was noted in her everyday speech and well-rehearsed songs or rhymes. He noted that she had a greater flexibility in the use of language that was unobserved in monolingual children of her age. Leopold considered that perhaps this loose connection between the meaning and form of a word could result in more abstract thinking or greater mental flexibility for bilingual children.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1953.tb01398.x|title=Patterning in Children's Language Learning|journal=Language Learning|volume=5|pages=1–13|year=1953|last1=Leopold|first1=Werner F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this study, several others were formed to test similar things and find out more about the mental abilities of bilinguals with relation to their languages.

=== Semantic development ===
Anita Ianco-Worrall, author of ''Bilingualism and Cognitive Development,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/1127524|jstor=1127524|title=Bilingualism and Cognitive Development|journal=Child Development|volume=43|issue=4|pages=1390–1400|year=1972|last1=Ianco-Worrall|first1=Anita D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' designed a study to test Leopold's&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; observations and was able to replicate them. She tested two groups of monolingual and bilingual children at ages 4–6 and 6–9. These participants were given tasks to assess whether they showed a semantic or phonetic preference when categorizing words. An example of one task given in the study was to decide which of the two words, either ''can'' or ''hat,'' was more similar to the word ''cap''. The semantic choice would be ''hat'' while the phonetic choice would be ''can''. Other tasks were designed to provide a choice between semantic and phonetic interpretation of objects. For instance, in a hypothetical situation, could you call a ''cow'' a ''dog'' and if you did, would this ''dog'' bark?

The results of Ianco-Worrall's study showed that although both monolingual and bilingual children had no differences in the way they understood the words used, 54% of the younger bilingual children consistently showed a semantic preference in contrast to their monolingual peers. In monolingual children, semantic preference increased with age, suggesting that bilingual children reach a stage of semantic development 2–3 years earlier than their monolingual peers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This finding is in stark contrast to the early research and claims about bilingualism, which warned that bilingualism stunts children's linguistic development.

=== Language structure and awareness ===
In their book ''In Other Words,'' Ellen Bialystok and Kenji Hakuta, both professors studying bilingualism, examined the idea that "the knowledge of two languages is greater than the sum of its parts." They argued that there are linguistic benefits to being bilingual and that they are more than simply being able to speak two languages. A child learning two languages whose structures and rules are significantly different from each other requires the child to think in cognitively demanding ways. An example of this cognitive demand in action would be in the arbitrariness of labels for objects, or distinguishing between and using two different grammatical or syntactical structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hakuta | first1 = Kenji | last2 = Bialystok | first2 = Ellen | date = 1994 | title = In other words: the science and psychology of second-language acquisition | location = New York | publisher = BasicBooks | isbn = 0-465-07565-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas are quite arduous for a child to learn, but have been shown to increase the understanding the structure of language and introduce a greater awareness of meaning. Bilinguals who have worked through these strenuous stages of development obtain what is referred to as metalinguistic awareness (see metalinguistics abilities section above).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.4.560|title=Levels of bilingualism and levels of linguistic awareness |journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=24|issue=4|pages=560–567|year=1988|last1=Bialystok|first1=Ellen | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adesope" /&gt;

=== Reading ability ===
As an attempt to further analyze bilingualism as it relates to reading capability, there was another study done by Bialystok. This study was conducted by testing a group of children ages 4 to 5, equally familiar in secondary language as with their native tongues. The assessment was made using what Bialystok discussed as a representational principle; which refers to a symbolic representation of spoken language or the connection between the spoken and written language systems. For the testing of this principle, she gave children a "Moving Word Task" where a child would have to appropriately match a written word to an object on a card. If they could correctly matched the two after some rearranging of the cards, it suggested that they could understand the written words as representations of specific words whose meanings cannot change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bialystok | first = Ellen | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1997 | title = Effects of bilingualism and biliteracy on children’s emerging concepts of print. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | pages = 429–440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was taken further in order to see when bilinguals grasped this principle in comparison to monolinguals. The results showed that bilingual children were correct on their "Moving Word Task" over 80% of the time, which is a percentage equal to that of monolinguals who were one year older than the bilinguals being tested. Overall, the bilinguals seemed to understand the representational principle earlier than monolinguals, meaning they were earlier prepared for literacy acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bialystok | first1 = Ellen | last2 = Shenfield | first2 = Tali | last3 = Codd | first3 = Judith | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2000 | title = Languages, scripts, and the environment: Factors in developing concepts of print. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 36 | pages = 66–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study done by Durgunoglu, Nagy, and Hancin-Bhatt, this same concept for bilinguals' reading abilities was also studied. For this specific study, native Spanish speaking children who were learning to read English were tested. The researchers observed these bilinguals to find that their levels of phonological awareness and word recognition in Spanish could predict how well they would be able to recognize words in English. The results showed that the phonological awareness skills established in one language could be transferred to the reading ability in another language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durgunoglu | first1 = Aydin | last2 = Nagy | first2 = William | last3 = Hancin-Bhatt | first3 = Barbara | year = 1993 | title = Cross-language transfer of phonological awareness. | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 85 | pages = 453–465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Durgunoglu | first = Aydin | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1998 | chapter = Acquiring literacy in English and Spanish in the United States. | editor-first1 = Aydin | editor-last1 = Durgunoglu | editor-first2 = Ludo | editor-last2 = Verhoeven | title = Literacy Development in a Multilingual Context: A Cross-Cultural Perspective | pages = 135–146 | location = Mahwah, NJ | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, bilinguals seem to be more advanced than monolinguals when it comes to reading ability.

=== Vocabulary ===
It is a well-replicated finding that bilinguals have a smaller vocabulary size than their monolinguals counterparts.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gollan TH, Brown AS | title = From tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) data to theoretical implications in two steps: when more TOTs means better retrieval | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology.

However, within each language bilinguals have a smaller vocabulary size and take longer to name pictures as seen in standardized vocabulary tests, such as the [[Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test]] and [[Boston Naming Test|Boston Naming task]]. A possible explanation may be that the frequency of use of words is related to increased lexical accessibility, meaning that words that are used more frequently are accessed more quickly.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oldfield RC, Wingfield A | title = Response latencies in naming objects | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 273–81 | date = November 1965 | pmid = 5852918 | doi = 10.1080/17470216508416445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1977 |title=Frequency and repetition effects in lexical memory. | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=3|pages=1–17|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.3.1.1 |  vauthors = Scarborough DL, Cortese C, Scarborough H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, bilinguals may be 'less proficient' relative to monolinguals, purely because they use one sole language less frequently than monolinguals, who use the same language all the time. In addition, the need to select the appropriate language system makes ordinary linguistic processing more effortful. The simple act of retrieving a common word is more effortful for bilinguals than monolinguals due to the competition of the two languages.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt;

Other things to consider in this area of a bilingual's language were pointed out in Bialystok, Luk, Peets, and Yang's study from 2010. They note that certain vocabulary tests could yield artificially low scores for bilingual children according to the domain from which the test words are taken. For example, this group of researchers found that monolingual and bilingual 6-year-olds in their study had similar scores on English words that were associated with schooling. However, when the children were tested on English words that were associated with the home, the scores were significantly lower for the bilingual (English-Spanish) children. The researchers interpret this result as reflecting an asymmetry in vocabulary domains and language exposure: monolingual and bilingual children were equally exposed to the school context in the same language (English), but English was not commonly used in the home environments of the bilingual children. Therefore, one cannot conclude that the bilingual children exhibited a true deficit in vocabulary ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialystok E, Luk G, Peets KF, Yang S | title = Receptive vocabulary differences in monolingual and bilingual children | journal = Bilingualism | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 525–531 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 25750580 | doi = 10.1017/s1366728909990423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on L1 from prolonged exposure to L2 ===
It has been suggested that prolonged naturalistic exposure to L2 affects how L2 is processed, but it may also affect how the L1 is processed. For example, in [[Language immersion|immersion contexts]], the individual experiences reduced access to L1 and extensive contact with L2, which affects and facilitates processing of L2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linck JA, Kroll JF, Sunderman G | title = Losing access to the native language while immersed in a second language: evidence for the role of inhibition in second-language learning | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 12 | pages = 1507–15 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19906121 | pmc = 2858781 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02480.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=Linguistic diversity and object naming by non-native speakers of English | journal=Biling.

For example, ''Alguien disparó al hijo de la actriz que estaba en el balcón' = '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Someone shot the son of the actress who was on the balcony.'' When asked the question, ''¿Quien estaba en el balcón?'' = ''Who was on the balcony?'', monolingual Spanish speakers will typically answer ''el hijo'' = ''the son'' as they have a high attachment preference, meaning they attach the modifier to the "higher" verb phrase [shot the son]. This differs from monolingual English speakers who will typically answer ''the actress'' as they have a low attachment preference, meaning they attach the modifier to the "lower" verb phrase [the actress who was on the balcony].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carreiras M, Clifton C | title = Another word on parsing relative clauses: eyetracking evidence from Spanish and English | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 826–33 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10540811 | doi = 10.3758/bf03198535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that Spanish-English bilinguals in a Spanish-speaking environment showed preference for the typical Spanish high-attachment strategy. However, Spanish-English bilinguals in an English-speaking environment showed preference for the typical English low-attachment strategy, even when reading the phrase in Spanish, their dominant language. This may be because they have more exposure to English constructions, making it more available to them.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; But altogether, this supports the idea that the L2, English in this case, is affecting the way the native Spanish speakers use their L1.

'''David Christopher Cole''', also known as '''David Stein''', is an American journalist and documentary film director. As a young man, he achieved notoriety for his controversial views on the [[Holocaust]], which have at various times been labeled [[Holocaust revisionism]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/03/david-stein-cole-holocaust-revisionist|title=Hollywood conservative unmasked as notorious Holocaust revisionist|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=May 3, 2013|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Holocaust denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spectator.org/55628_holocaust-denier-walks-bar|title=A Holocaust Denier Walks Into a BarThe American Spectator|website=spectator.org|language=en-US|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the controversy Cole attracted resulted from the fact that he is Jewish. After changing his name to David Stein following death threats, he became known for his activism on behalf of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is the author of the book ''Republican Party Animal'', published by [[Feral House]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://feralhouse.com/republican-party-animal/|title=Republican Party Animal|work=Feral House|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life until 1998==

In his late teens, Cole embarked on a study of American political ideology. This led author [[Michael Shermer]] to coin the term "meta-ideologue" to describe Cole. In a 1994 article in Shermer's [[Skeptic (US magazine)|''Skeptic'' magazine]], Shermer wrote, "Where the other revisionists are political and/or racial ideologues, Cole's interests run at a deeper level. He is a meta-ideologue – an existentialist on a quest to understand how ideologues invent their realities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/american/skeptic-magazine/skeptic-4.html|title=Who Are The Holocaust Revisionists?|website=www.nizkor.org|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Cole appeared on the ''[[Montel Williams Show]]'', the ''[[Phil Donahue Show]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', and ''[[The Morton Downey Jr. Show]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In an ironic twist, Ernest Hollander, the Auschwitz survivor who debated Cole on the Montel Williams Show, discovered after the show aired that the brother he thought was murdered during the Holocaust was actually alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jweekly.com/2002/07/26/holocaust-survivor-lecturer-ernie-hollander-dies-at-77/|title=Holocaust survivor-lecturer Ernie Hollander dies at 77 – J.|date=July 26, 2002|work=J.|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brother's neighbor had seen the Montel episode, and recognized the resemblance between the two Hollanders. Both brothers had thought the other was dead (Williams hosted the reunion on his show).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Talia Hollander|title=Ernest Hollander reunited with his brother|date=March 6, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBGCNWcrM2E|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cole claimed that this supported his theory that many of the Jews deported to Auschwitz in 1944 were falsely believed to be dead.

In 1993, Cole was interviewed by Timothy Ryback for ''[[The New Yorker]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/11/15/evidence-of-evil|title=Evidence of Evil|work=The New Yorker|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other interviews from that time include the ''[[Jerusalem Report]]'' (which referred to Cole as "an unlikely media sensation" and "something of a media star"),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Who Needs Enemies?|last=|first=|date=October 21, 1993|work=The Jerusalem Report|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Detroit Jewish News'',&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Rebel Without a Cause|last=|first=|date=January 21, 1994|work=The Detroit Jewish News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Hustler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wonderclub.com/magazines/HUSTmagHUST199308.htm|title=Hustler August 1993 Magazine Back Issue Hustler WonderClub|last=magazine|first=WonderClub Hustler|website=wonderclub.com|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also penned op-eds for the ''Los Angeles Times'' under his own name,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-18/entertainment/ca-15273_1_angel-tv-show|title=It's Not the Networks That Shy Away From Religion|last=COLE|first=DAVID|date=December 18, 1995|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the name Christopher Cole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/12/entertainment/et-cole12|title=Media Aren't Racially Biased; They're Just Busy|last=COLE|first=CHRISTOPHER|date=August 12, 2002|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/12/entertainment/ca-31686|title=1st Amendment Means 'Pfeiffer' Too|last=COLE|first=CHRISTOPHER|date=October 12, 1998|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/19/opinion/op-urine19|title=Religion and Art in the Toilet|last=Cole|first=Christopher|date=June 19, 2005|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/19/entertainment/ca-27251|title=Using Epithet Isn't Bold, Fighting Censorship Is|last=COLE|first=CHRISTOPHER|date=February 19, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Cole lectured on college campuses throughout the U.S. During a lecture at [[UCLA]], he was assaulted on-stage, resulting in security rushing him off campus for his own safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ucladailybruin139losa|title=UCLA daily Bruin|date=1912|publisher=Los Angeles|others=UCLA Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proper label for Cole's views is a subject of debate. According to ''The Guardian'', which chose to use the term "revisionist," Cole's main thesis is that "[[Auschwitz]] was not an extermination camp in the manner of [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor]], [[Belzec]] and [[Chelmno]] – which he (Cole) acknowledged were part of a genocidal programme against Polish Jews; that the Holocaust ended in 1943, when the [[Nazis]] realised they needed Jewish slave labour for factories; and that there was no overarching, genocidal plan, but an evolving, morphing policy which claimed perhaps 4 million, rather than 6 million, Jewish lives."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Gawker''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gawker.com/hollywood-conservative-leader-turns-out-to-be-holocaust-492880292|title=Hollywood Conservative Leader Turns Out to Be Holocaust Revisionist|last=Berman|first=Taylor|work=Gawker|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Stranger''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2013/05/06/16686151/david-stein-is-david-cole-the-jewish-holocaust-revisionist/|title=David Stein Is David Cole, the Jewish Holocaust Revisionist|work=The Stranger|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; also used the term revisionist. Conversely, the ''[[Huffington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/05/david-stein-early-life_n_3219832.html|title=David Stein's Early Life As Holocaust Denier David Cole|date=May 5, 2013|work=Huffington Post|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Wrap]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/who-david-stein-strange-hollywood-republican-outs-himself-holocaust-denier-david-cole-89/|title=Who Is David Stein? A Strange Hollywood Republican Outs Himself as Holocaust Denier David Cole|date=May 4, 2013|work=TheWrap|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; have referred to Cole as a denier. Generally, most Jewish organizations refer to Cole as a denier, including the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/blog/us-representative-brings-holocaust-denier-to-meeting-on-capitol-hill|title=U.S. Representative Brings Holocaust Denier to Meeting on Capitol Hill|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] (in 1994 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told the Jerusalem Report "I can't think of any other Jew who has gone so far in aiding and abetting the enemies of the Jewish people").&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Professor [[Deborah Lipstadt]], who has made it her life's work to counter Holocaust denial, told the Detroit Jewish News in 1994 that there was a lot of "joy and rejoicing" in "revisionist" camps because of Cole.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Detroit Jewish News' editor, Phil Jacobs, went further, listing Cole as a threat to the Jewish people right alongside "Hitler, Hussein, and Arafat" in a January 28, 1994, editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Why David Cole Was On Page 1|last=|first=|date=January 28, 1994|work=The Detroit Jewish News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1998, [[Irv Rubin]], chairman of the [[Jewish Defense League]], offered a monetary reward for information regarding Cole's whereabouts. The Anti-Defamation League, no fan of Cole's, agreed that the JDL's reward offer implied that "it was prepared to take immediate, possibly violent, action" in order to "get rid" of Cole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.is/NLsoB#selection-385.277-397.167|title=Holocaust Denial: David Cole and Roger Garaudy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat, Cole entered into a deal with Rubin whereby he renounced his views and the JDL removed the "reward offer." The over-the-top "recantation" was met with widespread skepticism, with Michael Shermer writing in his 2000 book ''[[Denying History]]'' that Cole's retraction demanded "a healthy dose of skepticism" because it was "so unlike his earlier positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uACijKy-cbgC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=JDL+%22David+Cole%22+%22Monstrous+traitor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3TW_5XJWW0&amp;sig=cDJ22jBTGAOVAbcb36Mqi8wZj4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA9p_Q8sXaAhUmhOAKHfrjChUQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=JDL%20%22David%20Cole%22%20%22Monstrous%20traitor%22&amp;f=false%5D%20Rubin%20even%20admitted%20to%20Shermer%20that%20the%20recantation%20came%20about%20because%20Cole%20was%20%E2%80%9Cdeadly%20afraid%20for%20his%20life.%E2%80%9D%20%5Bhttps://books.google.com/books?id=uACijKy-cbgC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=JDL+%22David+Cole%22+%22Monstrous+traitor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3TW_5XJWW0&amp;sig=cDJ22jBTGAOVAbcb36Mqi8wZj4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA9p_Q8sXaAhUmhOAKHfrjChUQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=JDL%20%22David%20Cole%22%20%22Monstrous%20traitor%22&amp;f=false%5D%20Rubin%20also%20copped%20to%20accepting%20money%20from%20Cole%20in%20order%20to%20remove%20the%20reward%20offer.%20%5Bhttps://books.google.com/books?id=uACijKy-cbgC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=JDL+%22David+Cole%22+%22Monstrous+traitor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3TW_5XJWW0&amp;sig=cDJ22jBTGAOVAbcb36Mqi8wZj4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA9p_Q8sXaAhUmhOAKHfrjChUQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=JDL%20%22David%20Cole%22%20%22Monstrous%20traitor%22&amp;f=false|title=Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?

In the words of The Guardian, "David Stein brought right-wing congressmen, celebrities, writers and entertainment industry figures together for shindigs, closed to outsiders, where they could scorn liberals and proclaim their true beliefs. Over the past five years Stein's organization, Republican Party Animals, drew hundreds to regular events in and around Los Angeles, making him a darling of conservative blogs and talkshows. That he made respected documentaries on the Holocaust added intellectual cachet and Jewish support to Stein's cocktail of politics, irreverence and rock and roll."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==After 2013==

In April 2013, Stein was outed as Cole by an ex-girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2014/7/17/1314791/-The-GOP-the-Holocaust-Denier-and-the-Fashion-Model|title=The GOP, the Holocaust Denier, and the Fashion Model|work=Daily Kos|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L.A.

In 2014, Cole's autobiography, ''Republican Party Animal'', was published by Feral House&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and excerpted on AlterNet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/culture/my-life-undercover-hollywoods-right-wing-underground|title=My Life Undercover in Hollywood's Right-Wing Underground|last=Cole|first=David|date=May 25, 2014|work=AlterNet|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2015, he became a regular source in The Guardian for matters relating to Hollywood conservatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/13/hollywood-republicans-friends-of-abe-club-trump|title=Club for Hollywood Republicans locked in dispute – caused in part by Trump|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=June 13, 2017|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/27/alt-right-donald-trump-white-supremacy-backlash|title='Alt-right' groups will 'revolt' if Trump shuns white supremacy, leaders say|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=December 27, 2016|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/01/trump-hollywood-celebrity-supporters-friends-of-abe|title='It’s a civil war in slow-mo': how Trump's rise is cracking Hollywood conservatives|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=April 1, 2016|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/11/donald-trump-friends-abe-immigration-los-angeles|title=Donald Trump and the Friends of Abe: tycoon brings immigration fight to LA|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=July 11, 2015|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in that capacity he has also been interviewed by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/features/hollywood-aclu-civil-liberties-trump-1202492378/|title=Hollywood Heavyweights Help ACLU Fight for Civil Liberties in Trump Era|last=Lopez|first=Ricardo|date=July 12, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Daily Mail]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3554024/Powerful-Hollywood-conservative-group-secret-members-include-Clint-Eastwood-Jon-Voight-forced-disband-constant-infighting-Donald-Trump.html|title=Secret Hollywood conservative group dissolves over fights about Trump|work=Mail Online|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Truthdig]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/friends-of-abe-hollywood-conservatives-secret-society-is-calling-it-quits-exclusive-2/|title=Friends of Abe, Hollywood Conservatives' Secret Society, Is Calling It Quits (Exclusive)|work=Truthdig: Expert Reporting, Current News, Provocative Columnists|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Digital rights management''' ('''DRM''') is a set of [[access control]] technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and [[copyright]]ed works.&lt;ref name="act11"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=0rVfRwcIPYgC&amp;pg=SA9-PA26&amp;dq=DRM+%22access+control+technology%22#v=onepage&amp;q=DRM%20%22access%20control%20technology%22&amp;f=false|title = Computer Forensics: Investigating Network Intrusions and Cybercrime|publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|pages = 9–26|isbn = 1435483529|date = 16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.priv.gc.ca/resource/fs-fi/02_05_d_32_e.asp |title=Fact Sheet: Digital Rights Management and have to do: Technical Protection Measures |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414002554/http://www.priv.gc.ca/resource/fs-fi/02_05_d_32_e.asp |archive-date=14 April 2016 |date=24 November 2006|website= Priv.gc.ca |accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of digital rights management is not universally accepted. Proponents of DRM argue that it is necessary to prevent [[intellectual property]] from being copied freely, just as physical locks are needed to prevent personal property from being stolen,&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2009/08/06/tech-digital-locks-drm-tpm-rights-management-protection-measures-copyright-copy-protection.html |title=The pros, cons, and future of DRM |quote=Digital locks – also known as digital rights management (DRM) technologies or technological protection measures (TPM) |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=7 August 2009|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it can help the copyright holder maintain [[artistic control]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistscope.com/protection.asp|title=Images and the Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it can ensure continued revenue streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streamingmedia.com/r/printerfriendly.asp?id=8306 |title=Making Money with Streaming Media |author=Christopher Levy |date=3 February 2003 |accessdate=28 August 2006 |publisher=streamingmedia.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514024614/http://www.streamingmedia.com/r/printerfriendly.asp?id=8306 |archivedate=14 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those opposed to DRM contend there is no evidence that DRM helps prevent copyright infringement, arguing instead that it serves only to inconvenience legitimate customers, and that DRM helps [[big business]] stifle innovation and competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/drm |title=DRM|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued.&lt;ref name="opensource1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.com/life/11/11/drm-graveyard-brief-history-digital-rights-management-music|title=The DRM graveyard: A brief history of digital rights management in music|publisher=opensource.com |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; DRM can also restrict users from exercising their [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|legal rights]] under the copyright law, such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs (instead having to buy another copy, if it can still be purchased), lending materials out through a library, accessing works in the public domain, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the [[fair use doctrine]].&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) consider the use of DRM systems to be an [[anti-competitive practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2004/05/fairplay-another-anticompetitive-use-drm|title=FairPlay: Another Anti-competitive Use of DRM|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/DRM/fair_use_and_drm.html |title=Fair Use and DRM |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230184227/http://w2.eff.org/IP/DRM/fair_use_and_drm.html |archivedate=30 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, many laws have been created which criminalize the circumvention of DRM, communication about such circumvention, and the creation and distribution of tools used for such circumvention. Such laws are part of the United States' [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ304/html/PLAW-105publ304.htm|title = Public Law 105 – 304 – Digital Millennium Copyright Act|date = |accessdate = 26 July 2015|website = U.

==Introduction==

The rise  of digital media and analog-to-digital conversion technologies has vastly increased the concerns of copyright-owning individuals and organizations, particularly within the music and movie industries. While [[analog audio|analog]] media inevitably lost quality with each [[generation loss|copy generation]], and in some cases even during normal use, digital media files may be duplicated an unlimited number of times with no degradation in the quality.

The rise of [[personal computer]]s as household appliances has made it convenient for consumers to convert media (which may or may not be copyrighted) originally in a physical, analog or broadcast form into a universal, digital form (this process is called [[ripping]]) for portability or [[timeshifting|viewing later]]. This, combined with the [[Internet]] and popular [[file sharing|file-sharing]] tools, has made [[Copyright infringement|unauthorized distribution of copies of copyrighted digital media]] (also called [[digital piracy]]) much easier.

In 1983, a very early implementation of Digital Rights Management (DRM) was the Software Service System (SSS) devised by the Japanese engineer Ryuichi Moriya.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19850501&amp;CC=JP&amp;NR=60077218A&amp;KC=A Patent application 58-186100] (Publication #60-077218), ''Software Control System'', Japan Patent Office, 5 October 1983, Ryoichi Mori, applicant. Reported by [[Industrial Property Digital Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently refined under the name [[superdistribution]]. The SSS was based on encryption, with specialized hardware that controlled decryption and also enabled payments to be sent to the copyright holder. The underlying principle of the SSS and subsequently of superdistribution was that the distribution of encrypted digital products should be completely unrestricted and that users of those products would not just be permitted to redistribute them but would actually be encouraged to do so.

Common DRM techniques include restrictive [[licensing agreement]]s: The access to digital materials, copyright and public domain is restricted to consumers as a condition of entering a website or when downloading software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Rights Management Systems and Copy Protection Schemes| url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/DRM/ |publisher=eff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Encryption]], scrambling of expressive material and embedding of a tag, which is designed to control access and reproduction of information, including backup copies for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;Kranich, Nancy. "Chap 1(pg.8)." The Information Commons. Creative Commons, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

DRM technologies enable content publishers to enforce their own access policies on content, such as restrictions on copying or viewing. These technologies have been criticized for restricting individuals from copying or using the content legally, such as by [[fair use]]. DRM is in common use by the [[entertainment industry]] (e.g., audio and video publishers).&lt;ref name=devices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/117244/quickplay-distributes-tv-over-mobile-wi-fi.html|publisher=MediaDaily News |title=QuickPlay Distributes TV Over Mobile Wi-Fi |date=11 November 2009|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[online music store]]s, such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Store]], and [[e-book]] publishers and vendors, such as OverDrive, also use DRM, as do cable and satellite service operators, to prevent unauthorized use of content or services. However, Apple dropped DRM from all iTunes music files around 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bobbie Johnson, San Francisco|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jan/06/apple-drops-itunes-copy-protection|title=Apple drops copy protection from iTunes|publisher=Guardian|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry has expanded the usage of DRM to more traditional hardware products, such as [[Keurig]]'s [[coffeemaker]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140227/06521826371/keurig-will-use-drm-new-coffee-maker-to-lock-out-refill-market.shtml|title=Keurig Will Use DRM in New Coffee Maker To Lock Out Refill Market |publisher=techdirt.com |first=Karl |last=Bode |date=3 March 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/28/6079711/keurig-coffee-pod-drm-has-been-defeated |title=Keurig's coffee brewer 'DRM' has already been defeated |author=Chris Welch |date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philips]]' [[light bulb]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://boingboing.net/2015/12/14/philips-pushes-lightbulb-firmw.html Philips pushes lightbulb firmware update that locks out third-party bulbs] by [[Cory Doctorow]] on [[boingboing]] (14 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/07452133070/lightbulb-drm-philips-locks-purchasers-out-third-party-bulbs-with-firmware-update.shtml Light Bulb DRM: Philips Locks Purchasers Out Of Third-Party Bulbs With Firmware Update] on techdirt.com (14 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; [[mobile device]] [[AC adapter|power chargers]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070724/094533.shtml Another Thing You Need: 'DRM For Chargers'] on techdirt.com by Carlo Longino (25 July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/drm-chargers-possibly-good-users/ |title=DRM for Chargers: Possibly Good for Users|author=Ed Felten|date=26 July 2007|publisher=freedom-to-tinker.com|quote=''Apple has filed a patent application on a technology for tethering rechargeable devices (like iPods) to particular chargers.

==Technologies==

===Computer games===

====Limited install activations====
Computer games sometimes use DRM technologies to limit the number of systems the game can be installed on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled. This not only limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (seeing as the rights of the software developers allow them to limit the number of installations), but can also prove to be a problem if the user has to unexpectedly perform certain tasks like upgrading operating systems or reformatting the computer's hard drive, tasks which, depending on how the DRM is implemented, count a game's subsequent reinstall as a new installation, making the game potentially unusable after a certain period even if it is only used on a single computer.

In mid-2008, the Windows version of ''[[Mass Effect]]'' marked the start of a wave of titles primarily making use of [[SecuROM]] for DRM and requiring authentication with a server. The use of the DRM scheme in 2008's ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' [[Spore (2008 video game)#DRM controversy|backfired]] and there were protests, resulting in a considerable number of users seeking an unlicensed version instead. This backlash against the three-activation limit was a significant factor in ''Spore'' becoming the most pirated game in 2008, with [[TorrentFreak]] compiling a "top 10" list with ''Spore'' topping the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ernesto|url=http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-pirated-games-of-2008-081204/|title=Top 10 Most Pirated Games of 2008|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=4 December 2008|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Greenberg|author2=Mary Jane Irwin|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/12/spore-drm-piracy-tech-security-cx_ag_mji_0912spore.html|title=Spore's Piracy Problem|publisher=Forbes|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tweakguides concluded that the presence of intrusive DRM does not appear to increase the cracking of a game, noting that other games on the list such as ''[[Call of Duty 4]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' use [[SafeDisc]] DRM, which has no install limits and no online activation. Additionally, other video games that use intrusive DRM such as ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[Crysis Warhead]]'', and ''Mass Effect'', do not appear on the list.&lt;ref name="Tweakguides: PC Game Piracy Examined: Page 4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Koroush Ghazi|url=http://www.tweakguides.com/Piracy_4.html|title=PC Game Piracy Examined: Page 4|publisher=Tweakguides |date=14 December 2008|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Persistent online authentication====
{{main article|Always-on DRM}}

Many mainstream publishers continued to rely on [[online]] DRM throughout the later half of 2008 and early 2009, including [[Electronic Arts]], [[Ubisoft]], [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], and [[Atari]], ''[[The Sims 3]]'' being a notable exception in the case of Electronic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3173495|title=The Sims 3 Will Not Use DRM: News from|publisher=1UP.com|date=29 March 2009|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft broke with the tendency to use online DRM in late 2008, with the release of ''Prince of Persia'' as an experiment to "see how truthful people really are" regarding the claim that DRM was inciting people to use illegal copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/12/pc-prince-of-persia-contains-no-drm-its-a-trap.ars|title=PC Prince of Persia contains no DRM. It's a trap!|publisher=Arstechnica.com|date=12 December 2008|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ubisoft has not commented on the results of the "experiment", Tweakguides noted that two [[Torrent file|torrents]] on [[Mininova]] had over 23,000 people downloading the game within 24 hours of its release.&lt;ref name="Tweakguides: PC Game Piracy Examined: Page 8"&gt;{{cite web|author=Koroush Ghazi|url=http://www.tweakguides.com/Piracy_8.html|title=PC Game Piracy Examined: Page 8|publisher=Tweakguides|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubisoft formally announced a return to online authentication on 9 February 2010, through its [[Uplay]] online gaming platform, starting with ''[[Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic|Silent Hunter 5]]'', ''[[The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom|The Settlers 7]]'', and ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ubisoft|url=https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/press/detail.aspx?cid=tcm:99-30202-16&amp;ctid=tcm:95-27313-32|title=Ubisoft Press Release|publisher=Ubisoft|date=9 February 2010|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Silent Hunter 5'' was first reported to have been compromised within 24 hours of release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nic Simmonds|url=http://www.mygaming.co.za/news/pc/5515-Ubisofts-contentious-DRM-scheme-already-hacked.html|title=Ubisoft's contentious DRM scheme already hacked|publisher=MyGaming|date=4 March 2010|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but users of the cracked version soon found out that only early parts of the game were playable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Chalk|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98843-Ubisoft-Denies-Launch-Day-Crack-for-Silent-Hunter-5-DRM|title=Ubisoft Denies Launch Day Crack for Silent Hunter 5 DRM|publisher=Escapist Magazine|date=4 March 2010|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uplay system works by having the installed game on the local PCs incomplete and then continuously downloading parts of the game-code from Ubisoft's servers as the game progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Kuchera|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/02/ubisoft-details-drm.ars|title=Official explanation of controversial Assassin's Creed 2 DRM|publisher=Escapist Magazine|date=18 February 2010|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was more than a month after the PC release in the first week of April that software was released that could bypass Ubisoft's DRM in ''Assassin's Creed II''. The software did this by emulating a Ubisoft server for the game. Later that month, a real crack was released that was able to remove the connection requirement altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/assassins-creed-crack-hack-drm-ac2,10260.html|title=Ubisoft's DRM for Assassin's Creed II is Cracked|publisher=Tomshardware.com|date=23 April 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowensohn|first=Josh|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20003120-248.html|title=Ubisoft's controversial 'always on' PC DRM hacked|publisher=News.cnet.com|date=21 April 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 2010, the Uplay servers suffered a period of inaccessibility due to a large-scale [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS attack]], causing around 5% of game owners to become locked out of playing their game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Leyden|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/08/ubisoft_anti_drm_hack_attack/|title=Ubisoft undone by anti-DRM DDoS storm|publisher=The Register|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later credited owners of the affected games with a free download, and there has been no further downtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andre Yoskowitz|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2010/03/26/ubisoft_apologizes_to_users_affected_by_always_on_drm|title=Ubisoft apologizes to users affected by 'always on' DRM|publisher=Afterdawn|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other developers, such as [[Blizzard Entertainment]] are also shifting to a strategy where most of the game logic is on the "side" or taken care of by the servers of the game maker. Blizzard uses this strategy for its game [[Diablo III]] and Electronic Arts used this same strategy with their reboot of [[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]], the necessity of which has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Summer اWalker|url=http://www.gamebreaker.tv/pc-games/simcity-modder-catches-ea-lying/|title=SimCity Modder Catches EA Lying|publisher=Gamebreaker TV|date=20 March 2013|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Software tampering====
[[Bohemia Interactive]] have used a form of technology since ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]'', wherein if the game copy is suspected of being unauthorized, annoyances like guns losing their accuracy or the players being turned into a bird are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan Grayson|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/17/interview-bohemia-interactives-ceo-on-fighting-piracy-creative-drm/|title=Interview: Bohemia Interactive's CEO on fighting piracy, creative DRM|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Croteam]], the company that released ''[[Serious Sam 3: BFE]]'' in November 2011, implemented a different form of DRM wherein, instead of displaying error messages that stop the illicit version of the game from running, it causes a special invincible foe in the game to appear and constantly attack the player until he or she is killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Walker|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/12/07/serious-sams-drm-is-a-giant-pink-scorpion/|title=Serious Sam's DRM Is A Giant Pink Scorpion|publisher=rockpapershotgun.com|date=7 December 2011|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=socketboy |url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/63236/Serious-Sam-3-Non-Traditional-DRM-Solutions-Part-2 |title=Serious Sam 3 Non-Traditional DRM Solutions Part 2 |publisher=ign.com |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216132324/http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/63236/Serious-Sam-3-Non-Traditional-DRM-Solutions-Part-2 |archivedate=16 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Product keys====
One of the oldest and least complicated DRM protection methods for computer and Nintendo Entertainment System games was when the game would pause and prompt the player to look up a certain page in a booklet or manual that came with the game; if the player lacked access to such material, they would not be able to continue the game. A [[product key]], a typically alphanumerical [[serial number]] used to represent a license to a particular piece of software, serve a similar function. During the installation process or launch for the software, the user is asked to input the key; if the key correctly corresponds to a valid license (typically via internal algorithms), the key is accepted, then the user who bought the game can continue. In modern practice, product keys are typically combined with other DRM practices (such as online "activation"), as the software could be [[Software cracking|cracked]] to run without a product key, or "[[keygen]]" programs could be developed to generate keys that would be accepted.

===Documents===
'''Enterprise digital rights management''' ('''E-DRM''' or '''ERM''') is the application of DRM technology to the control of access to corporate documents such as [[Microsoft Word]], [[PDF]], and [[AutoCAD]] files, emails, and [[intranet]] web pages rather than to the control of consumer media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2006/121806techupdate.html|title="DRM vs. ERM: Battle to Control Data", Network World|accessdate=2 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303235632/http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2006/121806techupdate.html|archivedate=3 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-DRM, now more commonly termed IRM ([[Information Rights Management]]), is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use (such as [[Industrial espionage|industrial or corporate espionage]] or inadvertent release) of proprietary documents. IRM typically integrates with [[content management]] system software but corporations such as [[Samsung Electronics]] also develop their own custom DRM systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sds.samsung.com/popup/solution/epoint.jsp|title=NASCA is a DRM solution...|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DRM has been used by organizations such as the [[British Library]] in its [[secure electronic delivery service]] to permit worldwide access to substantial numbers of rare (and in many cases unique) documents which, for legal reasons, were previously only available to authorized individuals actually visiting the Library's document centre at Boston Spa in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1= Braid |first1= Andrew |title= The use of a Digital Rights Management System for Document Supply |book-title= 71th IFLA General Conference and Council |publisher= [[IFLA World Library and Information Congress]] |date= 22 June 2005 |url= http://202.206.214.254:8089/GYZJ/NEPAPER/papers/096e-Braid.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160611154507/http://202.206.214.254:8089/GYZJ/NEPAPER/papers/096e-Braid.pdf |archivedate= 11 June 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/libraries-secure-electronic-delivery/ |title= Practical problems for libraries distributing ebooks &amp; secure electronic delivery |author= |publisher=LockLizard |date=2016 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bl.uk/help/how-to-open-your-on-demand-order |title=How to open your on Demand order |author= |publisher=[[British Library]] |date=1 April 2014 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-books===
[[e-book|Electronic books]] read on a personal computer, or an [[e-book reader]] or e-reader app typically use DRM technology to limit copying, printing, and sharing of e-books. E-books are usually limited to be used on a limited number of reading devices, and some [[e-publisher]]s prevent any copying or printing. Some commentors believe DRM makes e-book publishing complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tinhat.com/ebooks_epublishing/epublishers_drm.html|title=eBooks and Digital Rights Management (DRM), for ePublishers|author=TinHat|date=June 2006|accessdate=28 May 2008|publisher=tinhat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012|08}}, there were five main e-book formats: [[EPUB]], [[KF8]], [[Mobipocket]], [[PDF]], and Topaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Topaz|publisher=mobileread.com |work=Mobileread.com|title=Topaz|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amazon Kindle]] uses KF8, Mobipocket, and Topaz; it also supports native PDF format e-books and native PDF files. Other e-book readers mostly use EPUB format e-books, but with differing DRM schemes.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There are four main e-book DRM schemes in common use today, one each from [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], Amazon, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and the Marlin Trust Management Organization (MTMO).

* Adobe's [[Adobe Digital Editions#Digital rights management|ADEPT]] DRM is applied to EPUBs and PDFs, and can be read by several third-party e-book readers, as well as [[Adobe Digital Editions]] (ADE) software. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] uses a DRM technology provided by Adobe, applied to EPUBs and the older [[PDB (Palm OS)]] format e-books. In October 2014, Adobe released version 4.0.1 of the software, which sends data to Adobe in a secure transmission (using [[HTTPS]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/what-we-can-learn-adobe-e-reader-mess What We Can Learn From The Adobe E-Reader Mess]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amazon's DRM is an adaption of the original Mobipocket encryption and is applied to Amazon's .azw4, KF8, and Mobipocket format e-books. Topaz format e-books have their own encryption system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Topaz Topaz]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apple's [[FairPlay]] DRM is applied to EPUBs and can currently only be read by Apple's [[iBooks]] app on [[iOS]] devices and [[Mac OS]] computers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* The Marlin DRM was developed and is maintained in an open industry group known as the Marlin Developer Community (MDC) and is licensed by MTMO. (Marlin was founded by five companies, [[InterTrust Technologies|Intertrust]], Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, and Sony.) The [[Kno]] online textbook publisher uses Marlin to protect e-books it sells in the EPUB format. These books can be read on the Kno App for [[iOS]] and [[Android OS|Android]].

In one instance of DRM that caused a rift with consumers, [[Amazon.com]] in July 2009, remotely deleted purchased copies of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) from customers' [[Amazon Kindle]]s after providing them a refund for the purchased products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html|title=Amazon Erases Orwell Books From Kindle Devices|date=18 July 2009|publisher=New York Times|first=Brad|last=Stone|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentors have described these actions as [[Orwellian]] and have compared Amazon to [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] from Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/|title=Some E-Books Are More Equal Than Others|date=17 July 2009|publisher=New York Times|author=David Pogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2009/07/17/amazon-kindle-1984/|title=Big Brother: Amazon Remotely Deletes 1984 From Kindles|date=17 July 2009|author=Pete Cashmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2009/07/17/amazon-zaps-purchase.html|title=Amazon zaps purchased copies of Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm from Kindles |date=17 July 2009|author=Mark Frauenfelder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon recalls (and embodies) Orwell's '1984'|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10289983-56.html|date=17 July 2009|author=Ina Fried}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Amazon CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] issued a public apology, the [[Free Software Foundation]] wrote that this was just one more example of the excessive power Amazon has to remotely censor what people read through its software, and called upon Amazon to free its e-book reader and drop DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/news/amazon-apologizes|title=Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos apologizes for Kindle ebook deletion.

===Film===
An early example of a DRM system is the [[Content Scrambling System]] (CSS) employed by the [[DVD Forum]] on film [[DVD]]s circa 1996. CSS uses an [[encryption algorithm]] to encrypt content on the DVD disc. Manufacturers of DVD players must license this technology and implement it in their devices so that they can decrypt the encrypted content to play it. The CSS license agreement includes restrictions on how the DVD content is played, including what outputs are permitted and how such permitted outputs are made available. This keeps the encryption intact as the video material is played out to a TV.

In 1999, [[Jon Lech Johansen]] released an application called [[DeCSS]], which allowed a CSS-encrypted DVD to play on a computer running the [[Linux]] operating system, at a time when no licensed DVD player application for Linux had yet been created. The legality of DeCSS is questionable: one of the authors has been the subject of a lawsuit, and reproduction of the keys themselves is subject to restrictions as [[illegal number]]s.&lt;ref name=eff1&gt;{{cite web|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=https://w2.eff.org/IP/Video/MPAA_DVD_cases/?f=20000202_ny_memorandum_order.html |title=Memorandum Order, in MPAA v. Reimerdes, Corley and Kazan |location=New York|date= 2 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1999, Microsoft released [[Windows Media DRM]], which read instructions from media files in a rights management language that stated what the user may do with the media.&lt;ref name="SecurityEngineeringRA"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html | author=[[Ross J. Anderson]] | title=Security Engineering | isbn = 0-471-38922-6 | page=705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language can define how many times the media file can be played, and whether or not it can be burned to a CD, forwarded, printed, or saved to the local disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/sample/DOMIS/update/2003/04apr/0403rmctte.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821220931/http://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/sample/DOMIS/update/2003/04apr/0403rmctte.htm |archivedate=21 August 2012|title=Rights Management comes to the Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of Windows Media DRM also allow producers to declare whether or not the user may transfer the media file to other devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/windows-media-player-drm-frequently-asked-questions|title=Windows Media Player DRM: frequently asked questions|accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to implement music subscription services that make downloaded files unplayable after subscriptions are cancelled, and to implement [[regional lockout]].&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite book |url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html|title = Security Engineering|publisher = WILEY|chapter = 22: Copyright and DRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Microsoft operating system, [[Windows Vista]], contains a DRM system called the [[Protected Media Path]], which contains the Protected Video Path (PVP). PVP tries to stop DRM-restricted content from playing while unsigned software is running, in order to prevent the unsigned software from accessing the content. Additionally, PVP can encrypt information during transmission to the [[Computer monitor|monitor]] or the [[graphics card]], which makes it more difficult to make unauthorized recordings.

[[Advanced Access Content System]] (AACS) is a DRM system for [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s developed by the AACS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a [[consortium]] that includes [[Disney]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], Microsoft, [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] (Panasonic), Sony, [[Toshiba]], and [[Warner Brothers]]. In December 2006, [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] published a process key online, which enabled unrestricted access to AACS-protected HD DVD content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/28/report-hddvd-copy-pr.html|title=Report: HD-DVD copy protection defeated|author=Xeni Jardin|date=28 December 2006|work=BoingBoing|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the cracked keys were revoked, further cracked keys were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/30/new-aacs-processing-.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124055806/http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/30/new-aacs-processing-.html |archivedate=24 January 2009|title=New AACS processing key leaks onto the net|author=Cory Doctorow|date=30 May 2007|work=BoingBoing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marlin (DRM)]] is a technology that is developed and maintained in an open industry group known as the Marlin Developer Community (MDC) and licensed by the Marlin Trust Management Organization (MTMO). Founded in 2005, by five companies: Intertrust, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, and Sony, Marlin DRM has been deployed in multiple places around the world. In Europe, Philips NetTVs implement Marlin DRM. Also in Europe, Marlin DRM is required in such industry groups as the [[Open IPTV Forum]] and national initiatives such as HDForum in France, Tivu in Italy, and YouView in the UK, and which are starting to see broad deployments. In Japan, the acTVila IPTV service uses Marlin to encrypt video streams, which are permitted to be recorded on a DVR in the home.

[[OMA DRM]] is a system invented by the [[Open Mobile Alliance]], whose members represent information technology companies (e.g., [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]]), mobile phone network operators (e.g., [[Cingular]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], [[Telefónica Europe|O2]], and [[Vodafone]]), mobile phone manufacturers (e.g., [[LG]], [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]), mobile system manufacturers (e.g., [[Ericsson]] and [[Openwave]]).

===Music===

====Audio CDs====
Discs with DRM schemes are not standards-compliant [[Compact Disc]]s (CDs) but are rather [[CD-ROM]] media. Therefore, they all lack the CD logotype found on discs which follow the standard (known as [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]]). These CDs cannot be played on all [[CD player]]s or personal computers. Personal computers running [[Microsoft Windows]] sometimes even crash when attempting to play the CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lewis, Rita|title=What is DRM and Why Should I Care?|date=8 January 2008|publisher=Firefox News|accessdate=10 July 2008|url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/1045/1/What-is-DRM-and-why-should-I-care/Page1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614083008/http://firefox.org/news/articles/1045/1/What-is-DRM-and-why-should-I-care/Page1.html|archivedate=14 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal|Sony BMG introduced new DRM technology]] which installed DRM software on users' computers without clearly notifying the user or requiring confirmation. Among other things, the installed software included a [[rootkit]], which created a severe security vulnerability others could exploit. When the nature of the DRM involved was made public much later, Sony BMG initially minimized the significance of the vulnerabilities its software had created, but was eventually compelled to recall millions of CDs, and released several attempts to patch the surreptitiously included software to at least remove the rootkit. Several [[class action lawsuit]]s were filed, which were ultimately settled by agreements to provide affected consumers with a cash payout or album downloads free of DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McMillan, Robert|title=Settlement Ends Sony Rootkit Case|date=23 May 2006|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=8 April 2007|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,125838-page,1-c,unresolvedtechstandards/article.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal|Sony BMG's DRM software]] actually had only a limited ability to prevent copying, as it affected only playback on Windows computers, not on other equipment. Even on the Windows platform, users regularly bypassed the restrictions. And, while the Sony BMG DRM technology created fundamental vulnerabilities in customers' computers, parts of it could be trivially bypassed by holding down the "shift" key while inserting the CD, or by disabling the [[autorun]] feature. In addition, audio tracks could simply be played and re-recorded, thus completely bypassing all the DRM (this is known as the [[analog hole]]). Sony BMG's first two attempts at releasing a [[patch (computing)|patch]] which would remove the DRM software from users' computers failed.

In January 2007, [[EMI]] stopped publishing audio CDs with DRM, stating that "the costs of DRM do not measure up to the results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marechal, Sander|url=http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/78008/index.html|title=DRM on audio CDs abolished|date=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following EMI, [[Sony BMG]] was the last publisher to abolish DRM completely, and audio CDs containing DRM are no longer released by the four largest commercial record label companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Internet music====
Many internet music stores employ DRM to restrict usage of music purchased and downloaded.

* Prior to 2009, Apple's iTunes Store utilized the [[FairPlay]] DRM system for music. Apple did not license its DRM to other companies, so only Apple devices and Apple's [[QuickTime]] media player could play iTunes music.&lt;ref name="opensource1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt; In May 2007, EMI tracks became available in ''iTunes Plus'' format at a higher price. These tracks were higher quality (256 kbit/s) and DRM free. In October 2007, the cost of iTunes Plus tracks was lowered to US$0.99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/10/15/itunes-plus-drm-free-tracks-expanding-dropping-to-99-cents|title=iTunes Plus DRM-free tracks expanding, dropping to 99 cents|work=Apple News from ARS Technica|accessdate=16 October 2007|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, all iTunes music became available completely DRM-free. (Videos sold and rented through iTunes, as well as iOS Apps, however, were to continue using Apple's FairPlay DRM.)
* [[Napster (pay service)|Napster music store]] offers a subscription-based approach to DRM alongside permanent purchases. Users of the subscription service can download and stream an unlimited amount of music transcoded to [[Windows Media Audio|Windows Media Audio (WMA)]] while subscribed to the service. But when the subscription period lapses, all the downloaded music is unplayable until the user renews his or her subscription. Napster also charges users who wish to use the music on their portable device an additional $5 per month. In addition, Napster gives users the option of paying an additional $0.99 per track to burn it to CD or for the song to never expire. Music bought through Napster can be played on players carrying the [[Microsoft PlaysForSure]] logo (which, notably, do not include [[iPod]]s or even Microsoft's own [[Zune]]). As of June 2009, Napster is offering DRM free MP3 music, which can be played on iPhones and iPods.
* Wal-Mart Music Downloads, another music download store, charges $0.94 per track for all non-sale downloads. All Wal-Mart downloads are able to be played on any Windows PlaysForSure marked product. The music does play on the [[SanDisk]]'s [[SanDisk Sansa|Sansa]] [[mp3 player]], for example, but must be copied to the player's [[internal memory]]. It cannot be played through the player's [[microSD]] card slot, which is a problem that many users of the mp3 player experience.
* Sony operated a music download service called "[[Sony Connect|Connect]]" which used Sony's proprietary [[OpenMG]] DRM technology. Music downloaded from this store (usually via Sony's [[SonicStage]] software) was only playable on computers running Microsoft Windows and Sony hardware (including the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and some [[Sony Ericsson]] phones).
* [[Kazaa]] is one of a few services offering a subscription-based pricing model. However, music downloads from the Kazaa website are DRM-protected and can only be played on computers or portable devices running Windows Media Player, and only as long as the customer remains subscribed to Kazaa.

The various services are currently not interoperable, though those that use the same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster, Kazaa and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]. Several colleges and [[universities]], such as [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds.&lt;ref name="freelegal&amp;ignored"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB115214899486099107-vuoIhGUthiYcFwsQK0DjegSRPwQ_20070706.html|title=Free, Legal and Ignored|author=Nick Timeraos|work=[[WSJ.com]] (Wall Street Journal)|date=6 July 2006|accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the problems is that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The [[Gowers Review of Intellectual Property]] (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8—12) that there be explicit [[fair dealing]] exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users to do the same privately. If adopted, some acrimony may decrease.

Although DRM is prevalent for Internet music, some [[online music store]]s such as [[eMusic]], [[Dogmazic]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Beatport]], do not use DRM despite encouraging users to avoid sharing music. Major labels have begun releasing more music without DRM. Eric Bangeman suggests in Ars Technica that this is because the record labels are "slowly beginning to realize that they can't have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time... One way to break the cycle is to sell music that is playable on any digital audio player. eMusic does exactly that, and their surprisingly extensive catalog of non-DRMed music has vaulted it into the number two online music store position behind the iTunes Store."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061206-8368.html|title=Testing DRM-free waters: EMI selling a few MP3s through Yahoo Music|author=Eric Bangeman|publisher=Ars Technica|date=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's [[Steve Jobs]] called on the music industry to eliminate DRM in an open letter titled [[Thoughts on Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macdailynews.com/2007/02/06/apple_ceo_steve_jobs_posts_rare_open_letter_thoughts_on_music/|author=Steve Jobs|title=Thoughts on Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's iTunes Store will start to sell DRM-free 256 kbit/s (up from 128 kbit/s) [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] encoded music from EMI for a premium price (this has since reverted to the standard price).

In March 2007, Musicload.de, one of Europe's largest internet music retailers, announced their position strongly against DRM. In an open letter, Musicload stated that three out of every four calls to their customer support phone service are as a result of consumer frustration with DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ken Fisher|date=18 March 2007|title=Musicload: 75% of customer service problems caused by DRM|publisher=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070318-75-percent-customer-problems-caused-by-drm.html|accessdate=20 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mobile ring tones=====
The [[Open Mobile Alliance]] created a standard for interoperable DRM on mobile devices. The first version of OMA DRM consisted of a simple rights management language and was widely used to protect mobile phone ringtones from being copied from the phone to other devices. Later versions expanded the rights management language to similar expressiveness as Fairplay, but did not become widely used.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;

===Television===
The [[CableCard]] standard is used by cable television providers in the United States to restrict content to services to which the customer has subscribed.

The [[broadcast flag]] concept was developed by Fox Broadcasting in 2001, and was supported by the [[MPAA]] and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). A ruling in May 2005, by a [[United States courts of appeals]] held that the FCC lacked authority to impose it on the TV industry in the US. It required that all HDTVs obey a stream specification determining whether a stream can be recorded. This could block instances of fair use, such as [[time-shifting]]. It achieved more success elsewhere when it was adopted by the [[Digital Video Broadcasting Project]] (DVB), a consortium of about 250 broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators, software developers, and regulatory bodies from about 35 countries involved in attempting to develop new digital TV standards.

An updated variant of the broadcast flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management group under DVB ([[DVB-CPCM]]). Upon publication by DVB, the technical specification was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, at the direction of the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], which paid to be a member of the consortium, "You won't even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/DVB/dvb_briefing_paper.php|title=Who Controls Your Television?|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=1 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129123215/http://w2.eff.org/IP/DVB/dvb_briefing_paper.php|archivedate=29 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normative sections have now all been approved for publication by the DVB Steering Board, and will be published by ETSI as a formal European Standard as ETSI TS 102 825-X where X refers to the Part number of specification. Nobody has yet stepped forward to provide a [[Compliance and Robustness]] regime for the standard (though several are rumoured to be in development), so it is not presently possible to fully implement a system, as there is nowhere to obtain the necessary device certificates.

===Metadata===
Sometimes, [[metadata]] is included in purchased media which records information such as the purchaser's name, account information, or email address. Also included may be the file's publisher, author, creation date, download date, and various notes. This information is not embedded in the played content, like a watermark, but is kept separate, but within the file or stream.

As an example, metadata is used in media purchased from Apple's iTunes Store for DRM-free as well as DRM-restricted versions of their music or videos. This information is included as MPEG standard metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/05/31/itunes-plus-drm-free-not-free-of-annoying-glitches/|title=Tunes Plus DRM-free, not free of annoying glitches|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1058178/ituneswatermark.html|publisher=[[Macworld]]|title=Watermarked iTunes files}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watermarks===
[[Digital watermarking|Digital watermarks]] exist since 1992. They are [[steganography|steganographically]] embedded within audio or video data during production or distribution. They can be used for recording the copyright owner, the distributor, the distribution chain or identifying the purchaser of the music.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Watermarks are not complete DRM mechanisms in their own right, but are used as part of a system for copyright enforcement, such as helping provide prosecution evidence for legal purposes, rather than direct technological restriction. Some programs used to edit video and/or audio may distort, delete, or otherwise interfere with watermarks. Signal/modulator-carrier chromatography may also separate watermarks from original audio or detect them as glitches. Additionally, comparison of two separately obtained copies of audio using simple, home-grown algorithms can often reveal watermarks.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Streaming media services ===
Since the late-2000s the trend in [[media consumption]] has been towards renting content using online streaming services, for example [[Spotify]] for music and [[Netflix]] for video content. Copyright holders often require that these services protect the content they licence using DRM mechanisms.

==Laws==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
{{globalize|section|date=November 2012}}

The 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty]] (WCT) requires nations to enact laws against DRM circumvention, and has been implemented in most member states of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]].

The [[United States]] implementation is the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), while in Europe the treaty has been implemented by the 2001 [[European directive on copyright]], which requires member states of the [[European Union]] to implement legal protections for technological prevention measures. {{As of|2006|alt=In 2006}}, the lower house of the French parliament adopted such legislation as part of the controversial [[DADVSI]] law, but added that protected DRM techniques should be made interoperable, a move which caused widespread controversy in the United States. The [[Tribunal de grande instance de Paris]] concluded in 2006, that the complete blocking of any possibilities of making private copies was an impermissible behaviour under French copyright law.&lt;ref name="Christophe R. vs Warner Music"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indicare.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=180|title=Christophe R. vs Warner Music: French court bans private-copying hostile DRM|author=Natali Helberger|date=1 March 2006|publisher=INDICARE|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In 1998 "Interim Regulations" were founded in China, referring to the DMCA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=89e26729-52ba-4418-bbb5-05294dff2a2a|title=Digital age copyright law in Asia: DMCA-type provisions in China and India|last=Gerk|first=David|last2=Dannenberg|first2=Ross|date=13 May 2009|website=Lexology}}&lt;/ref&gt; China also has Intellectual Property Rights, which to the World Trade Organization, was "not in compliance with the Berne Convention".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The WTO panel "determined that China's copyright laws do not provide the same efficacy to non- Chinese nationals as they do to Chinese citizens, as required by the Berne Convention". and that "China's copyright laws do not provide enforcement procedures so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because China has a form of DMCA and or copyright laws, it is assumed they are using some kind of technology to enforce those laws, however there is no mention of specific DRM technology.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===European Union===
On 22 May 2001, the European Union passed the [[EU Copyright Directive]], an implementation of the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty, that addressed many of the same issues as the DMCA.

On 25 April 2007, the European Parliament supported the first directive of EU, which aims to harmonize criminal law in the member states. It adopted a first reading report on harmonizing the national measures for fighting copyright abuse. If the European Parliament and the Council approve the legislation, the submitted directive will oblige the member states to consider a crime a violation of international copyright committed with commercial purposes. The text suggests numerous measures: from fines to imprisonment, depending on the gravity of the offense. The EP members supported the Commission motion, changing some of the texts. They excluded patent rights from the range of the directive and decided that the sanctions should apply only to offenses with commercial purposes. Copying for personal, non-commercial purposes was also excluded from the range of the directive.

In 2012, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in favor of reselling copyrighted games, prohibiting any preventative action that would prevent such transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/07/03/european-court-of-justice-rules-on-the-right-to-sell-your-digital-games-and-licenses/|title=European Court of Justice rules on the right to sell your digital games and licenses|work=PC Gamer|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that "The [[first sale doctrine|first sale]] in the EU of a copy of a computer program by the copyright holder or with his consent exhausts the right of distribution of that copy in the EU. A rightholder who has marketed a copy in the territory of a Member State of the EU thus loses the right to rely on his monopoly of exploitation in order to oppose the resale of that copy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregvoakes/2012/07/03/european-courts-rule-in-favor-of-consumers-reselling-downloaded-games/|title=European Courts Rule in Favor of Consumers Reselling Downloaded Games|author=Greg Voakes|date=3 July 2012|work=Forbes|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that circumventing DRM on game devices may be legal under some circumstances, limiting the legal protection to only cover technological measures intended to prevent or eliminate unauthorised acts of reproduction, communication, public offer or distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140123/08532725967/europes-highest-court-says-drm-circumvention-may-be-lawful-certain-circumstances.shtml|title=Europe's Highest Court Says DRM Circumvention May Be Lawful in Certain Circumstances|work=Techdirt.|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/131597-DRM-Circumvention-May-Be-Legal-European-Union-Court-Rules|title=DRM Circumvention May Be Legal, European Union Court Rules|date=23 January 2014|work=The Escapist|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;. However, as a part of its 2012 amendment of copyright laws, it implemented digital rights management protection&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Devika Agarwal, Radhika Agarwal ‘Needless Pressure to Change Copyright Laws’ (The Hindu Businessline, 4 May 2016) &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/needless-pressure-to-change-copyright-laws/article8557036.ece&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; accessed 16 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. Section 65A of [[Copyright Act, 1957]] imposed criminal sanctions on circumvention of "effective technological protection measures"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Zakir Thomas, 'Overview of Changes to Indian Copyright Law' [2012] 17 Journal of Intellectual Property Rights pp 324-334, 332 &lt;available at http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/14460/1/JIPR%2017(4)%20324-334.pdf?trk=right_banner&amp;id=1423737542&amp;ref=e882cae5bee920357317f68469dd25a2 accessed 16 May 2018&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Section 65B criminalized interference with digital rights management information. Any distribution of copies whose rights management information was modified was also criminalized by Section 65B&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The terms used in the provisions were not specifically defined, with the concerned Parliamentary Standing Committee indicating the same to have been deliberate. The Standing Committee noted that similar terms in developed terms were used to considerable complexity and therefore in light of the same, it was preferable to keep it open-ended&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

A prison sentence is mandatory under both provisions, with a maximum term of 2 years in addition to fine, which is discretionary. While the statute doesn't include exceptions to copyright infringement, including fair use directly, Section 65A allows measures "unless they are expressly prohibited", which may implicitly include such exceptions&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Section 65B however, lacks any exceptions&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Arul George Scaria, 'Does India Need Digital Rights Management Provisions or Better Digital Business  Management Strategies?'

Further. Section 65B (digital rights management information) allows resort to other civil provisions, unlike Section 65A&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

It is important to note that the WIPO Internet Treaties themselves do not mandate criminal sanctions, merely requiring "effective legal remedies"&lt;ref&gt;Urs Gasser, 'Legal Frameworks and Technological Protection Measures: Moving towards a Best Practices Model' Research Publication No. 2006-04 at Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society (Harvard) &lt;available at: https://courses.edx.org/c4x/HarvardX/HLS1.1x/asset/Urs_Gasser.pdf last accessed 17 May 2018&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, India's adoption of criminal sanctions ensures compliance with the highest standards of the WIPO internet treaties. Given the 2012 amendment, India's entry to the WIPO Internet Treaties appears facilitated&lt;ref&gt;Arul George Scaria, 'Does India Need Digital Rights Management Provisions or Better Digital Business  Management Strategies?'

=== Israel ===
{{as of| 2014}} Israel had not ratified the WIPO Copyright Treaty. Israeli law does not currently expressly prohibit the circumvention of technological measures used to implement digital rights management. In June 2012 The Israeli Ministry of Justice proposed a bill to prohibit such activities, but the [[Knesset]] did not pass it. In September 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the current copyright law could not be interpreted to prohibit the circumvention of digital rights management, though the Court left open the possibility that such activities could result in liability under the law of unjust enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israeltechnologylaw.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/no-digital-rights-management-here/|title=Israel Technology Law Blog – No Digital Rights Management Here}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main article|Digital Millennium Copyright Act}}

In May 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) passed as an amendment to US [[copyright law]], which criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology that lets users circumvent technical copy-restriction methods.(For a more detailed analysis of the statute, see [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]].)

Reverse engineering of existing systems is expressly permitted under the Act under the specific condition of a safe harbor, where circumvention is necessary to achieve interoperability with other software . See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201(f). Open-source software to decrypt content scrambled with the [[Content Scrambling System]] and other encryption techniques presents an intractable problem with the application of the Act. Much depends on the intent of the actor. If the decryption is done for the purpose of achieving interoperability of open source operating systems with proprietary operating systems, it would be protected by Section 1201(f) the Act. Cf., Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley, 273 F.3d 429 (2d Cir. 2001) at notes 5 and 16. However, dissemination of such software for the purpose of violating or encouraging others to violate copyrights has been held illegal. See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 346 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).

The DMCA has been largely ineffective in protecting DRM systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2007/03/24/dmcas_author_says_th.html|title=DMCA's author says the DMCA is a failure, blames record industry|first=Cory|last=Doctorow|date=24 March 2007|accessdate=12 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623191635/http://boingboing.net/2007/03/24/dmcas_author_says_th.html|archivedate=23 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as software allowing users to circumvent DRM remains widely available. However, those who wish to preserve the DRM systems have attempted to use the Act to restrict the distribution and development of such software, as in the case of DeCSS.

Although the Act contains an exception for research, the exception is subject to vague qualifiers that do little to reassure researchers. Cf., 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201(g). The DMCA has affected [[cryptography]], because many {{Who|date=March 2010}} fear that cryptanalytic research may violate the DMCA. In 2001, the arrest of Russian programmer [[Dmitry Sklyarov]] for alleged infringement of the DMCA was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. He was arrested in the US after a presentation at [[DEF CON]], and spent several months in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling to non-criminal inclined users, such as students of [[cryptanalysis]] including, Professor Felten and students at [[Princeton University]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sec01/craver.pdf|title=RIAA challenges SDMI attack|date=7 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; security consultants, such as Netherlands based [[Niels Ferguson]], who declined to publish vulnerabilities he discovered in [[Intel]]'s secure-computing scheme due to fear of being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the US; and blind or visually impaired users of [[screen reader]]s or other [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2011/initial/american_foundation_blind.pdf |title=Joint Comments of the American Council of the Blind and the American Foundation for the Blind, DOCKET NO.

In Europe, there have been several ongoing dialog activities that are characterized by their consensus-building intention:

* January 2001 Workshop on Digital Rights Management of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2000/12/drm-ws/Overview.html|title=W3C Workshop – Digital Rights Management for the Web|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2003 Participative preparation of the [[European Committee for Standardization]]/Information Society Standardization System (CEN/ISSS) DRM Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cenorm.be/cenorm/businessdomains/businessdomains/isss/activity/drm_fg.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005073900/http://www.cenorm.be/cenorm/businessdomains/businessdomains/isss/activity/drm_fg.asp |archivedate=5 October 2006 |title=Digital Rights Management |publisher=[[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2005 DRM Workshops of [[Directorate-General for Information Society and Media (European Commission)]], and the work of the High Level Group on DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=European Commission – Information Society – eEurope 2005 |title= eEurope 2005 Action Plan |date=2005|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/2005/all_about/action_plan/index_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520194647/ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/2005/all_about/action_plan/index_en.htm |archivedate=2006-05-20 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2005 Gowers Review of Intellectual Property by the British Government from [[Andrew Gowers]] published in 2006 with recommendations regarding copyright terms, exceptions, orphaned works, and copyright enforcement.
* 2004 Consultation process of the European Commission, DG Internal Market, on the Communication COM(2004)261 by the European Commission on "Management of Copyright and Related Rights" (closed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/copyright/management/management_en.htm|title=The address you requested is obsolete|publisher=Europa.eu.int|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=31 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422013330/http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/copyright/management/management_en.htm|archivedate=22 April 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Axmedis|AXMEDIS]] project, a European Commission Integrated Project of the FP6, has as its main goal automating content production, copy protection, and distribution, to reduce the related costs, and to support DRM at both B2B and B2C areas, harmonizing them.
* The [[INDICARE]] project is an ongoing dialogue on consumer acceptability of DRM solutions in Europe. It is an open and neutral platform for exchange of facts and opinions, mainly based on articles by authors from science and practice.

==Opposition==
Many organizations, prominent individuals, and computer scientists are opposed to DRM. Two notable DRM critics are [[John Walker (programmer)|John Walker]], as expressed for instance, in his article "[[The Digital Imprimatur]]: How Big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/|title=The Digital Imprimatur: How big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle.|first=John|last=Walker|date=13 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Stallman]] in his article ''The Right to Read''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richard Stallman]]|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html|title=The Right to Read}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other public statements: "DRM is an example of a malicious feature – a feature designed to hurt the user of the software, and therefore, it's something for which there can never be toleration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifso.ie/documents/gplv3-launch-2006-01-16.html|title=Transcript of Opening session of first international GPLv3 conference|date=16 January 2006|first=Ciaran|last=O'Riordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman also believes that using the word "rights" is misleading and suggests that the word "restrictions", as in "Digital Restrictions Management", be used instead.&lt;ref name="opposing-drm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/opposing-drm.html|title=Opposing Digital Rights Mismanagement (Or Digital Restrictions Management, as we now call it)?|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology has since been adopted by many other writers and critics unconnected with Stallman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/sony-rootkit-the-untold-story/ |title=Sony rootkit: The untold story |author=David Berlind |date=18 November 2005 |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher= |accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other prominent critics of DRM include Professor [[Ross J. Anderson (professor)|Ross Anderson]] of Cambridge University, who heads a British organization which opposes DRM and similar efforts in the UK and elsewhere, and [[Cory Doctorow]], a writer and technology blogger.&lt;ref name=Doctorow /&gt;

There have been numerous others who see DRM at a more fundamental level. This is similar to some of the ideas in Michael H. Goldhaber's presentation about "The Attention Economy and the Net" at a 1997 conference on the "Economics of Digital Information".&lt;ref name="Goldhaber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue2_4/goldhaber/#dep18|title=The Attention Economy and the Net|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sample quote from the "Advice for the Transition" section of that presentation:&lt;ref name="Goldhaber"/&gt; "If you can't figure out how to afford it without charging, you may be doing something wrong.")

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] and similar organizations such as [[FreeCulture.org]] also hold positions which are characterized as opposed to DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DRM|url = https://www.eff.org/issues/drm|website = Electronic Frontier Foundation|publisher =Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date = 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] has criticized DRM's effect as a [[trade barrier]] from a [[free market]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Media in the Digital Age|last = Pavlik|first = John|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 0231142099|location = New York|pages = 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final version of the [[GNU General Public License]] version 3, as released by the Free Software Foundation, has a provision that "strips" DRM of its legal value, so people can break the DRM on GPL software without breaking laws like the [[DMCA]]. Also, in May 2006, the FSF launched a "[[Defective by Design]]" campaign against DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#DRMProhibited|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation|publisher=FSF|date=28 July 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/|title=The Campaign to Eliminate DRM|publisher=DefectiveByDesign.org|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Creative Commons]] provides licensing options encouraging the expansion of and building upon creative work without the use of DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Is_Creative_Commons_involved_in_digital_rights_management_.28DRM.29.3F|title=Frequently Asked Questions – CcWiki|accessdate=22 November 2006|date=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Creative Commons licenses have anti-DRM clauses, therefore the use of DRM by a licensee to restrict the freedoms granted by a Creative Commons license is a breach of the Baseline Rights asserted by the licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Baseline_Rights|title=Baseline Rights – Creative Commons Wiki|accessdate=23 December 2007|date=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Gates spoke about DRM at CES in 2006. According to him, DRM is not where it should be, and causes problems for legitimate consumers while trying to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/12/14/bill-gates-on-the-future-of-drm/|title=Bill Gates on the Future of DRM.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Steve Jobs]], Apple opposes DRM music after a public letter calling its music labels to stop requiring DRM on its iTunes Store. As of 6 January 2009, the iTunes Store is DRM-free for songs.&lt;ref name="iTunes is DRM-free"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/01/06itunes.html|title=Changes Coming to the iTunes Store|author=apple.com|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:DRM protest Boston DefectiveByDesign.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Man in Tyvek suit holding a "Eliminate DRM" sign|[[Defective by Design]] member protesting DRM on 25 May 2007.]]

The Norwegian consumer rights organization "Forbrukerrådet" complained to Apple Inc. in 2007, about the company's use of DRM in, and in conjunction with, its iPod and iTunes products. Apple was accused of restricting users' access to their music and videos in an unlawful way, and of using [[EULA]]s which conflict with Norwegian consumer legislation. The complaint was supported by consumers' [[ombudsmen]] in Sweden and Denmark, and is currently being reviewed in the EU. Similarly, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] held hearings in March 2009, to review disclosure of DRM limitations to customers' use of media products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/12/ftc-town-hall-address-digital-rights-management-technologies|title=FTC Town Hall to Address Digital Rights Management Technologies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029070751/http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/12/ftc-town-hall-address-digital-rights-management-technologies |archivedate=29 October 2014|publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DRM opponents argue that the presence of DRM violates existing [[private property]] rights and restricts a range of heretofore normal and legal user activities. A DRM component would control a device a user owns (such as a [[digital audio player]]) by restricting how it may act with regard to certain content, overriding some of the user's wishes (for example, preventing the user from burning a copyrighted song to [[Compact Disc|CD]] as part of a compilation or a review). Doctorow has described this possibility as "the right to make up your own copyright laws".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140206/10323526118/drm-is-right-to-make-up-your-own-copyright-laws.shtml DRM Is The Right To Make Up Your Own Copyright Laws] – [[Mike Masnick]], Techdirt, 6 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this restriction to legal user activities may be seen in Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system in which content using a Protected Media Path is disabled or degraded depending on the DRM scheme's evaluation of whether the hardware and its use are 'secure'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmvps.com/blogs/chrisl/archive/2007/01/25/519180.aspx|title=What Content Will Be Crippled When Output in Vista?|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of DRM depend on the DRM-enabled device (e.g., computer, DVD player, TV) imposing restrictions that (at least by intent) cannot be disabled or modified by the user. Key issues around DRM such as the right to make personal copies, provisions for persons to lend copies to friends, provisions for service discontinuance, hardware agnosticism, software and operating system agnosticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesleytech.com/why-is-netflix-ignoring-linux/2072/|title=Why is Netflix ignoring Linux?|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; contracts for public libraries, and customers' protection against one-side amendments of the contract by the publisher have not been fully addressed.(see references 80–89) It has also been pointed out that it is entirely unclear whether owners of content with DRM are legally permitted to pass on their property as [[inheritance]] to another person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teleread.org/2009/02/26/why-the-kindles-drm-is-anti-elderly-and-perhaps-even-a-target-for-an-aarp-campaign-against-it/ Why the Kindle's DRM is anti-elderly: AARP should fight against it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503064350/http://www.teleread.org/2009/02/26/why-the-kindles-drm-is-anti-elderly-and-perhaps-even-a-target-for-an-aarp-campaign-against-it/ |date=3 May 2009 }}, 26 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools like [[FairUse4WM]] have been created to strip Windows Media of DRM restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/08/25/fairuse4wm-strips-windows-media-drm|title=Engadget FairUse4WM strips Windows Media DRM!|accessdate=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Valve Corporation]] president [[Gabe Newell]] also stated "most DRM strategies are just dumb" because they only decrease the value of a game in the consumer's eyes. Newell suggests that the goal should instead be "[creating] greater value for customers through service value". Valve operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], a service which serves as an online store for [[PC game]]s, as well as a [[social networking service]] and a DRM platform.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3171588|title=Gabe Newell Says DRM Strategies 'Are Just Dumb'|date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[Game Developers Conference]], the CEO of [[CD Projekt Red]], Marcin Iwinski, announced that the company will not use DRM in any of its future releases. Iwinski stated of DRM, "it's just over-complicating things. We release the game. It's cracked in two hours, it was no time for [[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings|Witcher 2]]. What really surprised me is that the pirates didn't use the [[Good Old Games|GOG]] version, which was not protected. They took the [[SecuROM]] retail version, cracked it and said 'we cracked it' – meanwhile there's a non-secure version with a simultaneous release. You'd think the [[Good Old Games|GOG]] version would be the one floating around." Iwinski added after the presentation, "DRM does not protect your game. If there are examples that it does, then people maybe should consider it, but then there are complications with legit users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/03/08/witcher-2-developer-we-will-never-use-any-drm-anymore/|title='Witcher 2' Developer: 'We Will Never Use Any DRM Anymore'|last=Kain|first=Eric|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Schneier]] argues that digital copy prevention is futile: "What the entertainment industry is trying to do is to use technology to contradict that natural law. They want a practical way to make copying hard enough to save their existing business. But they are doomed to fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0105.html#3 The Futility of Digital Copy Prevention] Crypto-Gram Newsletter, 15 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He has also described trying to make digital files uncopyable as being like "trying to make water not wet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2006/09/71738|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103095236/http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2006/09/71738|archivedate=3 January 2010|title=Quickest Patch Ever|author=Bruce Schneier|date=7 September 2005|publisher=''Wired''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of StarForce also take this stance, stating that "The purpose of copy protection is not making the game uncrackable – it is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glop.org/starforce/images/starforce-official-words.png|title=Official words of StarForce on DRM|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] have historically opposed DRM, even going so far as to name [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] as a technology "most likely to fail" in an issue of [[IEEE Spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jan05/2703|title=Loser: DVD Copy Protection, Take 2|accessdate=4 May 2007|author=Tekla S.

===DRM-free works===
[[File:DRM-free label.en.svg|thumb|alt=DRM FREE with the no symbol removed|Label proposed by the [[Free Software Foundation]] for DRM-free works]]

In reaction to opposition to DRM, many publishers and artists label their works as "DRM-free". Major companies that have done so include the following:

* [[Apple Inc.]] sold DRM content on their [[iTunes Store]] when it started 2003, but made music DRM-free after April 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/04/02itunes.html|title=Apple Unveils Higher Quality DRM-Free Music on the iTunes Store|accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been labeling all music as "DRM-Free" since January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070530-apple-hides-account-info-in-drm-free-music-too.html|title=Apple hides account info in DRM-free music, too|accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music still carries a [[digital watermark]] to identify the purchaser. Other works sold on iTunes such as apps, audiobooks, movies, and TV shows continue to be protected by DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/itunes-drm-free|title=Apple announces all music on iTunes to go DRM-free – no word on movies, TV shows, games, audiobooks and applications|date=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 2014, [[Comixology]], which distributes digital comics, has allowed rights holders to provide the option of a DRM-free download of purchased comics. Publishers which allow this include [[Dynamite Entertainment]], [[Image Comics]], [[Thrillbent]], [[Top Shelf Productions]], and [[Zenescope Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amazon's comixology introduces DRM-free downloads|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/25/amazon-comixology-drm-free-downloads-walking-dead-sex-criminals-darkness-comics|accessdate=30 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GOG.com]] (formerly Good Old Games), a [[Digital distribution|digital distributor]] started in 2008, specializes in the distribution of [[Personal computer|PC]] [[video game]]s. While most other digital distribution services allow various forms of DRM (or have them embedded), gog.com has a strict non-DRM policy.&lt;ref name="arspreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/09/first-look-gog-revives-classic-pc-games-for-download-age.ars |title=First look: GOG revives classic PC games for download age |accessdate=27 December 2012 |first=Frank|last=Caron |date=9 September 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |quote=''[...] [Good Old Games] focuses on bringing old, time-tested games into the downloadable era with low prices and no DRM.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All music sold on [[Google Play]] is DRM free.
* [[Tor Books]], a major publisher of science fiction and fantasy books, started selling DRM-free [[e-book]]s in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tor/Forge E-book Titles to Go DRM-Free |url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/torforge-e-book-titles-to-go-drm-free|publisher=Tor.com |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller e-book publishers, such as [[Baen Books]] and [[O'Reilly Media]], had already forgone DRM previously.
*[[Vimeo|Vimeo on Demand]] is one of the publishers included in the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s DRM-free guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guide to DRM-Free Living {{!}} Defective by Design|url = http://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide|website = www.defectivebydesign.org|accessdate = 3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings==

===DRM server and Internet outages===
Many DRM systems require authentication with an online server. Whenever the server goes down, or a region or country experiences an Internet outage, it effectively locks out people from registering or using the material. This is especially true for a product that requires a persistent online authentication, where, for example, a successful [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS attack]] on the server would essentially make all copies of the material unusable.

===DRM bypass methods for audio and video content===
One simple method to bypass DRM on audio files is to burn the content to an audio CD and then [[Ripping|rip]] it into DRM-free files. Some software products simplify and automate this burn-rip process by allowing the user to burn music to a CD-RW disc or to a Virtual CD-R drive, then automatically rip and encode the music, and automatically repeat this process until all selected music has been converted, rather than forcing the user to do this one CD (72–80 minutes worth of music) at a time.

Many software programs have been developed that intercept the data stream as it is decrypted out of the DRM-restricted file, and then use this data to construct a DRM-free file. These programs require a decryption key. Programs that do this for Blu-ray Discs, DVDs, and HD DVDs include universal decryption keys in the software itself. Programs that do this for [[iTunes]] audio, [[PlaysForSure]] songs, and [[TiVo]] ToGo recordings, however, rely on the user's own key – that is, they can only process content the user has legally acquired under his or her own account.

Another method is to use software to record the signals being sent through the audio or video cards or plug analog recording devices into the analog outputs of the media player. These techniques utilize the "[[analog hole]]".

To bypass DRM technologies embedded in video-streaming services, hackers employ a variety of methods. Besides rerecording and redistributing video streams, they place links to video-streaming services in web pages owned by the hackers, sell legitimate users' data on the black market for other people's use, and legitimate users sharing their account with family or friends who intend not to pay for the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/resources/0006/drm-and-%20the-challenge-%20of-securing-%20%20content/279627|title=DRM and the Challenge of Securing Content|last=TvTechnology|work=TV Technology|access-date=26 May 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analog recording===
{{Main article|Analog recording}}

All forms of DRM for audio and visual material (excluding interactive materials, e.g., videogames) are subject to the [[analog hole]], namely that in order for a viewer to play the material, the digital signal must be turned into an analog signal containing light and/or sound for the viewer, and so available to be copied as no DRM is capable of controlling content in this form. In other words, a user could play a purchased audio file while using a separate program to record the sound back into the computer into a DRM-free file format.

All DRM to date can therefore be bypassed by recording this signal and digitally storing and distributing it in a non DRM limited form, by anyone who has the technical means of recording the analog stream. Furthermore, the analog hole cannot be overcome without the additional protection of externally imposed restrictions, such as legal regulations, because the vulnerability is inherent to all analog means of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Sicker, Douglas, Paul Ohm, and Shannon Gunaji. "The Analog Hole and the Price of Music: An Empirical Study". ''Journal of Tellecommunications and High Technology''. 2006–2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the conversion from digital to analog and back is likely to force a loss of quality, particularly when using [[lossy]] digital formats. [[HDCP]] is an attempt to plug the analog hole, although as of 2009, it was largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/4520463|title=MPAA shows how to videorecord a TV set|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GzN3ohNNPDgC&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Security and Privacy in Digital Rights Management|accessdate=4 September 2009|isbn=9783540436775|author1=Sander|first1=Tomas|date=26 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asus]] released a soundcard which features a function called "Analog Loopback Transformation" to bypass the restrictions of DRM. This feature allows the user to record DRM-restricted audio via the soundcard's built-in analog I/O connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/computex-2007-asus-showcases-new-generation-audio-card.32449/|title=Computex 2007: ASUS Showcases New Generation Audio Card|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=www.techpowerup.com|date=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/121497/asus-xonar-d2.html|title=PC Pro Product Reviews Asus Xonar D2|publisher=Pcpro.co.uk|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent this exploit, there has been some discussions between copyright holders and manufacturers of electronics capable of playing such content to no longer include analog connectivity in their devices.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The movement, dubbed as "Analog Sunset", has seen a steady decline in analog output options on most [[Blu-ray]] devices manufactured after 2010.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===General computing platforms===
Many of the DRM systems in use are designed to work on general purpose computing hardware, such as desktop PCs, apparently because this equipment is felt to be a major contributor to revenue loss from disallowed copying.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Large commercial copyright infringers avoid consumer equipment,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} so losses from such infringers will not be covered by such provisions.

Such schemes, especially software based ones, can never be wholly secure since the software must include all the information necessary to decrypt the content, such as the [[Key (cryptography)|decryption keys]]. An attacker will be able to extract this information, directly decrypt and copy the content, which bypasses the restrictions imposed by a DRM system.&lt;ref name="Doctorow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changethis.com/4.DRM|format=PDF|title=Microsoft Research DRM Talk|first=Cory|last=Doctorow|authorlink=Cory Doctorow|quote=At the end of the day, all DRM systems share a common vulnerability: they provide their attackers with ciphertext, the cipher and the key. At this point, the secret isn't a secret anymore.|date=17 June 2004|accessdate=17 August 2007|publisher=craphound.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose-built hardware===
Many DRM schemes use encrypted media which requires purpose-built hardware to hear or see the content. This appears to ensure that only licensed users (those with the hardware) can access the content. It additionally tries to protect a secret decryption key from the users of the system.

While this in principle can work, it is extremely difficult to build the hardware to protect the secret key against a sufficiently determined adversary. Many such systems have failed in the field. Once the secret key is known, building a version of the hardware that performs no checks is often relatively straightforward. In addition user verification provisions are frequently subject to attack, [[pirate decryption]] being among the most frequented ones.

A common real-world example can be found in commercial [[direct broadcast satellite]] television systems such as [[DirecTV]] and Malaysia's [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]]. The company uses tamper-resistant [[smart card]]s to store decryption keys so that they are hidden from the user and the satellite receiver.

===Watermarks===
[[Digital watermarking|Watermarks]] can often be removed, although degradation of video or audio can occur.

===Undecrypted copying failure===
Mass redistribution of hard copies does not necessarily need DRM to be decrypted or removed, as it can be achieved by bit-perfect copying of a legally obtained medium without accessing the decrypted content. Additionally, still-encrypted [[disk image]]s can be distributed over the Internet and played on legitimately licensed players.

===Obsolescence===
When standards and formats change, it may be difficult to transfer DRM-restricted content to new media, for instance Microsoft's new media player [[Zune]] did not support content that uses Microsoft's own [[PlaysForSure]] DRM scheme they had previously been selling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/09/19/1342256|title=Zune Won't Play Old DRM Infected Files|date=19 September 2006|accessdate=19 September 2007|publisher=slashdot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, any system that requires contact with an authentication server is vulnerable to that server's becoming unavailable, as happened in 2007, when videos purchased from [[Major League Baseball]] (mlb.com) prior to 2006, became unplayable due to a change to the servers that validate the licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/07/2014253|title=MLB Fans Who Bought DRM Videos Get Hosed|date=7 November 2007|accessdate=8 November 2007|publisher=slashdot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, when a company undergoes business adjustment or even bankrupt, its legacy service may become unavailable. Examples include MSN Music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080422-drm-sucks-redux-microsoft-to-nuke-msn-music-drm-keys.html|title=DRM sucks redux: Microsoft to nuke MSN Music DRM keys|date=22 April 2008|accessdate=22 April 2008|publisher=Ars Technica|first=Jacqui|last=Cheng}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Yahoo!

===Environmental issues===
DRM can accelerate hardware obsolescence, turning it into [[electronic waste]] sooner:

* DRM-related restrictions on capabilities of hardware can artificially reduce the range of potential uses of the device (to the point of making a device consisting of general-purpose components usable only for a purpose approved, or with “content” provided, by the vendor), limit [[upgrade]]ability and repairability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2012/comments/James_Evans_Turner.pdf Copyright.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_2012_dmca_letter_final.pdf Ntia.doc.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Cf. [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[abandonware]], [[orphan works]], [[planned obsolescence]]. Examples:
** [[DVD region code]] (applies to discs as well as DVD players and drives);
** the removal of the [[OtherOS]] feature from Sony PlayStation 3 game consoles;
** [[Tivoization]], [[UEFI Secure Boot]] and similar.
* Users may be forced to buy new devices for compatibility with DRM (i.e., through having to upgrade an operating system to one with different hardware requirements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/924|title="Wow starts now"? Software Freedom Activists Stand Up To VISTA Launch|last1=Heller|first1=Gregory|date=26 January 2007|work=Defective By Design.org|publisher=Free Software Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral and legitimacy implications===
According to the EFF, "in an effort to attract customers, these music services try to obscure the restrictions they impose on you with clever marketing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/customer-always-wrong-users-guide-drm-online-music|title=The Customer Is Always Wrong|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DRM laws are widely flouted: according to Australia Official Music Chart Survey, copyright infringements from all causes are practised by millions of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/CurrentIssueInternetMusicFileSharingCDBurning.htm|title=Australia Recording industry Association Survey, 2003|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relaxing some forms of DRM can be beneficial===
Jeff Raikes, ex-president of the Microsoft Business Division, stated: "If they're going to pirate somebody, we want it to be us rather than somebody else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2007/03/microsoft-executive-pirating-software-choose-microsoft.ars |title=Microsoft executive: Pirating software? Choose Microsoft!|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous argument was made in an early paper by Kathleen Conner and Richard Rummelt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Software Piracy: An Analysis of Protection Strategies|author=Conner, Kathleen and Richard Rummelt |journal=Management Science|volume=37|year=1991|jstor=2632386|issue=2|doi=10.1287/mnsc.37.2.125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study of digital rights management for e-books by [[Gal Oestreicher-Singer]] and [[Arun Sundararajan]] showed that relaxing some forms of DRM can be beneficial to digital rights holders because the losses from piracy are outweighed by the increases in value to legal buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2004/42/|title=Are Digital Rights Valuable? Theory and Evidence from the eBook Industry|author=Oestreicher-Singer, Gal and Arun Sundararajan|work=Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, free distribution, even if unauthorized, can be beneficial to small or new content providers by spreading and popularizing content and therefore generating a larger consumer base by sharing and word of mouth. Several musicians have grown to popularity by posting their music videos on sites like YouTube where the content is free to listen to. This method of putting the product out in the world free of DRM not only generates a greater following but also fuels greater revenue through other merchandise (hats, T-shirts), concert tickets, and of course, more sales of the content to paying consumers.

===Can increase infringement===
While the main intent of DRM is to prevent unauthorized copies of a product, there are mathematical models that suggest that DRM schemes can fail to do their job on multiple levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music Downloads and the Flip Side of Digital Rights Management|url=http://static.arstechnica.net/2011/10/11/mksc.1110.0668-1.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2012|author=Dinah A. Vernik|author2=Devavrat Purohit |author3=Preyas S. Desai |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest failure that can result from DRM is that they have a potential to increase the infringement rate of a product. This goes against the held belief that DRM can always reduce unauthorized distribution. There also seems to be evidence that DRM will reduce profits.

The driving factor behind this is related to how many restrictions DRM imposes on a legal buyer. An ideal DRM would be one which imposes zero restrictions on legal buyers but makes imposing restrictions on infringers. Even if an ideal DRM can be created and used, in certain cases, it can be shown that removing the DRM will result in less unauthorized copying. For the ideal DRM, the reason why profits can increase is because of the demand is elastic. When there are more people legally buying and few people sharing the product, more profits are going to be made.

The mathematical models are strictly applied to the music industry (music CDs, downloadable music). These models could be extended to the other industries such as the gaming industry which show similarities to the music industry model. There are real instances when DRM restrain consumers in the gaming industry. Some DRM games are required to connect to the Internet in order to play them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|title=Ubisoft DRM games to be temporarily unplayable|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/ubisoft-drm-games-to-be-temporarily-unplayable-6349732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Good Old Games]]' head of public relations and marketing, Trevor Longino, in agreement with this, believes that using DRM is less effective than improving a game's value in reducing video game infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobra|first=Andrei|title=DRM Doesn't Stop Piracy, Game Content Does, Good Old Games Believes|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/DRM-Doesn-t-Stop-Piracy-Game-Content-Does-Good-Old-Games-Believes-237641.shtml|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, TorrentFreak published a "Top 10 pirated games of 2008" list which shows that intrusive DRM is not the main reason why some games are copied more heavily than others. Popular games such as BioShock, Crysis Warhead, and Mass Effect which use intrusive DRM are strangely absent from the list.&lt;ref name="Tweakguides: PC Game Piracy Examined: Page 4" /&gt;

==Alternatives==
Several business models have been proposed that offer an alternative to the use of DRM by content providers and rights holders.&lt;ref name="infrastructure2000"&gt;Committee on Intellectual Property Rights in the Emerging Information Infrastructure, National Research Council. (2000) "The Digital Dilemma: Intellectual Property in the Information Age." 3 May 2011. http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9601#toc&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Easy and cheap"===
The first business model that dissuades illegal file sharing is to make downloading digital media easy and cheap. The use of noncommercial sites makes downloading digital media complex. For example, misspelling an artist's name in a search query will often fail to return a result, and some sites limit internet traffic, which can make downloading media a long and frustrating process. Furthermore, illegal file sharing websites are often host to viruses and malware which attach themselves to the files (see [[torrent poisoning]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2014/04/30/surprise-surprise-almost-every-piracy-website-features-cyber-scams/|title=Surprise, surprise – almost every piracy website features cyber scams|work=BetaNews|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If digital media (for example, songs) are all provided on accessible, legitimate sites, and are reasonably priced, consumers will purchase media legally to overcome these frustrations.&lt;ref name="infrastructure2000"/&gt;

Comedian [[Louis C.K.]] made headlines in 2011, with the release of his [[concert film]] ''[[Live at the Beacon Theater]]'' as an inexpensive (US$5), DRM-free download. The only attempt to deter unlicensed copies was a letter emphasizing the lack of corporate involvement and direct relationship between artist and viewer. The film was a commercial success, turning a profit within 12 hours of its release. Some, including the artist himself, have suggested that file sharing rates were lower than normal as a result, making the release an important case study for the digital marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buy.louisck.net/news/a-statement-from-louis-c-k|title=Louis CK: Live at the Beacon Theater|publisher=Buy.louisck.net|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-12-14/what-louis-c-dot-k-dot-knows-that-most-media-companies-dont|title=What Louis C.K.

Webcomic [[Diesel Sweeties]] released a DRM-free PDF e-book on author R Stevens's 35th birthday,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-57359936-264/a-new-drm-free-experiment-diesel-sweeties/|title=A New DRM-free Experiment: Diesel Sweeties|publisher=news.cnet.com|date=17 January 2012|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselsweeties.com/ebooks//|title=Diesel Sweeties Webcomics Ebook|publisher=www.dieselsweeties.com|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2012/01/17/free-pdf-of-the-first-diesel-s.html|title=Free PDF of the first Diesel Sweeties comic collection|publisher=boingboing.net|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to more than 140,000 downloads in the first month, according to Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dieselsweeties/diesel-sweeties-ebook-stravaganza-3000|title=Diesel Sweeties eBook-Stravaganza 3000 by Richard Stevens – Kickstarter|publisher=Kickstarter.com|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with a DRM-free iBook specifically for the iPad, using Apple's new software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselsweeties.com/blog/?p=737|title=An Experiment in iBookery|publisher=dieselsweeties.com|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which generated more than 10,000 downloads in three days.&lt;ref name="dieselsweeties740"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselsweeties.com/blog/?p=740|title=iBooks Follow-up|publisher=dieselsweeties.com|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That led Stevens to launch a [[Kickstarter]] project – "ebook stravaganza 3000" – to fund the conversion of 3,000 comics, written over 12 years, into a single "humongous" e-book to be released both for free and through the iBookstore; launched 8 February 2012, with the goal of raising $3,000 in 30 days, the project met its goal in 45 minutes, and went on to be funded at more than 10 times its original goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dieselsweeties/diesel-sweeties-ebook-stravaganza-3000|title=Diesel Sweeties eBook-Stravaganza 3000|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "payment optional" DRM-free model in this case was adopted on Stevens' view that "there is a class of webcomics reader who would prefer to read in large chunks and, even better, would be willing to spend a little money on it."&lt;ref name="dieselsweeties740"/&gt;

===Crowdfunding or pre-order model===
In February 2012, [[Double Fine]] asked for an upcoming video game, ''[[Double Fine Adventure]]'', for [[crowdfunding]] on [[kickstarter.com]] and offered the game DRM-free for backers. This project exceeded its original goal of $400,000 in 45 days, raising in excess of $2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure|title=Double Fine Adventure|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/double_fines_adventure_game_will_be_drm_free_for_backers.html|title=Double Fine's adventure game will be DRM free for backers|publisher=videogamer.com|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case DRM freedom was offered to backers as an incentive for supporting the project before release, with the consumer and community support and media attention from the highly successful Kickstarter drive counterbalancing {{citation needed span|any loss through file sharing.|date=June 2013}} Also, crowdfunding with the product itself as benefit for the supporters can be seen as [[pre-order]] or [[Subscription (finance)|subscription business model]] in which one motivation for DRM, the uncertainty if a product will have enough paying customers to outweigh the development costs, is eliminated. After the success of ''Double Fine Adventure'', many games were crowd-funded and many of them offered a DRM-free game version for the backers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2259790/drmfree-torment-is-the-most-richly-backed-game-on-kickstarter drmfree-torment-is-the-most-richly-backed-game-on-kickstarter] on theinquirer.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techspot.com/news/51884-civitas-the-drm-free-alternative-to-simcity-hits-kickstarter.html civitas-the-drm-free-alternative-to-simcity-hits-kickstarter] on techspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/93169/kitaru-kickstarter-supporters-get-drm-free-copy-of-the-game/ Kitaru Kickstarter supporters get DRM-free copy of the game] on technologytell.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital content as promotion for traditional products===
Many artists are using the Internet to give away music to create awareness and liking to a new upcoming album. The artists release a new song on the internet for free download, which consumers can download. The hope is to have the listeners buy the new album because of the free download.&lt;ref name="infrastructure2000"/&gt; A common practice used today is releasing a song or two on the internet for consumers to indulge. In 2007, Radiohead released an album named in Rainbows, in which fans could pay any amount they want, or download it for free.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, Angela. (2007). "Radiohead Challenges Labels With Free Album." Web. 10 May 2011. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2816893/Radiohead-challenges-labels-with-free-album.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic Freedom Voucher===
The Artistic Freedom Voucher (AFV) introduced by Dean Baker is a way for consumers to support “creative and artistic work.” In this system, each consumer would have a refundable tax credit of $100 to give to any artist of creative work. To restrict fraud, the artists must register with the government. The voucher prohibits any artist that receives the benefits from copyrighting their material for a certain length of time. Consumers can obtain music for a certain amount of time easily and the consumer decides which artists receive the $100. The money can either be given to one artist or to many, the distribution is up to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dean. (2003). "The Artistic Freedom Voucher: An Internet Age Alternative to Copyrights." Pg. 2–8. Web. 3 May. 2011. http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/ip_2003_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past plants and animals have persisted through long periods of climate change including several [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial and interglacial periods]]. There is a long-standing debate on what  happened to the species that were inhabiting high-latitidue regions during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]. Two main scenarios are usually considered. The first scenario proposes a total extinction of species within glaciated areas with  survival events in peripheral [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] in the south and successive massive postglacial migration into empty areas ([[tabula rasa hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second scenario proposes long-term in situ survival within glaciated regions (glacial survival hypothesis), either in isolated northern ice-free micro-refugia at the edge of the ice sheet, or on exposed mountains not covered with ice within the [[ice sheet]] ([[nunatak]] hypothesis).

For boreal and cold-tolerant species the glacial survival hypothesis is credible, though controversial &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tzedakis|first=P.C.|last2=Emerson|first2=B.C.|last3=Hewitt|first3=G.M.|date=2013-12-01|title=Cryptic or mystic?

{{Linguistics}}
'''Graphemics''' or '''graphematics''' is the linguistic study of [[writing system]]s and their basic components, i.e. [[grapheme]]s.

At the beginning of the development of this area of linguistics, [[Ignace Gelb]] coined the term ''[[grammatology]]'' for this discipline; later some scholars suggested calling it ''[[graphology]]''&lt;ref&gt;Used in this sense e.g. in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, second edition, Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; to match ''[[phonology]]'', but that name is traditionally used for a pseudo-science. Others therefore suggested renaming the study of language-dependent pronunciation ''[[phonemics]]'' or ''[[phonematics]]'' instead, but this did not gain widespread acceptance either, so the terms ''graphemics'' and ''graphematics'' became more frequent.

Graphemics examines the specifics of written texts in a certain language and their correspondence to the spoken language. One major task is the [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive analysis]] of implicit regularities in written words and texts (''graphotactics'') to formulate explicit rules (''[[orthography]]'') for the writing system that can be used in [[prescriptive linguistics|prescriptive education]] or in [[computer linguistics]], e.g. for [[speech synthesis]].

In analogy to [[phoneme]] and ([[allophone|allo]])[[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] in [[phonology]], the graphic units of language are graphemes, i.e. language-specific [[character (symbol)|character]]s, and [[grapheme|graph]]s, i.e. language-specific [[glyph]]s. Different schools of thought consider different entities to be graphemes; major points of divergence are the handling of [[punctuation]], [[diacritic mark]]s, [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s or other [[multigraph (orthography)|multigraph]]s and non-[[alphabet]]ic [[writing system|scripts]].

analogous to [[phonetics]], the "[[emic and etic|etic]]" counterpart of graphemics is called [[graphetics]] and deals with the material side only (including [[paleography]], [[typography]] and [[graphology]]).

==Graphotactics==
'''Graphotactics''' refers to rules which restrict the allowable sequences of letters in alphabetic languages.&lt;ref&gt;Carney, Edward. {{Google books|sceZ5XcqSfIC|A Survey of English Spelling|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example is the partially correct "[[I before E except after C]]". However, there are exceptions, for example Edward Carney in his book, ''A Survey of English Spelling'', refers to the "I before E except after C” rule instead as an example of a “phonotactic rule”.&lt;ref&gt;Carney, Edward.{{Google books|sceZ5XcqSfIC|A Survey of English Spelling|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Graphotactical rules are useful in [[error detection]] by [[optical character recognition]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Nylander|first=Stina|title=Statistics and Graphotactical Rules in Finding OCR-errors|citeseerx = 10.1.1.140.9712|work=Language Engineering Programme, Department of Linguistics|publisher=Uppsala University|accessdate=&lt;!-- 22 October 2012 --&gt;|date=14 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies of [[Old English]], "graphotactics" is also used to refer to the variable-length spacing between words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevick|first=Robert|title=Graphotactics of the Old English 'Alexander's Letter to Aristotle' |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Graphotactics+of+the+Old+English+'Alexander's+Letter+to+Aristotle'.-a0125953277|publisher=The Free Library|accessdate=22 October 2012|location=University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hassānīya''' ({{lang-ar|حسانية}}  &lt;!--{{rtl-lang|ar|''' موريتانية '''}} is the Arabic form of Mauritania's Arabic dialect--&gt;''{{transl|ar|Ḥassānīya}}''; also known as ''Hassaniyya'', ''Klem El Bithan'', ''Hasanya'', ''Hassani'', ''Hassaniya'') is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of [[Maghrebi Arabic]]. It was spoken by the [[Beni Ḥassān]] [[Bedouin]] tribes, who extended their authority over most of [[Mauritania]] and [[Morocco]]'s southeastern and [[Western Sahara]] between the 15th and 17th centuries. Hassaniya Arabic was the language spoken in the pre-modern region around [[Chinguetti]].

The language has now almost completely replaced the [[Berber languages]] that were originally spoken in this region. Although clearly a western dialect, Hassānīya is relatively distant from other Maghrebi variants of Arabic. Its geographical location exposed it to influence from [[Zenaga language|Zenaga-Berber]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]]. There are several dialects of Hassānīya which differ primarily phonetically. Today, Hassānīya is spoken in [[Algeria]], [[Libya]], [[Morocco]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Senegal]] and the [[Western Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
The phonological system of Hassānīya is both very innovative and very conservative. All phonemes of [[Classical Arabic]] are represented in the dialect, but there are also many new phonemes. As in other [[Varieties of Arabic#Sedentary vs. Bedouin|Bedouin dialects]], Classical /q/ corresponds mostly to dialectal {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/dˤ/}} and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} have merged into {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} and the interdentals {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} have been preserved. In common with most Maghrebi Arabic varieties, the letter ج (j) is realised as {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.

However, there is sometimes a double correspondence of a classical sound and its dialectal counterpart. Thus classical {{IPA|/q/}} is represented by {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in {{IPA|/ɡbaðˤ/}} 'to take' but by {{IPA|/q/}} in {{IPA|/mqass/}} 'scissors'. Similarly, {{IPA|/dˤ/}} becomes {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} in {{IPA|/ðˤəħk/}} 'laugh (noun)', but {{IPA|/dˤ/}} in {{IPA|/mrˤədˤ/}} 'to be sick'. Some consonant roots even have a double appearance: {{IPA|/θaqiːl/}} 'heavy (mentally)' vs. {{IPA|/θɡiːl/}} 'heavy (materially)'. Some of the "classicizing" forms are easily explained as recent loans from the literary language (such as {{IPA|/qaː.nuːn/}} 'law') or from sedentary dialects in case of concepts pertaining to the sedentary way of life (such as {{IPA|/mqass/}} 'scissors' above). For others, there is no obvious explanation (like {{IPA|/mrˤədˤ/}} 'to be sick'). Etymological {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} appears constantly as {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}, never as {{IPA|/dˤ/}}.

Nevertheless, the phonemic status of {{IPA|/q/}} and {{IPA|/dˤ/}} as well as {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} appears very stable, unlike in many other Arabic varieties.  Somewhat similarly, classical {{IPA|/ʔ/}} has in most contexts disappeared or turned into {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} ({{IPA|/ahl/}} 'family' instead of {{IPA|/ʔahl/}}, {{IPA|/wak.kad/}} 'insist' instead of {{IPA|/ʔak.kad/}} and {{IPA|/jaː.məs/}} 'yesterday' instead of {{IPA|/ʔams/}}). In some literary terms, however, it is clearly preserved: {{IPA|/mət.ʔal.lam/}} 'suffering (participle)' (classical {{IPA|/mu.ta.ʔal.lim/}}).

Hassānīya has innovated many consonants by the spread of the distinction ''emphatic/non-emphatic''. In addition to the above-mentioned, {{IPA|/rˤ/}} and {{IPA|/lˤ/}} have a clear phonemic status and {{IPA|/bˤ fˤ ɡˤ mˤ nˤ/}} more marginally so. One additional emphatic phoneme {{IPA|/zˤ/}} is acquired from the neighbouring [[Zenaga language|Zenaga Berber language]] along with a whole palatal series {{IPA|/c ɟ ɲ/}} from [[Niger–Congo languages]] of the south. At least some speakers make the distinction /p/–/b/ through borrowings from [[French language|French]] (and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in Western Sahara). All in all, the number of consonant phonemes in Hassānīya is 33, or 39 counting the marginal cases.

On the phonetic level, the classical consonants {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}} are usually realised as voiced {{IPA|[v]}} (hereafter marked {{IPA|/v/}}) and {{IPA|[θ̬]}}. The latter is still, however, pronounced differently from {{IPA|/ð/}}, the distinction probably being in the amount of air blown out (Cohen 1963: 13–14). In geminated and word-final positions both phonemes are voiceless, for some speakers /θ/ apparently in all positions. The uvular fricative {{IPA|/ʁ/}} is likewise realised voiceless in a geminated position, although not fricative but plosive: {{IPA|[qː]}}. In other positions, etymological {{IPA|/ʁ/}} seems to be in free variation with {{IPA|/q/}} (etymological {{IPA|/q/}}, however varies only with {{IPA|/ɡ/}}).

Vowel phonemes come in two series: long and short. The long vowels are the same as in [[Classical Arabic]] {{IPA|/aː iː uː/}}, and the short ones extend this by one: {{IPA|/a i u ə/}}. The classical diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} may be realised in many different ways, the most usual variants being {{IPA|[eːʲ]}} and {{IPA|[oːʷ]}}, respectively. Still, realisations like {{IPA|[aj]}} and {{IPA|[aw]}} as well as {{IPA|[eː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} are possible, although less common.

As in most Maghrebi Arabic dialects, etymological short vowels are generally dropped in [[Syllable#Structure|open syllables]] (except for the feminine noun ending {{IPA|/-a/}}): {{IPA|*/tak.tu.biː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/tə.ktbi/}} 'you (f. sg.) write', {{IPA|*/ka.ta.ba/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ka.tab/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ktəb/}} 'he wrote'. In the remaining closed syllables dialectal /a/ generally corresponds to classical {{IPA|/a/}}, while classical {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} have merged into {{IPA|/ə/}}. Remarkably, however, morphological {{IPA|/j/}} is represented by {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|/w/}} by {{IPA|[u]}} in a word-initial pre-consonantal position: {{IPA|/u.ɡəft/}} 'I stood up' (root ''w-g-f''; cf. {{IPA|/ktəbt/}} 'I wrote', root ''k-t-b''), {{IPA|/i.naɡ.ɡaz/}} 'he descends' (subject prefix ''i-''; cf. {{IPA|/jə.ktəb/}} 'he writes', subject prefix ''jə-''). In some contexts this initial vowel even gets lengthened, which clearly demonstrates its phonological status of a vowel: {{IPA|/uːɡ.vu/}} 'they stood up'. In addition, short vowels {{IPA|/a i/}} in open syllables are found in Berber loanwords, such as {{IPA|/a.raː.ɡaːʒ/}} 'man', {{IPA|/i.vuː.kaːn/}} 'calves of 1 to 2 years of age', and {{IPA|/u/}} in passive formation: {{IPA|/u.ɡaː.bəl/}} 'he was met' (cf. {{IPA|/ɡaː.bəl/}} 'he met').

==Code-switching==
Many educated Hassaniya Arabic speakers also practice [[code-switching]]. In Western Sahara it is common for code-switching to occur between Hassaniya Arabic, [[Modern Standard Arabic]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as [[Spain]] had [[Spanish Sahara|previously controlled this region]]; in the rest of Hassaniya-speaking lands, French is the additional language spoken, except Libya, where Italian is spoken by educated speakers.

==Speakers distribution==
According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are approximately three million Hassaniya speakers, distributed as follows:

'''Healing the deaf mute of Decapolis''' is one of the [[miracles of Jesus in the Gospels]], namely Mark 7:31-37.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207:31-37&amp;version=TNIV |title=Biblegateway Mark 7:31-37 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its narration offers many parallels with the [[The Blind Man of Bethsaida|healing of the blind man of Bethsaida]] in Mark 8:22-26.

According to the [[Gospel of Mark]], when Jesus entered the region of the [[Decapolis]] after passing through Sidon and down the [[Sea of Galilee]], some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. This account follows the [[Exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter|healing]] of the daughter of a [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Syro-Phoenician]] woman who speaks with Jesus about whether his mission extends to the [[gentile]]s (Mark 7:24-30). The deaf-mute man lives in the gentile Decapolis region, although the text does not specify that he is a gentile. The Gospel of Mark states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. 34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "[[Ephphatha]]!" (which means "Be opened!"). 35 At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[New Testament]] commentator Lamar Williamson writes that this is the last unit in a series of miracles concerned with the identity of Jesus, as subsequently confirmed by the [[Apostle Peter]]'s [[christological]] affirmation in Mark 8:29, where Peter exclaimed: "You are the Messiah".&lt;ref&gt;Lamar Williamson (1983), ''Mark'' {{ISBN|0-8042-3121-4}} pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Heciyê Cindî''' (sometimes spelled '''Hajiye Jndi'''; 1908&amp;ndash;1990) was a [[Yazidi]] linguist and researcher.

Cindî was born into a [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] family in the village of [[Emençayîr]] near [[Kars]]. During [[World War I]] and [[Turkish–Armenian War|Turkish]] and Soviet invasions, his family fled to [[Armenia]] and settled in the village of [[Elegez]]. Later on, he lost all his family (except for one brother) to disease and massacre. In 1919, he stayed in the American [[orphanage]] in [[Alexandropol]], and in 1926 was transferred to the orphanage in [[Leninakan]], [[Armenia]].

During 1929-30, Cindî taught in the villages of [[Qundexsaz]] and Elegez, and was head of the cultural section of the Kurdish newspaper ''[[Riya Teze]]'' in 1930. He also worked as a [[news anchor]] in the Kurdish section of [[International Public Radio of Armenia|Radio Yerevan]]. In 1933, he joined the [[Writers Union of Armenia]] and attended the meeting of the [[Soviet Writers Congress]]  the following year. In 1937, during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s purges, he was imprisoned on March 18, 1937 on charges of spying, nationalism, being a Yezidi and helping counter-revolutionaries. After one year, several Armenian intellectuals campaigned for his release and he was pardoned, but was not allowed to work; however, with [[Alexander Alexandrovich Fadeyev|Alexander Fadeyev]]'s help and support, he was able to resume his literary work.

In 1940, Cindî received his [[PhD]] in [[Kurdish folklore]], and in 1941 the [[Government of Armenia|Armenian government]], put him in charge of changing [[Kurdish alphabet]] from [[Latin script|Latin]] to [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. The new alphabet was approved and published in 1946, and it was used in Kurdish education in Armenia, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and several [[Central Asia]]n republics. In 1959, he was employed in the Oriental department of [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], where he headed the [[Kurdology]] section for the next eight years.

In 1940 and 1952 his book ''Kurdish Fairy Tales'' was published in Armenian, in 1959 in Kurdish (''Һ’ьк’йа̄тед щьмаә’тә к’ӧрдие'').

From 1968 to 1974, Cindî taught Kurdish literature and language at the Oriental Faculty of the [[University of Yerevan]]. He wrote and translated many books, among them 15 books on folklore and literature, 33 textbooks for schools, 19 translations and 7 books in [[pedagogy]].

'''Jesús Padilla Gálvez''' (xe'sus pa'ðiʎa 'ɣalβeθ)&lt;ref&gt;In Spain people traditionally have two family names: the first family name is the paternal one (Padilla), inherited from the father's paternal family name, while the second family name is the maternal one (Gálvez), inherited from the mother's paternal family name. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, (also "Padilla") although both are needed for legal purpose.&lt;/ref&gt; (born October 28, 1959) is a [[philosopher]] who worked primarily in [[philosophy of language]], [[logic]], and the [[history of sciences]].

==Professional biography==

Jesús Padilla Gálvez studied Philosophy, History and Mathematics at the [[University of Cologne]] (Germany) and was awarded the M.A. in 1983 and a Dr. phil. in [[Philosophy]] in 1988. He was Research Assistant (1988–1991) at the [[University of Murcia]] (Spain) and later held the post of Associate Professor (1992–1994) for [[Logic]] and [[Philosophy of Language]] at the [[University of León]] (Spain). From 1994 to 1999 he was Visiting Professor at the [[Johannes Kepler University]] in Linz (Austria). Since 1999 he has been Professor at the [[University of Castilla-La Mancha]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (Spain). He has held visiting posts at the Universities of [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] (Germany), [[University of Graz]] (Austria), [[University of Potsdam]] (Germany), [[University of Cambridge]] (United Kingdom), [[University of Munich]] (Germany), [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Oxford]] (United Kingdom). As director of the international scientific journal [[Dókos. Revista Filosófica - Philosophical Review]] (published in Ápeiron Ediciones (Madrid)&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/revista?codigo=23685]&lt;/ref&gt; and editor of the international series "Aporia / Aπορία" (De Gruyter)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/207890 Aporia / Aπορία, De Gruyter]&lt;/ref&gt; the author is continuously engaged with highly relevant philosophical topics.

==Philosophical views==

In his doctoral thesis, Padilla Gálvez examined central issues of analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Referenz und Theorie der möglichen Welten'' (Peter Lang, Frankfurt a.M, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent investigations are characterized by an application of the analytic method to the study of philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Runggaldier]], Analytische Sprachphilosophie. Stuttgart-Berlin-Köln: Kohlhammer, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method involves both, the analysis of language to eliminate ambiguity as well as a profound scrutiny of the logical form of philosophical propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Phenomenology as Grammar'' (Ontos Verlag, Frankfurt a. M., Paris, Lancaster, New Brunswick, 2008). 2nd Edition: ''Phenomenology as Grammar'' (De Gruyter, Berlin, 2013). Transl. Portuguese: ''Fenomenologia como gramática'' (Editora Universidade de Brasília, Brasília, 2011). ''Reflexionando acerca de la gramática filosófica'' (Areté. Revista de filosofía, 2012, Vol. XXIV, Nr 2, pp. 323-349.)&lt;/ref&gt; Padilla Galvez's work may be classified into five lines of investigation: philosophy of language, logic, philosophy of history of science, social changes in democratic systems and language for specific purposes (LSP). He was dealing with the works of [[Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf.: ''Identität und Selbigkeit. Ontologische Interpretation der Leibnizschen Individuen'' (V. Internationaler Leibniz Kongress Leibniz Tradition und Aktualität, Ed. A. Heinekamp, Hannover, 1988, pp. 685 692); ''Las lógicas modales en confrontación con los conceptos básicos de la lógica modal de G. W. Leibniz'' (Theoria, 1991, Vol. 14-15, pp. 115-127); ''Die Leibnizsche Behandlung kontrafaktischer Bedingungssätze'' (Leibniz und Europa. VI. Internationaler Leibniz Kongreß. Hannover, 1994, pp. 565-572); ''Teoría de los mundos posibles e identidad'' (Analogía y expresión en Leibniz, Madrid, 1992, 103-109); ''Modalisatoren und mögliche Welten in den logisch-semantischen Untersuchungen um 1686'' (Nihil sine ratione. VII. Internationaler Leibniz-Kongreß, Ed. Hans Poser, Berlin, 2001, pp. 926-933); ''Die Setzung der Einheit. Einheit in der Vielheit'' (VIII. Internationaler Leibniz-Kongress. Hannover, 2005, pp. 757-763); ''La teoría de los condicionales contrafácticos propuesta por Luis de Molina y la respuesta de G. W. Leibniz'' (Estudios Filosóficos, LVIII, 2009, pp. 333-346).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf: Bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Saul Kripke]], among others. Padilla Gálvez is recognized as one of the leading experts of Ludwig Wittgenstein´s philosophy in the English&lt;ref&gt;Cf.: ''Wittgenstein, from a New Point of View'' (Peter Lang, Frankfurt a. M., 2003); ''Phenomenology as Grammar'' (Ontos Verlag, Frankfurt a.M., 2008); ''Philosophical Anthropology.

'''John Abraham''' (11 August 1937&amp;nbsp;– 31 May 1987) was a [[Malayali]] Indian filmmaker, short story writer and screenwriter. 

Abraham is ranked among the greatest Indian film directors. His film ''[[Amma Ariyan]]'' (1986) was the only south Indian feature film to make the list of "Top 10 Indian Films" of all time by [[British Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Indian Films|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2002|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/imagineasia/guide/poll/india|accessdate=12 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515101729/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/imagineasia/guide/poll/india/|archivedate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agraharathil Kazhuthai'' was listed among the "100 Greatest Indian Films" of all time by [[IBN Live]]'s 2013 poll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mayabazar-is-indias-greatest-film-ever-ibnlive-poll/391184-8-66.html "'Mayabazar' is India's greatest film ever"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6W5lwHhfU?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20150204142913/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mayabazar-is-indias-greatest-film-ever-ibnlive-poll/391184-8-66.html |date=4 February 2015 }}.

John Abraham was born in  [[Chennamkary]], [[Kuttanadu]] in 1937. He is from the Vazhakkat branch, [[Chennamkary]] of the [[Pattamukkil family|Pattamukkil Family]].&lt;ref name=birth1&gt;{{cite book|title=John Abraham|editor=K. N. Shaji|year=2011|publisher=Chintha Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birth2/&gt; He completed his intermediate studies in C.M.S, College, at [[Kottayam]] staying with his grandfather, who nurtured Abraham's talent in early days. After completing his degree in [history and politics] from [http://www.marthomacollege.org/ Marthoma College], [[Thiruvalla]], he worked as a private college teacher and latter he joined as an [[office assistant]] with [[Life Insurance Corporation of India]] in [[Udupi]], Karnataka.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} After that he joined the [[Film and Television Institute of India|FTII]], [[Pune]] and there he met film-makers such as [[Ritwik Ghatak]] and [[Mani Kaul]]. Abraham graduated out of the [[Film and Television Institute of India|FTII]] with gold medals in screenwriting and film direction. He entered the film industry working as an [[assistant director]] to Mani Kaul for the film ''[[Uski Roti]]'' (1969, Hindi).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He has worked for some [[Hindi]] projects that was shot in [[Kerala]], but none were released. Abraham's first attempt in direction came in 1967 named ''[[Vidyarthikale Ithile Ithile]]''. It was the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film ''[[Agraharathil Kazhuthai]]'' (1977) that gave Abraham recognition.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Career in film direction==
He completed only four films, namely ''[[Vidyarthikale Ithile Ithile]]'' (1972), ''[[Agraharathil Kazhuthai]]'' (1977, Tamil), ''[[Cheriyachante Kroorakrithyangal|Cheriachante Krurakrithyangal]]'' (1979, [[Malayalam]]) and ''[[Amma Ariyan]]'' (1986, [[Malayalam]]).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Odessa Collective==
Under Abraham the ''Odessa Collective'' came into existence in 1984 with a street drama in [[Fort Kochi]] named ''Nayakali'' (The game of dogs). ''Odessa'' was an attempt by a group of movie enthusiasts to change the history of film production and distribution by making it a collaborative effort with the public and thus act as an empowering and liberating medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/culture-cauldron/John-Abraham-New-Indian-Cinemas-most-creative-representative/articleshow/3091515.cms?curpg=3 ''Economic Times of India'': John Abraham: New Indian Cinema's most creative representative]&lt;/ref&gt; For the financing of the first film produced by Odessa, Abraham and his friends travelled through villages and collected money from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofmalayalam.net/john.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119082938/http://www.cinemaofmalayalam.net/john.html |archivedate=19 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Odessa also collected funds for the film by screening [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''. The film, ''[[Amma Ariyan]]'' (Report to mother) (1986) was exhibited across the state of [[Kerala]] on a non-commercial basis,&lt;ref&gt;http://india.gov.in/knowindia/art_kerala_cinema.php&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative kept alive, after Abraham's death, by his colleague and co-founder of Odessa Collective, [[Odessa Sathyan]].&lt;ref name="Mathrubhumi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mathrubhuminews.in/ee/ReadMore/9203/noted-documentary-filmmaker-odessa-sathyan-dies/E | title=Mathrubhumi | publisher=Mathrubhumi | work=Article and video | date=19 August 2014 | accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started shooting a documentary based on the life of [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]], but never completed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sahapedia.org/john-abraham-and-the-socio-political-contexts-of-new-cinema-kerala |title=John Abraham and the Socio-Political Contexts of New Cinema in Kerala |date=2018-06-08 |website=[[sahapedia]] |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media called him ''Ottayan'' (The Lone [[Elephant|Tusker]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |number=795869228339318784 |user=AkashvaniAIR |title=“Ottayan- The Lone Tusker” The programme will detail the life and legacy of John Abraham, hailed as ‘Ottayan’ or the 'Lone Tusker.' |date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has left behind a number of complete and incomplete scripts. A collection of his stories had been published under the title Nerchakkozhi. Another collection of his stories has been published posthumously under the title ''John Abrahaminte Kathakal'' by Pakshikkottam Books, [[Thiruvananthapuram]] in 1993.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Death==
On 30 May 1987 Abraham was admitted to the [[Calicut Medical College]] hospital following his fall from a house top after a party. He was not identified by the hospital authorities, and allegedly not given due attention and medical care, which caused his condition to deteriorate, leading to his death on 31 May.&lt;ref&gt;Abhish K Bose (12 June 2013). Later, neuro-surgeon B.Iqbal lamented and apologized Abraham's pathetic death. While Abraham was fighting for his life at the casualty room in Calicut Medical College,  Iqbal was working there.  [http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130612/news-current-affairs/article/john-was-unknown-medical-staff "John Abraham was unknown to medical staff"]. ''Deccan Chronicle''. Retrieved 12 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the allegations of medical negligence, a departmental inquiry was conducted into the incident. 26 years after Abraham's death, social activist [[B. Ekbal]] who was a surgeon at the Calicut Medical College when Abraham was admitted for treatment, revealed that the director could have been saved if his identity was known to the doctors at the time of admission. He said the doctors at the casualty did not know Abraham and mistook him for a film representative when he said that he was a filmmaker. In a Facebook post, Ekbal said the doctors failed to diagnose internal bleeding suffered by Abraham and to check his blood pressure which could have prevented him from slipping into a shock through a timely surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/26-years-after-john-abrahams-death-an-autopsy-on-facebook/article4807864.ece/ "26 years after John Abraham’s death, an autopsy on Facebook"].

'''John Edgar McFadyen''' B. A. (Oxon), M. A., D. D. (17 July 1870 – 1933) a Scottish theologian, was professor of language, literature and Old Testament theology in the [[University of Glasgow]]. He was born in Glasgow and died in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?AuthRecID=1311332&amp;v1=1&amp;HC=1&amp;SEQ=20100427222732&amp;PID=k0qZGy9fGtmJIX7nU3GzINEQfP90|title=McFadyen, John Edgar|work=Name Authorities|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He produced translations of a number of books of the Bible in what he labelled "modern speech". His translations of Job and Psalms strove to be metrical, to reflect their poetic originals.&lt;ref&gt;Paul (2003); p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He learned [[Esperanto]] in 1907 during a stay in [[Chautauqua, New York]], and was a prominent proponent of that language.

The [[Kingdom of Denmark]] has only one [[official language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denmark.dk/en/quick-facts/facts/ |title=Facts and Statistics|website=Denmark.dk|accessdate= 16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danish language|Danish]], the [[national language]] of the Danish people, but there are several [[Minority languages of Denmark|minority languages spoken]], namely [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[German language|German]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]].

A large majority (86%)&lt;ref name="ebs_243_en.pdf"/&gt; of Danes also speak English as a second language; it is mandatory for Danish students to learn from the first grade in the public [[elementary school]]s ({{lang-da|folkeskole}}), by far the most popular option in the country. In the 1st (or 3rd, depends on the school) grade of folkeskole, a third language option is given, usually German or [[French language|French]]. The vast majority pick German (47% of Danes report being able to speak conversational German). The third most widely understood foreign language is Swedish, with 13% of Danes reporting to be able to speak it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 386: Europeans and their languages |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=26 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |archivedate= 6 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officially recognized minority languages==
{{main|Minority languages of Denmark}}

===Faroese===
{{further|Faroese Dane}}
Faroese, a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] like Danish, is the primary language of the [[Faroe Islands]], a self-governing territory of the Kingdom. It is also spoken by some Faroese immigrants to mainland Denmark. [[Faroese language|Faroese]] is similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and also the [[Old Norse]] language spoken.

===German===
{{further|Germans in Denmark}}
[[German language|German]] is an officially recognized minority language in the former [[South Jutland County]] (part of what is now the [[Region of Southern Denmark]]), which was part of [[Imperial Germany]] prior the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; Between 15,000 and 20,000 [[Ethnic Germans]] live in South Jutland, of whom roughly 8,000 use either the standard [[German language|German]] or the [[Schleswigsch]] variety of [[West Low German]] in daily communications. Schleswigisch is highly divergent from Standard German and can be quite difficult to understand by Standard German speakers. Outside of South Jutland, the members of [[St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen|St. Peter's Church]] in [[Copenhagen]] use German in their Church, its website, and the school that it runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sankt-petri.dk/ |title=Willkommen Auf Deutsch|website=Sankt-petri.dk|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German minority operates its own system of primary schools with German as the primary language of instruction as well as a system of libraries throughout South Jutland. It also operates a German high school located in [[Aabenraa]] (German: Apenrade).

Beside this there are also 28,584 immigrants from Germany in Denmark in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/upload/16601/indv.pdf|format=PDF|title=Indvandrere i Danmark : 2012|website=Dst.dk|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenlandic===
{{further|Greenlandic people in Denmark}}
[[Kalaallisut language|Greenlandic]] is the main language of the 54,000 [[Greenlanders]] living in [[Greenland]], which is, like the [[Faroe islands|Faroe Islands]], a self-governing territory of the Kingdom. Roughly 7,000 people speak Greenlandic in mainland Denmark. [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] is similar to [[Inuktitut]], and also the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]] spoken in the Arctic North America, and Eastern Siberian area.

In [[computing]], a '''locale''' is a set of [[parameter]]s that defines the user's language, region and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their [[user interface]]. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language code and a country/region code.

On [[POSIX]] platforms such as [[Unix]], [[Linux]] and others, locale identifiers are defined by [[ISO/IEC 15897]], which is similar to the [[BCP 47]] definition of language tags, but the locale variant modifier is defined differently, and the [[character set]] is included as a part of the identifier. It is defined in this format: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. (For example, [[Australian English]] using the [[UTF-8]] encoding is &lt;tt&gt;en_AU.UTF-8&lt;/tt&gt;.)

== General locale settings ==

These settings usually include the following display (output) format settings:

* Number format setting
* Character classification, case conversion settings
* Date-time format setting
* String [[collation]] setting
* Currency format setting
* Paper size setting
* other minor settings ...

The locale settings are about formatting output given a locale. So, the timezone information and daylight saving time are not usually part of the locale settings.
Less usual is the input format setting, which is mostly defined on a per application basis.

Furthermore, the general settings usually include the [[keyboard layout]] setting.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Programming and markup language support ==
In these environments,

{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
* [[C (programming language)|C]]
* [[C++]]
* [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]]
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
* [[.NET Framework]]
* [[REBOL]]
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[PHP]]
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* [[XML]]
* [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]]
* [[JavaScript]]

{{div col end}}

and other (nowadays) [[Unicode]]-based environments, they are defined in a format similar to [[BCP 47]]. They are usually defined with just [[ISO 639]] (language) and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] (2-letter country) codes.

== POSIX platforms ==
On [[POSIX]] platforms, locale identifiers are defined by [[ISO/IEC 15897]], which is similar to the [[BCP 47]] definition of language tags, but the locale variant modifier is defined differently, and the [[character set]] is included as a part of the identifier.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}
&lt;!-- The identifier format is documented with the environment variables, but how do we cite (e.g.) SUSv4 here? Also, this seems to be part of an "optional" feature. ~~~~ --&gt;

In the next example there is an output of command &lt;code&gt;locale&lt;/code&gt; for [[Czech language]] (cs), [[Czech Republic]] (CZ) with explicit [[UTF-8]] encoding:

== Specifics for Microsoft platforms ==

{{outdated|section|date=June 2016}}

Windows uses specific [https://web.archive.org/web/20170228045725/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/39cwe7zf(vs.71).aspx language] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20160610104759/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cdax410z(VS.71).aspx territory] strings.
The ''locale identifier'' (LCID) for [[managed code|unmanaged code]] on [[Microsoft Windows]] is a number such as 1033 for English (United States) or 1041 for Japanese (Japan). These numbers consist of a language code (lower 10 bits) and culture code (upper bits) and are therefore often written in [[hexadecimal]] notation, such as 0x0409 or 0x0411. The list of those codesets are described in [[character encoding]].
[[Microsoft]] is starting to introduce managed code [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) for .NET that use this format. One of the first to be generally released is a function to mitigate issues with [[internationalized domain name]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd317795.aspx |title=DownlevelGetLocaleScripts function (Windows) |work=[[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more are in [[Windows Vista]] Beta 1.

Starting with Windows Vista, new functions&lt;ref name="microsoft"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd373814.aspx |title=Locale Names (Windows) |work=[[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; that use [[BCP 47]] locale names have been introduced to replace nearly all LCID-based APIs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34878">The '''Loony Left''' is a [[pejorative]] term to describe those considered to be politically [[far-left]]. The term was widely used in the campaign for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]] and subsequently both by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and by [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] that supported the Conservatives as well as by more moderate factions within the Labour movement to refer to the activities of more militantly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politicians that they believed moderate voters would perceive as extreme or unreasonable. The label was directed at the policies and actions of some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] controlled inner-city [[Local government in the United Kingdom|councils]] and some Labour Party politicians. Although the labels "[[hard left]]" and "[[soft left]]" reflected a genuine political division within the Labour Party, "Loony Left" was by far the more often used label than either.&lt;ref name=GyfordLeachGame1989 /&gt; While academics have depicted the era as of the "new urban left" (such as the [[rate-capping rebellion]]) as a throwback to earlier municipal militancy (e.g. [[Poplarism]]), wider media coverage tended to focus on the personalities of city leaders such as the [[Greater London Council]]'s [[Ken Livingstone]] and Liverpool's [[Derek Hatton]].

== Origin and themes of the term ==
The term "Loony Left" as used to describe certain aspects of Labour politics was invented by the British popular press a few years before the 1987 general election. Throughout the run-up to the election it became a staple feature of press-coverage of the election, with many stories running detailing the "antics" of Labour politicians and Labour-controlled local government authorities.&lt;ref name=Negrine1989 /&gt;

[[Jolyon Jenkins]] recorded in 1987 that 1986 was the climax of the Loony Left campaign:&lt;ref name=GyfordLeachGame1989 /&gt;
{{quote|[That it was the year] when the ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' announced that it was going to award a prize&amp;nbsp;— a symbolic two-finger statuette&amp;nbsp;— to the "looniest" council of them all [&amp;hellip;] when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' sent teams of reporters chasing round London boroughs in search of good (if not true) stories; when even ''[[The Times]]'' used the term without apparent irony.  Most importantly, it was the year when Environment Secretary [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]] and Conservative Party Chairman [[Norman Tebbit]] decided this could be harnessed as a vote winner for the Conservative Party.&lt;ref name=GyfordLeachGame1989 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jolyon Jenkins|title=The green sheep in "Colonel Gadaffi Drive"|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|date=1987-01-09|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The ridicule of the political left by some British newspapers has a far longer history. Petley observes that the British press had long-since "perfected a way of representing the ideas and personalities associated with socialism as so deranged and [[psychotic]] that they represented a danger to society", thus rendering them fair game for editorial vilification.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt; After his party's defeat in the 1983 general election, one newspaper had characterised [[Michael Foot]]'s habit of swinging his [[walking stick]] around as he went for his morning walk as being "like an escaped loony".&lt;ref name=Thomas2005 /&gt; The election of [[Ken Livingstone]] to leader of the [[Greater London Council]] in 1981 had him regularly described in newspapers as "barmy" or "loony", with the GLC's policies labelled "crazy". These labels were increasingly also applied to local councils within London: The 13 March 1983 ''[[Sunday People]]'' labelled [[Islington]] local council the "Bananas republic"; and the 13 February 1983 ''Mail on Sunday'' labelled it "The mad mad mad mad world of Islington". In some ways, the "Loony Left" campaign was a generalisation of the Conservative campaign of demonising Livingstone and the GLC.&lt;ref name=Petley2005/&gt;

As recorded by Jenkins, the climax of the campaign was in 1986 and pivotal moments in its history were the London local council elections held in May 1986 and the [[Greenwich by-election, 1987]] as well as of course the campaign for the 1987 general election.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

The general theme that the "Loony Left" label suggested was twofold and  Labour Party local government authorities were perceived to be:&lt;ref name=Petley2005/&gt;
* Irrationally obsessed with minority and fringe issues.
* Paranoid about racial and sexual "problems" that are wholly imaginary on their parts and that have no real existence.

"Loony Left" was also used to describe specific individuals. [[Neil Kinnock]], who had been subject to press vituperation since his election as party leader was associated with the "Loony Left" when in March 1987 he endorsed a rise of 60% in local council rates in Ealing, where he was a rate-payer. The ''Sun'' gave this the headline "Kinnock admits&amp;nbsp;— I back loonies" and other newspapers put this forward as an example of support for extremism by the Labour Party leadership. A later story in the ''Daily Express'' about how Ken Livingstone purportedly had a left-wing takeover of the party arranged was denied by the Labour leadership only to have that reported as "Neil Denies Truth About Left Plot".&lt;ref name=Thomas2005 /&gt;

Similarly, [[Deirdrie Wood]], Labour candidate in the 1987 Greenwich by-election, came to be known in the press as "Dreadful Deirdrie". Wood had been selected by her local constituency party against opposition from the Labour leadership. Privately, she had promised Kinnock "I won't drop you in it", to which he had replied "It's not you, it's those bastards out there", i.e. the press.  Labour presented her as "a hard-working local woman with sensible policies", but the press portrayed her as a radical extremist both by association, as an IRA sympathiser living with a militant [[shop steward]] who was not the father of her children and directly as a "hard left feminist, anti-racist and gay-rights supporter" (as one ''News of the World'' report put it) who wanted to twin London schools with PLO camps.&lt;ref name=Thomas2005 /&gt;

However, local authorities were the primary targets, in part because that is where progressives had found their platform in the 1980s. This was caused by two factors: a change in the composition of local authorities and the general election defeats for Labour from 1979 onwards. Partly because of structural changes to local authorities enacted in 1974, including the end of local [[aldermanic]] dignities and partly simply as a result of an influx of new people whose background had been in the radical youth movements of the 1960s, local government authorities became highly partisan political battlegrounds in the 1970s and 1980s that a canny politician would be able to use to construct a power base and as a stepping stone to a career in national-level politics.&lt;ref name=HellerEdwards1992 /&gt;

This was compounded by the general election defeats for Labour, leaving the party with little ability to push its agenda at a national level in Westminster. As a result, local authorities became hotbeds of progressive and radical ideas and a conflict between local Labour local authorities and the Conservative central government on many issues ensued. Like [[municipal socialism]] before it, Labour leaderships at local level saw themselves as stronger than their Westminster party colleagues and capable of pushing socialist political agendas where they could not be pushed at national level. This resulted in an era of "grand gesture politics", with local authorities taking highly visible stances on national political issues such as declaring themselves [[nuclear-free zone]]s and "rainbow coalitions" between local Labour party politicians and pressure groups for causes outside of Labour's traditional working class roots, such as anti-racism, gay rights, disabled rights and feminist groups.&lt;ref name=HellerEdwards1992 /&gt;

Unfortunately for Labour, the wide range of local-level policy initiatives that this engendered made it easy for Conservative opponents to then apply the "Loony Left" blanket label that the news media had handed to them, a political card that the Conservatives played at both local and national levels. The label was a particularly effective tactic against Labour-controlled [[local education authority|local education authorities]] because the suggestion of innocent children being manipulated to further cynical adult political goals was a very potent image.&lt;ref name=HellerEdwards1992 /&gt;

== Persistence of the idea and counteraction by the Labour Party ==
The label still occurs in British political discourse, even in the 21st century and has become a firmly embedded feature of British journalism.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt; However, changes made by the Labour Party after the 1987 general election to ensure that it was no longer associated in the public mind with the images of the "Loony Left" from 1986–1987 have since blunted its impact and reduced its power, to the extent that it had far less impact on the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992]], less even (according to academic studies by Butler and Kavanaugh) than Labour Party officials themselves believed at the time post-election.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaber2005/&gt;

These changes were in part an increased awareness of how important news media were to Labour's election campaign. One party press secretary said of Labour's attitude to the news media in the 1983 general election campaign: "If a miracle had happened and Fleet Street had suddenly come clamouring to Walworth Road for pro-Labour material, they would have been sent away with a copy of the manifesto each". The party leadership noted afterwards that it had been the effect of the "Loony Left" image that had caused it to lose the 1987 Greenwich by-election by such a large margin. This is not to say that Labour ignored the press, but it became reluctant to talk to it. Kinnock refused to talk to the press on the flight back from his visit to the U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] after British journalists had continually sought a story that would represent the trip in a negative light. Similarly, [[Patricia Hewitt]], then party press secretary, considered abandoning holding daily press conferences in the run-up to the 1987 general election because "they allow the newspaper journalists to set the agenda &amp;hellip; and we know where they stand".&lt;ref name=Thomas2005/&gt;

In a widely leaked letter written to [[Frank Dobson]] after the Greenwich by-election and published by the ''Sun'' under the headline "Gays put Kinnock in a panic &amp;mdash; secret letter lashes loonies", Hewitt said:
{{quote|It is obvious from our own polling, as well as from the doorstep, that the "London effect" is now very noticeable.  The "Loony Labour Left" is now taking its toll; the gays and lesbians issue is costing us dear amongst the pensioners and fear of extremism and higher taxes/rates is particularly prominent in the GLC area.&lt;ref name=Gaber2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cronin2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HeffernanMarqusee1992 /&gt;}}

[[Nick Raynsford]] similarly ascribed the general election defeat to the "Loony Left" and other factors stating after the election that there were "too many worrying skeletons in the Labour Party cupboard deterring voters".&lt;ref name=Cronin2004 /&gt;  In general, the "soft left" portion of the Labour Party blamed the "Loony Left" perception for this third general election defeat,&lt;ref name=HeffernanMarqusee1992 /&gt; despite the election campaign having been, in [[Larry Whitty]]'s words, "the most effective campaign the party has ever waged".&lt;ref name=Cronin2004 /&gt;  According to the "soft left", the Labour-controlled local government authorities had made errors in both pace and presentation, albeit that almost any initiative relating to race or sex, no matter how presented or paced, would have been seized by the press and held up for vilification.&lt;ref name=HeffernanMarqusee1992 /&gt;

Even before the election, Labour was working hard to distance itself from the "Loony Left" perception. [[Roy Hattersley]] stated that at the time of the initiative of Brent Council to appoint race-relations advisers to schools "I do not deny the existence of unacceptable behaviour in some local education authorities. I want to eliminate it".  Similarly, a question-and-answer pamphlet for voters prepared by staff at Labour headquarters had the question: "But if I vote Labour won't I get a loony left council like those in London?", to which the answer given was: "Left councils are exceptions, Neil Kinnock has told them to mend their ways and he is in full charge of the Labour Party".&lt;ref name=HeffernanMarqusee1992 /&gt;

On several occasions, the Labour Party leadership and others attempted to take a hard line on the "Loony Left" in order to gain a more favourable impression in the media. On 3 April 1987, for example, five Labour MPs with constituencies in Birmingham &amp;mdash; Roy Hattersley, [[Denis Howell]], [[Jeff Rooker]], [[Terry Davis (politician)|Terry Davis]] and [[Robin Corbett]] &amp;mdash; wrote to [[Sharon Atkin]], [[Bernie Grant]] and [[Linda Bellos]] in letters that they themselves leaked to the newspapers, demanding that they not attend a meeting in Birmingham, scheduled for 7 April, of activists campaigning for [[Black Sections]] within the Labour Party. Similarly, after the Greenwich by-election defeat five London Labour Party members &amp;mdash; [[Brian Nicholson]], [[Roger Godsiff]], [[John Spellar]], Roy Shaw and [[Dianne Hayter]] &amp;mdash; formed the "Londoners for Labour" association, according to their press releases aimed at reclaiming the London Labour Party from "the loonies".&lt;ref name=HeffernanMarqusee1992 /&gt;

The 1980s UK press campaign against the "Loony Left" was echoed in the 1990s in the U.S. where sections of the press campaigned against [[political correctness]], using much the same rhetoric.&lt;ref name=Eppstein1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanovich2000 /&gt;{{verify source|date=November 2010}} The same accusations made by the British press in the 1980s were levelled by U.S. newspapers such as ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.&lt;ref name=Grainge2003 /&gt;

== Exemplification ==
As Jenkins noted, the truth of the stories mattered less than their resonance with voter fears. Three of the most famously recorded instances of "Loony Left" activities - the renaming of the nursery rhyme [[Baa Baa Black Sheep]], of "[[manhole cover]]s" and of "[[bin bag|black bin-liner bags]]" - were myths, outright fabrications by the press. Others stories, such as reports that London councils had insisted that homosexuals be placed at the heads of the waiting lists for council housing and that London councils had spent £500,000 on "24 super-loos for gypsies" were found to be highly misleading upon investigation by the Media Research Group of [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College, University of London]].&lt;ref name=Curran1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schostak1993 /&gt;

The report of the MRG investigation estimated that some 3,000 news stories about the "Loony Left" ran between 1981 and 1987 in the British tabloid press alone. It determined that a large proportion of these stories were either partially or wholly fabricated and that their targets, against whom they aimed to inflame public opinion, were a small number of London local councils that were under Labour Party control.&lt;ref name=GyfordLeachGame1989 /&gt;

=== Baa Baa White Sheep ===
In 1986, a parent-run nursery school banned the song "Baa Baa Black Sheep" over concerns the song might have racial undertones. Over time, media reports came to misreport the story, eventually incorrectly claiming the Birmingham City Council had ordered the lyrics be changed to "Baa Baa green sheep".

Variants of this story have been reported repeatedly by the British mass media since 1986, to the state at which it has almost gained the status as an [[urban myth]].&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt; Both ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' reported in 2002, for example, the same "Baa Baa White Sheep" story, ascribing it to a parent of a child attending Paston Ridings Primary School in London.&lt;ref name=TheAge1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TheHerald1 /&gt;

The original story reported a ban at Beevers Nursery, a privately run nursery school in Hackney. It was originally reported by Bill Akass, then a journalist at the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' in the 15 February 1986 edition under the headline "Now it's Baa Baa Blank Sheep". Akass had heard of a ban issued, by nursery school staff, on the singing of the nursery rhyme "[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]" on the grounds that it was racist.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt; In his story, he wrote:

{{quote|Staff at a nursery school in Hackney, London, claim that the traditional nursery rhyme is offensive to blacks. At first they wanted the 30 children aged between one and three&amp;nbsp;— only two of whom are black&amp;nbsp;— to sing Baa Baa White Sheep instead. But now it has been banned altogether at Beevers Nursery in De Beauvoir Road. Leaders of left-wing Hackney council welcomed the ban last night. A spokesman said: "We consider playgroups and nurseries should be discouraged from singing the rhyme. It reinforces a derogatory and subservient use of the word 'black' among our youngsters in their formative years. This is particularly important because the majority of children in our nurseries come from black and ethnic minority communities."&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;}}

The nursery was run by the parents, rather than by Hackney council, but Akass had telephoned Hackney council for its reaction to his story. Martin Bostock, then the press officer for Hackney council, reported that he had considered the possibility of simply responding: "We don't know what this nursery is doing, but whatever they're doing it is up to them". However, according to Bostock council leader Tony Millwood, Bostock rejected this advice and wanted to take a more supportive stance on the alleged ban and in conjunction with the press office drafted and issued a statement saying "that we supported what they'd done, although making it quite clear that it was not a council nursery and not a council ban".&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

Three days later in the 18 February 1986 ''Hackney Gazette'', Tim Cooper took up Akass's story. He went to Beevers Nursery and asked parents there what their reactions were in turn to the Hackney council statement itself a reaction to the claim that Beevers had issued a ban. Cooper's story reported one of the nursery playleaders as saying: "We're run by parents and if they want us to stop singing it, we would. But there have been no complaints so far, though someone once suggested it could be racist". Cooper later stated that there had been no such ban, but that the statement issued by Millwood and Hackney council had given the story the impetus that it was then to run with:

{{quote|I think they really shot themselves in the foot. I think they issued the statement because they, or the council leader at the time, believed that the ban was in force and tried to justify it. I think that they were wrong. There was no ban in the first place.  By issuing the statement they virtually created the story, which obviously snowballed from there&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;}}

The story was carried by the ''Sun'' in its 20 February 1986 edition under the headline "Lefties baa black sheep", with the ban attributed directly to "Loony left-wing councillors". The ''Sun''{{'s}} version of events was subsequently carried by the 23 February 1986 ''[[Sunday World]]''. It was taken to the letters columns of the February 28, 1986 and 4 March 1986 ''Hackney Gazette'' and the 6 March 1986 ''Ilford Recorder'' and even reached the pages of the 4 April 1986 ''Knitting International''. Despite neither the journalists nor the letter-writers presenting any evidence for their assertions, only one paper (''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'') rejected the story in print, calling the story a deliberate attempt to discredit the council.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

The 9 October 1986 ''Daily Mail'' carried the story further, with a story headlined "Baa baa, green (yes green) sheep!", reporting that Haringey (not Hackney) council had ordered playgroup leaders to attend a racialism awareness course, where they were instructed that the council had banned the rhyme with its original wording, mandating the alternative "green sheep" wording instead. This story was ascribed to an anonymous playgroup leader. From here, this new twist on the original story was carried by the ''[[Birmingham Evening Mail]]'' ("Silly bleat" and "Green sheep? They've got to be joking."), the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' ("Black sheep in the dog house"), the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Press]]'' ("So sheepish"), the 10 October 1986 ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' ("Racist sheep are a joke"), the 12 October 1986 ''[[Sunday People]]'', ''[[News of the World]]'' ("Green sheep take over") and ''[[Sunday Mercury]]'', the 13 October 1986 Carlisle ''[[Evening News and Star]]'' ("Bernie Bleat Barmy"), the 14 October 1986 Yorkshire ''[[Evening Courier]]'' and the 15 October 1986 ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' ("Just Barmy") and Ipswich ''[[Evening Star (Ipswich)|Evening Star]]'' ("A load of wollies!").&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

In fact, the playgroup leaders had requested the racialism awareness course, at which attendance was not compulsory, there had been no ban imposed by Haringey council and there was no evidence that the rhyme had even been discussed on the course. As before, only newspapers for the British black community reported these facts. The attempts by the ''Daily Mail'' attempts to fact check the story that it had run, including posing as parents looking for playgroups and as supermarket managers wanting to run racialism awareness courses, had failed to elicit a single playgroup worker who would confirm the alleged council ban.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

Haringey council attempted to get the story straightened. It initiated legal action against the ''Daily Mail'', but was forced to drop it for lack of funds. The attempts by the council to rebut the story were ignored by the press for a week, its rebuttal only being first printed in the 16 October 1986 ''Haringey Advertiser'' ("Black sheep still in evidence")., but that was not enough to stem the tide as the story was now running, without independent fact checking, in newspapers all across the country, from ''Men's Wear'' to the 19 October ''[[Sunday Times]]'' letters column, the 23 October ''Hendon Times'' ("Stop stirring up trouble") and [[Auberon Waugh]]'s column in the 19 October ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]''. The 23 October ''Mail on Sunday'' letters column carried letters noting that [[black pudding]] was henceforth to be "green pudding", the same day's ''Sunday Times'' letters column noted that [[blackhead]]s could no longer be called blackheads.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

The ''Daily Mail'' ran the story again on 20 October, comparing Haringey council to Nazi Germany. Again, the council attempted to set the record straight with a press statement that noted the irony of the ''Daily Mail'' comparing the council to Nazi Germany when the ''Mail'' itself had supported Hitler right up until the eve of [[World War II]]. Again, only the British black community newspapers (the 3 November ''[[Asian Herald]]'' and the 5 November ''[[West Indian News]]'') carried Haringey council's corrections. The story continued to be carried by many newspapers for months thereafter, including ''[[The Economist]]'' on 1 November and the ''Islington Gazette'' on 20 February 1987, this time with Islington council as the ban-issuer, a fact that was explicitly denied by a council spokesman in the piece, who said that "it is not council policy to ban Baa Baa Black Sheep but if individual nursery workers find it offensive the council is not in the business of forcing them to teach that rhyme rather than others". The ''Daily Express'' carried the new Islington variant on the same day ("School bars boy's Baa-baa Black Sheep 'racist' rhyme") as did the ''Daily Telegraph'' ("Boy's first rhyme upsets nursery staff"), the ''Daily Mirror'' ("Baa Baa blacked") and the ''Sun'' ("Baa Baa nursery ban on sad little Dan"), whose lead article the next day then began with "Loony left councils have given us a good laugh over the years".&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

Even other political parties ran with the story. A [[party election broadcast]] for the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], fronted by [[John Cleese]], named Islington council as "the council that accused a five year old of reciting a racially offensive poem". Islington council sought an injunction in the High Court to have this material excluded, but this was denied by Mr Justice Drake. [[David Owen]] dropped the material anyway, stating that it was to avoid further distress to the five-year-old's family. Ironically, the press reported Owen's press conference, announcing this change as "loony" David Owen "outclowning anything that [[Basil Fawlty]] could have thought up".&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

Two newspapers recognised that the story had no foundation. The ''Yorkshire Evening Press'' printed on 14 November 1986 a correction to its earlier story, stating: "We regret that the editorial, which was written in good faith, was based upon an inaccurate report". The ''Birmingham Evening Mail'' published a letter from [[Bernie Grant]] on 22 October denying the story. Nonetheless and despite the corrections, court actions and attempts to set the record straight, the story has refused to die. The 8 February 1998 ''Sunday Times'', for example, re-hashed the story once again, eleven years after the fact, in a story about [[Margaret Hodge]], former leader of Islington council, so too did the ''Daily Mail'' on 4 October 1999.

In 2000, the BBC reported the withdrawal of guidance to nursery schools by Birmingham City Council that the nursery rhyme ''Baa Baa Black Sheep'' should not be taught due to its "racial offensiveness". The advice was "ridiculous", according to [[Black British]] families in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nursery rhyme ban scrapped|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/600470.stm|accessdate=21 April 2015|agency=British Broadcasting Corporation|publisher=BBC News|date=12 January 2000|quote=A warning that the nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep should not be taught in schools because it is "racially offensive" has been scrapped. / The guidelines by education chiefs at Birmingham City Council were dropped after black parents condemned the advice as ridiculous.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' on 6 July 2000 reminded readers of Islington's reputation of being "one of the country's most celebrated loony Labour councils", again printing as fact the claim that Islington was where "Baa Baa Black Sheep was banned for being politically incorrect". Further stories about Hodge's ministerial promotions in the 14 June 2003 ''Sun'' and the 28 September 2003 ''Daily Mail'' also repeated this claim and attached it to Hodge.&lt;ref name=Petley2005 /&gt;

=== Peter Jenkins ===
[[Peter Jenkins (journalist)|Peter Jenkins]], a columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'', recorded policies which were dubbed "loony left" by the media. For instance, [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] council allowed only Nicaraguan coffee to be sold&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Jenkins (journalist) |year=1988 |title=Mrs. Thatcher's revolution |pages=245–246 |isbn=0-674-58832-0 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |oclc=17726876}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced courses on [[homosexuality]] into its [[Nursery school|nursery]] and [[primary schools]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

[[Hackney London Borough Council]] ended its [[Town twinning|twinning]] arrangements with France, West Germany and Israel and made new twinnings with the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]] and [[Nicaragua]]. A spokesperson for the council explained: "This will enable us to concentrate on our new friends".&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; When [[Sinn Féin]] representatives were invited to speak to Hackney council, a revolver was fired by a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and there was a fight in the council chamber.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

[[Lambeth London Borough Council]] banned the word "[[family]]" from council literature because this was "discriminatory"&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; and police were banned from using council facilities.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; Lambeth council's leader, [[Linda Bellos]], claimed: "I think the police are bent on war".&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

[[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]] council removed all books it considered to be "racist" and "sexist" from its local libraries.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; An [[Inner London Education Authority]] (ILEA) teaching pack titled ''Auschwitz: Yesterday's Racism'' drew comparisons between the [[trade union]] legislation of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; Another ILEA school in [[Kennington]] discouraged competitive games&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; and making pupils write protest letters was made part of the school time-table.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:MapofEmergingUSMegaregions.png|thumb|420px|&lt;center&gt;Regional Plan Association map.&lt;/center&gt;]]A megaregion is a large network of metropolitan regions that share several or all of the following:
* Environmental systems and topography
* Infrastructure systems
* Economic linkages
* Settlement and land use patterns
* Culture and history&lt;ref name=RPA&gt;Regional Plan Association (2006). ''America 2050: A Prospectus.'' New York, NY: Regional Plan Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

A megaregion may also be known as a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] or megapolitan area. More than 70 percent of the nation's population and jobs are located in 11 megaregions identified by the [[Regional Plan Association]] (RPA), which is an independent, non-profit New York-based planning organization. Megaregions are becoming the new competitive units in the global economy, characterized by the increasing movement of goods, people and capital among their metropolitan regions.&lt;ref name=RPA/&gt; "The New Megas," asserted [[Richard Florida]] (2006), "are the real economic organizing units of the world, producing the bulk of its wealth, attracting a large share of its talent and generating the lion's share of innovation."&lt;ref name=Dewar/&gt;

The megaregion concept provides cities and metropolitan regions a context within which to cooperate across jurisdictional borders, including the coordination of policies, to address specific challenges experienced at the megaregion scale, such as planning for high-speed rail, protecting large watersheds, and coordinating regional economic development strategies.

The American-based Regional Plan Association recognizes 11 emerging megaregions:&lt;ref&gt;Hagler, Yoav (2009). "Defining U.S. Megaregions."

==Identification==
The Regional Plan Association methodology for identifying the emerging megaregions included assigning each county a point for each of the following:
* It was part of a core-based statistical area;
* Its population density exceeded 200 people per square mile as of the 2000 census;
* The projected population growth rate was expected to be greater than 15 percent and total increased population was expected to exceed 1,000 people by 2025{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}};
* The population density was expected to increase by 50 or more people per square mile between 2000 and 2025 {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}; and
* The projected employment growth rate was expected to be greater than 15 percent and total growth in jobs was expected to exceed 20,000 by 2025.&lt;ref name=Hagler&gt;Hagler, Yoav (2009). "Defining U.S. Megaregions." New York, NY: Regional Plan Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortcomings of the RPA method===
This methodology was much more successful at identifying fast-growing regions with existing metropolitan centers than more sparsely populated, slower growing regions. Nor does it include a distinct marker for connectedness between cities.&lt;ref name=Hagler/&gt; The RPA method omits the eastern part of the [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor|Windsor-Quebec City]] urban corridor in Canada.

Notes:
* [[Houston]] appears twice (as part of [[Gulf Coast (U.S.)|Gulf Coast]] and [[Texas Triangle]]). 
* The populations given for megalopolies that extend into Canada and Mexico (Cascadia, Great Lakes, and Southern California) include their non-U.S. residents.
* Disconnected metropolitan areas (as defined by the RPA) are flagged with double asterisks.  Disconnected areas in the upper Great Lakes region and southern Quebec are not included in RPA statistics.

==Major cities and areas not included by the RPA==
Thirteen of the top 100 American [[Table of United States primary census statistical areas|primary census statistical areas]] are not included in any of the 11 emerging mega-regions. However, the Lexington-based CSA in Kentucky is identified by the RPA as being part of an "area of influence" of the Great Lakes megalopolis, while the Albany and Syracuse-based CSAs in Upstate New York are shown as being within the influence of the Northeastern mega-region. Similarly, the Augusta, GA and Columbia, SC-based CMA are considered influenced by the Piedmont-Atlantic megalopolis, Jackson, MS CMA by the Gulf Coast megaregion, Little Rock, AR CMA by the Texas Triangle, and the Des Moines and Omaha-based CMAs by the Great Lakes megalopolis. The El Paso, TX CMA is roughly equidistant from two megaregions, being near the southeastern edge of the Arizona Sun Corridor area of influence and the southern tip of the Front Range area of influence. This leaves Honolulu, HI, Wichita, KS, Springfield, MO and Charleston, SC as the only top 100 American CMAs that have no mega-region affiliation of any kind as defined by the RPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america2050.org/maps/|title=Our Maps |publisher=Regional Plan Association |location=USA |work=America2050 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning==
Though identification of the megaregions has gone through several iterations, the above identified are based on a set of criteria developed by Regional Plan Association, through its America 2050 initiative - a joint venture with the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Two historic publications helped lay the foundation for this new set of criteria, the book'' Megalopolis'' by [[Jean Gottmann ]](1961)&lt;ref name=Gottman&gt;Gottman, Jean (1961). ''Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States.'' New York: Twentieth Century Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; and The Regions’ Growth, part of Regional Plan Association’s second regional plan{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}.

The relationships underpinning megaregions have become more pronounced over the second half of the 20th century as a result of decentralized land development, longer daily commutes, increased business travel, and a more footloose, flexible, knowledge workforce. The identification of new geographic scales—historically based on increased population movement from the city center to lower density areas as a megaregion presents immense opportunities from a regional planning perspective, to improve the environmental, infrastructure and other issues shared among the regions within it. The most recent and only previous attempt to plan at this scale happened more than 70 years ago, with the Tennessee Valley Authority. Political issues stymied further efforts at river basin planning and development.&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;Dewar, Margaret and David Epstein (2006). "Planning for 'Megaregions' in the United States." Ann Arbor, MI: Urban and Regional Planning Program, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961's Megalopolis, Gottman describes the Northeastern seaboard of the United States - or Megapologis - as "... difficult to single out ... from surrounding areas, for its limits cut across established historical divisions, such as New England and the Middle Atlantic states, and across political entities, since it includes some states entirely and others only partially." On the complex nature of this regional scale, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the major characteristics of Megalopolis, which set it apart as a special region within the United States, are the high degree of concentration of people, things and functions crowded here, and also their variety. This kind of crowding and its significance cannot be described by simple measurements. Its various aspects will be shown on a number of maps, and if these could all be superimposed on one base map there would be demarcated an area in which so many kinds of crowding coincide in general (though not always in all the details of their geographical distribution) that the region is quite different from all neighboring regions and in fact from any other part of North America. The essential reason for its difference is the greater concentration here of a greater variety of kinds of crowding.

Crowding of population, which may first be expressed in terms of densities per square mile, will, of course, be a major characteristic to survey. As this study aims at understanding the meaning of population density, we shall have to know the foundation that supports such crowding over such a very fast area. What do these people do? What is their average income and their standard of living? What is the distribution pattern of wealth and of certain more highly paid occupations? For example, the outstanding concentration of population in the City of New York and its immediate suburbs (a mass of more than ten million people by any count) cannot be separated from the enormous concentration in the same city of banking, insurance, wholesale, entertainment, and transportation activities. These various kinds of concentration have attracted a whole series of other activities, such as management of large corporations, retail business, travel agencies, advertising, legal and technical counseling offices, colleges, research organizations, and so on. Coexistence of all these facilities on an unequaled scale within the relatively small territory of New York City, and especially of its business district...has made the place even more attractive to additional banking, insurance, and mass media organizations.&lt;ref name=Gottman/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Outside of the United States==
The RPA report identifies megaregions that are shared between the US and Canada, and is presumably at least tangentially concerned with pan-North American issues. However, being based on largely American research, it does not clearly define the geographic extent of megaregions where they extend into Canada, a responsibility that has largely been left to Canadian geographers defining the megalopolis within their own country. The American report excludes Canadian population centres that are not deemed to be closely adjacent to US megaregions. It includes most of [[Southern Ontario]] in the Great Lakes Megaregion but excludes the [[St. Lawrence Valley]], despite the fact that Canadian geographers usually include them as part of one larger [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]].

The close relationship between large linked metropolitan regions and a nation's ability to compete in the global economy is recognized in Europe and Asia. Each has aggressively pursued strategies to manage projected population growth and strengthen economic prosperity in its large regions.

The [[European Spatial Development Perspective]], a set of policies and strategies adopted by the [[European Union]] in 1999, is working to integrate the economies of the member regions, reduce economic disparities, and increase economic competitiveness (Faludi 2002; Deas and Lord 2006).

In [[East Asia]], comprehensive strategic planning for large regions, centered on metropolitan areas, has become increasingly common and has progressed further than in the United States or Europe. Planning for the Hong Kong-[[Pearl River Delta]] region, for instance, aims to enhance the region's economic strength and competitiveness by overcoming local fragmentation, building on global economic cooperation, taking advantage of mutually beneficial economic factors, increasing connectivity among development nodes, and pursuing other strategic directions.&lt;ref name=Dewar/&gt;

== Biography ==
Melkon Guirdjian was born in the Havav village in the [[Palu, Turkey|Palu]] region that is now considered [[Elâzığ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palu - Population movements|url=http://www.houshamadyan.org/en/mapottomanempire/vilayetdiyarbekir/palu/locale/population-movements.html|publisher=Houshamadyan|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guirdjian attended the local [[Armenia]]n school. He then moved to [[Constantinople]] at age 11 where he attended the prestigious Jemaran [[Armenia]]n School of [[Üsküdar]]. After completing his studies at Jemaran and later Surp Hac Tbrevank, he became a teacher from 1878 to 1896.&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt; He taught [[Armenian history]], language, and culture in many [[Armenia]]n schools such as the prestigious [[Getronagan Armenian High School]].&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;

In 1893 he was imprisoned for alleged political activity. Due to the political instability, he fled to [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt; In [[Varna]], he founded the Armenian school Artzrunian, which served as a haven for [[Armenia]]n refugees. During his absence from [[Constantinople]], his house was searched by local police and many of his manuscripts and writings were burned.&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt; He felt the need to return in 1898 and was immediately arrested once again upon return. After spending 6 months in prison, Guirdjian escaped to [[Kastamonu]], where he remains for 10 years.&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt; During his stay in [[Kastamonu]], he gave Armenian literature and history lessons covertly. In 1906, on the basis of a secret agent's reports, his literary pieces were once again destroyed.&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;
When the [[Young Turk Revolution]] succeeded in 1908, Guirdjian returned to [[Constantinople]] and began participating in civic and literary activities once again.

== Death ==
On April 24, 1915, Melkon Guirdjian along with other prominent intellectuals and figures of the [[Constantinople|Constantinople's]] [[Armenia]]n community were [[Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915|deported]] to unknown destinations within the interior provinces of [[Ottoman Turkey]] as part of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ölüme giden sürgün|url=http://www.koxuz.org/anasayfa/node/5876|publisher=Koxuz|accessdate=28 September 2012|language=Turkish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908054249/http://www.koxuz.org/anasayfa/node/5876|archivedate=8 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melkon Guirdjian found himself in the outskirts of [[Ankara]] and was ultimately killed by [[Turkey|Turkish]] gendarmes.&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=November 2009}}
'''Michael Sharwood Smith''' (born 1942), Emeritus Professor of Languages at [[Heriot-Watt University]] &amp; Honorary Professorial Fellow at the [[University of Edinburgh]], is a researcher into [[multilingualism]] and the acquisition of non-native languages, a branch of [[developmental linguistics]] and [[cognitive science]]. He is a founding editor of ''[[Second Language Research]]'', successor to the ''Interlanguage Studies Bulletin''. 
Together with John Truscott of [[National Tsing Hua University]], Taiwan he has developed a new theoretical platform for studying language development and language use called the [[MOGUL Framework]] (Modular Growth and Use of Language) which explains language development as a [[by-product]] of processing albeit constrained by the modular architecture of the mind. His research interests have included theoretical issues concerning the way in which second languages are represented in the mind and how they interact, [[language attrition]], the role of consciousness in [[language learning]] and also applications of linguistics such as the design of pedagogical grammars. He has introduced various concepts and associated terms into the field of [[second language acquisition]] research, notably "grammatical consciousness-raising" ([[#SharwoodSmith1981|Sharwood Smith 1981]]), "[[crosslinguistic influence]]" ([[#SharwoodSmith1983|Sharwood Smith 1982]]) and "[[input enhancement]]" ([[#SharwoodSmith1991|Sharwood Smith 1991]]), the last-mentioned idea focusing on the supposed learning effect of systematically making salient for learners certain specific linguistic features that are present in the language to which they are exposed. Together with James Pankhurst, he ran the annual LARS (Language Acquisition Research Symposia) meetings in Utrecht between 1983 and 1998, bringing together researchers in first and [[second language acquisition]] and also [[theoretical linguistics]]. Speakers at the LARS meetings have included leading figures such as [[Melissa Bowerman]], [[Ray Jackendoff]], [[Annette Karmiloff-Smith]], Mary-Louise Kean, [[Brian MacWhinney]], [[Frederick Newmeyer]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]] as well as many prominent researchers in second language acquisition.

[[File:codex ephremi.jpg|thumb|350px|The ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a Greek manuscript of the Bible from the 5th century, is a palimpsest.]]

In [[textual studies]], a '''palimpsest''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ɪ|m|p|s|ɛ|s|t}}) is a [[manuscript]] page, either from a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or a [[book]], from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parchment#History|Pergamene]] (now known as [[parchment]]) was made of lamb, calf, or goat kid skin (best made in ancient [[Pergamon]]) and was expensive and not readily available, so in the interest of economy a pergamene often was re-used by scraping the previous writing. In colloquial usage, the term ''palimpsest'' is also used in [[architecture]], [[archaeology]], and [[geomorphology]] to denote an object made or worked upon for one purpose and later reused for another, for example a [[monumental brass]] the reverse blank side of which has been re-engraved.

== Etymology ==

The word "palimpsest" derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:palimpsestus#Latin|palimpsestus]]'', which derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:en:παλίμψηστος#Ancient Greek|παλίμψηστος]] (''palímpsēstos'', "again scraped"), a compound word that literally means "scraped clean and ready to be used again". The Ancient Greeks used wax-coated tablets, like scratch-pads, to write on with a stylus, and to erase the writing by smoothing the wax surface and writing again. This practice was adopted by [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], who wrote (literally scratched on letters) on [[Wax tablet|wax-coated tablets]], which were reuseable; [[Cicero]]'s use of the term "palimpsest" confirms such a practice.

== Development ==
[[File:Georgian paliphsest V-VI cc.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Georgian language|Georgian]] palimpsest from the 5th or 6th century]]

Because [[parchment]] prepared from animal hides is far more durable than [[paper]] or [[papyrus]], most palimpsests known to modern scholars are parchment, which rose in popularity in [[Western Europe]] after the 6th century. Where papyrus was in common use, reuse of writing media was less common because papyrus was cheaper and more expendable than costly parchment. Some papyrus palimpsests do survive, and Romans referred to this custom of washing papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Suetonius]], [[Augustus]], "though he began a tragedy with great zest, becoming dissatisfied with the style, he obliterated the whole; and his friends saying to him, What is your Ajax doing? He answered, My Ajax met with a sponge." (''Augustus'', 85). Cf. a letter of the future emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] to his friend and teacher [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]] (''ad M. Caesarem'', 4.5), in which the former, dissatisfied with a piece of his own writing, facetiously exclaims that he will "consecrate it to water (''lymphis'') or fire (''Volcano'')," i.e. that he will rub out or burn what he has written.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing was washed from parchment or [[vellum]] using milk and [[oat bran]]. With the passing of time, the faint remains of the former writing would reappear enough so that scholars can discern the text (called the ''scriptio inferior'', the "underwriting") and decipher it. In the later [[Middle Ages]] the surface of the vellum was usually scraped away with powdered [[pumice]], irretrievably losing the writing, hence the most valuable palimpsests are those that were overwritten in the early Middle Ages.

Medieval [[codex|codices]] are constructed in "gathers" which are folded (compare "[[wikt:folio|folio]]", "leaf, page" [[ablative case]] of [[Latin]] folium), then stacked together like a newspaper and sewn together at the fold. Prepared parchment sheets retained their original central fold, so each was ordinarily cut in half, making a [[quarto]] volume of the original folio, with the overwritten text running perpendicular to the effaced text.

== Modern decipherment ==
Faint legible remains were read by eye before 20th-century techniques helped make lost texts readable. To read palimpsests, scholars of the 19th century used chemical means that were sometimes very destructive, using [[tincture]] of [[gall]] or, later, [[ammonium bisulfate]]. Modern methods of reading palimpsests using [[ultraviolet]] light and photography are less damaging.

Innovative [[Digitization|digitized images]] aid scholars in deciphering unreadable palimpsests. Superexposed photographs exposed in various light spectra, a technique called "multispectral filming", can increase the contrast of faded ink on parchment that is too indistinct to be read by eye in normal light. For example, [[multispectral imaging]] undertaken by researchers at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] recovered much of the undertext (estimated to be more than 80%) from the ''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''. At the [[Walters Art Museum]] where the palimpsest is now conserved, the project has focused on experimental techniques to retrieve the remaining text, some of which was obscured by overpainted icons. One of the most successful techniques for reading through the paint proved to be [[X-ray]] [[fluorescence]] imaging, through which the iron in the ink is revealed. A team of imaging scientists and scholars from the United States and Europe is currently using spectral imaging techniques developed for imaging the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' to study more than one hundred palimpsests in the library of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="imaging"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/in-the-sinai-a-global-team-is-revolutionizing-the-preservation-of-ancient-manuscripts/2012/08/30/1c203ef4-ca1f-11e1-aea8-34e2e47d1571_story.html|title=In the Sinai, a global team is revolutionizing the preservation of ancient manuscripts|publisher=Washington POST Magazine|date= September 8, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==

A number of ancient works have survived only as palimpsests.&lt;ref&gt;The most accessible overviews of the transmission of texts through the cultural bottleneck are Leighton D. Reynolds (editor), in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'', where the texts that survived, fortuitously, ''only'' in palimpsest may be enumerated, and in his general introduction to textual transmission, ''Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature'' (with N.G. Wilson).&lt;/ref&gt; Vellum manuscripts were over-written on purpose mostly due to the dearth or cost of the material. In the case of Greek manuscripts, the consumption of old [[codex|codices]] for the sake of the material was so great that a synodal decree of the year 691 forbade the destruction of manuscripts of the [[Scriptures]] or the [[church father]]s, except for imperfect or injured volumes. Such a decree put added pressure on retrieving the vellum on which secular manuscripts were written. The decline of the vellum trade with the introduction of paper exacerbated the scarcity, increasing pressure to reuse material.

Cultural considerations also motivated the creation of palimpsests. The demand for new texts might outstrip the availability of parchment in some centers, yet the existence of cleaned parchment that was never overwritten suggests that there was also a spiritual motivation, to sanctify pagan text by overlaying it with the word of God, somewhat as pagan sites were overlaid with Christian churches to hallow pagan ground. Or the pagan texts may have merely appeared irrelevant.

Texts most susceptible to being overwritten included obsolete legal and liturgical ones, sometimes of intense interest to the historian. Early Latin translations of Scripture were rendered obsolete by Jerome's [[Vulgate]]. Texts might be in foreign languages or written in unfamiliar scripts that had become illegible over time. The codices themselves might be already damaged or incomplete. [[Christian heresy|Heretical]] texts were dangerous to harbor—there were compelling political and religious reasons to destroy texts viewed as heresy, and to reuse the media was less wasteful than simply to burn the books.

Vast destruction of the broad [[quarto]]s of the early centuries took place in the period which followed the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], but palimpsests were also created as new texts were required during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The most valuable [[Latin]] palimpsests are found in the codices which were remade from the early large folios in the 7th to the 9th centuries. It has been noticed that no entire work is generally found in any instance in the original text of a palimpsest, but that portions of many works have been taken to make up a single volume. An exception is the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' (see below). On the whole, early medieval scribes were thus not indiscriminate in supplying themselves with material from any old volumes that happened to be at hand.

* The best-known palimpsest in the legal world was discovered in 1816 by Niebuhr and Savigny in the [[Chapter Library of Verona|library of Verona cathedral]]. Underneath letters by St. Jerome and Gennadius was the almost complete text of the [[Gaius (jurist)|Institutes of Gaius]], probably the first student's textbook on Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;The Institutes of Gaius, ed W.M. Gordon and O.F. Robinson, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], Paris: portions of the Old and New Testaments in Greek, attributed to the 5th century, are covered with works of [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraem the Syrian]] in a hand of the 12th century.
* The [[Sana'a palimpsest]] is one of the oldest Qur'anic manuscripts in existence. Carbon dating indicates that the undertext (the scriptio inferior) was written probably within 15 years before the death of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. The undertext differs from the standard Qur'anic text and is therefore the most important documentary evidence for the existence of variant Qur'anic readings.&lt;ref name=Sadeghi2&gt;{{cite journal |last = Sadeghi |first = Behnam |author2=Goudarzi, Mohsen | title = Ṣan'ā' 1 and the Origins of the Qur'ān |journal = Der Islam |date = March 2012 |url = http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle/j$002fislm.2010.87.issue-1-2$002fislam-2011-0025$002fislam-2011-0025.xml;jsessionid=82FA69F0EB77BCCC0BC1E1A6AC19B933 |accessdate = 2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pukina Map.png|thumb|Pukina language distribution around 1600 CE, Pukina toponyms, and pre-Inca Pukina ethnicities.]]

'''Puquina''' (or '''Pukina''') is an [[extinct language]] once spoken by a native ethnic group in the region surrounding [[Lake Titicaca]] ([[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]) and in the north of [[Chile]]. It is often associated with the culture that built [[Tiwanaku]].

Remnants of Puquina can be found in the Quechuan and Spanish languages spoken in the south of Peru, mainly in [[Arequipa]], [[Moquegua]] and [[Tacna]], as well as in [[Bolivia]]. There also seem to be remnants in the [[Kallawaya language]], which may be a [[mixed language]] formed from [[Quechuan languages]] and Puquina. ([[Terrence Kaufman]] (1990) finds the proposal plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://52ica.etnolinguistica.org/adelaar |title=The Puquina and Leko languages |accessdate=2007-09-19 |author=Willem Adelaar |author2=Simon van de Kerke |work=Symposium: Advances in Native South American Historical Linguistics, July 17-18, 2006, at the 52nd [[International Congress of Americanists]], Seville, Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Some theories claim that "Qhapaq Simi", the cryptic language of the nobility of the [[Inca Empire]], was closely related to Puquina, and that ''Runa Simi'' (Quechuan languages) were spoken by commoners.

Sometimes the term ''Puquina'' is used for the [[Uru language]], which is distinctly different.

In addition, it is also one of the [[Languages of the European Union|official languages of the European Union]].

Romanian is a part of the [[Eastern Romance languages|Balkan-Romance]] group that evolved from several dialects of [[Vulgar Latin]], which separated from the [[Italo-Western languages|Western Romance]] during the 5th–8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;"Istoria limbii române" ("History of the Romanian Language"), II, Academia Română, Bucharest, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish it within that group in comparative linguistics it is called ''[[Daco-Romanian]]'' as opposed to its closest relatives, [[Aromanians|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], and [[Istro-Romanians|Istro-Romanian]].

Romanian is also known as ''[[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]'' in Moldova, although the [[Constitutional Court of Moldova|Constitutional Court]] ruled in 2013 that "the official language of the republic is Romanian".&lt;ref name=Moldova group=nb&gt;The constitution of the Republic of Moldova refers to the country's language as ''Moldovan'', whilst the 1991 [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] names the official language ''Romanian''. In December 2013, a decision of the [[Constitutional Court of Moldova]] ruled that the Declaration of Independence takes precedence over the Constitution and that the state language is therefore Romanian, not "Moldovan".

Furthermore, numerous [[Romanian diaspora|immigrant Romanian speakers]] are also scattered across many other regions and countries worldwide, most notably [[Italy]], the [[Iberian peninsula]] (both in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]), the [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]] ([[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]]), the [[British Isles]] (both in the [[United Kingdom]] as well as in [[Ireland]]), [[Scandinavia]] ([[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]), [[North America]] (most notably in the [[United States]] but also in [[Canada]]), [[Oceania]] (mainly [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) and [[South America]] (Mainly [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]).

Romanian descended from the [[Vulgar Latin]] spoken in the [[Roman province]]s of [[Southeastern Europe]].{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}} Roman inscriptions show that Latin was primarily used to the north of the so-called [[Jireček Line]] (a hypothetical boundary between the predominantly Latin- and Greek-speaking territories of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in the Roman Empire), but the exact territory where [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanian]] (or Common Romanian) developed cannot certainly be determined.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}}{{sfn|Andreose|Renzi|2013|pp=285–287}} Most regions where Romanian is now widely spoken{{mdash}}[[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]], [[Crișana]], [[Maramureș]], [[Moldova]], and significant parts of [[Muntenia]]{{mdash}}were not incorporated in the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Andreose|Renzi|2013|p=287}} Other regions{{mdash}}[[Banat]], western Muntenia, [[Oltenia]] and [[Transylvania]]{{mdash}}formed the Roman province of [[Dacia Traiana]] for about 170 years.{{sfn|Andreose|Renzi|2013|p=287}} According to the "continuity" theory, modern Romanian is the direct descendant of the Latin dialect of Dacia Traiana and developed primarily in the lands now forming [[Romania]]; the concurring "immigrationist" theory maintains that Proto-Romanian was spoken in the lands to the south of the Danube and Romanian-speakers settled in most parts of modern Romania only centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}}{{sfn|Andreose|Renzi|2013|p=287}}

Most scholars agree that two major dialects developed from Common Romanian by the 10th century.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}} Daco-Romanian (the official language of Romania and Moldova) and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] (a language spoken by no more than 2,000 people in [[Istria]]) descended from the northern dialect.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}} Two other languages, [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], developed from the southern version of Common Romanian.{{sfn|Petrucci|1999|p=4}} These two languages are now spoken in lands to the south of the Jireček Line.{{sfn|Andreose|Renzi|2013|p=287}}

The use of the denomination ''Romanian'' (''română'') for the language and use of the demonym ''Romanians'' (''Români'') for speakers of this language predates the foundation of the modern Romanian state. Although the followers of the former Romanian voievodships used to designate themselves as "Ardeleni" (or "Ungureni"), "Moldoveni" or "Munteni", the name of "rumână" or "rumâniască" for the Romanian language itself is attested earlier, during the 16th century, by various foreign travellers into the Carpathian Romance-speaking space,&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan Pascu, Documente străine despre români, ed. Arhivelor statului, București 1992, {{ISBN|973-95711-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in other historical documents written in Romanian at that time such as [[:ro:Letopisețul Țării Moldovei|Cronicile Țării Moldovei]] (''The Chronicles of the land of Moldova'') by [[Grigore Ureche]].

In 1534, [[Tranquillo Andronico]] notes: ''"Valachi nunc se Romanos vocant"'' (''The Wallachians are now calling themselves Romans'').&lt;ref&gt;Tranquillo Andronico în [https://www.google.com/books?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;id=a3UDAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Veress+Endre&amp;q=Romanos+vocant&amp;pgis=1#search Endre Veress, ''Fontes rerum transylvanicarum: Erdélyi történelmi források'', Történettudományi Intézet, Magyar Tudományos Akadémia, Budapest, 1914, S. 204]&lt;/ref&gt; Francesco della Valle writes in 1532 that Romanians ''are calling themselves Romans in their own language'', and he subsequently quotes the expression: ''"Știi Românește?"'' (''Do you know Romanian?'').&lt;ref&gt;''"...si dimandano in lingua loro Romei...se alcuno dimanda se sano parlare in la lingua valacca, dicono a questo in questo modo: Sti Rominest ? Che vol dire: Sai tu Romano ?..."'' în: Claudiu Isopescu, ''Notizie intorno ai romeni nella letteratura geografica italiana del Cinquecento'', în Bulletin de la Section Historique, XVI, 1929, p. 1- 90&lt;/ref&gt;

After travelling through [[Principality of Wallachia|Wallachia]], [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavia]] and [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvania]] [[Ferrante Capecci]] accounts in 1575 that the indigenous population of these regions call themselves "românești" (''"romanesci"'').&lt;ref&gt;''"Anzi essi si chiamano romanesci, e vogliono molti che erano mandati quì quei che erano dannati a cavar metalli..."'' în: Maria Holban, ''Călători străini despre Țările Române'', București, Editura Stiințifică, 1970, vol. II, pp.&amp;nbsp;158–161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Lescalopier]] writes in 1574 that those who live in Moldavia, Wallachia and the vast part of Transylvania, ''"se consideră adevărați urmași ai romanilor și-și numesc limba "românește", adică romana"'' (''they consider themselves as the descendants of the Romans and they name their language Romanian'').&lt;ref&gt;''"Tout ce pays: la Wallachie, la Moldavie et la plus part de la Transylvanie, a esté peuplé des colonies romaines du temps de Trajan l'empereur… Ceux du pays se disent vrais successeurs des Romains et nomment leur parler romanechte, c'est-à-dire romain ... "'' în Voyage fait par moy, Pierre Lescalopier l’an 1574 de Venise a Constantinople, în: Paul Cernovodeanu, ''Studii și materiale de istorie medievală'', IV, 1960, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Transylvanian Saxon]] [[Johann Lebel]] writes in 1542 that ''"Vlachi" se numeau între ei "Romuini"''&lt;ref&gt;''"Ex Vlachi Valachi, Romanenses Italiani,/Quorum reliquae Romanensi lingua utuntur.../Solo Romanos nomine, sine re, repraesentantes./Ideirco vulgariter Romuini sunt appelanti"'', Ioannes Lebelius, De opido Thalmus, Carmen Istoricum, Cibinii, 1779, p. 11 – 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Polish people|Polish]] chronicler [[Stanislaw Orzechowski]] (Orichovius) notes in 1554 that ''în limba lor "walachii" se numesc "romini"'' (''In their language the Wallachians call themselves Romini'').&lt;ref&gt;''"qui eorum lingua Romini ab Romanis, nostra Walachi, ab Italis appellantur"'' St. Orichovius, Annales polonici ab excessu Sigismundi, in I. Dlugossus, Historiae polonicae libri XII, col 1555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Croatian people|Croatian]] prelate and diplomat [[Antun Vrančić]] recorded in 1570 that ''"Vlachs in Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia designate themselves as "Romans"''&lt;ref&gt;''"...Valacchi, qui se Romanos nominant..." "Gens quae ear terras (Transsylvaniam, Moldaviam et Transalpinam) nostra aetate incolit, Valacchi sunt, eaque a Romania ducit originem, tametsi nomine longe alieno..."'' De situ Transsylvaniae, Moldaviae et Transaplinae, in Monumenta Hungariae Historica, Scriptores; II, Pesta, 1857, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hungarian people|Transylvanian Hungarian]] [[Martin Szentiványi]] in 1699 quotes the following: ''«Si noi sentem Rumeni»'' ("Și noi suntem români" – "We are Romans as well") and ''«Noi sentem di sange Rumena»'' ("Noi suntem de sânge român" – ''We are of Roman blood'').&lt;ref&gt;''"Valachos...dicunt enim communi modo loquendi: Sie noi sentem Rumeni: etiam nos sumus Romani. Item: Noi sentem di sange Rumena: Nos sumus de sanguine Romano"'' Martinus Szent-Ivany, Dissertatio Paralimpomenica rerum memorabilium Hungariae, Tyrnaviae, 1699, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[:ro:Palia de la Orăștie|Palia de la Orăștie]] (1582) stands written ''".[...] că văzum cum toate limbile au și înfluresc întru cuvintele slăvite a lui Dumnezeu numai noi '''românii''' pre limbă nu avem. Pentru aceia cu mare muncă scoasem de limba jidovească si grecească si srâbească pre limba '''românească''' 5 cărți ale lui Moisi prorocul si patru cărți și le dăruim voo frați '''rumâni''' și le-au scris în cheltuială multă... și le-au dăruit voo fraților '''români''',... și le-au scris voo fraților '''români'''"''&lt;ref&gt;Palia de la Orăștie (1581–1582), Bucuresti, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and in Letopisețul Țării Moldovei written by the Moldavian chronicler Grigore Ureche we can read: ''«În Țara Ardialului nu lăcuiesc numai unguri, ce și sași peste seamă de mulți și '''români''' peste tot locul...»'' ("In Transylvania there live not solely Hungarians or Saxons, but overwhelmingly many Romanians everywhere around.").&lt;ref&gt;Grigore Ureche, Letopisețul Țării Moldovei, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the oldest extant document written in Romanian remains [[Neacșu's letter]] (1521) and was written using Cyrillic letters (which remained in use up until the late 19th century). There are no records of any other documents written in Romanian from before 1521.

[[Miron Costin]], in his ''De neamul moldovenilor'' (1687), while noting that Moldavians, [[Wallachia]]ns, and the Romanians living in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] have the same origin, says that although people of Moldavia call themselves ''Moldavians'', they name their language ''Romanian'' (''românește'') instead of ''Moldavian'' (''moldovenește'').&lt;ref name=ConstantiniuSincer&gt;Constantiniu, Florin, ''O istorie sinceră a poporului român'' (''An honest history of the Romanian people''), Univers Enciclopedic, București, 1997, {{ISBN|97-3924-307-X}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dimitrie Cantemir]], in his ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'' (Berlin, 1714), points out that the inhabitants of Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania spoke the same language. He notes, however, some differences in accent and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;
''From [[s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'': "Valachiae et Transylvaniae incolis eadem est cum Moldavis lingua, pronunciatio tamen rudior, ut dziur, Vlachus proferet zur, jur, per z polonicum sive j gallicum; Dumnedzeu, Deus, val. Dumnezeu: akmu, nunc, val. akuma, aczela hic, val: ahela."&lt;/ref&gt;
Cantemir's work provides one of the earliest histories of the language, in which he notes, like [[Grigore Ureche|Ureche]] before him, the evolution from Latin and notices the Greek and Polish borrowings. Additionally, he introduces the idea that some words must have had [[Dacian language|Dacian]] roots. Cantemir also notes that while the idea of a Latin origin of the language was prevalent in his time, other scholars considered it to have derived from Italian.

The slow process of Romanian establishing itself as an official language, used in the public sphere, in literature and ecclesiastically, began in the late 15th century and ended in the early decades of the 18th century, by which time Romanian had begun to be regularly used by the Church. The oldest Romanian texts of a literary nature are religious manuscripts (''Codicele Voroneţean'', ''Psaltirea Scheiană''), translations of essential Christian texts. These are considered either propagandistic results of confessional rivalries, for instance between [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]], or as initiatives by Romanian monks stationed at [[Săpânţa|Peri Monastery]] in [[Maramureş]] to distance themselves from the influence of the [[Mukacheve]] eparchy in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Munteanu.

The language remains poorly attested during the Early Modern period.

{{further|National awakening of Romania}}
The first [[Romanian grammar]] was published in Vienna in 1780.&lt;ref name="Elementa"/&gt;
Following the [[Bessarabia#Annexation by the Russian Empire|annexation of Bessarabia by Russia]] (after 1812), Moldavian was established as an official language in the governmental institutions of [[Bessarabia]], used along with Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}''Charter for the organization of the Bessarabian Oblast'', 29 April 1818, in "Печатается по изданию: Полное собрание законов Российской империи. Собрание первое.", Vol 35. ''1818'', [[Sankt Petersburg]], 1830, pg. 222–227. Available online at [http://www.hrono.info/dokum/moldav1818.html hrono.info]&lt;/ref&gt;
The publishing works established by Archbishop [[Gavril Bănulescu-Bodoni]] were able to produce books and liturgical works in Moldavian between 1815–1820.&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles, ''The Moldovans'', [[Hoover Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|08-1799-792-X}}, pg. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic situation in Bessarabia from 1812 to 1918 was the gradual development of [[bilingualism]]. Russian continued to develop as the official language of privilege, whereas Romanian remained the principal vernacular.

The period from 1905 to 1917 was one of increasing linguistic conflict, with the re-awakening of Romanian national consciousness. In 1905 and 1906, the Bessarabian ''[[zemstvo|zemstva]]'' asked for the re-introduction of Romanian in schools as a "compulsory language", and the "liberty to teach in the mother language (Romanian language)". At the same time, Romanian-language newspapers and journals began to appear, such as ''Basarabia'' (1906), ''Viața Basarabiei'' (1907), ''Moldovanul'' (1907), ''Luminătorul'' (1908), ''Cuvînt moldovenesc'' (1913), ''Glasul Basarabiei'' (1913). From 1913, the synod permitted that "the churches in [[Bessarabia]] use the Romanian language".&lt;!--&lt;ref name="lidia" /&gt;--&gt;
Romanian finally became the official language with the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|Constitution of 1923]].

=== Historical grammar ===
Romanian has preserved a part of the [[Latin]] [[declension]], but whereas Latin had six [[Grammatical case|case]]s, from a morphological viewpoint, Romanian has only five: the [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], and marginally the [[vocative]]. Romanian nouns also preserve the neuter [[Grammatical gender|gender]], although instead of functioning as a separate gender with its own forms in adjectives, the Romanian neuter became a mixture of masculine and feminine. The [[verb]] morphology of Romanian has shown the same move towards a compound [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[future tense]] as the other Romance languages. Compared with the other [[Romance languages]], during its evolution, Romanian simplified the original Latin [[Grammatical tense|tense]] system in extreme ways,&lt;ref&gt;Yves D'hulst, Martine Coene, Larisa Avram, "Syncretic and analytic tenses in Romanian", in ''Balkan Syntax and Semantics'', pag. 366: "In its evolution, Romanian simplified the original Latin tense system in extreme ways."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}&lt;!-- According to the relevant Wiki article, it has five fully synthetic tenses and moods, as much as colloquial spoken French. It may be extreme in comparison to Spanish and Portuguese, but is it really much below Romance average? None of the descendants has inherited all twelve Latin forms sets or created many new ones. --&gt; in particular the absence of [[sequence of tenses]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves D'hulst et al., "Syncretic and analytic tenses in Romanian", in ''Balkan Syntax and Semantics'', p. 355: "general absence of consecutio temporum."&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian is spoken mostly in [[Central Europe|Central]] and the [[Balkans|Balkan region]] of Southern Europe, although speakers of the language can be found all over the world, mostly due to emigration of Romanian nationals and the return of immigrants to Romania back to their original countries. Romanian speakers account for 0.5% of the world's population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtil.unilat.org/LI/2005/ro/rezultatele_detaliate.htm |title=Latin Union – Languages and cultures online 2005 |publisher=Dtil.unilat.org |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4% of the Romance-speaking population of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html MSN Encarta – Languages Spoken by More Than 10 Million People] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029104855/http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |date=29 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian is the single official and national language in Romania and Moldova, although it shares the official status at regional level with other languages in the Moldovan autonomies of [[Gagauzia]] and Transnistria. Romanian is also an official language of the [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] in Serbia along with five other languages. Romanian minorities are encountered in Serbia ([[Timok Valley]]), Ukraine ([[Chernivtsi oblast|Chernivtsi]] and [[Odessa oblast]]s), and Hungary ([[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]]). Large immigrant communities are found in Italy, Spain, France, and Portugal.

In 1995, the largest Romanian-speaking community in the Middle East was found in Israel, where Romanian was spoken by 5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1993 ''Statistical Abstract of Israel'' there were 250,000 Romanian speakers in Israel, of a population of 5,548,523 in 1995 (census).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=110 |title=Reports of about 300,000 Jews that left the country after WW2 |publisher=Eurojewcong.org |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831192934/http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=110 |archivedate=31 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian is also spoken as a second language by people from Arabic-speaking countries who have studied in Romania. It is estimated that almost half a million Middle Eastern Arabs studied in Romania during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=185041 |title=Evenimentul Zilei |publisher=Evz.ro |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small Romanian-speaking communities are to be found in Kazakhstan and Russia. Romanian is also spoken within communities of Romanian and Moldovan immigrants in the United States, Canada and Australia, although they do not make up a large homogeneous community statewide.

=== Legal status ===
==== In Romania ====
According to the [[Constitution of Romania]] of 1991, as revised in 2003, Romanian is the official language of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=1 |title=Constitution of Romania |publisher=Cdep.ro |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania mandates the use of Romanian in official government publications, public education and legal contracts. Advertisements as well as other public messages must bear a translation of foreign words,&lt;ref&gt;Legea "[[George Pruteanu|Pruteanu]]": [http://www.cdep.ro/proiecte/2001/500/80/5/leg_pl585_01.pdf 500/2004 – Law on the Protection of the Romanian Language]&lt;/ref&gt; while trade signs and logos shall be written predominantly in Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 27 (3), Legea nr. 26/1990 privind Registrul Comerțului&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian Language Institute (''Institutul Limbii Române''), established by the Ministry of Education of Romania, promotes Romanian and supports people willing to study the language, working together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department for Romanians Abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.edu.ro/index.php/articles/c262/ |title=Ministry of Education of Romania |access-date=19 April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629192930/http://www.edu.ro/index.php/articles/c262/ |archive-date=29 June 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Moldova ====
{{Main|Moldovan language}}
Romanian is the official language of the Republic of Moldova.

In [[Hertsa Raion]] of Ukraine as well as in other villages of [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], Romanian has been declared a "regional language" alongside Ukrainian as per the 2012 [[legislation on languages in Ukraine]].

==== In other countries and organizations ====
{{See also|Romanian diaspora}}

Romanian is an official or administrative language in various communities and organisations, such as the [[Latin Union]] and the [[European Union]]. Romanian is also one of the five languages in which religious services are performed in the autonomous monastic state of [[Mount Athos]], spoken in the monk communities of [[Prodromos (Mount Athos)|Prodromos]] and [[Lacu (Mount Athos)|Lacu]]. In the unrecognised state of [[Transnistria]], Moldovan is one of the official languages. However, unlike all other dialects of Romanian, [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|this variety of Moldovan is written in Cyrillic Script]].

=== As a second and foreign language ===
Romanian is taught in some areas that have Romanian minority communities, such as [[Vojvodina]] in Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Hungary. The [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] (ICR) has since 1992 organised summer courses in Romanian for language teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=183071&amp;data=2005-08-19&amp;ziua=f08bdeacd2583ee59a42d5f08d1fba7e "Cursuri de perfecționare"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040246/http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=183071&amp;data=2005-08-19&amp;ziua=f08bdeacd2583ee59a42d5f08d1fba7e |date=25 February 2007 }}, ''[[Ziua]]'', 19 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-Romanians who study Romanian as a foreign language, for example the Nicolae Bălcescu High-school in [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], Hungary.

Romanian is taught as a [[foreign language]] in tertiary institutions, mostly in European countries such as Germany, France and Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as in the United States. Overall, it is taught as a foreign language in 43 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilr.ro/plr.php?lmb=1 "Data concerning the teaching of the Romanian language abroad"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207173432/http://www.ilr.ro/plr.php?lmb=1 |date=7 December 2010 }}, Romanian Language Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular culture ===
Romanian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Romanian language. Examples of Romanian acts that had a great success in non-Romanophone countries are the bands [[O-Zone]] (with their No. 1 single ''[[Dragostea Din Tei]]/Numa Numa'' across the world in 2003–2004), [[Akcent]] (popular in the Netherlands, Poland and other European countries), [[Activ (band)|Activ]] (successful in some Eastern European countries), [[DJ Project]] (popular as clubbing music) [[SunStroke Project]] (known by viral video "Epic sax guy") and [[Alexandra Stan]] (worldwide no.1 hit with "[[Mr. Saxobeat]])" and [[Inna (singer)|Inna]] as well as high-rated movies like ''[[4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days]]'', ''[[The Death of Mr. Lazarescu]]'', ''[[12:08 East of Bucharest]]'' or ''[[California Dreamin' (film)|California Dreamin']]'' (all of them with awards at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]).

Also some artists wrote songs dedicated to the Romanian language. The multiplatinum pop trio [[O-Zone]] (originally from Moldova) released a song called "''Nu mă las de limba noastră''" ("I won't forsake our language"). The final verse of this song, ''Eu nu mă las de limba noastră, de limba noastră cea română'' is translated in English as "I won't forsake our language, our Romanian language". Also, the Moldovan musicians [[Doina and Ion Aldea Teodorovici]] performed a song called "The Romanian language".

== Dialects ==
{{Main|Romanian dialects}}

The term "Romanian" is sometimes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508587/Romanian-language "Romanian language"], in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; used also in a more general sense, encompassing four varieties: (Daco-)Romanian, [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]]. When the term "Romanian" is used in this larger sense, the term "[[Daco-Romanian]]" is used for Romanian proper. The origin of the term "Daco-Romanian" can be traced back to the first printed book of Romanian grammar in 1780,&lt;ref name="Elementa"&gt;Samuil Micu, Gheorghe Șincai, ''Elementa linguae daco-romanae sive valachicae'', Vienna, 1780.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Samuil Micu]] and [[Gheorghe Șincai]]. There, the Romanian dialect spoken north of the [[Danube]] is called ''lingua Daco-Romana'' to emphasize its origin and its area of use, which includes the former [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] province of [[Dacia]], although it is spoken also south of the Danube, in [[Dobrudja]], [[Vlachs of Serbia|Central Serbia]] and northern Bulgaria.

This article deals with the Romanian (i.e. Daco-Romanian) language, and thus only its dialectal variations are discussed here. The differences between the regional varieties are small, limited to regular phonetic changes, few grammar aspects, and lexical particularities. There is a single written standard (literary) Romanian language used by all speakers, regardless of region. Like most natural languages, Romanian dialects are part of a [[dialect continuum]]. The dialects of Romanian are also referred to as ''subdialects'' (see [[Romanian dialects#Terminology|reasons for this terminology]]) and are distinguished primarily by phonetic differences. Romanians themselves speak of the differences as ''accents'' or ''speeches'' (in Romanian: ''accent'' or ''grai'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delyusto|first=Maryna|date=25 July 2016|title=Multi-Lingual Atlas of Dialects Spread Between the Danube and the Dniester Rivers: Sources and Tools of Creation|url=http://journals.univ-danubius.ro/index.php/research/article/view/3523|journal=Journal of Danubian Studies and Research|language=en|volume=6|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the criteria used for classifying these dialects, fewer or more are found, ranging from 2 to 20, although the most widespread approaches give a number of five dialects. These are grouped into two main types, southern and northern, further divided as follows:
* The southern type has only one member:
** the [[Wallachian dialect]], spoken in the southern part of Romania, in the historical regions of [[Muntenia]], [[Oltenia]] and the southern part of [[Northern Dobruja]], but also extending in the southern parts of [[Transylvania]].
* The northern type consists of several dialects:
** the [[Moldavian dialect]], spoken in the historical region of [[Moldavia]], now split among Romania, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine ([[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]]), as well as northern part of [[Northern Dobruja]];
** the [[Banat Romanian dialect|Banat dialect]], spoken in the historical region of [[Banat]], including parts of Serbia;
** a group of finely divided and transition-like [[Transylvanian varieties of Romanian|Transylvanian varieties]], among which two are most often distinguished, those of [[Crișana dialect|Crișana]] and [[Maramureș dialect|Maramureș]].

Over the last century, however, regional accents have been weakened due to mass communication and greater mobility.

== Classification ==
=== Romance language ===
{{See also|Romance languages}}
[[File:Romance languages and Romanian.png|thumb|upright=2.05|Romanian language in the Romance language family]]
Romanian is a Romance language, belonging to the [[Italic languages|Italic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], having much in common with languages such as French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref name=Stoica1&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=50|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/50/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the languages closest to Romanian are the other [[Eastern Romance languages]], spoken south of the Danube: [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]]. An alternative name for Romanian used by linguists to disambiguate with the other Eastern Romance languages is "Daco-Romanian", referring to the area where it is spoken (which corresponds roughly to the onetime [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Dacia]]).

Compared with the other Romance languages, the closest relative of Romanian is Italian;&lt;ref name=Stoica1/&gt; the two languages show a limited degree of asymmetrical [[mutual intelligibility]], especially in their cultivated forms: speakers of Romanian seem to understand Italian more easily than the other way around.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Romanian has obvious grammatical and [[lexical similarity|lexical similarities]] with French, [[Catalan language|Catalan]], Spanish and Portuguese, with a high phonological similarity with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in particular; however, it is not mutually intelligible with them to any practical extent.{{Citation needed|reason= can we add a source please?|date=November 2010}} Romanian speakers will usually need some formal study of basic grammar and vocabulary before being able to understand more than individual words and simple sentences in other Romance languages.{{Citation needed|reason= can we add a source please?|date=November 2010}} The same is true for speakers of these languages trying to understand Romanian.{{Citation needed|reason= can we add a source please?|date=November 2010}} Because of its separation from the other Romance languages, it has diverged from them and is an outlier in various ways, somewhat like English in regards to the other Germanic languages.

Romanian has had a greater share of foreign influence than some other Romance languages such as Italian in terms of vocabulary and other aspects. A study conducted by [[Mario Pei]] in 1949 which analyzed the degree of differentiation of languages from their parental language (in the case of [[Romance languages]] to [[Latin]] comparing [[phonology]], [[inflection]], [[discourse]], [[syntax]], [[vocabulary]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) produced the following percentages (the higher the percentage, the greater the distance from Latin):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Story of Language |last=Pei |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Pei |year=1949 |isbn=03-9700-400-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: 8%
* Italian: 12%
* Spanish: 20%
* Romanian: 23.5%
* [[Occitan language|Occitan]]: 25%
* Portuguese: 31%
* French: 44%

The [[lexical similarity]] of Romanian with Italian has been estimated at 77%, followed by French at 75%, Sardinian 74%, Catalan 73%, Portuguese and [[Rhaeto-Romance]] 72%, Spanish 71%.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue, [http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ron Romanian]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian vocabulary became predominantly influenced by French and, to a lesser extent, Italian in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandiuc|first=Corina|date=1 November 2014|title=Languages and cultures in contact: The French language and the maritime terminology|url=https://doaj.org/article/6eb325ddd1ea4f5eb41f3119f6ea3485|journal=Diversitate si Identitate Culturala in Europa|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|issn=2067-0931}}&lt;/ref&gt;


{{undue weight|date=November 2018}}
The [[Dacian language]] was an [[Indo-European language]] spoken by the ancient Dacians, mostly north of the Danube river but also in [[Moesia]] and other regions south of the Danube. It may have been the first language to influence the Latin spoken in Dacia, but little is known about it. Dacian is usually considered to have been a northern branch of the [[Thracian language]], and, like Thracian, Dacian was a [[satem language]]. 

About 300 words found only in Romanian or with a cognate in the [[Albanian language]] may be inherited from Dacian (for example: ''barză'' "[[stork]]", ''balaur'' "dragon", ''mal'' "shore", ''brânză'' "cheese").{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Some of these possibly Dacian words are related to pastoral life (for example, ''brânză'' "cheese"). Some linguists and historians have asserted that Albanians are Dacians who were not Romanized and migrated southward.&lt;ref name="georgiev"&gt;Vladimir Georgiev (Gheorghiev), {{ro icon}} ''Raporturile dintre limbile dacă, tracă și frigiană'', "Studii Clasice" Journal, II, 1960, 39–58&lt;/ref&gt;

A different view is that these non-Latin words with Albanian [[cognate]]s are not necessarily Dacian, but rather were brought into the territory that is modern Romania by Romance-speaking shepherds migrating north from Albania, Serbia, and northern Greece who became the Romanian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gottfried|last=Schramm|title=Ein Damn bricht.

=== Balkan language area ===
While most of Romanian grammar and morphology are based on Latin, there are some features that are shared only with other languages of the Balkans and not found in other Romance languages. The shared features of Romanian and the other languages of the [[balkan sprachbund|Balkan language area]] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], Greek, and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) include a suffixed [[Article (grammar)|definite article]], the [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] of genitive and dative case and the formation of the future and the alternation of infinitive with subjunctive constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mišeska Tomić |first=Olga |year=2006 |title=Balkan Sprachbund Morpho-Syntactic Features |publisher=Springer |ISBN=978-1-4020-4487-8 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schulte |first=Kim |editor1-last=Haspelmath|editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Tadmor |editor2-first=Uri | title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |year=2009 |pages=230–259 |chapter=Loanwords in Romanian |ISBN=978-3-11-021843-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a well-established scholarly theory, most Balkanisms could be traced back to the development of the Balkan Romance languages; these features were adopted by other languages due to [[language shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lindstedt | first =  J. | year = 2000 | chapter = Linguistic Balkanization: Contact-induced change by mutual reinforcement | pages = 235 | editor = D.

=== Slavic influence ===
{{Main|Slavic influence on Romanian}}
The Slavic influences on Romanian are especially noticeable at lexis, phonetics, morphology and syntax. About 20% of modern Romanian words are presently of Slavic origin. Based on 5765-8400 words, [[Moldavia]]n linguist Alexandru Cihac (1825-1887) and later Tinktin (1895-1925) estimated that the Romanian vocabulary consists of the following origins: 41-45% Slavic, 20-31% Latin, 17-8% Turkish, 11-8% Modern Greek, 10-6% Hungarian, 1% Albanian, but not all etymologies were found to be correct in Cihac's overestimate and many words missing, later [[Ion A.

Slavic tribes lived in the territory of present-day Romania during the early evolution of the language, [[Old Church Slavonic]] was the official language of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] until it was replaced by Romanian in the 18th century, and was used continuously as the [[Sacred language|liturgical language]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crișan |first1=Marius-Mircea |title=Dracula: An International Perspective |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319633664 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6x0-DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=official+language+old+church+slavonic+dracula&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj097eA0tneAhUEtosKHXfMB40Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=official |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of the introduction of Slavic in Dacia was similar to the appearance of various Germanic dialects in the Western Roman Empire, where Gallic Latin, Iberian Latin, and Northern Italian dialects became strongly Germanized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, due to the lower Romance-speaking populace in the East, Slavic remained spoken for much longer and did not die out immediately.

=== Other influences ===
Even before the 19th century, Romanian came in contact with several other languages. Some notable examples include:
* [[German language|German]]: ''cartof'' &lt; ''Kartoffel'' "potato", ''bere'' &lt; ''Bier'' "beer", ''șurub'' &lt; ''Schraube'' "screw", ''turn'' &lt; ''Turm'' "tower", ''ramă'' &lt; ''Rahmen'' "frame", ''muștiuc'' &lt; ''Mundstück''   "mouth piece", ''bormașină'' &lt; ''Bohrmaschine'' "drilling machine", ''cremșnit'' &lt; ''Kremschnitte'' "cream slice", ''șvaițer'' &lt; ''Schweizer'' "Swiss cheese", ''șlep'' &lt; ''Schleppkahn'' "barge", ''șpriț'' &lt; ''Spritzer'' "wine with soda water", ''abțibild'' &lt; ''Abziehbild'' "decal picture", ''șnițel'' &lt; ''Schnitzel'' "cutlet", ''șuncă'' &lt; dialectal ''Schunke'' (''Schinken'') "ham", ''punct'' &lt; ''Punkt'' "point", ''maistru'' &lt; ''Meister'' "master",  ''rundă'' &lt; ''Runde'' "round". 
Furthermore, during the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] and, later on, [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule of [[Banat]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Bukovina]], a large number of words were borrowed from [[Austrian German|Austrian High German]], in particular in fields such as the military, administration, social welfare, economy, etc.&lt;ref name="iit.iit.tuiasi.ro"&gt;Hans Dama, [http://iit.iit.tuiasi.ro/philippide/asociatia/asociatia_admin/upload/II_1_Dama.pdf "Lexikale Einflüsse im Rumänischen aus dem österreichischen Deutsch" ("Lexical influences of 'Austrian'-German on the Romanian Language")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818085432/http://iit.iit.tuiasi.ro/philippide/asociatia/asociatia_admin/upload/II_1_Dama.pdf |date=18 August 2011 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, German terms have been taken out of science and technics, like: ''șină'' &lt; ''Schiene'' "rail", ''știft'' &lt; ''Stift'' "peg", ''liță'' &lt; ''Litze'' "braid", ''șindrilă'' &lt; ''Schindel'' "shingle", ''ștanță'' &lt; ''Stanze'' "punch", ''șaibă'' &lt; ''Scheibe'' "washer", ''ștangă'' &lt; ''Stange'' "crossbar", ''țiglă'' &lt; ''Ziegel'' "tile", ''șmirghel'' &lt; ''Schmirgelpapier'' "emery paper";
* [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''folos'' &lt; ''ófelos'' "use", ''buzunar'' &lt; ''buzunára'' "pocket", ''proaspăt'' &lt; ''prósfatos'' "fresh", ''cutie'' &lt; ''cution'' "box", ''portocale'' &lt; ''portokalia'' "oranges". While Latin borrowed words of Greek origin, Romanian obtained Greek loanwords on its own. Greek entered Romanian through the ''[[apoikia]]i'' (colonies) and ''[[Emporium (antiquity)|emporia]]'' (trade stations) founded in and around [[Dobruja]], through the presence of [[Byzantine Empire]] in north of the [[Danube]], through [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] during Bulgarian Empires that converted Romanians to Orthodox Christianity, and after the Greek Civil War, when thousands of Greeks fled Greece.
* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''a cheltui'' &lt; ''költeni'' "to spend", ''a făgădui'' &lt; ''fogadni'' "to promise", ''a mântui'' &lt; ''menteni'' "to save", ''oraș'' &lt; ''város'' "city";
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''papuc'' &lt; ''pabuç'' "slipper", ''ciorbă'' &lt; ''çorba'' "wholemeal soup, sour soup", ''bacșiș'' &lt; ''bahşiş'' "tip" (ultimately from Persian ''[[baksheesh]]'');
* Additionally, the [[Romani language]] has provided a series of slang words to Romanian such as: ''mișto'' "good, beautiful, cool" &lt; ''mišto'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Zafiu |first=Rodica |year=2009 |title=Mișto și legenda bastonului |url=http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/mito_i_legenda_bastonului |magazine=România literară |number=6 |quote=There is no doubt among linguists about the Romany etymology of the Romanian word ''mișto'', but a fairly widespread folk etymology and urban legend maintains that the German phrase ''mit Stock'' 'with stick' would be its true origin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''gagică'' "girlie, girlfriend" &lt; ''[[Gadjo (non-Romani)|gadji]]'', ''a hali'' "to devour" &lt; ''halo'', ''mandea'' "yours truly" &lt; ''mande'', ''a mangli'' "to pilfer" &lt; ''manglo''.

In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Classical Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church, as Latin did hold an important position in [[Transylvania]] after the 11th century as it was part of Kingdom of Hungary, a Roman Catholic country, until it became part of Romania after [[World War I]].

Throughout the Middle Ages and well into the early modern period, most literate Romanian speakers, including Roman Catholics and Orthodox, were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words, along with Hungarian, into their writing—and eventually speech—in Romanian. Consequently, this led Romanian to include the least amount of Slavic loanwords from all other non-Slavic languages in the geographic vicinity of its linguistic areal.

=== French, Italian, and English loanwords ===
Since the 19th century, many literary or learned words were borrowed from the other Romance languages, especially from French and Italian (for example: ''birou'' "desk, office", ''avion'' "airplane", ''exploata'' "exploit"). It was estimated that about 38% of words in Romanian are of French and/or Italian origin (in many cases both languages); and adding this to Romanian's native stock, about 75%–85% of Romanian words can be traced to Latin. The use of these Romanianized French and Italian learned loans has tended to increase at the expense of Slavic loanwords, many of which have become rare or fallen out of use. As second or third languages, French and Italian themselves are better known in Romania than in Romania's neighbors. Along with the switch to the Latin alphabet in Moldova, the re-latinization of the vocabulary has tended to reinforce the Latin character of the language.

In the process of lexical modernization, much of the native Latin stock have acquired doublets from other [[Romance languages]], thus forming a further and more modern and literary lexical layer. Typically, the native word is a noun and the learned loan is an adjective. Some examples of doublets:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-

|-
|{{wiktla|agilis}} 'quick’
|{{wiktro|ager}} 'astute’

|-
|{{wiktla|rapidus}}
|{{wiktro|repede}} 'quick’
|{{wiktro|rapid}} 'quick' (&lt; Fr ''rapide'', It ''rapido'')
|}

In the 20th century, an increasing number of English words have been borrowed (such as: ''gem'' &lt; jam; ''interviu'' &lt; interview; ''meci'' &lt; match; ''manager'' &lt; manager; ''fotbal'' &lt; football; ''sandviș'' &lt; sandwich; ''bișniță'' &lt; business; ''chec'' &lt; cake). These words are assigned grammatical gender in Romanian and handled according to Romanian rules; thus "the manager" is ''managerul''. Some borrowings, for example in the computer field, appear to have awkward (perhaps contrived and ludicrous) 'Romanisation,' such as ''cookie-uri'' which is the plural of the Internet term ''cookie.''

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Romanian grammar}}

Overall, Romanian grammar is more conservative in its preservation of Latin grammatical constructs than other Romance languages. (Scholars disagree on the reasons for this.)

Romanian nouns are characterized by gender (feminine, masculine, and neuter), and [[Declension|declined]] by number (singular and plural) and case ([[nominative case|nominative]]/[[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]]/[[genitive case|genitive]] and [[vocative case|vocative]]). The articles, as well as most adjectives and pronouns, [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in gender, number and case with the noun they modify.

Romanian is the only Romance language where [[Article (grammar)|definite articles]] are [[enclitic]]: that is, attached to the end of the noun (as in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), instead of in front ([[proclitic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savescu|first=Oana|date=November 2012|title=When syncretism meets word order. On clitic order in Romanian.|url=|journal=International Journal of Latin and Romance Linguistics|volume=24 |issue=2|pages=233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were formed, as in other Romance languages, from the Latin demonstrative pronouns.

As in all Romance languages, Romanian verbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, mood, and voice. The usual word order in sentences is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO). Romanian has four verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] which further split into ten conjugation patterns. Verbs can be put in five [[mood (linguistics)|moods]] that are inflected for the person ([[indicative mood|indicative]], [[conditional mood|conditional]]/[[optative mood|optative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[presumptive mood|presumptive]]) and four impersonal moods ([[infinitive]], [[gerund]], [[supine]], and [[participle]]).

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Romanian phonology}}

Romanian has seven [[vowel]]s: {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ə/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}. Additionally, {{IPA|/ø/}} and {{IPA|/y/}} may appear in some [[Loanword|borrowed words]]. Arguably, the diphthongs {{IPA|/e̯a/}} and {{IPA|/o̯a/}} are also part of the phoneme set. There are twenty-two consonants. The two [[Approximant consonant|approximant]]s {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} can appear before or after any vowel, creating a large number of glide-vowel sequences which are, strictly speaking, not [[diphthong]]s.

In final positions after consonants, a short {{IPA|/i/}} can be deleted, surfacing only as the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding consonant (e.g., {{IPA|[mʲ]}}). Similarly, a deleted {{IPA|/u/}} may prompt [[labialization]] of a preceding consonant, though this has ceased to carry any morphological meaning.

=== Phonetic changes ===
{{Main|Latin-to-Romanian sound changes}}

Owing to its isolation from the other Romance languages, the phonetic evolution of Romanian was quite different, but the language does share a few changes with Italian, such as {{IPA|[kl]}} → {{IPA|[kj]}} (Lat. '''cl'''arus → Rom. '''chi'''ar, Ital. '''chi'''aro, Lat. clamare → Rom. ''che''mare, Ital. ''chi''amare) and {{IPA|[ɡl]}} → {{IPA|[ɡj]}} (Lat. *''gl''acia (''gl''acies) → Rom. ''ghe''ață, Ital. ''ghi''accia, ''ghi''accio, Lat. *un''gl''a (ungula) → Rom. un''ghi''e, Ital. un''ghi''a), although this did not go as far as it did in Italian with other similar clusters (Rom. ''pl''ace, Ital. ''pi''ace); another similarity with Italian is the change from {{IPA|[ke]}} or {{IPA|[ki]}} to {{IPA|[tʃe]}} or {{IPA|[tʃi]}} (Lat. pax, pa''ce''m → Rom. and Ital. pa''ce'', Lat. dul''ce''m → Rom. dul''ce'', Ital. dol''ce'', Lat. ''ci''rcus → Rom. ''ce''rc, Ital. ''ci''rco) and {{IPA|[ɡe]}} or {{IPA|[ɡi]}} to {{IPA|[dʒe]}} or {{IPA|[dʒi]}} (Lat. ''ge''lu → Rom. ''ge''r, Ital. ''ge''lo, Lat. mar''gi''nem → Rom. and Ital. mar''gi''ne, Lat. ''ge''mere → Rom. ''ge''me (''ge''mere), Ital. ''ge''mere). There are also a few changes shared with [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]], such as {{IPA|/ɡn/}} (probably phonetically {{IPA|[ŋn]}}) → {{IPA|[mn]}} (Lat. co'''gn'''atus → Rom. cu'''mn'''at, Dalm. co'''mn'''ut) and {{IPA|/ks/}} → {{IPA|[ps]}} in some situations (Lat. coxa → Rom. coa''ps''ă, Dalm. co''ps''a).

Among the notable phonetic changes are:
* diphthongization of e and o → ea and oa, before ă (or e as well, in the case of o) in the next syllable:
:* Lat. c'''e'''ra → Rom. c'''ea'''ră (wax)
:* Lat. s'''o'''le → Rom. s'''oa'''re (sun)
* [[iotation]] {{IPA|[e]}} → {{IPA|[ie]}} in the beginning of the word
:* Lat. h'''e'''rba → Rom. '''ia'''rbă (grass, herb)
* velar {{IPA|[k ɡ]}} → labial {{IPA|[p b m]}} before alveolar consonants and {{IPA|[w]}} (e.g. '''ngu''' → '''mb'''):
:* Lat. o'''ct'''o → Rom. o'''pt''' (eight)
:* Lat. li'''ng'''ua → Rom. li'''mb'''ă (tongue, language)
:* Lat. si'''gn'''um → Rom. se'''mn''' (sign)
:* Lat. co'''x'''a → Rom. coa'''ps'''ă (thigh)
* [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] {{IPA|[l]}} → {{IPA|[r]}} between vowels
:* Lat. cae'''l'''um → Rom. ce'''r''' (sky)
* Alveolars {{IPA|[d t]}} palatalized to {{IPA|[(d)z] [ts]}} when before short {{IPA|[e]}} or long {{IPA|[iː]}}
:* Lat. '''d'''eus → Rom. '''z'''eu (god)
:* Lat. '''t'''enem → Rom. '''ț'''ine (hold)

Romanian has entirely lost Latin {{IPA|/kw/}} ('''qu'''), turning it either into {{IPA|/p/}} (Lat. '''qu'''attuor → Rom.''patru'', "four"; cf. It. ''quattro'') or {{IPA|/k/}}  (Lat. '''qu'''ando → Rom.''când'', "when"; Lat. '''qu'''ale → Rom.''care'', "which"). In fact, in modern re-borrowings, it sometimes takes the German-like form /kv/, as in ''acvatic'', "aquatic". Notably, it also failed to develop the palatalised sounds {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, which exist at least historically in all other major Romance languages, and even in neighbouring non-Romance languages such as [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

== Writing system ==
[[File:Scrisoarea-lui-neacsu-din-campulung.jpg|thumb|[[Neacșu's letter]] is the oldest surviving document written in Romanian]]

The first written record about a [[Romance language]] spoken in the Middle Ages in the Balkans is from 587. A Vlach muleteer accompanying the Byzantine army noticed that the load was falling from one of the animals and shouted to a companion ''Torna, torna frate'' (meaning "Return, return brother!"), and, "sculca" (out of bed) . [[Theophanes Confessor]] recorded it as part of a 6th-century military expedition by [[Commentiolus]] and [[Priscus]] against the Avars and Slovenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1898 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature |publisher=A. and C.

[["Libri III de moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum"]] by [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin]] states that [[Richard I of Normandy]] was sent by his father [[William I Longsword]] to learn the [[Dacian language]] with [[Bothon]] because the inhabitants of [[Bayeux]] spoke more Dacian than [[Latin|Roman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/demoribusetacti00dudogoog#page/n224/mode/2up page 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving written text in Romanian is a letter from late June 1521,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKWpBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |title=Romanian Grammar |last=Sarlin |first=Mika |publisher=Books on Demand |year=2014 |isbn=9789522868985 |edition=2nd |location=Helsinki |page=15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Neacșu of [[Câmpulung]] wrote to the mayor of [[Brașov]] about an imminent attack of the Turks. It was written using the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]], like most early Romanian writings. The earliest surviving writing in Latin script was a late 16th-century [[Transylvania]]n text which was written with the [[Hungarian alphabet]] conventions.
[[File:Romanian-kirilitza-tatal-nostru.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|A sample of Romanian written in the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]], which was still in use in the early 19th century]]

In the 18th century, [[Transylvania]]n scholars noted the Latin origin of Romanian and adapted the [[Latin alphabet]] to the Romanian language, using some orthographic rules from [[Italian alphabet|Italian]], recognized as Romanian's closest relative. The Cyrillic alphabet remained in (gradually decreasing) use until 1860, when Romanian writing was first officially regulated.

In the [[Moldavian SSR|Soviet Republic of Moldova]], a special version of the Cyrillic alphabet derived from the Russian version was used until 1989, when Romanian language spoken there officially returned to the Romanian Latin alphabet, although in the breakaway territory of Transnistria the Cyrillic alphabet is used to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=Donald L.|date=1999|title=Some Influences of Russian on the Romanian of Moldova during the Soviet Period|jstor=309907|journal=The Slavic and East European Journal|volume=43|issue=1|pages=85–98|doi=10.2307/309907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

K, Q, W and Y, not part of the native alphabet, were officially introduced in the Romanian alphabet in 1982 and are mostly used to write loanwords like ''kilogram'', ''quasar'', ''watt'', and ''yoga''.

The Romanian alphabet is based on the [[Latin script]] with five additional letters {{lang|ro|[[Ă]]}}, {{lang|ro|[[Â]]}}, {{lang|ro|[[Î]]}}, {{lang|ro|[[Ș]]}}, {{lang|ro|[[Ț]]}}. Formerly, there were as many as 12 additional letters, but some of them were abolished in subsequent reforms. Also, until the early 20th century, a short vowel marker was used, which survives only in ă.

Today the Romanian alphabet is largely [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]]. However, the letters ''â'' and ''î'' both represent the same [[close central unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. ''Â'' is used only inside words;  ''î'' is used at the beginning or the end of non-compound words and in the middle of compound words. Another exception from a completely phonetic writing system is the fact that [[vowel]]s and their respective [[semivowel]]s are not distinguished in writing. In dictionaries the distinction is marked by separating the entry word into [[syllable]]s for words containing a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].

Stressed vowels also are not marked in writing, except very rarely in cases where by misplacing the stress a word might change its meaning and if the meaning is not obvious from the context. For example, ''trei copíi'' means "three children" while ''trei cópii'' means "three copies".

=== Pronunciation ===
[[File:Romanian keyboard letters.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A close shot of some keys with Romanian characters on the keyboard of a laptop]]

{{See also|Romanian alphabet#Î versus Â}}
* ''h'' is not silent like in other Romance languages such as Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan and French, but represents the phoneme {{IPA|/h/}}, except in the digraphs ''ch'' /k/ and ''gh'' /g/ (see below)
* ''j'' represents {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, as in French, Catalan or Portuguese (the sound spelled with ''s'' in the English words "vision, pleasure, treasure").
* There are two letters with a comma below, [[Ș]] and [[Ț]], which represent the sounds {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/t͡s/}}. However, the allographs with a cedilla instead of a comma, ''[[Ş]]'' and ''[[Ţ]]'', became widespread when pre-[[Unicode]] and early Unicode [[character sets]] did not include the standard form.
* A final orthographical ''i'' after a consonant often represents the palatalization of the consonant (e.g., ''lup'' {{IPA|/lup/}} "wolf" vs. ''lupi'' {{IPA|/lupʲ/}} "wolves") – it is ''not'' pronounced like Italian ''lupi'' (which also means "wolves"), and is an example of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence on Romanian.
* ''ă'' represents the [[schwa]], {{IPA|/ə/}}.
* ''î'' and ''â'' both represent the sound {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. In rapid speech (for example in the name of the country) the ''â'' sound may sound similar to a casual listener to the short [[schwa]] sound ''ă'' (in fact, [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] does merge the two, writing them ''ã'') but careful speakers will distinguish the sound. The nearest equivalent is the vowel in the last syllable of the word ''roses'' for some English speakers. It is also roughly equivalent to European Portuguese {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, the Polish ''y'' or the Russian ''ы''.
* The letter ''e'' generally represents the [[Mid front|mid front unrounded]] vowel {{IPA|[e]}}, somewhat like in the English word ''s'''e'''t''. However, the letter ''e'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[je]}} ([j] sounds like 'y' in 'you') when it is the first letter of any form of the verb ''a fi'' "to be", or of a personal pronoun, for instance ''este'' {{IPA|/jeste/}} "is" and ''el'' {{IPA|/jel/}} "he".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Several Romanian dictionaries specify the pronunciation [je] for word-initial letter ''e'' in some personal pronouns: [http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=el ''el'', ''ei'', etc.] and in some forms of the verb ''a fi'' (''to be''): [http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=fi ''este'', ''eram'', etc.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mioara Avram, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/georgepruteanu/carti/avram-ortog-pdf.zip&amp;date=2009-10-26+12:00:24 ''Ortografie pentru toți''], Editura Litera, Chișinău, 1997, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; This addition of the semivowel {{IPA|/j/}} does not occur in more recent loans and their derivatives, such as ''eră'' "era", ''electric'' "electric" etc. Some words (such as ''iepure'' "hare", formerly spelled ''epure'') are now written with the initial ''i'' to indicate the semivowel.
* ''x'' represents either the phoneme sequence {{IPA|/ks/}} as in ''expresie'' = expression, or {{IPA|/ɡz/}} as in ''exemplu'' = example, as in English.
* As in Italian, the letters ''c'' and ''g'' represent the affricates {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} before ''i'' and ''e'', and {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} elsewhere. When {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are followed by vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} (or their corresponding [[semivowel]]s or the final {{IPA|/ʲ/}}) the digraphs ''ch'' and ''gh'' are used instead of ''c'' and ''g'', as shown in the table below. Unlike Italian, however, Romanian uses ''ce-'' and ''ge-'' to write {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} before a back vowel instead of ''ci-'' and ''gi-''.

=== Punctuation and capitalization ===
Uses of punctuation peculiar to Romanian are:
* The quotation marks use the [[Quotation mark, non-English usage#Polish|Polish format]] in the format „quote «inside» quote", that is, „. . .“ for a normal quotation, and double angle symbols for a quotation inside a quotation.
* Proper quotations which span multiple paragraphs do not start each paragraph with the quotation marks; one single pair of quotation marks is always used, regardless of how many paragraphs are quoted.
* Dialogues are identified with [[Quotation mark, non-English usage#Quotation dash|quotation dashes]].
* The [[serial comma|Oxford comma]] before "and" is considered incorrect ("red, yellow and blue" is the proper format).
* Punctuation signs which follow a text in parentheses always follow the final bracket.
* In titles, only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, the rest of the title using sentence capitalization (with all its rules: proper names are capitalized as usual, etc.).
* Names of months and days are not capitalized (''ianuarie'' "January", ''joi'' "Thursday").
* Adjectives derived from proper names are not capitalized (''Germania'' "Germany", but ''german'' "German").

=== Spelling issues between Romania and Moldova ===
Prior to 2010, there existed a minor spelling difference between standard forms of Romanian language used in Romania and the variant (also called [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]) used in the Republic of Moldova—the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]] did not switch to the new spelling rules introduced by the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1993. In 2000, the Moldovan Academy recommended adopting the spelling rules used in Romania,&lt;ref&gt;The new edition of "Dicționarul ortografic al limbii române (ortoepic, morfologic, cu norme de punctuație)" – introduced by the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]] and recommended for publishing following a conference on 15 November 2000 – applies the decision of the General Meeting of the [[Romanian Academy]] from 17 February 1993, regarding the return to "â" and "sunt" in the orthography of the Romanian language. ([[:ro:Imagine:Asm lbro3.jpg|Introduction, Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova]])&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 the Academy launched a schedule for the transition to the new rules that was completed in 2011 (regarding publications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmoldova.md/ro/int/interview/gheorghe-duca-060410.html|title=Gheorghe Duca: Trebuie schimbată atitudinea de sorginte proletară față de savanți și în genere față de intelectuali|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=3 January 2011|language=Romanian|publisher=Allmoldova|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170555/http://www.allmoldova.md/ro/int/interview/gheorghe-duca-060410.html|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2016, Minister of Education Corina Fusu signed Order No. 872, adopting the revised spelling rules as recommended by the Moldovan Academy of Sciences, coming into force on the day of signing (due to be completed within two school years). From this day, the spelling as used by institutions subordinated to the ministry of education is in line with the spelling norms used in Romania since 1993. This order, however, has no application to other government institutions and neither has Law 3462 of 1989 (which provided for the means of transliterating of Cyrillic to Latin) been amended to reflect these changes; thus, these institutions continue to use the old spelling.

As of 2015, however, most Moldovan commercial websites maintain the 'old' spelling.

=== Examples of Romanian Text ===

: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
::''([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]])''

Romanian – highlighted words were inherited directly from Latin:
: '''Toate''' '''ființele''' umane '''se''' '''nasc''' libere '''și''' egale '''în''' demnitate '''și''' '''în''' '''drepturi'''. '''Ele''' '''sunt''' '''înzestrate''' '''cu''' rațiune '''și''' conștiință '''și''' trebuie '''să''' '''se''' comporte '''unele''' '''față''' '''de''' '''altele''' '''în''' spiritul fraternității.

Contemporary Romanian – highlighted words are French or Italian [[loanword]]s:
: Toate ființele '''umane''' se nasc '''libere''' și '''egale''' în '''demnitate''' și în drepturi. Ele sunt înzestrate cu '''rațiune''' și '''conștiință''' și trebuie să se '''comporte''' unele față de altele în '''spiritul''' '''fraternității'''.

Romanian, excluding French and Italian loanwords – highlighted words are Slavic loanwords:
: Toate ființele omenești se nasc '''slobode''' și '''deopotrivă''' în '''destoinicie''' și în drepturi. Ele sunt înzestrate cu înțelegere și cuget și '''trebuie''' să se poarte unele față de altele în '''duh''' de frățietate.

Romanian, excluding loanwords and having almost the same meaning:
: Toate ființele omenești se nasc nesupuse și asemenea în prețuire și în drepturi. Ele sunt înzestrate cu înțelegere și cuget și se cuvine să se poarte unele față de altele după firea frăției.

[[Image:Seal Eg.png|200px|thumb|left|Chinese characters for the words 'seal script' in [[regular script]] 
(left) and seal script (right).]]
'''Seal script''' ({{zh|t=篆書|p=zhuànshū}}) is an ancient [[Chinese script styles|style]] of writing [[Chinese characters]] that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BCE. It evolved organically out of the [[Zhou dynasty]] [[bronze script|script]]. The [[Qin (state)|Qin]] variant of seal script eventually became the standard, and was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. It was still widely used for decorative engraving and [[seal (East Asia)|seal]]s (name chops, or signets) in the [[Han dynasty]]. The literal translation of the Chinese name for seal script, {{lang|zh|篆書}} (''{{transl|zh|zhuànshū}}''), is ''decorative engraving script'', a name coined during the Han dynasty, which reflects the then-reduced role of the script for the writing of ceremonial inscriptions.

== Types ==
The general term '''seal script''' can be used to refer to several types of seal script, including the [[Large Seal Script|Large or Great Seal script]] ({{lang|zh|大篆}} ''{{transl|zh|Dàzhuàn}}''; Japanese ''{{transl|ja|daiten}}''; Korean ''{{transl|ko|daejeon}}''; Vietnamese  ''{{transl|vi|đại triện}}'') and the lesser or [[Xiaozhuan|Small Seal Script]] ({{lang|zh|小篆}} ''{{transl|zh|Xiǎozhuàn}}''; Japanese ''{{transl|ja|shōten}}''; Korean ''{{transl|ko|sojeon}}''; Vietnamese ''{{transl|vi|tiểu triện}}''). Most commonly, without any other clarifying terminology, it refers to the latter of these. The term ''Large Seal script'' itself can also cover a broad variety of scripts, including a variation of Qin writing earlier than the small seal characters, but also the earlier Western Zhou forms, or even oracle bone characters as well.  Since the term is an imprecise one, not clearly referring to any specific historical script and not used with any consensus in meaning, modern scholars tend to avoid it, and when referring to ''seal script'', generally mean the (small) seal script of the Qin system, that is, the lineage which evolved in the state of Qin during the Spring and Autumn&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Warring States period]] and which was standardized under the First Emperor.

== Evolution==
There were several different variants of seal script which developed independently in each kingdom during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. One of these, the [[Bird-worm seal script|"bird-worm" seal script]] ({{lang|zh|鳥蟲文}}), is named for its intricate decorations on the defining strokes, and was used in the Kingdoms of [[State of Wu|Wu]], [[State of Chu|Chu]], and [[State of Yue|Yue]]. It was found on several artifacts including the [[Spear of Fuchai]] and the [[Sword of Goujian]]. This seal script variant is very difficult to read.

As a southern state, Chu was close to the Wu-Yue influences. Chu produced broad bronze swords that were similar to Wuyue swords, but not as intricate. Chu also used the bird-worm style, which was borrowed by the Wu and Yue states.

== Unified small seal script==
{{main|Small Seal Script}}
[[File:XiaozhuanQinquan.jpg|320px|thumb|left|Small seal script [[epigraphy|epigraph]] on the standard weight prototype of [[Qin dynasty]]. Made from [[iron]], this prototype was unearthed in 1973 at [[Wendeng]], [[Shandong]] Province.]]
The script of the Qin system (the writing as exemplified in bronze inscriptions in the state of Qin before unification) had evolved organically from the Zhou script starting in the Spring and Autumn period.&lt;ref name="Chén Zhāoróng 2003"&gt;Chén Zhāoróng (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning around the Warring States period, it became vertically elongated with a regular appearance. This was the period of maturation of Small Seal script. It was systematized by prime minister [[Li Si]] during the reign of the First Emperor of China [[Qin Shi Huang]] through elimination of most variant structures, and was imposed as the nationwide standard.&lt;ref name="Chén Zhāoróng 2003"/&gt; Through Chinese commentaries, it is known that Li Si compiled the ''[[Cangjiepian]]'', a partially-extant wordbook listing some 3,300 [[Chinese characters]] in small seal script. Their form is characterized by being less rectangular and more squarish.

[[File:BronzePlaque-EdictOfSecondEmperor-Qin-ROM-May8-08.png|thumb|right|125px|Edict of the second Qin emperor, in seal script]]In the popular history of Chinese characters, the Small Seal script is traditionally considered to be the ancestor of the [[clerical script]], which in turn gave rise to all of the other scripts in use today. However, recent archaeological discoveries and scholarship have led some scholars to conclude that the direct ancestor of clerical script was proto-clerical script, which in turn evolved out of the little-known ''vulgar'' or ''popular'' writing of the late Warring States to Qin period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qiu Xigui]] ''Chinese Writing'' (2000). Translation of {{lang|zh|文字學概要}} by Gilbert L. Mattos and [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]]. Early China Special Monograph Series No. 4. Berkeley: The Society for the Study of  Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley. {{ISBN|1-55729-071-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known character [[dictionary]] was the 3rd century BC ''[[Erya]]'', collated and bibliographed by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] and his son [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]]. It is no longer extant. Not long after, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (AD 100&amp;ndash;121), the lifework of [[Xu Shen]], was written. Its 9,353 entries reproduce the standardized small-seal script variant for each entry, and for some entries other pre-Han variants from the late Zhou era. Entries are categorized under 540 [[Radical (Chinese character)|section headers]].

==Computer encoding==
It has been anticipated that the small seal script will some day be encoded in [[Unicode]]. Codepoints U+31400 to U+33D1F (Plane 3, Tertiary Ideographic Plane) have been tentatively allocated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/tip/ The Unicode Consortium, Roadmap to the TIP]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kandahārī Pashtō''' ({{lang-ps|کندهارۍ پښتو}}), also known as '''Southern Pashto''', '''Western Pashto''', or '''Southwestern Pashto''',&lt;ref&gt;Prods Oktor Skjærvø, P.O. 1989. Pashto. In "Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum", R. Schmitt (ed.), 384-410.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Pashto dialects|Pashto dialect]], spoken in southern and western [[Afghanistan]], including the city of [[Kandahar]]. It is similar with Quetta (Kakar) and Khattak dialects (95–100% similarities in vocabulary, and 80% with [[Yusufzai (Peshawari) Pashto|Yusufzai dialect]]). It is one of the most archaic and most prestigious varieties of [[Pashto language|Pashto]].

Kandahari Pashto is spoken in [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], [[Helmand Province|Helmand]], [[Ghazni]],  most of [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]], [[Farah Province|Farah]], and [[Nimruz Province|Nimruz]], [[Shinkot|southeastern]] [[Ghor Province|Ghor]], the districts of [[Murghab District|Murghab]], [[Ghormach District|Ghormach]], [[Muqur District, Badghis|Muqur]], and [[Jawand District|Jawand]] in [[Badghis Province|Badghis]], and parts of [[Zabul Province|Zabul]], [[Paktika Province|Paktika]], and [[Herat Province|Herat]] provinces of Afghanistan. It is also spoken in parts of the provinces of [[Razavi Khorasan]] and [[South Khorasan]] in [[Iran]], where they numbered roughly 120,000 (in 1993).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/country/ir/languages&lt;/ref&gt; Kandahari Pashto is almost same as the southeastern Pashto dialect, spoken in northern Balochistan including [[Quetta]] city, except for few phonetic differences.

The Kandahari dialect retains archaic retroflex [[Sibilant consonant|sibilants]], {{IPA|/ʂ/}} and {{IPA|/ʐ/}} (in other dialects, they have shifted to ʃ/x and ʒ/g). In the Quetta and Kakar dialects they change to ʃ and ʒ. Kandahari also has the affricates {{IPA|/t͡s/}} and {{IPA|/d͡z/}}.

TN was developed at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and was tested in multiple scenarios including the extraction of smoking status, family history of coronary artery disease, classify patients with sleep disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Development of an Algorithm to Identify Patients with Physician-Documented Insomnia |journal=Scientific Reports | year=2018 | last1=Kartoun et al.| first1=Uri| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25312-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;, improve the accuracy of the [[Framingham risk score]] for patients with [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]], and classify non-adherence to type-2 diabetes. A comprehensive review regarding extracting information from textual documents in the [[electronic health record]] is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18660887 |url=http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1268&amp;L=1&amp;pii=meme08010128&amp;no_cache=1 |year=2008 |author1=Meystre |first1=S.

TN combines two concepts: 1) human-interaction with narrative text to identify highly prevalent non-negated expressions, and 2) conversion of all expressions and notes into non-negated alphabetical-only representations to create homogeneous representations. The importance of using non-negated expressions to achieve an increased accuracy of text-based classifiers was emphasized in a letter published in Communications of the ACM in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/3273019 |title=More accurate text analysis for better patient outcomes |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=61 |issue=10 |pages=6–7 |year=2018 |author1=CACM Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional [[machine learning]] approaches for [[text classification]], a human expert is required to label phrases or entire notes, and then a [[supervised learning]] algorithm attempts to generalize the associations and apply them to new data. In contrast, using non-negated distinct expressions eliminates the need for an additional computational method to achieve generalizability.&lt;ref name=pmid28181568&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep42282 |pmid=28181568 |pmc=5299453 |title=Predictive Modeling of Physician-Patient Dynamics That Influence Sleep Medication Prescriptions and Clinical Decision-Making |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |pages=42282 |year=2017 |last1=Beam |first1=Andrew L |last2=Kartoun |first2=Uri |last3=Pai |first3=Jennifer K |last4=Chatterjee |first4=Arnaub K |last5=Fitzgerald |first5=Timothy P |last6=Shaw |first6=Stanley Y |last7=Kohane |first7=Isaac S |bibcode=2017NatSR...742282B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29085919&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hep4.1051 |pmid=29085919 |pmc=5659323 |title=Model for end-stage liver disease Na Score predicts incident major cardiovascular events in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease |journal=Hepatology Communications |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=429–438 |year=2017 |last1=Simon |first1=Tracey G |last2=Kartoun |first2=Uri |last3=Zheng |first3=Hui |last4=Chan |first4=Andrew T |last5=Chung |first5=Raymond T |last6=Shaw |first6=Stanley |last7=Corey |first7=Kathleen E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26925881&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ajg.2016.44 |pmid=26925881 |pmc=4864030 |title=Using an Electronic Medical Records Database to Identify Non-Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease |journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=111 |issue=5 |pages=671–6 |year=2016 |last1=Corey |first1=Kathleen E |last2=Kartoun |first2=Uri |last3=Zheng |first3=Hui |last4=Chung |first4=Raymond T |last5=Shaw |first5=Stanley Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source code==
A sample code for extracting smoking status from narrative notes using "nailed expressions" is available in [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/kartoun/text-nailing&lt;/ref&gt;

==TN as progressive cyber-human intelligence==
In July 2018 researchers from [[Virginia Tech]] and [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] referred TN as an example for progressive cyber-human intelligence (PCHI).&lt;ref&gt;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3231559&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of machine learning in health care==
Chen &amp; Asch 2017 wrote "With machine learning situated at the peak of inflated expectations, we can soften a subsequent crash into a “trough of disillusionment” by fostering a stronger appreciation of the technology’s capabilities and limitations."&lt;ref name=pmid28657867&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1702071 |pmid=28657867 |title=Machine Learning and Prediction in Medicine — Beyond the Peak of Inflated Expectations |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=376 |issue=26 |pages=2507–9 |year=2017 |last1=Chen |first1=Jonathan H |last2=Asch |first2=Steven M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter published in [[Communications of the ACM]], "Beyond brute force", emphasized that a brute force approach may perform better than traditional machine learning algorithms when applied to text. The letter stated "... machine learning algorithms, when applied to text, rely on the assumption that any language includes an infinite number of possible expressions. In contrast, across a variety of medical conditions, we observed that clinicians tend to use the same expressions to describe patients' conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/3135241 |title=Beyond brute force |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=8–9 |year=2017 |author1=CACM Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his viewpoint published in June 2018 concerning slow adoption of data-driven findings in medicine, Uri Kartoun, co-creator of Text Nailing states that " ...Text Nailing raised skepticism in reviewers of medical informatics journals who claimed that it relies on simple tricks to simplify the text, and leans heavily on human annotation. TN indeed may seem just like a trick of the light at ﬁrst glance, but it is actually a fairly sophisticated method that ﬁnally caught the attention of more adventurous reviewers and editors who ultimately accepted it for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Toward an accelerated adoption of data-driven findings in medicine |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy | year=2018 | last1=Kartoun| first1=Uri| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11019-018-9845-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The human in-the-loop process is a way to generate features using domain experts. Using domain experts to come up with features is not a novel concept. However, the specific interfaces and method which helps the domain experts create the features are most likely novel.

In this case the features the experts create are equivalent to regular expressions. Removing non-alphabetical characters and matching on "smokesppd" is equal to the regular expression /smokes[^a-zA-Z]*ppd/. Using regular expressions as features for text classification is not novel.

Given these features the classifier is a manually set threshold by the authors, decided by the performance on a set of documents. This is a classifier, it's just that the parameters of the classifier, in this case a threshold, is set manually. Given the same features and documents almost any machine learning algorithm should be able to find the same threshold or (more likely) a better one.

The authors note that using support vector machines (SVM) and hundreds of documents give inferior performance, but does not specify which features or documents the SVM was trained/tested on. A fair comparison would use the same features and document sets as those used by the manual threshold classifier.

In 1856, [[Karl Graul|Dr. Karl Graul]] published the Kural text in German, with later translated it into Latin and simple Tamil in 1865. In 1865, an unknown author made the third Latin translation of the Kural text titled ''Tiruvalluvar Kural Versione Lationa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Criticisms on translations==
Modern scholars have noticed several mistranslations in the Latin translation by Father Beshi. According to V. Ramasamy, "Beschi is purposely distorting the message of the original when he renders பிறவாழி as ‘the sea of miserable life’ and the phrase பிறவிப்பெருங்கடல் as ‘sea of this birth’ which has been translated by others as ‘the sea of many births’. Beschi means thus ‘those who swim the vast sea of miseries’. The concept of rebirth or many births for the same soul is contrary to Christian principle and belief".&lt;ref name="OnTranslatingTirukkural"/&gt;

The '''Touo''' language is spoken over the southern part of [[Rendova Island]],  located in the [[Western Province (Solomon Islands)|Western Province]] of the [[Solomon Islands]].

Touo belongs to the [[Central Solomons languages|Central Solomons group]] of the [[East Papuan languages|Papuan languages]]. All the surrounding languages to Touo belong to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic subgroup]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].

The Touo language is sometimes called the ''Baniata'' or ''Lokuru'' language, after the largest two villages where the language is spoken. The word ''Touo'' comes from the [[ethnonym]] that Touo speakers use to refer to themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1595">'''Uaithne Ó Cobhthaigh''' (murdered 1556) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] poet.

==Biography==

[[Ó Cobhthaigh]] was a member of a [[hereditary]] [[bard]]ic family based in what is now [[County Westmeath]]. His father's name was William.

According to the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], in 1556 ''Owny, the son of William O'Coffey, the most learned in Ireland in poetry, was treacherously slain at night, at Baile-an-luig in Magh-bhachla, but it is not known by whom.'' The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' states that "he was murdered, with his wife, at Ballinlig, [[Westmeath]]."

==Verse==

At least two of his poems are [[extant taxon|extant]]: ''Mó ná iarla anim Shémais''/''Greater than an earl is the name of James'', and the [[theological]] poem, ''Fada an cuimhne so ar choir nDe''/''Long be this rememberence on the [[justice]] of [[God]]'', which consists of one hundred and sixty verses.

'''''Vital Speeches of the Day''''' is a monthly [[magazine]] that presents [[Public speaking|speeches]] and other public addresses in full.

== Overview ==
''Vital Speeches'' was established in [[New York City]] in 1934 by Thomas Daly &amp;mdash; whose grandson Thomas Daly III moved publication to [[South Carolina]] in 1986&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Bruce Smith. "In world of flux, magazine unswayed: publication ignores sound-bite trend," ''The State'' (Columbia, SC), October 28, 1995, page B8.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; and is published by [[Pro Rhetoric, LLC]].

The magazine first appeared in February, 1935; its first issue included speeches by then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], [[David L. Lawrence|David Lawrence]], legal expert [[Ferdinand Pecora]], and [[economics|economist]] and [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref name="currentmags"&gt;"In Current Magazines" (column), ''The Dallas Morning News'', February 10, 1935, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1995, the magazine had published speeches by every president since Roosevelt, although the publication avoided [[political campaign|campaign speeches]]. Its editor, Thomas Daly IV, said of such speeches, "A lot of that is hot air."&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

According to their policy statement:
:The publisher of ''Vital Speeches'' believes that the important addresses of the recognized leaders of public opinion constitute the best expression of contemporary thought in America, and that it is extremely important for the welfare of the nation that these speeches be permanently recorded and disseminated. The publisher has no axe to grind. ''Vital Speeches'' will be found authentic and constructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2006 | title = Policy of Vital Speeches | journal = Vital Speeches of the Day | volume = LXXII | issue = 14-15 | pages = 418 | issn=0042-742X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The periodical is included in various guides to reference works. These guides typically describe ''Vital Speeches'' in politically neutral terms, as when ''Guide to Reference Materials'' offered this summary: "Each semimonthly issue contains the full text of some 12 to 15 addresses on public issues delivered by important figures. The editors attempt to select speeches pertaining to all sides of controversial issues."&lt;ref name="grm"&gt;"1069. Vital Speeches of the Day," ''Guide to Reference Materials''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, descriptions of specialty collections of speeches often compare the collection favorably to the content of ''Vital Speeches''.

In January 2009, the magazine launched ''Vital Speeches International'' which compiles English-language texts from outside the United States.

All the areas are situated south of the town of [[Gävle]] and most are areas constructed during the [[Million Programme]] (MP), although there are towns north of Gävle having MP areas they do not experience the crime rate of some southern MP areas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|title=Utsatta områden - sociala risker, kollektiv förmåga och oönskade händelser|last=|first=|publisher=Police in Sweden - Nationella Operativa Avdelningen - December 2015|year=|isbn=|location=|page=21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819054415/https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|archive-date=19 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
A vulnerable area is described as being geographically defined and having a low socioeconomic status and criminals negatively affecting society. The three categories of vulnerable area are divided along level of severity: vulnerable area, risk area and especially vulnerable area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|title=Utsatta områden - sociala risker, kollektiv förmåga och oönskade händelser|last=|first=|publisher=Police in Sweden - Nationella Operativa Avdelningen - December 2015|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=13–14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819054415/https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|archive-date=19 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These areas are sometimes called no-go zones as emergency services such as fire engines and [[ambulance]]s cannot drive into these areas during a tense situation without a police escort as they will be attacked by criminal gangs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The population in these areas have higher rates of unemployment, whereas about 67% of the general population has employment, the share in vulnerable areas is about 49%.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/GVLRV/Svensk-politi-skulle-ta-tilbake-kontrollen-over-utsatte-bydeler-fra-kriminelle-To-ar-senere-er-situasjonen-blitt-enda-verre-|title=Svensk politi skulle ta tilbake kontrollen over lovløse områder. To år senere er situasjonen blitt enda verre.|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 report by [[Swedish Defence University]] , of those who have travelled from Sweden to conflict zones to participate in terrorist activities, 70% were residents in vulnerable areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=6717191|title=Terrorresenärer ofta från utsatta områden - Nyheter (Ekot)|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 report by [[Sveriges Television|Swedish Television]], the overall trend is that these areas are improving. Employment rates, income and school results are generally rising.&lt;ref name="SVTstat"/&gt;

Vulnerable areas have a low participation in election, where for instance in the Gårdsten district in Gothenburg only a third voted in the [[Swedish general election, 2014|2014 election]]. Journalists who visited Gårdsten to interview locals on why they didn't vote struggled to complete their task as many locals they encountered spoke neither Swedish nor English.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hemhyra.se/nyheter/har-struntar-varannan-valet/|title=Här struntar varannan i valet|last=|first=|date=|work=Hem &amp; Hyra|access-date=2018-06-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623094651/https://www.hemhyra.se/nyheter/har-struntar-varannan-valet/|archive-date=23 June 2018|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Japanese economist Takaaki Mitsuhashi, foreigners primarily from Africa and the Middle East have settled in districts which they then proceeded to take over. Having visited vulnerable area [[Husby, Stockholm|Husby]], he described it as "whatever it was, it wasn't Sweden".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2018/08/11/japan-valkomnar-fler-utlandska-arbetare-men-kritiker-namner-sverige-som-varnande|title=Japan välkomnar fler utländska arbetare, men kritiker nämner Sverige som varnande exempel: "Utlänningarna är välkomna, men jag vet inte om de passar så bra att stå i butiker"|last=|first=|date=12 August 2018|work=Yle|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2018 gang violence, which had long been a feature of vulnerable areas, had begun to spill out into the wider society where hospital staff reported armed confrontations in emergency rooms and school authorities reported that threats and weapons having become commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/world/europe/sweden-crime-immigration-hand-grenades.html|title=Hand Grenades and Gang Violence Rattle Sweden’s Middle Class|last=Anderson|first=Ellen Barry and Christina|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Vulnerable area ===
An area in the vulnerable category is characterised by a low socioeconomic status and where criminals have a negative impact on society and public institutions. Criminals may use direct threats and [[blackmail]] or indirect methods such as public displays of violence which place bystanders at risk of injury or [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics openly traded]] in public spaces. The effect of their activities is that inhabitants experience lower levels of security which may make them less willing to participate or witness in judicial proceedings against criminals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|title=Utsatta områden - sociala risker, kollektiv förmåga och oönskade händelser|last=|first=|publisher=Police in Sweden - Nationella Operativa Avdelningen - December 2015|year=|isbn=|location=|page=13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819054415/https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|archive-date=19 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Especially vulnerable area ===
An area in this category is characterised by inhabitants having a potential threat from criminals in the area which has led to an overall disinclination to participate in judicial proceedings against criminals. In especially vulnerable areas there are systematic threats and violence against witnesses and plaintiffs. These circumstances make it very difficult or impossible for police organisations to complete [[Law enforcement|their mission]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In December 2015 these areas numbered 15.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In June 2017 these areas numbered 23 as some areas were reclassified primarily due to more refined information, not that the situation changed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6721866|title=Voices from a new "vulnerable area" - Radio Sweden|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An especially vulnerable area may to a certain extent also experience&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12525">The '''Wiseman hypothesis''', sometimes called the '''tablet theory''', is a  theory of the authorship and composition of the [[Book of Genesis]] which suggests that [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]] compiled Genesis from tablets handed down through Abraham and the other patriarchs. Originally advocated by P. J. Wiseman (1888&amp;ndash;1948) in his ''New discoveries in Babylonia about Genesis'' (1936) and republished by Wiseman's son, [[Donald Wiseman]], as ''Ancient records and the structure of Genesis: A case for literary unity'' in 1985, the hypothesis received some support from [[R. K. Harrison]] (1969) but otherwise remained without acceptance in [[Biblical criticism|scholarly circles]].

==History==

===P. J. Wiseman===
Air Commodore P. J. Wiseman, a British officer who visited many active archaeological sites during his career in the Middle East, found that ancient narrative tablets usually ended in [[colophon (publishing)|colophons]] which had a very specific format consisting of three parts; 1) "this has been the history/book/genealogy  of...", 2) the name of the person who wrote or owned the tablet, and 3) a date (such as "in the year of the great earthquake," or "the 3rd year of king so-and-so", etc.  Wiseman noted that there are eleven phrases in Genesis which have the same colophon format, which have long been identified as the ''toledoth'' (Hebrew for "generations") passages; the Book is generally divided thematically along the lines of the toledot.&lt;ref&gt;These are Genesis 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10; 11:27; 25:12; 25:19; 36:1; 36:9; 37:2&lt;/ref&gt; What Wiseman brought new to the table was the idea that these apparent colophons indicated that Genesis had originally been a collection of narrative clay tablets written in cuneiform, like the ancient tablets he had seen, which Moses had edited into a single document on parchment or papyrus.  This is in contrast with traditional views that Moses wrote Genesis entirely on his own without any outside sources and with the [[Documentary hypothesis]] that Genesis was compiled by much later and unknown [[Documentary hypothesis#R, Redactor|redactors]].{{sfn|Wiseman|1958|p=40}}

Once a link had been made between the tolodoth in Genesis and the ancient colophons, another point became apparent.  Just as the colophons came at the end of the narratives, so too, the tolodoths may come at the end of narratives.  Thus the first of these toledoth passages, Genesis 2:4, refers to the preceding Creation account beginning in Genesis 1, rather than being the introduction to the succeeding account.  The traditional understanding has been that since nearly all the tolodoths are immediately followed by a list of descendants of the person named in the tolodoth, then the tolodoths were thought to be the beginning of sections in Genesis.{{sfn|Wiseman|1958|p=40}}

In his ''Creation Revealed in Six Days'', P. J. Wiseman argued that the [[Genesis creation narrative|days of creation]] represented the time period in which God took to reveal his work of creation, and that Genesis 1 "is an account of what 'God said' about the things 'God made'... it is His revelation to men about His creative acts in time past."{{sfn|Wiseman|1958|p=40}}

===R. K. Harrison===
[[R. K. Harrison]] in his ''Introduction to the Old Testament'' wrote approvingly of [Wiseman's] approach which "had the distinct advantage of relating the ancient Mesopotamian sources underlying Genesis to an authentic Mesopotamian life-situation, unlike the attempts of the Graf–Wellhausen school, and showed that the methods of writing and compilation employed in Genesis were in essential harmony with the processes current among the scribes of ancient Babylonia."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1969|p=64}}. See also Harrison's elucidation of the use of colophons in Genesis, and their archaeological background, on pp. 543–552.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison noted that these examples had been discounted by scholars who follow Wellhausen and the [[Documentary hypothesis]], since the central basis of the Documentary hypothesis is that the Pentateuch is mostly a work composed by unknown editors and authors who lived much later than the time of Moses. {{sfn|Harrison|1969| p=545}}

===Donald Wiseman===
[[Donald Wiseman]] noted in the foreword to the revised edition of his father’s book that since it had first been written (1936) many more colophons have been discovered among Babylonian cuneiform texts{{sfn|Hunger|1968}}{{sfn|Leichty|1964|pp=147-54}} which substantiated the use of this scribal device. Texts from Syria and Mesopotamia&lt;ref&gt;notably the finds in 1975–76 from Tell Mardih (Ebla) and, from a millennium later, the Akkadian texts from Ras Shamra (Ugarit)&lt;/ref&gt; show continuity in tradition of scribal education and literary practices for more than two millennia, giving fixed and dated points.  He particularly valued the implication of this theory for the early use of writing.  Genesis 1-37 could be a transcript of the oldest written records.{{sfn|Wiseman|1985|pp=8,9}}

==Tablets in Genesis==
This is a breakdown of Genesis into 'tablets' delineated by colophons according to Wiseman's theory.{{sfn|Wiseman|1985| pp=79-80}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1990|pp=8–9}}, note: this author’s list of the same 11 tablets differs from A. J. and Donald Wiseman’s list over choice of beginning and ending verses for some tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Biblical scholar [[Victor P. Hamilton|Victor Hamilton]] states that Wiseman's hypothesis was "the first concerted attempt to challenge the hypothesis" of introductory colophons. Hamilton does however identify several problems with what he terms the "Wiseman-Harrison approach". Firstly, "in five instances where the formula precedes a genealogy ..., it is difficult not to include the colophon with what follows." Secondly, the approach requires the "unlikely" explanation that "Ishmael was responsible for preserving the history of Abraham", Isaac for Ishmael's history, Esau for Jacob's and Jacob for Esau's. The third problem he identifies is that Genesis is narrative, not biographical, as that approach would suggest.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp =8-11}}

[[Herbert M. Wolf]] describes the theory as "an attractive one", but suggests that it has "serious shortcomings". Firstly, he suggests  that ''toledoth'' almost always fit more naturally with the verses that they precede than with the verses that precede them. Secondly he doubts if Moses would be able to read writing made before the [[Tower of Babel]]. Thirdly he also suggests that the pairings of preservers and preserved histories are "unlikely", given the "rivalry and jealousy" involved and the lack of contact between Esau and Jacob.{{sfn|Wolf|2007|p=65}}
''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Old Testament'' says that Wiseman's view is "unconvincing" and distinguishes between the Babylonian colophons and the ''toledoth'' of Genesis, in that the colophon is a repetition, not a description of contents, the owner named is the current owner, not the original, and the colophons do not use the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] equivalent of the ''toledoth'' as part of their formula.{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|Baker|Blaising|1985|p=22}}

'''Yuantang''' is [[language game]] spoken by [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] speakers at [[Yuantang]] ({{Zh|c=苑塘}}), a village in [[Northern and southern China|southern China]]. It is also known as the ''snake language''{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

==Rules==
Example : 食饭 → 手习花散 [sit fan] → [siu jit fa san]; eat (rice) → ''hand + learn + flower + separation''.

Clearly, the words 食 and 饭 are each split into two sounds, the initial and the rime, thus 食 [sit] is made up of the initial of 手 [s] and the rime of 习 [it], and similarly, 饭 [fan] is [f] from 花 and [an] from 散. This is similar to the traditional Chinese practice of representing sounds by two characters known as [[fanqie]].
&lt;br&gt;
This practice also resembles [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], another Sinitic language, in its process of splitting a monosyllabic word into two syllables. A similar process is also found in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].

==History==
There is no solid evidence for the original of Yuantang. But it is believed to be an invention of a local intellectual in [[Qing dynasty]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
