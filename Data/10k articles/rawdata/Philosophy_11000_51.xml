'''5Rhythms'''&lt;ref group=uspto&gt;USPTO registration # &amp;nbsp;'''3157101'''http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/European Union Registration #'''&amp;nbsp;005669874'''https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/005669874  &lt;/ref&gt; is a movement meditation practice devised by [[Gabrielle Roth]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=North|first=Madelaine|title=TALK OF THE TOWN: Just do it Rhythm is a dancer
|work=Independent on Sunday|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20050220/ai_n9771257|date=20 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It draws from indigenous and world traditions using tenets of [[shamanism|shamanistic]], [[ecstatic dance|ecstatic]], mystical and [[eastern philosophy]].  It also draws from [[Gestalt therapy]], the human potential movement and [[transpersonal psychology]].
Fundamental to the practice is the idea that everything is energy, and moves in waves, [[Patterns in nature|patterns]] and rhythms.

Roth describes the practice as a soul journey, and says that by moving the body, releasing the heart, and freeing the mind, one can connect to the essence of the soul, the source of inspiration in which an individual has unlimited possibility and potential.

==The practice==
The practice of the 5Rhythms is said by [[Gabrielle Roth]] to put the body in motion in order to still the mind. The five rhythms (in order) are Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical and Stillness.&lt;ref group=uspto&gt;USPTO Registration #'''&amp;nbsp;4840073''' European Union (https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/)  Registration #&amp;nbsp;'''014276281'''&lt;/ref&gt; The 5Rhythms, when danced in sequence, are known as a "Wave." A typical Wave takes about an hour to dance.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Roth. ''Maps to Ecstasy'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer workshops may, according to ''The Dancing Path'', explore emotion, the cycle of life, the ego, relationships and spiritual vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabrielleroth.com/ |work=5 rhythms global |title=The Dancing Path |accessdate=28 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912075641/http://www.gabrielleroth.com/ |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 5Rhythms Maps==

The work is taught through a series of maps that explore the terrain of the inner and outer worlds of individuals, their relationships to others and the space around them. The maps offer a soul journey by exploring embodiment, emotions, the life cycle, the psyche, and the archetypes. The rhythms offer understanding of people's innate powers – being, loving, knowing, seeing and healing.&lt;ref name="Maps"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Maps of the 5Rhythms |url=https://www.5rhythms.com/gabrielle-roths-5rhythms/workshops/ |publisher=5Rhythms |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first map, "Waves" teaches embodiment of the five distinct rhythms. To embody the rhythms means to access the deep internal wisdom that human bodies contain. The "Heartbeat" map teaches how people have embodied and how they express the emotions of fear, anger, sadness, joy and compassion; while the "Cycles" map provides insight and understanding about how one has internalized conditioning and relationships throughout the life cycle, specifically in the stages of birth, childhood, puberty, maturity and death. Insight and understanding of the ego is delivered through the psyche map, "Mirrors".&lt;ref name="Maps"/&gt;

Roth drew a circular "Medicine Mandala" that related each rhythm to an emotion, a stage of life, a way of perceiving, and an aspect of the self.&lt;ref name="Mandala"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gabrielle Roth's 5Rhythms |url=https://www.5rhythms.com/gabrielle-roths-5rhythms/ |publisher=5Rhythms |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and teachers==
Roth founded ''The Moving Center''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.5rhythms.com/the-moving-center-new-york/|title=The Moving Center NY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York in 1977 as a base for her workshops, and to train and develop teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5rhythms.com/the-moving-center-new-york/ 5Rhythms: Moving Center New York].

The [[5Rhythms Teachers Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.5rhythms.com/who-we-are/5rhythms-teachers-association/|title=5Rhythms Teachers Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2007 as a professional association serving the continuing education of accredited 5Rhythms teachers.

==Reception==

Charlotte Macleod, writing in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' in 2009, describes dancing the 5Rhythms as a kind of antidote to life in a large city, and how she was attracted to a dance class by a video of Thom Yorke. The class leaves her "mentally and physically refreshed, and oddly connected to the other dancers." The dance was "a kind of moving meditation" for her.&lt;ref name="EveningStandard"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/thom-yorke-and-the-new-5rhythms-dance-craze-6389419.html | title=Thom Yorke and the new 5Rhythms dance craze | work=London Evening Standard |  date=April 6, 2011 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 | author=Macleod, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Ottery, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2011, states that "ecstatic dancing has an image problem" and "encompasses everything from large global movements such as 5Rhythms and [[Biodanza]] to local drum'n'dance meet-ups". She suggests that readers may "find 5 Rhythms a good place to start", and does so herself: "Nervously, I stretch and warm my muscles. As the rhythms take off, I shake off my shyness." She dances in different ways, alone or with partners. "My body is expressing itself - it's utter abandonment and a complete high."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/21/ecstatic-dance?INTCMP=SRCH | title=Ecstatic dance: rhythm to beat the blues | work=The Guardian | date=21 July 2009 | accessdate=March 18, 2012 | author=Ottery, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jed Lipinski, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2010, notes that 5Rhythms is suitable for all ages, unlike some other forms of dance and movement. He observes that "At a recent 5Rhythms class ... in Manhattan, more than 100 people were gleefully writhing and leaping to  tribal drumming  courtesy of Ms. Roth's husband, Robert Ansell... Dancers occasionally released  guttural howls, as if exorcising the demons of the workweek."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/fashion/05Sober.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | department= Fashion and Style | title=Dance, Dance, Dance. And That's It. | date=4 August 2010 | accessdate=9 June 2012 | author=Lipinski, Jed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' writes of 5Rhythms in 2007 that "I love it precisely because it isn't based on learned steps. Instead, the idea is to find your own dance by moving your body in whatever way you fancy. For those of us keen to improve our fitness, it can also be an energetic aerobic workout."&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/3346805/Feel-the-rhythm-from-head-to-heal.html | title=Feel the rhythm from head to heal | author=unattributed | publisher=Telegraph.co.uk | date=6 January 2007 | accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Academics working in mental health and other fields are starting to carry out research about the 5Rhythms. The [[Mental Health Foundation]], a UK charity published the 'Dancing for Living Report' describing a group of women's experience of 5Rhythms dance and the effects on their emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Cook | first=Sarah  | last2=Ledger

==Parody in popular culture==
The British TV sitcom ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' featured an episode ("Dance Class") where the two principal male characters attend a 'Rainbow Rhythms' class which invites its participants to interpretatively dance 'colours', featuring guidance and a closing circle reminiscent of a 5Rhythms class.

'''Affective Meditation''' is a [[Christian]] [[spiritual practice]] originating in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;Southern, R. W., The Making of the Middle Ages. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Bynum, C. W., Jesus as Mother: Studies in the Spirituality of the High Middle Ages. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; by which a [[pilgrim]], [[worship]]per, or other follower of Christ seeks to [[Imagination|imagine]] the [[Visual perception|sights]], [[sound]]s, [[taste]]s, [[Olfaction|smells]], [[Animal locomotion|movement]], and [[Somatosensory system|tactility]] of specific scenes from [[Gospel|canonical Gospels]] and their characters, with particular emphasis on empathising with the [[compassion]] and [[suffering]] of [[Jesus]] and the joys and sorrows of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], leading to the authentic and spontaneous expression of [[emotion]].&lt;ref&gt;
Hennessy, M. V., Passion Devotion, Penitential Reading, and the Manuscript Page: 'The Hours of the Cross'. in London, British Library Additional 37049. Mediaeval Studies, Vol. 66, 2004, pp214–216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, A. C., and Bestul, T. H., Cultures of Piety: Medieval English Devotional Literature in Translation. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Affective Meditation is the [[spiritual practice]] around which the tradition and [[philosophy]] of [[affective piety]] revolves, and was initiated by [[Saint]] [[Anselm of Canterbury]], subsequently by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], and latterly by [[Francis of Assisi]], who are credited with spawning an expressive form of [[worship]] through which members of the [[clergy]], [[Monasticism|monastic orders]], and [[laity]] [[Creative visualization|visualized]] and envisioned scenes from the life of [[Jesus|Christ]] with which they [[Empathy|empathized]] to such degree that their [[Compassion|compassionate identification]] with the suffering of him and his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] manifested in emotive vocal sounds and physical movements.&lt;ref&gt;Bestul, T. H., St. Anselm and the Continuity of Anglo-Saxon Devotional Traditions. Annuale Mediævale, Vol. 18, Issue 20, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern, R. W., Saint Anselm: A Portrait in a Landscape. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Gregorio, S., Affective Spirituality: Theory and Practice. In Bede and Alfred the Great. Essays. In Medieval Studies Vol. 22, Issue 130, 2005, pp129–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following excerpt from a work by English writer, [[Abbot]] and [[saint]] [[Aelred of Rievaulx]] is indicative of instructions provided by Christians in the tradition of Affective Piety.&lt;ref&gt;McNamer, S., Affective Meditation and the Invention of Medieval Compassion. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, A., Discerning Devotional Readers: Readers, Writers, and the Pursuit of God In Some Late Medieval Texts. University of Ottawa Doctoral Thesis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...follow her [the Virgin Mary] as she goes to Bethlehem, and turning away from the inn with her, help and humor her during the birth; and when the little child is placed in the manger, burst out words of exultation, crying out with Isaiah: A child is born to us, a son is given to us...Embrace that sweet manger, let love conquer bashfulness, and emotion drive out fear so that you fix your lips on those most sacred feet and repeat the kisses.&lt;ref&gt;Aelred of Rievaulx, "Rule for Recluses". In Aelred of Rievaulx: Treatises and Pastoral Prayer: On Jesus at the Age of Twelve. Rules of Life for a Recluse, and the Pastoral Prayers. (Cistercian Fathers). Spenser, MA: Cistercian Publications/Liturgical Press. 3rd Edition. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further example comes from the writings of English [[hermit]], [[Mysticism|mystic]], and religious writer [[Richard Rolle]], who expresses his empathy with the suffering of Christ in his work ''Meditation on the Passion''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ah, Lord, your sorrow--why was it not my death? Now they lead you forth as naked as a worm, with torturers around you and armed knights. The press of the crowd was incredibly intense as they threw things and harried you so shamefully, kicking at you as if you had been a dog. I see in my soul how ruefully you walk, your body so bloody, so raw and blistered. The crown on your head is so sharp, and your hair, blown in the wind, is all matted with blood. Your lovely face is so pale and swollen with the blows and the beatings, and covered with spittle and phlegm. And down runs your blood; it horrifies me to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle, D. J. (Ed.), English Spirituality in the Age of Wyclif. Vancouver: Regent College Publications, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The experience of Affective Meditation is most often precipitated by [[Meditation|meditating]] or [[Concentration|concentrating]] [[Attentional control|attention]] on [[Christian]] [[Christian art|drawings or paintings]], [[Christian music|music]], or [[Christian literature|literature]] depicting the experience of [[Jesus]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], until the [[Meditation|meditator's]] [[empathy]] with the subjects of those depictions becomes sufficiently intense to precipitate [[Emotion|emotive]] expression that may include tears and crying, vocal sounds and [[prayer]], as well as bodily movements.&lt;ref&gt;McNamer, S., Affective Meditation and the Invention of Medieval Compassion.

During the late 1970s, [[Psychology|psychologist]], [[Yoga]] teacher, and organist at [[Culbone Church]] [[Joan D'Arcy Cooper]], began to explore using the stories told by and about [[Jesus]] as spoken scripts with which to lead members of the [[parish]] through [[Creative visualization|visualizations]] and [[Guided meditation|meditations]] in the tradition of Affective Meditation.&lt;ref&gt;
Welshman, M., A Tiny Church Called Culbone, Near Porlock. In Somerset Life, 4 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Cooper published ''Guided Meditation and the Teachings of Jesus'' in which she suggests that the words of [[Jesus]], as recorded in the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s, may perhaps have been intended to be considered, and are enriched by hearing or reading them as [[Guided meditation|Guided Meditations]], through which the reader or listener can [[Meditation|meditate]] upon the message and meaning inherent in the text, and thereby come to know [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, J. D., Guided Meditation and the Teaching of Jesus. Salisbury: Element Books, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

While affective meditation is a marginal practice, Cooper's books and teachings, and the creative approach to [[Christian]] [[Meditation|meditative]] practice that she encouraged, was acknowledged as making an important contribution to the [[New Age]] era and movement, characterized by a personal and [[Individualism|individualist]] exploration of various meditative and [[Contemplation|contemplative]] traditions outside the boundaries and purview of formal [[doctrine]] and religious organizations, including those originating in [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, M., Donovan, S., and Taylor, E., The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2559">In the first century of the [[Christian era]], the '''Agapetae''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''agapetai'', meaning 'beloved') were [[virgin]]s who consecrated themselves to God with a vow of chastity and associated with [[laymen]]. This association later resulted in abuses and scandals, so that councils of the fourth century forbade it. The [[Council of Ancyra]], in 314, forbade virgins consecrated to God to live thus with men as sisters. This did not correct the practice entirely, for [[St. Jerome]] arraigns Syrian monks for living in cities with Christian virgins. The Agapetae are sometimes confounded with the ''[[subintroductae]]'', or woman who lived with [[clerics]] without marriage, a class against which the third canon of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) was directed.&lt;ref name="Cath1913"&gt;{{CE1913|inline=y|wstitle=Agapetae|last = A'Becket|first = John J.|volume=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of clerics living with unrelated women was finally condemned by the [[First Council of the Lateran|First]] and [[Second Council of the Lateran|Second]]  Lateran Councils.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Agapetae|volume=1|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agapetae were also a branch of the [[Gnostics]] in the late 4th century, who held that sexual relations were only improper if the mind was impure. They taught that one should perjure himself rather than reveal the secrets of his sect.&lt;ref name="Cath1913"/&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}
'''Alfred I. Tauber''' (born 1947), Zoltan Kohn [[Professor Emeritus]] of Medicine and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[Boston University]], is an American [[philosopher]] and [[historian]] of science, who, from 1993 to 2010, served as Director of the [[Boston University Center for Philosophy and History of Science]] at [[Boston University]].

Since 2004, Tauber has held a part-time visiting professorship at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]], where he teaches in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020054831/http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/cohn/ Cohn Institute for the History of Science and Ideas]. While primarily teaching and writing in science studies and [[bioethics]], Tauber originally trained as a [[biochemist]] and [[hematologist]]. Aside from over 125 research publications in biochemistry and [[cell biology]], Tauber has published extensively on 19th and 20th century [[biomedicine]], the development of modern [[immunology]], the [[doctor-patient relationship]], and contemporary science studies. He is the 2008 recipient of the Science Medal from the [[University of Bologna]] in [[Bologna, Italy]] and Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa from the [[University of Haifa]] in [[Haifa, Israel]] in 2011. In 2013 Tauber was appointed [http://www.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/cbg Chairman of the Board of Governors of the University of Haifa] and is currently holding that position.

== Research ==
Tauber's key publications fall into three areas: He published the first philosophical study of contemporary immunology, ''The Immune Self: Theory or Metaphor?'' (Cambridge 1994), which became the second [[monograph]] of a [[quartet]] tracing the theoretical development of this science. In these works and various critical papers he has argued that the prevailing self/nonself paradigm inadequately models immune tolerance and over-emphasizes host defense at the expense of cooperative ecological relationships.  By advocating a cognitive view of immune functions, he presents physiological autoimmunity and symbiotic relationships as alternate immune frameworks for modeling normal immunity. His ''Immunity: The Evolution of an Idea'' (Oxford 2017) summarizes this interpretation.  In medical ethics, Tauber has focused on the doctor-patient relationship: In ''Confessions of a Medicine Man'' (MIT 1999), he promoted the foundational status of the [[ethics]] of medicine and thus firmly placed science and technology in the employ of the moral [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] of [[health care]]. ''Patient Autonomy and the Ethics of Responsibility'' (MIT Press 2005) extended this argument with a description of "relational [[autonomy]]" to define the moral status of the patient, coupled with advocacy of patient-centered medicine. His third area of interest has centered on the replacement of reified notions of science with an epistemology thoroughly melded with human-centered interests and intentions.  In seeking a comprehensive understanding of scientific practice and application, Tauber argues for a "[[moral epistemology]]", a philosophy that builds upon the collapse of the fact/value distinction to define the interplay of various values in the diversity of science's methodologies and interpretations.  More specifically, he is concerned with the nature of knowing that translates [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] knowledge into personal meaning.  His ''[[Thoreau]] and the Moral Agency of Knowing'' (California 2001) illustrates the composite character of personal identity that such an approach presents, one in which moral agency broadly defines personal identity.  These studies have been extended in critiques of psychoanalytic portrayals of the ego that place Freud in imagined dialogues with philosophers of his own era in ''Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher'' (Princeton 2010) and with Adorno, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein in ''Requiem for the Ego'' (Stanford 2013).

== Personal ==
Tauber is married to [[Paula Fredriksen]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020031646/http://www.bu.edu/religion/faculty/bios/fredriksen.html], the William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of the Appreciation of Scripture Emerita at Boston University.

Alfred Tauber's [[extracurricular]] activities focus on 1) Amuta Moshe Hess, a [[Charitable organization|charity]] he founded, which provides services to the [[mentally disabled]] in Israel; 2) Avaloch Farm Music Institute established in Boscawen, New Hampshire to foster the development of professional chamber music ensembles and composition of new classical music [http://www.avalochfarmmusic.org]; and 3) Molad, the Center for Renewal of Israeli Democracy, where he is the Chairman of the Board [http://www.molad.org/en/indexarch.php].

The perceiving subject (I myself) sees that another human being is “like me.” They act like I do, appear to be in control of their conscious life, just like me.&lt;ref&gt;Levinas, Emmanuel.  (From works of 1961 and 1974).  {{Cite book|url= https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/#OveLev
 |title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter= Emmanuel Levinas|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “other” takes me out of myself and creates new understanding, that is, alterity. Philosophically, the life of the other functions symbolically. It is in our encounter with this other life that generates the contrasts at the foundations of new consciousness.&lt;ref name="foo3"&gt;“Homecoming: Interpretation, Transformation and Individuation” (Missoula, MT. Scholars Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; In such exchanges we are not lost, but rather the “proper self,” one’s subjectivity, scrubbed and brightly lit, becomes stained and unsure by a renewed understanding from a nonoriginal origin. Ego is still there; we do not disappear, but boundaries are less well defined. The self is opened to new experiences, and the “affair” of the other is made available."&lt;ref name="foo"&gt;“Desiring Theology” (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Philosophy==
Within the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological tradition]], alterity is usually understood as the [[entity]] in contrast to which an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] is constructed, and it implies the ability to distinguish between [[self]] and not-self, and consequently to assume the [[existence]] of an alternative viewpoint. The concept was further developed by [[Emmanuel Levinas]] in a series of essays, collected in ''Altérité et transcendence'' (''Alterity and Transcendence'') (1995).

===Castoriadis===
For [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (''L'institution imaginaire de la société'', 1975; ''The Imaginary Institution of Society'', 1997) radical alterity/otherness ({{lang-fr|altérité radicale}}) denotes the element of creativity in history: "For what is given in and through history is not the determined sequence of the determined but the emergence of radical otherness, immanent creation, non-trivial novelty."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Castoriadis, ''The Imaginary Institution of Society'' (trans. Kathleen Blamey), MIT Press, Cambridge, 1997, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baudrillard===
For [[Jean Baudrillard]] (''Figures de l'alterité'', 1994; ''Radical Alterity'', 2008), alterity is a precious and transcendent element and its loss would seriously impoverish a world culture of increasing sameness and "arrogant, insular cultural narcissism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baudrillard|first1=Jean|last2=Guillaume|first2=Marc|last3=Translated by Hodges|first3=Ames|title=Radical Alterity|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9781584350491|edition=First|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/radical-alterity|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spivak===
{{also|Difference (poststructuralism)}}
[[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s theory of alterity was introduced in a 2014 symposium titled Remaking History, the intention of which was to challenge the masculine orthodoxy of history writing.&lt;ref name="Spivak 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spivak|first=Gayatari|title=Who Claims Alterity|url=http://postcolonialstudies.emory.edu/gayatri-chakravorty-spivak/|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Spivak, it is imperative for one to uncover the histories and inherent historical behaviors in order to exercise an [[individual right]] to authentic experience, identity and reality. Within the concept of socially constructed histories one "must take into account the dangerous fragility and tenacity of these concept-metaphors."&lt;ref name="Spivak 2014" /&gt;

Spivak recalls her personal history: "As a postcolonial, I am concerned with the appropriation of 'alternative history' or 'histories'. I am not a historian by training. I cannot claim disciplinary expertise in remaking history in the sense or rewriting it. But I can be used as an example of how historical narratives are negotiated. The parents of my parents' grandparents' grandparents were made over, not always without their consent, by the political, fiscal and educational intervention of British imperialism, and now I am independent. Thus I am, in the strictest sense, a postcolonial."&lt;ref name="Spivak 2014" /&gt;

Spivak explains four "master words" to identify the modes of being that create alterity: "Nationalism, Internationalism, Secularism and Culturalism."&lt;ref name="Spivak 2014" /&gt;  Furthermore, tools for developing alternative histories include: "gender, race, ethnicity, class".&lt;ref name="Spivak 2014" /&gt;

===Other thinkers===
Jeffery Nealon, in ''Alterity Politics: Ethics and Performative Subjectivity'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nealon|first1=Jeffery|title=Alterity Politics: Ethics and Performative Subjectivity|date=1998|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-8223-2145-3|edition=First|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Alterity-Politics/?viewby=title|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "ethics is constituted as an inexorable affirmative response to different identities, not through an inability to understand or totalize the other."

There is included a long article on alterity in the [[University of Chicago]]'s ''Theories of Media: Keywords Glossary'' by Joshua Wexler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Wexler|first1=Joshua|title=Alterity|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/alterity.htm|website=Theories of Media: Keywords Glossary|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wexler writes: "Given the various theorists formulations presented here, the mediation of alterity or otherness in the world provides a space for thinking about the complexities of self and other and the formation of identity."

The concept of alterity is also being used in theology and in spiritual books meant for general readers.  This is not out of place because, for believers in the Judeo-Christian tradition, God is the ultimate 'Other'.  Alterity has also been used to describe the goal of many Christians, to become themselves deeply "other" than the usual norms of behavior and patterns of thought of the secular culture at large. Enzo Bianchi in ''Echoes of the Word''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bianchi|first1=Enzo|title=Echoes of the Word|date=2013|publisher=Paraclete Press|location=Orleans, MA|isbn=978-1-61261-373-4|url=http://www.paracletepress.com/echoes-of-the-word.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; expresses this well, "Meditation always seeks to open us to alterity, love and communion by guiding us toward the goal of having in ourselves the same attitude and will that were in Christ Jesus."

[[Jadranka Skorin-Kapov]] in ''The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skorin-Kapov|first1=Jadranka|title=The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-1-4985-1846-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates alterity or otherness to newness and surprise, "The signification of the encounter with otherness is not in its novelty (or banal newness); on the contrary, newness has signification because it reveals otherness, because it allows the experience of otherness. Newness is related to surprise, it is a consequence of the encounter... Metaphysical desire is the acceptivity of irreducible otherness. Surprise is the consequence of the encounter. Between desire and surprise there is a pause, a void, a rupture, an immediacy that cannot be captured and presented.”

==Anthropology==
In [[anthropology]], alterity has been used by scholars such as [[Nicholas Dirks]], [[Johannes Fabian]], [[Michael Taussig]] and [[Pauline Turner Strong]] to refer to the [[social constructionism|construction]] of "cultural others".

==Musicology==
The term has gained further use in seemingly somewhat remote disciplines, e.g., [[historical musicology]] where it is employed by John Michael Cooper in a study of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]].&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Cooper. ''Mendelssohn, Goethe, and the Walpurgis Night: The Heathen Muse in European Culture, 1700–1850''. University Rochester Press, 2007, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anger in [[Judaism]]''' is treated as a negative trait to be avoided whenever possible. The subject of [[anger]] is treated in a range of Jewish sources, from the [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]], to [[Halacha]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Hasidism]] and contemporary Jewish sources.

==In Tanach==
In the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Jacob]] condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons Simon and Levi: "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel."&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;[[Kaufmann Kohler]], [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1523&amp;letter=A Anger], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bible commentators point to God's punishment of Moses, not allowing him to enter the land of Israel, as being due to Moses's anger at the Jewish People.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Yissachar Ber. ''Talelei Oros: Devarim: The Parsha Anthology''. Fledheim Publishers. Accessed December 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Talmud==
Restraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable, as [[Ethics of the Fathers]] states:

"[[Ben Zoma]] said:
Who is strong? He who subdues his evil inclination, as it is stated,
'He who is slow to anger is better than a strong man, and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city' (Proverbs 16:32)."&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics of the Fathers''. 4:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, "Rabbi Eliezer says... Do not be easy to anger."&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics of the Fathers''. 2:10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud also emphasizes the negative effect anger has on a person.

{{quote|Anger will cause a sage to lose his wisdom, a person who is destined for greatness to forfeit it.|The Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;"Tractate Pesachim." ''Talmud''. 66b.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Talmud links anger to conceit, stating “One who is angry does not even consider the presence of Hashem important."&lt;ref&gt;"Tractate Nedarim." ''Talmud''. 22b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Halacha==
{{Quote|One who becomes angry is as though that person had worshipped idols.|Moses Maimonides, Mishneh Torah&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moses Maimonides. "Hilchot De'ot, 2:3" ''Mishneh Torah: Yad Hachazakah L'Rambam''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, citing “the early sages;” his source seems to be "Tractate Shabbat," ''Talmud'', 105a. See, Kaminker, Mendy. [http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2349458/jewish/How-to-Deal-with-Anger.htm "How to Deal with Anger: The Rebbe’s Advice."] ''Chabad.org''. Accessed December 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt, Rabbi [[Shlomo Ganzfried]] in his ''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'' states: "Anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs. You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried. ''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch''. 29:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Kabbalah==
Rabbi [[Chaim Vital]] taught in the name of his master, Rabbi [[Yitzchak Luria]], the Arizal, that anger may be dispelled by immersing in a ritual bath (''[[mikvah]]'') twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. While immersing, one should meditate on the idea that the numerical value (''[[gematria]]'') of the Hebrew word "''mikvah''" ({{lang-he|מקוה}}) (ritual bath) is the same as the Hebrew word for anger ("''ka'as'', {{lang-he|כעס}}).&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Chaim Vital, "Remedy #15." ''Shaar Ruach HaKodesh''. p. 18b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikvah is the numerical value of 151, ka'as is 150 plus the ''colel'' (a common ''gematria'' formula to add the value of 1 for the word itself). See, Wisnefsky, Moshe Yaakov. [http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380677/jewish/Anger-Remedy-No-2.htm "Anger Remedy Number 2."] ''Chabad.org''. Accessed December 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hasidism==
The Rabbi [[Yisroel Baal Shem Tov]], founder of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]], taught that anger may dispelled by the emphasis on love for God and joy in performing the commandments.&lt;ref name=beshthappy&gt;Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov. ''Sefer Baal Shem Tov''. Colel Bais Yosef. Melbourne: Australia. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1:326}}

Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] interprets the parallel between anger and idol worship stems from the feelings of the one who has become angry typically coincides with a disregard of [[Divine Providence]] – whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from God – through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of [[God]] in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi. ''Sefer HaTanya''. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quote|As with anything else, the way to correct [the traits of anger and pride] is step by step. The first step is to wait. Don’t express your anger or pride verbally. In this way, those emotions will not gain momentum, as can be seen in practice.|The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. "Letter 5239." ''Igrot Kodesh''. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary Judaism==
Rabbi [[Harold Kushner]] finds no grounds for anger toward God because “our misfortunes are none of His doing.”&lt;ref&gt;Harold S. Kushner, ''When Bad Things Happen to Good People'' (Schocken Books, 1981), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Kushner’s reading of the [[Bible]], David Blumenthal finds an “abusing God” whose “sometimes evil” actions evoke vigorous protest, but without severing the protester’s relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Blumenthal |title=Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest'' (Westminster/John Knox, 1993) |page=223 |url=http://religion.emory.edu/faculty/blumenthal.html |publisher=Religion.emory.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115041028/http://religion.emory.edu/faculty/blumenthal.html |archivedate=2014-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a teaching attributed to Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], when anger is a mode of life or when expressed in an unjustified manner, is prohibited by Judaism. But if a person is wronged, he or she is allowed to express their natural feelings, including anger.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Seymour. [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9GB5Eu3cf0C&amp;pg=PA68 ''Mental Health, Psychotherapy and Judaism''] Mondial. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ardha Chandrasana''' ({{lang-sa|अर्धचन्द्रासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''Ardha Chandrāsana'') or '''Half Moon Pose'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yogaartandscience.com/poses/Standing%20Poses/archand/archand.html | title = Ardha Chandrasana | accessdate = 2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[asana]].&lt;ref name="McGilveryMehta2002"&gt;{{cite book

| page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''Ardha'' meaning "half", ''Candra'' or ''Chandra'' (चन्द्र) meaning "moon" or "luminous, as in the light from the moon", and ''Asana'' (asana, Āsana) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Like all standing balance asanas, ardha chandrasana offers many benefits related to focus and proprioception, and strengthening of hip and knee muscles. This asana is particularly beneficial to the external rotators and stabilizers of the hip including [[gluteus medius]] and [[gluteus minimus|minimus]], obturators ([[External obturator muscle|external]] and [[Internal obturator muscle|internal]]) and gemelli ([[Inferior gemellus muscle|inferior]] and [[Superior gemellus muscle|superior]]). Abduction of the hip is achieved through [[concentric contraction]] of [[tensor fasciae latae]], [[gluteus medius]] and [[gluteus minimus|minimus]] on both legs (lifting one and stabilizing the other). Both legs engage [[Articularis genus muscle|articularis genus]], [[hip flexors]] and [[quadriceps]] to maintain leg extension,to relax,help in improvement in sports, while the supporting leg stretches the [[gastrocnemius]], [[hamstrings]] and [[gluteus maximus]]. Upper body stability is achieved by a number of paraspinal and core muscles like the [[abdominals]] and obliques ([[Abdominal external oblique muscle|external]] and [[Abdominal internal oblique muscle|internal]]), while the chest is opened by the [[rhomboid muscles|rhomboids]], and [[trapezius]] and the arms are abducted by the [[deltoids]], externally rotated by the [[infraspinatus]] and stabilized by the [[latissimus dorsi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaiamtv.com/article/interconnections-ardha-chandrasana-half-moon-pose&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

* Parivrtta Ardha Chandrasana (Revolved Half Moon Pose),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yogaartandscience.com/poses/Standing%20Poses/parchand/parchand.html | title = Parivrtta Ardha Chandrasana (Revolved Half Moon Pose) | accessdate = 2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''parivrtta'' (परिवृत्त) meaning "revolved" or "twisted"

In [[Sivananda]] Yoga and its derivative styles such as the [[Bihar]] school, half moon pose refers to [[anjaneyasana]], an asana used in the moon salutation series (Chandra Namaskar). In [[Bikram Yoga]], half moon pose refers to a two-legged standing asana known as [[Indudalasana]].

'''Artificial stupidity''' is a phrase most commonly used as a humorous retort to the notion of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). It is a [[derogatory]] reference to the inability of an AI program to adequately perform basic tasks.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connell, M., 2017. ''Art as ‘artificial stupidity’''. [online] Falmer, East Sussex: University of Sussex. Available at: &lt;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/67604&gt; [Accessed 8 Aug. 2017]. pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; The term has appeared in connection with other subject areas, mostly related to computing technology but also with respect to human behaviour.

[[Sadie Plant]] suggests that [[Ada Lovelace]], the nineteenth century prophetess of computing, employed something like artificial stupidity to criticize those who underestimated the future potential for calculating machines&lt;ref&gt;Plant, S., 1998. Zeros and ones: digital women and the new technoculture. London: Fourth Estate. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O’Connell, M., 2017. ''Art as ‘artificial stupidity’''. [online] Falmer, East Sussex: University of Sussex. Available at: &lt;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/67604&gt; [Accessed 8 Aug. 2017]. p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Hito Steyerl]] has been applying the term with reference to the stupidity of not recognizing the power and dangers of algorithms because of their invisibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/data-streams/|title=Data Streams|last=Steyerl|first=Hito|last2=Crawford|first2=Kate|date=23 January 2017|website=The New Inquiry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a different note, artificial stupidity, for [[Avital Ronell|Avital Ronell]], describes the shocking misuse of intelligence measurement during the [[Eugenics in the United States|eugenics era in the USA]]: people were artificially deemed unintelligent.&lt;ref&gt;Ronell, A., 2002. Stupidty. Urbana, IL: Urbana: University of Illinois Press. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O’Connell, M., 2017. ''Art as ‘artificial stupidity’''. [online] Falmer, East Sussex: University of Sussex. Available at: &lt;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/67604&gt; [Accessed 8 Aug. 2017]. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and researcher Micheál O'Connell employed the term ''artificial stupidity'' for his doctoral thesis&lt;ref&gt;O’Connell, M., 2017. ''Art as ‘artificial stupidity’''. [online] Falmer, East Sussex: University of Sussex. Available at: &lt;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/67604&gt; [Accessed 8 Aug. 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; with reference both to questions of human intelligence and technological intelligence. Artificial stupidity can refer to the human ability to "act stupid" or "[[dumbing down|dumb down]]" but he suggests that it can also be a means of creative unearthing. He cites [http://www.wlv.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/cadre---centre-for-art-design-research-and-expe/art-philosophy-and-social-practice/prof-john-roberts/ John Roberts'] attention to contemporary artists and their use of a "thinking stupidity" as a "rejection of the dominant discourses".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J., 1996b. Mad For It! by John Roberts. [online] Everything Magazine. Available at:
&lt;http://bak.spc.org/everything/e/hard/text/roberts1.html&gt; [Accessed 14 Jun. 2016].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O’Connell, M., 2017. ''Art as ‘artificial stupidity’''. [online] Falmer, East Sussex: University of Sussex. Available at: &lt;http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/67604&gt; [Accessed 8 Aug. 2017]. p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; A suggestion is that one reason for the resilience of the "[[Social system|art system]]" is its cunning inverse pretentiousness; on its own art seems stupid from the point of view of utilitarian interests, commerce, entertainment, academia and political agendas. As well as discussing art and creativity O'Connell advocates for a readdressing of the significance of human intelligence against, the often palpable, stupidity of the technological sphere including AI (understood in the broadest sense). And ''artificial stupidity'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''s most valid usage relates to examples of the obvious faultiness of AI technologies and systems. Finally within the field of [[computer science]], ''artificial stupidity'' has one other significant application: it refers to a technique of deliberately dumbing down [[computer programs]] in order to introduce errors in their responses.

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''



== History ==

[[Alan Turing]], in his 1952 paper ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]'', proposed a test for intelligence which has since become known as the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name="turing"&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are a number of different versions, the original test, described by Turing as being based on the "[[Imitation Game (Turing test)|Imitation Game]]", involved a "machine intelligence" (a computer running an AI program), a female participant, and an interrogator. Both the AI and the female participant were to claim that they were female, and the interrogator's task was to work out which was the female participant and which was not by examining the participant's responses to typed questions.&lt;ref name="turing" /&gt; While it is not clear whether or not Turing intended that the interrogator was to know that one of the participants was a computer, while discussing some of the possible objections to his argument Turing raised the concern that "machines cannot make mistakes".&lt;ref name="turing" /&gt;

{{quote|It is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish the machine from the man simply by setting them a number of problems in arithmetic. The machine would be unmasked because of its deadly accuracy.|Turing, 1950|page 448}}

As Turing then noted, the reply to this is a simple one: the machine should ''not'' attempt to "give the ''right'' answers to the arithmetic problems".&lt;ref name="turing" /&gt; Instead, deliberate errors should be introduced to the computer's responses.

== Applications ==

Within computer science, there are at least two major applications for artificial stupidity: the generation of deliberate errors in [[chatbots]] attempting to pass the Turing test or to otherwise fool a participant into believing that they are human; and the deliberate limitation of computer AIs in [[video games]] in order to control the game's difficulty.

=== Chatbots ===

The first [[Loebner prize]] competition was run in 1991. As reported in ''[[The Economist]]'', the winning entry incorporated deliberate errors&amp;nbsp;– described by ''The Economist'' as "artificial stupidity"&amp;nbsp;– to fool the judges into believing that it was human.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{Citation | title = Artificial Stupidity | date = 1992-09-01 | journal = [[The Economist]] | volume = 324 | issue = 7770 | pages = 14 |url= http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/02/26/loebner_part_one/ |quote= the first event was held in 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has remained a part of the subsequent Loebner prize competitions, and reflects the issue first raised by Turing.

=== Game design ===

Lars Lidén argues that good game design involves finding a balance between the computer's "intelligence" and the player's ability to win. By finely tuning the level of "artificial stupidity", it is possible to create computer controlled plays that allow the player to win, but do so "without looking unintelligent".&lt;ref name="liden"&gt;{{citation | last = Lidén | first = Lars | year = 2004 | title = Artificial Stupidity: The art of making intentional mistakes | editor = S. Rabin | work = AI Game Programming Wisdom 2 | pages = 41–48 | publisher = Charles River Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Algorithms''

There are many ways to deliberately introduce poor decision-making in search algorithms. Take the [[minimax]] algorithm for example. The [[minimax]] algorithm is an adversarial search algorithm that is popularly used in games that require more than one player to compete against each other. The main purpose in this algorithm is to choose a move that maximizes your chance of winning and avoid moves that maximizes the chance of your opponent winning. An algorithm like this would be extremely beneficial to the computer as computers are able to search thousands of moves ahead. To "dumb down" this algorithm to allow for different difficulty levels, [[heuristic]] functions have to be tweaked. Normally, huge points are given in winning states. Tweaking the [[heuristic]] by reducing such big payoffs would reduce the chance of the algorithm in choosing the winning state.

Creating [[heuristic]] functions to allow for stupidity is more difficult than one might think. If a [[heuristic]] allows for the best move, the computer opponent would be too omniscient, making the game frustrating and unenjoyable. But if the [[heuristic]] is poor, the game might also be unenjoyable. Therefore, a balance of good moves and bad moves in an adversarial game relies on a well-implemented [[heuristic]] function.

=== Other applications ===
According to its definition, a sufficiently developed Artificial Stupidity program would be able to make all the worst cases regarding a given situation. This would enable computer programmers and analysts to find flaws immediately while minimizing errors that are within the code.

However, it is mostly expected to be used within the development and debugging stages of computer software.

=== Arguments on artificial stupidity ===

The Economist states that if we are to achieve Alan Turing's prediction, "it will be a dreadful anticlimax." It is a much pointless attempt to create a machine that mimics the behaviour and intelligent level of a human being. The purpose of the invention of the computer is to assist humans in performing tasks that would be deemed too tedious or time consuming to perform by hand.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

As mentioned in the passage regarding the Loebnizer prize competition, the computer was able to trick judges by introducing deliberate typing errors. The Economist argues that nobody would want a computer that couldn't type properly.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

Durham, T., an author of the journal "On Artificial Stupidity," seems to view computers as naturally possessing intelligence. It is only due to bad programming that a computer appears unintelligent. Durham states the opposite in what people would normally believe as "there is no such thing as AI, only artificial stupidity, which is what happens when computers are not given the knowledge they need."&lt;ref&gt;Durham, T. (21 March 1985), "On Artificial Stupidity", ''Computing, The Magazine'' pp: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial stupidity as a limitation of artificial intelligence ===

Artificial stupidity is not just delivering deliberate errors into the computer, but it could also be seen as a limitation of computer artificial intelligence. Dr. Jay Liebowitz argues that "if intelligence and stupidity naturally exist, and if AI is said to exist, then is there something that might be called "artificial stupidity?""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebowitz|first=Jay|title=If There is Artificial Intelligence, Is There Such Thing As Artificial Stupidity?|journal=SIGART Newsletter|date=July 1989|volume=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebowitz pointed out that the limitations are:

{{quote|
* Ability to possess and use common sense
* Development of deep reasoning systems
* Ability to vary an expert system's explanation capability
* Ability to get expert systems to learn
* Ability to have distributed expert systems
* Ability to easily acquire and update knowledge|Liebowitz, 1989|Page 109}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27676">[[File:Follyofatheism.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece to [[Richard Bentley]]'s ''The Folly of Atheism'' ([[Boyle Lectures]], 1692)]]
[[Atheism]], as defined by the entry in [[Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' is "the opinion of those who deny the existence of a God in the world. The simple ignorance of God doesn't constitute ''atheism''. To be charged with the odious title of ''atheism'' one must have the notion of God and reject it."&lt;ref&gt;Claude Yvon and Jean-Henri-Samuel Formey, "Atheisme," in ''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers'', ed. Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond D'Alembert. University of Chicago: ARTFL Encyclopédie Projet (Winter 2008 Edition), Robert Morrissey (ed), http://encyclopedie.uchicago.edu/.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], avowed and open atheism was made possible by the advance of religious toleration, but was also far from encouraged. 

Accusations of atheism were common, but most of the people suspected by their peers of atheism were not actually atheist. [[D'Holbach]] and [[Denis Diderot]] seem to be two of the very small number of publicly identified atheists in Europe during this period. [[Thomas Hobbes]] was widely viewed as an atheist for his [[materialism|materialist]] interpretation of scripture—Henry Hammond, a former friend, described him in a letter as a "Christian Atheist."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tuck, "The 'Christian Atheism' of Thomas Hobbes," in ''Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment'', ed. Michael Hunter and David Wooton (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] was accused of atheism for his writings on the "natural history of religion";&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/#10 Hume on Religion (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bayle]] was accused of atheism for defending the possibility of an ethical atheist society in his ''Critical Dictionary''; and [[Baruch Spinoza]] was frequently regarded as an atheist for his "[[pantheism]]." However, all three of these figures defended themselves against such accusations.

==Rise of toleration==
In the Reformation and Counter-Reformation eras, Europe was a "persecuting society," which did not tolerate religious minorities or atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Peter Grell and Roy Porter, "Toleration in Enlightenment and Europe," in ''Toleration in Enlightenment Europe'', ed. Ole Peter Grell and Roy Porter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in France, where the [[Edict of Nantes]] had been issued in 1598, then revoked in 1685, there was very little support for religious toleration at the beginning of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marisa Linton]], "Citizenship and Religious Toleration in France," in ''Toleration in Enlightenment Europe'', ed. Ole Peter Grell and Roy Porter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 157.&lt;/ref&gt; States were concerned with maintaining religious uniformity for two reasons: first, they believed that their chosen confession was the way to God and other religions were heretical, and second, religious unity was necessary for social and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Linton, 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement of toleration was the result of pragmatic political motives as well as the principles espoused by Enlightenment ''philosophes''.
Religion was a central topic of conversation during much of the eighteenth century. It was the subject of debate in the coffeehouses and debate societies of Enlightenment Europe, and a bone of contention among the ''philosophes''. Michael J. Buckley describes the rise of toleration, and of atheism itself, as a response to religious violence in the preceding years: the expulsion of the Huguenots from France, the Spanish inquisition, the witch trials, the civil wars of England, Scotland and the Netherlands. Buckley argues that "religious warfare had irrevocably discredited confessional primacy in the growing secularized sensitivity of much of European culture."&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Buckley, ''At the Origins of Modern Atheism'' (London: Yale University Press, 1987), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a view echoed by Ole Peter Brell and Ray Porter. [[Marisa Linton]], however, points out that it was a common conception that religious diversity would lead to unrest and possibly civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Linton, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Justin Champion, the question in England was not one of determining religious truth, whether or not there was a god, but rather one of understanding how the priesthood had gained the power to determine what was accepted as truth.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Champion, ''The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Republican radicals like [[Henry Stubbe]], [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]] and [[John Toland]] understood religion as a social and cultural institution, rather than as transcendent principles.&lt;ref&gt;Champion (1992), 134.&lt;/ref&gt; They were primarily motivated by priestly fraud or "[[priestcraft]]." The second half of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' book [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]] contains an example of this sort of anticlerical thought. Hobbes, like Toland and other anticlerical writers of the period, understood religion in terms of history. By viewing religious truth and the church as separate, they helped open the way for further religious dissent.

Because France was an absolutist monarchy in which the king was seen as ruling by divine right, it was generally thought that French people had to share his religious views. The Edict of Nantes, which granted toleration to the Huguenot minority in France, was revoked in 1685. Marisa Linton argues that while the ''philosophes'' did contribute to some extent to the rise of French toleration, the activities of French Huguenots also played a part: they began to worship more publicly in the more remote regions of France, and their continued loyalty to the French crown on the eve of and during the [[Seven Years' War]] may have helped to ease the monarch's suspicions about their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Linton, 169&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-eighteenth century, [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] intellectuals began campaigning for religious toleration for [[Calvinists]].&lt;ref&gt;Linton, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Linton argues that together, these causes shifted public opinion towards religious toleration.&lt;ref name="Linton, 172"&gt;Linton, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious toleration was not accepted by everyone;  for instance, Abbé Houtteville condemned the rise of toleration in France because it weakened ecclesiastical authority and encouraged irreligion.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, ''Locke, Spinoza and the Philosophical Debate Concerning Toleration in the Early Enlightenment'' (Amsterdam: Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, 1999), 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1787 [[Louis XVI]] granted an Edict of Toleration acknowledging their civil rights to marry and own property, although they were still denied the official right to worship and could not hold public office or become teachers.&lt;ref name="Linton, 172" /&gt; Full religious toleration for Protestants would not be granted until the French Revolution.

Toleration itself boiled down to two different factions. The "acceptable face" of toleration was essentially the mainstream view, the freedom of worship and peaceful coexistence of different churches. This view was supported by Kant, Locke, Voltaire and Hume, as the public face of the Enlightenment. The Radical Enlightenment, on the other hand, was the view of toleration where the radicals demanded freedom of thought and expression, rather than existing peacefully among each other. This movement was shaped by the lesser-known figures of d'Holbach, Diderot, Condorcet, and, in particular, Spinoza, who provided the heart and soul of this faction. Where reason reigned supreme for the radicals, the moderate thinkers maintained that reason must be limited by faith and tradition. Together, the two different views of Enlightenment forged powerfully contrasting notions of toleration.

===Writers on toleration===
The Dutch Jew [[Spinoza]] argued for individual freedom to express personal beliefs, while discouraging large congregations unless they belonged to a somewhat deistic idealized state religion.&lt;ref&gt;Israel (2000), 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spinoza, freedom of thought, speech and expression were the core values of toleration—as such, Spinoza opposed censorship. Jonathan Israel summarized his position, that anti-toleration laws were engineered "for personal advantage but also at great cost to the state and the public," and that they exacerbated religious conflict rather than diminishing it.&lt;ref&gt;Israel (1999), 16&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza constructed his theories about toleration based on a freedom to think rather than the right to worship, and was established according to philosophical principles rather than being based on any interpretation of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Champion, "Toleration and Citizenship in Enlightenment England: John Toland and the Naturalization of the Jews, 1714–1753," in ''Toleration in  Enlightenment Europe'', ed. Ole Peter Grell and Roy Porter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Spinoza was essentially arguing for everyone, atheists, Catholics and Jews included.

[[Pierre Bayle]] was a strong advocate of tolerance, the basis of a quarrel with [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;Marin Fitzpatrick, "Toleration and the Enlightenment Movement," in ''Toleration in Enlightenment Europe,'' ed. Ole Peter Grell and Ray Porter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; He even defended the idea of an ethical atheist society in his famous dictionary. Martin Fitzpatrick credits him with making a "powerful contribution to the way ''philosophes'' would wage war on intolerance and superstition."&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick, 36"&gt;Fitzpatrick, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he wanted to diminish the influence of Spinoza, Bayle was treated in a similar fashion by the Huguenots of the United Provinces, who saw him as a dangerous thinker and a potential atheist.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick, 36" /&gt;

[[John Locke]] suggested a pragmatic view of toleration,&lt;ref&gt;Tomaselli, 93&lt;/ref&gt; although he advanced a concept of toleration only between certain Christian sects. He vehemently denied the atheists' right to toleration since they did not believe in a god, practiced no recognizable form of worship, and were not seeking to save their souls. He similarly denied toleration to Catholics on the grounds that papal authority made them a danger to the state. In essence, Locke advanced a freedom of worship, not a freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, "Spinoza, Locke and the Enlightenment Battle for Toleration," in ''Toleration in Enlightenment Europe,'' ed. Ole Peter Grell and Ray Porter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2000), 103–4&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of eighteenth-century writers, like Locke, had no interest in granting religious tolerance to ideas that deviated from the core of revealed religion.&lt;ref&gt;Israel (2000), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these writers were strongly opposed to Spinoza's ideal of toleration, which is "chiefly about individual freedom and decidedly not the freedom of large ecclesiastical structures to impose themselves on society."&lt;ref&gt;Israel (2000), 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voltaire]], in his 1763 "A Treatise on Toleration", continued in the tradition of John Locke, arguing that toleration allowed communication and good relationships between differing confessions in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Grell and Porter, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing the Huguenots to return to France would boost the French economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvana Tomaselli, "Intolerance, the Virtue of Princes and Radicals," in "Toleration in Enlightenment Europe," ed. Ole Peter Grell and Ray Porter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He would not be the only one to espouse this viewpoint.

Opponents tended to conflate the views of those who wrote in favour of toleration under the heading of dangerous anti-orthodoxy and atheism, despite their radically differing viewpoints and confessions.

==Related philosophical movements==
===Deism===
{{See also|Deism}}

Deism is the philosophical belief in a deity based on reason rather than religious revelation or dogma. It was a popular perception among the ''philosophes'', who adopted deistic attitudes to varying degrees. Deism, in this respect, is very different from atheism, which denies the existence of a deity altogether. Voltaire, for instance, was convinced that the existence of god was a demonstrable fact. The deistic god, however, often bore little resemblance to the God of Christian scripture, which meant that deists were often heavily criticized by the adherents of confessional faiths and could be accused of atheism.

Deists often pushed for religious toleration, a move which would have supported the open expression of atheism. This is not because they supported atheism—they did not—but because deist philosophers tended to be in favour of the civil freedom of conscience. As Michael J. Buckley writes, "If atheism was unacceptable, superstition and fanaticism were even more so."&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Buckley, S.J.,  ''At the Origins of Modern Atheism'' (London: Yale University Press, 1987), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Deists were not pro-atheist, but their anticlerical leanings indirectly benefited the evolution of atheism.

In historiographical terms, it has been quite common to see a close link between deism and atheism. Buckley critiques Peter Gay's view of the direct tie between deism and atheism, writing, "the vectors which Gay charts are certainly there, but the distinction may be somewhat too neat, too overdrawn."&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Dupré describes the deism as "the result of a filtering process that had strained off all historical and dogmatic data from Christian theology and retained only that minimum which, by eighteenth-century standards, reason demands."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Dupré, ''Religion and the Rise of Modern Culture'' (Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 2008), 43&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism is perhaps the same process taken a step further. Buckley credits the rise of atheism with the gradual submission of theology to philosophy—as thinkers, including church leaders, began to argue religion on philosophical terms, they opened the way for disbelief—they made atheism thinkable. Deism is, in this perspective, a complicated waypoint on the path to atheism: deism is the philosophical belief in a deity based on reason. Once belief in god is based on reason, it becomes thinkable to reason one's way into disbelief.

===Freemasonry===
{{See also|Freemasonry}}
Freemasons in continental Europe during the Enlightenment era were accused of atheism. The masonic "Constitutions" of 1723 are vague on the matter of religion, stating that if a Freemason "rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine," while also asking that he follow "that religion to which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Europe'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 87&lt;/ref&gt; Although Masonic literature referred sporadically and vaguely to a "Grand Architect of the Universe," their secretive practices made the religious affiliation of each Freemason a matter of speculation. 

Freemasonic culture originated in Britain and spread to the Continent, bringing with it ideas about natural rights and the rights of the governed. In some areas, Continental Freemasonry may have drawn from more subversive English sources.  Margaret C. Jacob outlines a relationship between [[John Toland]] and Dutch Freemasonry; [[Jean Rousset de Missy]], the founder of the Masonic lodge in the Dutch Republic in 1735 was a self-described [[pantheist]], borrowing the term coined by Toland. Jacob argues that "there is a streak of freethinking or deism that turns up at moments in the history of Continental Freemasonry right into, and especially during, the 1790s."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; This religious ambiguity could be interpreted as contributing to the "thinkability" of atheism.

==Contemporary perspectives==
===Spinoza===
{{Main|Spinoza}}

Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), in his 1670 ''Theologico-Political Treatise'', criticized Judaism (his birth religion) and all organized religion. His philosophical orientation is often called "pantheism," a term coined by John Toland after Spinoza's death. However, in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Spinoza's name was often associated with atheism, freethinking, materialism, deism, and any other heterodox religious belief. Whether or not "pantheism" constitutes atheism is still debated by modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Spinoza, ''Theologico-Political Treatise'', originally published anonymously in 1670; Israel, Jonathan I. ''Radical Enlightenment''. Oxford University Press: 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-925456-7}}; Spinoza is also mentioned in Christopher Hitchens' ''The Portable Atheist'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pierre Bayle===
{{Main|Pierre Bayle}}
Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) was widely accused of atheism for his espousal of religious toleration, although he professed himself a [[Huguenot]]. He encountered a great deal of criticism for defending atheism. In his ''[[Dictionnaire historique et critique]]'' he stated that while atheists were "exceedingly blind and ignorant of the nature of things"&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bayle, ''An Historical and Critical Dictionary'' (London: Hunt and Clark, 1826), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; there were many atheists "who are no way distinguished for their vices,"&lt;ref&gt;Bayle (1826), 173&lt;/ref&gt; and that "if atheists exist, who, morally speaking, are well-disposed, it follows that Atheism is not a necessary cause of immorality, but simply an incidental one in regard to those who would have been immoral from disposition or temperament, whether Atheists or not."&lt;ref&gt;Bayle (1826), 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, he included an essay "Clarifications: On Atheists" in the 1702 edition of the Dictionary. In it, he continued defending his thesis that "there have been atheists and Epicureans whose propriety in moral matters has surpassed that of most idolators",&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bayle, "Bayle – Political Writings", ed. Sally L. Jenkinson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 312&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that religion is not the sole basis of morality. It is, he wrote, "a very likely possibility that some men without religion are more motivated to lead a decent, moral life by their constitution, in conjunction with the love of praise and the fear of disgrace, than are some others by the instincts of conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Bayle (2000), 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hume===
{{Main|David Hume}}

David Hume (1711–1776) was often seen as an atheist in his own day. His skeptical attitude toward religion in such works as "Of Superstition and Religion", "Essays Moral and Political", "On Suicide", "On the Immortality of the Soul", "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion", as well as his death-bed conversations with Boswell (later published), earned Hume the reputation as a practicing atheist. Hume was even turned down for a teaching position at the University of Edinburgh in the 1740s because of his alleged atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Nobbs, 'The Political Ideas of William Cleghorn, Hume's Academic Rival', in Journal of the History of Ideas, (1965), Vol. 26, No. 4: 575–586; Boswell, J. Boswell in Extremes, 1776–1778.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diderot===
{{Main|Diderot}}

Denis Diderot (1713–1784) was one of the central guests of D'Holbach's salon and the primary editor of the ''Encyclopédie''. Although Diderot wrote extensively about atheism, he was not as polemic as D'Holbach or Naigeon—instead of publishing his atheistic works, he tended to circulate them among his friends or give them to Naigeon for posthumous publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Kors, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot espoused a materialist worldview. He attempted to solve the problems of how the cosmos could begin without a creator, and theorized about how life could come from inorganic matter. According to Dupré, Diderot concluded that if one abandons "the unproved principle that the cosmos must have a beginning"&lt;ref&gt;Dupré, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; then the need to establish the "efficient cause" of creation is no longer a problem. Diderot thought that the origin of life might be a process of the natural internal evolution of matter.

===D'Holbach===
{{Main|Baron D'Holbach}}
{{See also|D'Holbach's Coterie}}

The Baron D'Holbach (1723–1789) was the central figure of the 'coterie holbachique'&lt;ref&gt;Alan Charles Kors, ''D'Holbach's Coterie: An Enlightenment in Paris'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1976), 9&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[salon (gathering)|salon]] he hosted in his Paris home. The salon has been interpreted as a meeting place for Parisian atheists, based on an anecdote in which D'Holbach told David Hume, who claimed not to believe anything, that of the eighteen guests at his salon, fifteen were atheists and three had not yet decided. There is some doubt as to the accuracy of this statement.&lt;ref&gt;See Alan Charles Kors, ''D'Holbach's Coterie'' 41–42 for a discussion of this claim.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, D'Holbach himself was a professed atheist. The salon was the site of a great deal of discussion about atheism, and the atheistic and theistic guests seem to have spent a great deal of time good-naturedly arguing for their respective positions.&lt;ref&gt;Kors, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims that the salon was a hotbed of atheism, there seem to only have been three convinced atheists in regular attendance: D'Holbach, Denis Diderot and [[Jacques-André Naigeon]]. 

D'Holbach's written works often included atheistic themes. Alan Charles Kors cites three in particular, "[[The System of Nature|Système de la Nature]]", "Le Bon-sens" and "La Morale Universelle" as being particularly concerned with advancing the cause of atheism. Kors summarized some of the basic themes of these three texts as the idea that rigorous materialism was the only coherent viewpoint, and that "the only humane and beneficial morality was one deduced from the imperatives for the happiness and survival of mankind."&lt;ref name="Kors, 45"&gt;Kors, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; What was relatively unique about D'Holbach was that, as Kors writes, he "was an atheist, and he proselytized."&lt;ref name="Kors, 45" /&gt;

===The ''Encyclopédie''===
{{See also|Encyclopédie}}

Although the "Encyclopédie" (published 1751–1772) was driven and edited by the atheist Denis Diderot, the Encyclopedia's articles on atheism and atheists take an incredibly negative tone, having been written by the pastor [[Jean-Henri-Samuel Formey]] and the abbé [[Claude Yvon]]. This was probably the most common conception of atheism by the public and by some of the "philosophes". Yvon identifies the main causes of atheism as ignorance and stupidity, and debauchery and the corruption of morals.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Yvon, "Athées," in "Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers", ed. by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond D'Alembert. University of Chicago: ARTFL Encyclopédie Project (Winter 2008 Edition), Robert Morrissey (ed), http://encyclopedie.uchicago.edu/.&lt;/ref&gt; The article "Athées" is primarily concerned with refuting Bayle's assertions, insisting that atheists "cannot have an exact and complete understanding of the morality of human actions."{{cite quote|date=September 2017}}

'''Beth Lord''' is a Canadian [[philosopher]] specialising in the [[history of philosophy]], especially the work and influence of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[Continental philosophy]]. She is currently a [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in the School of Divinity, History and Philosophy at the [[University of Aberdeen]], where she has worked since 2013.

==Education and career==
Lord was raised in [[Ontario]], and initially studied at the [[University of Toronto]]. She intended to study [[drama]], but graduated with a degree in Philosophy and [[Literary Studies]]. She went on to the [[University of Warwick]], where she read for an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Continental Philosophy and then a [[doctorate]].&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;Protevi, John (11 April 2012).

Accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral thesis, which was supervised initially by [[Andrew Benjamin]] and then by Stephen Houlgate, was entitled ''Kant's Productive Ontology: Knowledge, Nature and the Meaning of Being''. In the thesis, Lord argues that Kant's [[ontology]] is a "productive ontology"; i.e., a theory which rests upon an idea of production.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Beth (2003) [http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/36683/ ''Kant's Productive Ontology: Knowledge, Nature and the Meaning of Being''].

In 2010, with funding from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC), Lord founded the Spinoza Research Network, of which she remains the director.&lt;ref name="Aberdeen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://spinozaresearchnetwork.wordpress.com/about/ About the Spinoza Research Network]". Spinoza Research Network. Accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she published ''Spinoza's Ethics: An Edinburgh Philosophical Guide'' ([[Edinburgh University Press]]), a study aid for Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' (1677).&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Beth (2011). ''Spinoza's Ethics: An Edinburgh Philosophical Guide''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she published ''Kant and Spinozism: Transcendental Idealism and Immanence from Jacobi to Deleuze'' ([[Palgrave Macmillan]]), in which she examined the work of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]], [[Salomon Maimon]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]], all of whom, she argues, drew upon both Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] and Spinoza's [[immanence]]. For Lord, Spinoza's thought is key to understanding the influence of Kantian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul (2012).

A '''biblical manuscript''' is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the [[Bible]]. The word ''Bible'' comes from the Greek ''biblia'' (books); ''[[manuscript]]'' comes from Latin ''manu'' (hand) and ''scriptum'' (written). Biblical manuscripts vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures (see [[Tefillin]]) to huge [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] [[codices]] (multi-lingual books) containing both the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]) and the [[New Testament]], as well as [[Biblical canon|extracanonical]] works.

The study of biblical manuscripts is important because handwritten copies of books can contain errors. The science of [[textual criticism]] attempts to reconstruct the original text of books, especially those published prior to the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]].

==Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) manuscripts==
[[File:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|upright|A page from the [[Aleppo Codex]], Deuteronomy]]

{{main article|List of Hebrew Bible manuscripts}}

The [[Aleppo Codex]] (c. 920 CE) and [[Leningrad Codex]] (c. 1008 CE) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the [[Tanakh]]. In 1947 CE the finding of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] at [[Qumran]] pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the [[Old Testament]] were in Greek in manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the [[Book of Esther]]; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two [[scroll]]s of the [[Book of Isaiah]], one complete ([[1QIs-a|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and one around 75% complete ([[1QIs-b|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;]]). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.{{sfn|Bruce|1964}}

==New Testament manuscripts==

[[File:Codex Alexandrinus f41v - Luke.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Folio 41v from [[Codex Alexandrinus]] contains the [[Gospel of Luke]] with decorative tailpiece.]]
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work of literature, with over 5,800 complete or fragmented [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts catalogued, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. The dates of these manuscripts range from c. 125 (the {{Papyrus link|52}} papyrus, oldest copy of John fragments) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.

Often, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache was little more than a former manuscript recycling centre, where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided what to do with them.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} There were several options. The first was to simply "wash" the manuscript and reuse it. Such reused manuscripts were called [[palimpsest]]s and were very common in the ancient world until the [[Middle Ages]]. One notable palimpsest is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. If not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning. Since the manuscripts contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity;{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit, which occasionally happened (as in the case of [[Oxyrhynchus 840]]). The third option was to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, such as at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai]] (the source of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside [[Bethlehem]], they are finding not libraries but storehouses of rejected texts{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints. The texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |title=Codex Sinaiticus |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231104440/http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |archivedate=2008-12-31 |website=Codex Sinaiticus Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly evidence that monastery scribes compared them to a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but had deteriorated for heavy usage or had missing [[wikt:folio|folios]] would also be placed in the [[Treasure trove|caches]]. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

Complete and correctly-copied texts would usually be immediately placed in use and so wore out fairly quickly, which required frequent recopying. Manuscript copying was very costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods so a [[manuscript]] might be made only when it was commissioned. The size of the [[parchment]], [[writing system|script]] used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost) and whether it was one book or a collection of several would be determined by the one commissioning the work. Stocking extra copies would likely have been considered wasteful and unnecessary since the form and the presentation of a manuscript were typically customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.

Due to the prevalence of manuscript caches, scholars today are more likely to find incomplete and sometimes conflicting segments of manuscripts rather than complete and largely consistent works.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

===Transmission===
The task of copying manuscripts was generally done by [[scribe]]s who were trained professionals in the arts of writing and bookmaking. Some manuscripts were also proofread, and scholars closely examining a text can sometimes find the original and corrections found in certain manuscripts. In the 6th century, a special room devoted to the practice of manuscript writing and [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] called the [[scriptorium]] came into use, typically inside medieval European monasteries. Sometimes a group of scribes would make copies at the same time as one individual read from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/mss_trans.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscript construction===

An important issue with manuscripts is preservation. The earliest New Testament manuscripts were written on [[papyrus]], made from a reed that grew abundantly in the [[Nile Delta]]. This tradition continued as late as the 8th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|p=3f}} Papyrus eventually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The dry climate of Egypt allowed some papyrus manuscripts to be partially preserved, but, with the exception of {{Papyrus link|77}}, no New Testament papyrus manuscript is complete; many consist only of a single fragmented page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/intro.html#MSTypes|title=Waltz|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the fourth century, [[parchment]] (also called [[vellum]]) began to be a common medium for New Testament manuscripts.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=3-10}} It wasn't until the twelfth century that [[paper]] (made from cotton or plant fibers), which was invented in first-century [[China]], began to gain popularity in biblical manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 476 non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are in the form of [[scroll]]s; however, eight Christian manuscripts are [[codex|codices]]. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The adaptation of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/codex.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the [[Pauline epistles]]), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to hundreds of pages.  On its own, however, length alone is an insufficient reason - after all, the Jewish scriptures would continue to be transmitted on scrolls for centuries to come.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=249}} Scholars have argued that the codex was adopted as a product of the formation of the New Testament canon, allowing for a specific collections of documents like the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=250}} "Canon and codex go hand in hand in the sense that the adoption of a fixed canon could be more easily controlled and promulgated when the codex was the means of gathering together originally separate compositions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=J.K. |title=Manuscripts, the Codex, and the Canon |journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament |date=1996 |issue=63 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Script and other features===
[[Image:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|upright|The beginning of the [[Gospel of Mark]] from the [[Book of Durrow]].]]
The handwriting found in New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often written in a distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between [[uncial script]] (or majuscule) and [[Roman cursive#New Roman cursive|minuscule]]. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descender]]s that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=17-18, 20}}

The earliest manuscripts had negligible punctuation and breathing marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs would be a continuous string of letters ([[scriptio continua]]), often with line breaks in the middle of words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way to reduce the number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the ''[[nomina sacra]]''. Yet another method involved the [[palimpsest]], a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'' and the ''[[Syriac Sinaiticus]]'').

The original New Testament books did not have titles, section headings, or [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verse and chapter divisions]]. These were developed over the years as "helps for readers". The [[Eusebian Canons]] were an early system of division written in the margin of many manuscripts. The Eusebian Canons are a series of tables that grouped parallel stories among the gospels. Starting in the fifth century, subject headings ([[:wikt:κεφαλαία|κεφαλαία]]) were used.

Manuscripts became more ornate over the centuries, which developed into a rich [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition, including the famous Irish [[Gospel Book]]s, the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the ''[[Book of Durrow]]''.

===Cataloging===
[[File:SinopeGospelsFolio29rChristHealingBlind.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A page from the [[Sinope Gospels]]. The miniature at the bottom shows [[Jesus]] healing the blind.]]
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] compiled the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts because he did not have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used ([[uncial]], minuscule) or format ([[Lectionary|lectionaries]]) and based on content ([[Gospel]]s, [[Pauline epistles|Pauline letters]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] + [[General epistles]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (A) and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]] (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, [[Codex Sinaiticus]], over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the [[Latin alphabet]] had been used, and scholars moved on to first the [[Greek alphabet]], and eventually started reusing characters by adding a [[superscript]]. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Von Soden}}Von Soden====

[[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden]] published a complex cataloging system for manuscripts in 1902-10.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann von Soden, ''Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte'' 4 vols., Berlin: Glaue, 1902-1910.&lt;/ref&gt; He grouped the manuscripts based on content, assigning them a Greek prefix: δ for the complete New Testament, ε for the Gospels, and α for the remaining parts. This grouping was flawed because some manuscripts grouped in δ did not contain Revelation, and many manuscripts grouped in α contained either the general epistles or the Pauline epistles, but not both. After the Greek prefix, Von Soden assigned a numeral that roughly corresponded to a date (for example δ1-δ49 were from before the 10th century, δ150-δ249 for the 11th century). This system proved to be problematic when manuscripts were re-dated, or when more manuscripts were discovered than the number of spaces allocated to a certain century.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Gregory-Aland}}Gregory–Aland====

[[Caspar René Gregory]] published another cataloging system in 1908 in ''Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments'', which is the system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and [[Lectionary|lectionaries]]. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping is based on the physical material ([[papyrus]]) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in that the majority of the papyri are very early because parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory assigned the papyri a prefix of '''P''', often written in [[blackletter]] script ({{Papyrus|n}}), with a superscript numeral. The uncials were given a prefix of the number 0, and the established letters for the major manuscripts were retained for redundancy (''e.g.'' [[Codex Claromontanus]] is assigned both '''06''' and '''D'''). The minuscules were given plain numbers, and the lectionaries were prefixed with '''''l''''' often written in script ('''ℓ'''). [[Kurt Aland]] continued Gregory's cataloging work through the 1950s and beyond. Because of this, the numbering system is often referred to as "Gregory-Aland numbers". The most recent manuscripts added to each grouping are {{Papyrus link|131}}, [[Uncial 323|0323]], [[Minuscule 2928|2928]], and ''ℓ'' 2463.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/liste New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room] at the [[University of Münster]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the cataloging heritage and because some manuscripts which were initially numbered separately were discovered to be from the same codex, there is some redundancy in the list (''i.e.'' the [[Magdalen papyrus]] has both the numbers of {{Papyrus|64}} and {{Papyrus|67}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73f&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of New Testament textual criticism deals with Greek manuscripts because scholars believe the original books of the New Testament were written in Greek. The text of the New Testament is also found both translated in manuscripts of many different languages (called ''versions'') and quoted in manuscripts of the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. In the [[critical apparatus]] of the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], a series of abbreviations and prefixes designate different language versions (it for Old Latin, lowercase letters for individual Old Latin manuscripts, vg for [[Vulgate]], lat for Latin, sy&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]], sy&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Curetonian Gospels]], sy&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; for the [[Peshitta]], co for Coptic, ac for Akhmimic, bo for Bohairic, sa for Sahidic, arm for Armenian, geo for Georgian, got for Gothic, aeth for Ethiopic, and slav for Old Church Slavonic).&lt;ref&gt;NA&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; 1996, pp. 64*-76*&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Escribano.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of a European [[scribe]] at work]]
The New Testament books appear to have been completed within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books are not known to have survived. The [[autograph]]s are believed to have been lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. [[Paleography]], a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dating test]] requires that a small part of the material be destroyed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-73398/biblical-literature#597996.hook|title=Britannica Online: Types of manuscript errors|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by paleography can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.&lt;ref&gt;F. V. Greifenhagen, ''Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Earliest extant manuscripts====
The earliest manuscript of a New Testament text is a business-card-sized fragment from the [[Gospel of John]], [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], which may be as early as the first half of the 2nd century. The first complete copies of single New Testament books appear around 200, and the earliest complete copy of the New Testament, the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] dates to the 4th century.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|pp=479-480}} The following table lists the earliest extant manuscript witnesses for the books of the [[New Testament]].

===Textual criticism===
{{main article|Textual Criticism}}
{{further|Textual variants in the New Testament|List of Bible verses not included in modern translations}}
[[Palaeography]] is the study of ancient writing, and [[textual criticism]] is the study of manuscripts in order to reconstruct a probable original text.

None of the original documents of the New Testament is known to scholars to be extant; and the existing manuscripts differ from one another. The textual critic seeks to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be regarded as most conforming to the original.{{sfn|Metzger|1992}} The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th-century-CE [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Western text-type]], and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which includes over 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition.

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament. This is reflected in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society, 5th edition and Nestle-Aland, 28th edition. In [[textual criticism]], eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored in these two publications; and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Aland |first2=Joël |last2=Delobel |year=1994 |title=New Testament textual criticism, exegesis and church history: a discussion of methods |location=Kampen |publisher=Kok Pharos |p=138 |isbn=9-03-900105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most English translations of the New Testament made in the 20th Century were based on these copies.

Textual scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] writes: "It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament...."{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|p=449}} In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, [[Bruce M. Metzger]] wrote,

{{quote|In evaluating the significance of these statistics...one should consider, by way of contrast, the number of manuscripts which preserve the text of the ancient classics. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''...is preserved by 457 papyri, 2 uncial manuscripts, and 188 minuscule manuscripts. Among the tragedians the witnesses to [[Euripides]] are the most abundant; his extant works are preserved in 54 papyri and 276 parchment manuscripts, almost all of the later dating from the Byzantine period...the time between the composition of the books of the New Testament and the earliest extant copies is relatively brief. Instead of the lapse of a millennium or more, as is the case of not a few classical authors, several papyrus manuscripts of portions of the New Testament are extant which were copies within a century or so after the composition of the original documents.{{sfn|Metzger|1992|pp=33-35}}{{efn|1=As a footnote to his comments, [[Bruce Metzger|Metzger]] also said, "Lest, however, the wrong impression be conveyed from the statistics given above regarding the total number of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, it should be pointed out that most of the [[New Testament papyrus|papyri]] are relatively fragmentary and that only about fifty manuscripts (of which the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] is the only [[Uncial script|Uncial manuscript]]) contain the entire New Testament."{{sfn|Metzger|1992|p=34}} }} }}

Biblical scholar [[Gary Habermas]] adds, 

{{quote|What is usually meant is that the New Testament has far more manuscript evidence from a far earlier period than other classical works. There are just under 6000 NT manuscripts, with copies of most of the NT dating from just 100 years or so after its writing. Classical sources almost always have fewer than 20 copies each and usually date from 700-1400 years after the composition of the work. In this regard, the classics are not as well attested. While this doesn't guarantee truthfulness, it means that it is much easier to reconstruct the New Testament text. Regarding genre, the Gospels are usually taken today to be examples of Roman biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Reliability and Inspiration of the Bible  |website=Dr. Habermas Answers Important Questions |url=http://www.garyhabermas.com/qa/qa_index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. The latest substantial find was in 2008, when 47 new manuscripts were discovered in [[Albania]]; at least 17 of them unknown to Western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michelle A |last=Vu |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/nt.scholar.on.discovery.of.giant.trove.of.bible.manuscripts/18204.htm |title=NT scholar on discovery of giant trove of Bible manuscripts |work=[[Christianity Today]] |date=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been an estimate of 400,000 variations among all these manuscripts (from the 2nd to 15th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Wallace |date=13 April 2009 |title=The Number of Textual Variants: An Evangelical Miscalculation |url=https://bible.org/article/number-textual-variants-evangelical-miscalculation}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you spread those 400,000 variations over 5,600 manuscripts, that comes out to only about 71 variations per manuscript, (400,000 divided by 5,600). And some of these manuscripts are the equivalent of several hundred pages of text, hand-written (see [[Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus]], et al.).  The number of variants is additionally less significant than may appear since it is a comparison across linguistic boundaries.  More important estimates focus on comparing texts within languages. Those variations are considerably fewer. The vast majority of these are accidental errors made by [[scribe]]s, and are easily identified as such: [[Haplography|an omitted word]], [[Homoioteleuton|a duplicate line]], a misspelling, a rearrangement of words. Some variations involve apparently intentional changes, which often make more difficult a determination of whether they were corrections from better exemplars, [[harmonization]]s between readings, or ideologically motivated.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004}} Variants are listed in critical editions of the text, the most important of which is the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which is the basis for most modern translations. For over 250 years, Christian scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel |date=3 June 2004 |url=https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical |title=The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical? |access-date=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c.f.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5615">The '''Blogger's Code of Conduct''' is a proposal by [[Tim O'Reilly]] for [[blog]]gers to enforce civility on their blogs by being civil themselves and moderating comments on their blog.  The code was proposed in 2007 due to threats made to blogger [[Kathy Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html|title=Call for a Blogger's Code of Conduct|publisher=O'Reilly Radar|first=Tim |last=O'Reilly|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|date=March 3, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409153021/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html |archivedate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the code was first reported by [[BBC News]], who quoted O'Reilly saying, "I do think we need some code of conduct around what is acceptable behaviour, I would hope that it doesn't come through any kind of regulation it would come through self-regulation.".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6502643.stm|title=Call for blogging code of conduct|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=March 28, 2007|accessdate=April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland the proposal for a code was raised in an article in [[Sunday Business Post]] in 2009 by [[Simon Palmer]], a radio presenter and PR consultant in Dublin, after false details in relation to a client had appeared on Irish blogs [http://www.businesspost.ie/#!search/simon%2520palmer Time To Raise Above Blog Standard]. After his comments he was subjected to sustained on line abuse from Irish bloggers and anonymous trolls and even received death threats.

In Nepal, 10 prominent bloggers signed a Code of Ethics for Bloggers, first proposed by [[Ujjwal Acharya]] and finalized after discussion among bloggers, on July 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalivoices.com/nepal-blog/2011/07/27/historic-bloggers-sign-code-of-ethics/|title=Historic: Bloggers sign Code of Ethics|publisher=The Radiant Star|first=Ujjwal |last=Acharya|authorlink=Ujjwal Acharya|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', O'Reilly and [[Jimmy Wales]] based their preliminary list on one developed by the [[BlogHer]] women's blogging support network&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Call for Manners in the World of Nasty Blogs| first=Brad |last=Stone|date=April 9, 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/technology/09blog.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1346347088-tgkihQi2p1Jn13oBc48IFA}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, working with others, came up with a list of seven proposed ideas:
#Take responsibility not just for your own words, but for the comments you allow on your blog.
#Label your tolerance level for abusive comments.
#Consider eliminating anonymous comments.
#Don't feed the [[troll (internet)|troll]]s.
#Take the conversation offline, and talk directly, or find an intermediary who can do so.
#If you know someone who is behaving badly, tell them so.
#Don't say anything online that you wouldn't say in person.

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
Reaction to the proposal was internationally widespread among bloggers and media writers. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', the [[blogosphere]] described it as "excessive, unworkable and an open door to censorship."&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news

'''Blueprint''' is a [[CSS framework]] designed to reduce development time and ensure [[Cross-browser|cross-browser compatibility]] when working with [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS). It also serves as a foundation for many tools designed to make CSS development easier and more accessible to beginners. Blueprint is released under a modified version of the [[MIT License]], making it [[free software]]. It can be either used as is, or further adapted for use via a compression tool that is written in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].

==Features==
Blueprint's README file lists the following features as being provided out-of-the-box:
*An easily customizable grid
*Sensible default typography
*A typographic baseline
*Perfected browser CSS reset
*A stylesheet for printing
*Powerful scripts for customization
*Bloat Minimized as much as possible

==History==
Blueprint was first created by Olav Bjørkøy and released on August 3, 2007.&lt;ref name="launch"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516223431/http://bjorkoy.com/past/2007/8/3/launch_blueprint_a_css_framework/ Launch: Blueprint, a CSS framework]. bjorkoy.com (2007-8-3).&lt;/ref&gt; By August 11, Blueprint included work based on ideas from Jeff Croft, Nathan Borror, Christian Metts, and [[Eric A. Meyer|Eric Meyer]].&lt;ref name="v0point4"&gt;[http://www.byteswire.com/15-css-frameworks-for-front-end-developers/ CSS Frameworks for Front-end Developers]. byteswire.com. Retrieved on 2014-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; Version 0.8 was released on November 11, and included various [[bugfix]]es as well as a new "tabs" plugin.&lt;ref name="v0point8"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081225043346/http://www.christianmontoya.com/2008/11/11/blueprint-version-08/ Blueprint version 0.8]. (Archived) Christianmontoya.com. Retrieved on 2012-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blueprint as a foundation for other projects==

[[File:Hou710 BooleanNetwork.svg|thumb|State space of a Boolean Network with ''N=4'' [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] and ''K=1'' [[Glossary of graph theory#Basics|links]] per node. Nodes can be either switched on (red) or off (blue). Thin (black) arrows symbolise the inputs of the [[Boolean function]] which is a simple "copy"-function for each node. The thick (grey) arrows show what a synchronous update does. Altogether there are 6 (orange) [[attractor]]s, 4 of them are [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]].]]

A '''Boolean network''' consists of a discrete set of [[boolean variable]]s each of which has a [[Boolean function]] (possibly different for each variable) assigned to it which takes inputs from a subset of those variables and output that determines the state of the variable it is assigned to.  This set of functions in effect determines a topology (connectivity) on the set of variables, which then become nodes in a [[network (mathematics)|network]]. Usually, the dynamics of the system is taken as a discrete [[time series]] where the state of the entire network at time ''t''+1 is determined by evaluating each variable's function on the state of the network at time ''t''.  This may be done [[synchronous]]ly or [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naldi|first1=A.|last2=Monteiro|first2=P. T.|last3=Mussel|first3=C.|last4=Kestler|first4=H.

Boolean networks have been used in biology to model regulatory networks. Although Boolean networks are a crude simplification of genetic reality where genes are not simple binary switches, there are several cases where they correctly capture the correct pattern of expressed and suppressed genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=Réka|last2=Othmer|first2=Hans G|title=The topology of the regulatory interactions predicts the expression pattern of the segment polarity genes in Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2003|volume=223|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(03)00035-3|pmid=12782112|citeseerx=10.1.1.13.3370}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=J.|last2=Bench|first2=A.

== Classical model ==
A Boolean network is a particular kind of [[sequential dynamical system]], where time and states are discrete, i.e. both the set of variables and the set of states in the time series each have a [[bijection]] onto an integer series. Such systems are like [[cellular automata]] on networks, except for the fact that when they are set up each node has a rule that is randomly chosen from all ''2{{sup|2s}}'' possible ones with ''s'' inputs. With ''s=2'' class 2 behavior tends to dominate. But for ''s&gt;2'', the behavior one sees quickly approaches what is typical for a random mapping in which the network representing the evolution of the ''2{{sup|m}}'' states of the ''m'' underlying nodes is itself connected essentially randomly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|date=2002|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|location=Champaign, Illinois|isbn=978-1579550080|page=936|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''random Boolean network'''&amp;nbsp;(RBN) is one that is randomly selected from the set of all possible boolean networks of a particular size, ''N''.  One then can study statistically, how the expected properties of such networks depend on various statistical properties of the ensemble of all possible networks.  For example, one may study how the RBN behavior changes as the average connectivity is changed.

The first Boolean networks were proposed by [[Stuart A. Kauffman]] in 1969, as [[random]] models of [[genetic regulatory network]]s&lt;ref name=KauffmanOriginal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kauffman|first1=Stuart|title=Homeostasis and Differentiation in Random Genetic Control Networks|journal=Nature|date=11 October 1969|volume=224|issue=5215|pages=177–178|doi=10.1038/224177a0|bibcode = 1969Natur.224..177K }}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but their mathematical understanding only started in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=AldanaCoppersmithKadanoff&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aldana|first1=Maximo|last2=Coppersmith|first2=Susan|last3=Kadanoff|first3=Leo P.|title=Boolean Dynamics with Random Couplings|journal=Perspectives and Problems in Nonlinear Sciences|date=2003|pages=23–89|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-21789-5_2|arxiv=nlin/0204062|isbn=978-1-4684-9566-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=nlin.AO/0408006|last1=Gershenson|first1=Carlos|title=Introduction to Random Boolean Networks|journal=In Bedau, M., P.

Pp|volume=2004|pages=160–173|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attractors ===

Since a Boolean network has only 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; possible states, a trajectory will sooner or later  reach a previously visited state, and thus, since the dynamics are deterministic, the trajectory will fall into a steady state or cycle called an [[attractor]] (though in the broader field of dynamical systems a cycle is only an attractor if perturbations from it lead back to it). If the attractor has only a single state it is called a ''point attractor'', and if the attractor consists of more than one state it is called a ''cycle attractor''. The set of states that lead to an attractor is called the ''basin'' of the attractor. States which occur only at the beginning of trajectories (no trajectories lead ''to'' them), are called ''garden-of-Eden'' states&lt;ref name=WuenscheBook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wuensche|first1=Andrew|title=Exploring discrete dynamics : [the DDLab manual : tools for researching cellular automata, random Boolean and multivalue neworks [sic] and beyond]|date=2011|publisher=Luniver Press|location=Frome, England|isbn=9781905986316|page=16|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=qsktzY_Vg8QC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the dynamics of the network flow from these states towards attractors. The time it takes to reach an attractor is called ''transient time''.&lt;ref name=DrosselRbn /&gt;

With growing computer power and increasing understanding of the seemingly simple model, different authors gave different estimates for the mean number and length of the attractors, here a brief summary of key publications.&lt;ref name=GreilReview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greil|first1=Florian|title=Boolean Networks as Modeling Framework|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=2012|volume=3|pages=178|doi=10.3389/fpls.2012.00178|pmid=22912642|pmc=3419389}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stability ==
In dynamical systems theory, the structure and length of the attractors of a network corresponds to the dynamic phase of the network. The '''stability of Boolean networks''' depends on the connections of their [[Node (graph theory)|node]]s. A Boolean network can exhibit stable, critical or [[chaotic behavior]]. This phenomenon is governed by a critical value of the average number of connections of nodes (&lt;math&gt;K_{c}&lt;/math&gt;), and can be characterized by the [[Hamming distance]] as distance measure. In the unstable regime, the distance between two initially close states on average grows exponentially in time, while in the stable regime it decreases exponentially. In this, with "initially close states" one means that the Hamming distance is small compared with the number of nodes (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) in the network.

For '''N-K-model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kauffman |first=S. A. |date=1969 |title=Metabolic stability and epigenesis in randomly constructed genetic nets |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=437–467 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(69)90015-0|pmid=5803332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the network is stable if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;K_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, critical if &lt;math&gt;K=K_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, and unstable if &lt;math&gt;K&gt;K_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.

The state of a given node &lt;math&gt; n_{i} &lt;/math&gt; is updated according to its [[truth table]], whose outputs are randomly populated. &lt;math&gt; p_{i} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the probability of assigning an off output to a given series of input signals.

If &lt;math&gt; p_{i}=p=const. &lt;/math&gt; for every node, the transition between the stable and chaotic range depends on &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;. The critical value of the average  number of connections is &lt;math&gt; K_{c}=1/[2p(1-p)] &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Random Networks of Automata: A Simple Annealed Approximation|url = http://stacks.iop.org/0295-5075/1/i=2/a=001?key=crossref.8cf81041d96c6144f3a397d9cf72cf09|journal = Europhysics Letters (EPL)|date = 1986-01-15|pages = 45–49|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1209/0295-5075/1/2/001|first = B|last = Derrida|first2 = Y|last2 = Pomeau|bibcode = 1986EL......1...45D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; is not constant, and there is no correlation between the in-degrees and out-degrees, the conditions of stability is determined by &lt;math&gt; \langle K^{in}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phase transitions and antichaos in generalized Kauffman networks|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019400876Q|journal = Physics Letters A|date = 1995-01-02|pages = 331–334|volume = 196|issue = 5–6|doi = 10.1016/0375-9601(94)00876-Q|first = Ricard V.|last = Solé|first2 = Bartolo|last2 = Luque|bibcode = 1995PhLA..196..331S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phase transitions in random networks: Simple analytic determination of critical points|journal = Physical Review E|date = 1997-01-01|pages = 257–260|volume = 55|issue = 1|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.55.257|first = Bartolo|last = Luque|first2 = Ricard V.|last2 = Solé|bibcode = 1997PhRvE..55..257L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From topology to dynamics in biochemical networks |journal = Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science|date = 2001-12-01|issn = 1054-1500|pages = 809–815|volume = 11|issue = 4|doi = 10.1063/1.1414882|pmid = 12779520 |first = Jeffrey J.|last = Fox|first2 = Colin C.|last2 = Hill|bibcode = 2001Chaos..11..809F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network is stable if &lt;math&gt;\langle K^{in}\rangle &lt;K_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, critical if  &lt;math&gt;\langle K^{in}\rangle =K_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, and unstable if &lt;math&gt;\langle K^{in}\rangle &gt;K_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.

The conditions of stability are the same in the case of networks with [[Scale-free network|scale-free]] [[network topology|topology]] where the in-and out-degree distribution is a power-law distribution: &lt;math&gt; P(K) \propto K^{-\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\langle K^{in} \rangle=\langle K^{out} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, since every out-link from a node is an in-link to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A natural class of robust networks|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/100/15/8710|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2003-07-22|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 166377|pmid = 12853565|pages = 8710–8714|volume = 100|issue = 15|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1536783100|first = Maximino|last = Aldana|first2 = Philippe|last2 = Cluzel|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8710A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensitivity shows the probability that the output of the Boolean function of a given node changes if its input changes. For random Boolean networks,
&lt;math&gt; q_{i}=2p_{i}(1-p_{i}) &lt;/math&gt;. In the general case, stability of the network is governed by the largest [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] &lt;math&gt; \lambda_{Q} &lt;/math&gt; of matrix &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; Q_{ij}=q_{i}A_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is the [[adjacency matrix]] of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effect of network topology on the stability of discrete state models of genetic control|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8209|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2009-05-19|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 2688895|pmid = 19416903|pages = 8209–8214|volume = 106|issue = 20|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900142106|first = Andrew|last = Pomerance|first2 = Edward|last2 = Ott|first3 = Michelle|last3 = Girvan|first4 = Wolfgang|last4 = Losert|arxiv = 0901.4362|bibcode = 2009PNAS..106.8209P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network is stable if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{Q}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, critical if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{Q}=1&lt;/math&gt;, unstable if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{Q}&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Variations of the model ==

=== Other topologies ===
One theme is to study '''different underlying [[Graph topology|graph topologies]]'''.
* The homogeneous case simply refers to a grid which is simply the reduction to the famous [[Ising model]]. 
* [[Scale-free network|Scale-free]] topologies may be chosen for Boolean networks.&lt;ref name=AldanaScaleFree&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aldana|first1=Maximino|title=Boolean dynamics of networks with scale-free topology|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|date=October 2003|volume=185|issue=1|pages=45–66|doi=10.1016/s0167-2789(03)00174-x|arxiv=cond-mat/0209571|bibcode=2003PhyD..185...45A}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can distinguish the case where only in-degree distribution in power-law distributed,&lt;ref name=ScaleFreeInDegree&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drossel|first1=Barbara|last2=Greil|first2=Florian|title=Critical Boolean networks with scale-free in-degree distribution|journal=Physical Review E|date=4 August 2009|volume=80|issue=2|pages=026102|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.80.026102|pmid=19792195|arxiv=0901.0387|bibcode=2009PhRvE..80b6102D}}&lt;/ref&gt; or only the out-degree-distribution or both.

=== Other updating schemes ===
Classical Boolean networks (sometimes called '''CRBN''', i.e. Classic Random Boolean Network) are synchronously updated. Motivated by the fact that genes don't usually change their state simultaneously,&lt;ref name=HarveyBossomaier1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Imman|last2=Bossomaier|first2=Terry|editor1-last=Husbands|editor1-first=Phil|editor2-last=Harvey|editor2-first=Imman|title=Time out of joint: Attractors in asynchronous random Boolean networks|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL97)|date=1997|pages=67–75|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ccp8fzlyorAC&amp;pg=PA67|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262581578}}&lt;/ref&gt; different alternatives have been introduced.

* '''Deterministic asynchronous updated Boolean networks''' ('''DRBN'''s) are not synchronously updated but a deterministic solution still exists. A node ''i'' will be updated when ''t ≡ Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (''mod'' P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)'' where ''t'' is the time step.&lt;ref name=GershensonDrbn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gershenson|first1=Carlos|last2=Broekaert|first2=Jan|last3=Aerts|first3=Diederik|title=Contextual Random Boolean Networks|journal=Advances in Artificial Life|date=14 September 2003|volume=2801|pages=615–624|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-39432-7_66|arxiv=nlin/0303021|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|trans-title=7th European Conference, ECAL 2003|location=Dortmund, Germany|isbn=978-3-540-39432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Carr''' (born 1940) is an American [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] scholar and a Charles Howard Chandler Professor Emeritus of Philosophy from [[Emory University]].

==Biography==
Carr received his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at [[Yale University]], completing his doctorate there in 1966.&lt;ref name="phil"&gt;
[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], [http://phil.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/web/content.php?user_page_id=60&amp;mid=25-26 David Carr bio], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale he studied under the tutelage of [[Wilfred Sellars]] and [[Richard Bernstein]]. Concomitantly, as a graduate student, he studied at [[Heidelberg University]] under [[Karl Löwith]], [[Dieter Henrich]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], and at [[University of Paris]] under [[Paul Ricœur]].&lt;ref name="emory"&gt;[[Emory University]], [http://philosophy.emory.edu/home/people/emeritus/carr-david.html David Carr bio].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Professor Carr's research, publication and teaching have been devoted to various aspects of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s philosophy and to phenomenology in general. He is particularly attentive to the philosophy of history. The latter inquiry has led him to explore the nature of narrative, and has thus intersected with literary theory, [[Hegel]]'s phenomenology, and analytic theories of history. Carr's work is explicitly opposed to that of [[Louis Mink]], [[Hayden White]], and [[Roland Barthes]]; Carr considered the basis of narrative structure to inhere in the human phenomenology of experience, even if not in what he described as "merely physical" events.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, B. M., [https://open.bu.edu/pdfpreview/bitstream/handle/2144/15262/Roth_bu_0017E_10687.pdf "Narrative, understanding, and the self: Heidegger and the interpretation of lived experience"], [[Boston University Libraries]], OpenBU, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, his research interests fall on the nature of [[transcendental philosophy]], both in Husserl and in [[Kant]].
He is a former Executive Secretary and Board Member of the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]], and serves on the editorial boards of the philosophical series published by [[Indiana University Press]] and [[Northwestern University Press]], and by [[Springer Verlag]].&lt;ref name="phil" /&gt;
In retirement Carr has lectured on Husserl and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] at [[The New School for Social Research]],&lt;ref&gt;The New School for Social Research, [http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/?id=4d54-6b35-4d7a-4979 David Carr page].&lt;/ref&gt; and on Husserl's notion of “so etwas wie Leiblichkeit”—''something like corporality''—at [[Freie Universität Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Freie Universität Berlin,

}}

The '''discourse of power''' is used when it comes to differentiating the levels of [[Power (social and political)|power]] due to cultural and social characteristics that come about through societal upbringing. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlburg|first1=Michael|title=The Power of Discourse and the Discourse of Power: Pursuing Peace Through Discourse Intervention|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol10_1/Karlberg_101IJPS.pdf|website=International Journal of Peace Studies|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of the discourse of power within media has a domino effect and it can play a huge role in determining the patterns of access to the mass media: who has preferential access to journalists, who will be interviewed, who will be quoted and described in news reports, and whose opinions will influence the public? Through access to the mass media, dominant groups also may have access to and partial control over the public at large.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dijk|first1=Teun|title=Discourse Power and Access|url=http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Discourse,%20power%20and%20access.pdf|website=discourse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of mass media and power in the United States ==
{{See also|Media of the United States}}

Those with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial. A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy, but if not truly free, paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views, thus undermining democracy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Anup|title=Media in the United States|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/163/media-in-the-united-states|website=Global Issues|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which provides that "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States. A limited number of controls, such as regulatory laws, court decisions, and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media. In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication, such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Doris|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|title=Mass media and American politics|date=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452287287|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major mass media conglomerates in the United States===

*[[News Corporation]]
*[[Time Warner]]
*[[CBS Corporation]]
*[[Viacom]]
*[[General Electric]]

These media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives, media has never been more consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lutz|first1=Ashley|title=These 6 Corporations Control 90% of the Media in America|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6|website=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of media versus reality==
The shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality, symbolic reality, and socially constructed reality. Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily. Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them. The media is a [[hegemony|hegemonic]] form of power that maintains their position, not through force, but through elaboration of a particular world view, an ideology, or a particular notion of common sense, which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices. This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bybee|first1=Carl|title=Mass Media and Society|url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~cbybee/j201/overheads/hegemony_def.htm|website=University of Oregon - Journalism Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society, because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"/&gt;

=== Socially constructed reality ===
[[Social constructionism|Social construct]] examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. It assumes that understanding, significance, and meaning are developed not separately within the individual, but in coordination among other human beings. To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves. It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it. Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society, had different needs, values, or interests, an individual might have built a different kind of thing, or built this social construct differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Paul|title=What is Social Construction?|url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1153/socialconstruction.pdf|website=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to be aware that the values we hold, the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions, our experiences, our education and what we know for a fact. Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of.  We trust the media as an authority for news, information, education and entertainment. Considering that powerful influence, then, we should know how it really works. The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media.  Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today. Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers, magazines, radio or television. Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed. Sound recordings and film were and still are influential. Radio and then television were very influential. As the 20th century closed, TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing, suffering and relief, sexuality and violence, celebrity entertainment, and much more. New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century. We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs, popular culture websites and various social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=A|title=Mass Media Influence on Society|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media&amp;Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|website=University of North Carolina Pembroke|accessdate=27 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215065257/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media%26Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experienced reality===
Experienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition. It underlies all of our cognitive efforts. Because direct experience is largely sensory, automatic and constant, we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct. It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture.&lt;ref name="Guide to Reality"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim|title=A beginner's guide to reality : [exploring our everyday adventures in wonderland]|date=2006|publisher=Pegasus books|location=New York|isbn=9781933648040|edition=1st Pegasus Books}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Events or experiences spark change in an individual. Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe, and experienced reality is what initiates this idea. Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced.

===Symbolic reality===
Symbols exist everywhere for an individual. Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external, between inner and external reality of human being as a person. The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome [[personal boundaries]] including power struggles. Symbolic reality exists in and through person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekaterina|first1=Dr. Dvoretskaya|title=Personal approach to Symbolic reality|url=http://www.crvp.org/seminar/05-seminar/Ekaterina.htm|website=Council for Research in Values and Philosophy|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols are objects, characters, or other representations of ideas, concepts, or abstractions; they are the universal language in a culture. Symbols have been used for thousands of years, they help individuals communicate and interact with one another. Thus, as a representation, their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic. The culture’s members must interpret, and over time reinterpret, Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms, such as: verbal or nonverbal, written or unwritten, words on the page, drawings, pictures, gesture. They are things which act as triggers to remind people, in the culture, of its rules, beliefs… Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic; and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as, but more subtly than, conventional language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power of Symbols|url=http://bizshifts-trends.com/2012/01/23/power-of-symbols-symbolisms-and-brand-in-developing-global-markets-anthropology-of-business-marketing-leadership/|website=Business Shifts and Trends|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the level of power, media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}
The '''existence of God''' is a subject of debate in the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''The Rationality of Theism'' quoting [[Quentin Smith]] "God is not 'dead' in academia; it returned to life in the late 1960s". They cite "the shift from hostility towards theism in Paul Edwards's ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) to sympathy towards theism in the more recent ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of arguments for and against the existence of [[God]] can be categorized as [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[logic]]al, [[Empirical research|empirical]], or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]. In [[Philosophy|philosophical]] terms, the question of the existence of God involves the disciplines of [[epistemology]] (the nature and scope of [[knowledge]]) and [[ontology]] (study of the nature of [[being]], [[existence]], or [[reality]]) and the [[Value theory|theory of value]] (since some definitions of God include "perfection").

The [[Western philosophy|Western tradition of philosophical discussion]] of the existence of God began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], who made arguments that would now be categorized as [[cosmological argument|cosmological]]. Other arguments for the existence of God have been proposed by [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], who formulated the first [[ontological argument]]; [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroes)]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], who presented their own versions of the cosmological argument (the [[Kalam argument|''kalam'' argument]] and the [[Quinque viae|first way]], respectively); [[René Descartes]], who said that the existence of a benevolent God is [[logically necessary]] for the evidence of the senses to be meaningful. [[John Calvin]] argued for a ''[[sensus divinitatis]]'', which gives each human a knowledge of God's existence.

Philosophers who have provided arguments against the existence of God include [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hume]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. In modern culture, the question of God's existence has been discussed by scientists such as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Francis Collins]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNzlfYJaaCg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[John Lennox]] and [[Sam Harris]], as well as philosophers including [[Richard Swinburne]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[Rebecca Goldstein]], [[A. C. Grayling]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Edward Feser]] and [[David Bentley Hart]].

Scientists follow the [[scientific method]], within which theories must be verifiable by [[physical experiment]]. The majority of prominent conceptions of God explicitly or effectively posit a being which is not testable either by proof or disproof. On these bases, the question regarding the existence of God, one for which evidence cannot be tested, may lie outside the purview of modern science [[Relationship between religion and science|by definition]]. The [[Catholic Church]] maintains that knowledge of the existence of God is the "natural light of human reason".&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 47; cf. Canons of the First Vatican Council, 2:2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fideism|Fideists]] maintain that belief in the existence of God may not be amenable to demonstration or refutation, but rests on [[faith]] alone.

[[Atheists]] view arguments for the existence of God as insufficient, mistaken or weighing less in comparison to arguments against whereas some religions, such as [[Buddhism]], are not concerned with the existence of [[deity|gods]] at all and yet other religions, such as [[Jainism]], reject the possibility of a [[creator deity]].

==Positions==
[[File:EU belief in God.svg|thumb|Europeans polled who "believe in a god", according to [[Eurobarometer]] in 2005]]
[[File:Religious Belief in North America.png|thumb|North Americans polled about religious identity]]
Positions on the existence of God can be divided along numerous axes, producing a variety of orthogonal classifications. Theism and atheism are positions of belief (or lack of it), while [[gnosticism]] and agnosticism are positions of knowledge (or the lack of it). Ignosticism concerns belief regarding God's conceptual coherence. [[Apatheism]] concerns belief regarding the practical importance of whether God exists.

For the purposes of discussion, [[Richard Dawkins]] described seven "milestones" on his [[spectrum of theistic probability]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The God Delusion |isbn=978-0-618-68000-9 |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006 |page=50|title-link=The God Delusion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Strong theist. 100% [[probability]] of God. In the words of [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]]: "I do not believe, I know."
# ''[[De facto]]'' [[theist]]. Very high probability but short of 100%. "I don't know for certain, but I strongly believe in God and live my life on the assumption that he is there."
# Leaning towards theism. Higher than 50% but not very high. "I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God."
# Completely impartial. Exactly 50%. "God's existence and non-existence are exactly equiprobable."
# Leaning towards [[atheism]]. Lower than 50% but not very low. "I do not know whether God exists but I'm inclined to be skeptical."
# ''De facto'' atheist. Very low probability, but short of zero. "I don't know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there."
# Strong atheist. "I know there is no God, with the same conviction as Jung knows there is one."

===Theism===
{{Main|Theism}}
The Catholic Church, following the teachings of [[Paul the Apostle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[First Vatican Council]], affirms that God's existence "can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason".&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Council I, ''Dei Filius'' 2; quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 2nd edition (New York: Doubleday, 1995) n. 36, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traditional religious definition of God: personal, omnipotent, benevolent, transcendent====
In [[classical theism]], God is characterized as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is devoid of any [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as [[Theistic Personalism|theistic personalism]], [[open theism]], and [[process theism]]. Classical theists do not believe that God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict the [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barron|first=Robert|title=Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith|year=2011|publisher=The Doubleday Religious Publishing Group|isbn=9780307720511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Western societies, the [[Conceptions of God|concepts of God]] typically entail a [[monotheism|monotheistic]], supreme, ultimate, and [[personal god|personal being]], as found in the [[Christian]], [[Islam]]ic and [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions. In monotheistic religions outside the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]], the existence of God is discussed in similar terms. In these traditions, God is also identified as the author (either directly or by inspiration) of certain texts, or that certain texts describe specific historical events caused by the God in question or communications from God (whether in direct speech or via dreams or omens).  Some traditions also believe that God is the entity which is currently answering prayers for intervention or information or opinions.[[File:Ibn rushd.jpg|thumb|Ibn Rushd a 12th-century Islamic scholar]]

Many Islamic scholars have used philosophical and rational arguments to prove the existence of God. For example, [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd,]] a 12th-century Islamic scholar, philosopher, and physician, states there are only two arguments worthy of adherence, both of which are found in what he calls the "Precious Book" (The Qur'an). Rushd cites “providence” and “invention” in using the Qur'an's parables to claim the existence of God. Rushd argues that the Earth's weather patterns are conditioned to support human life; thus, if the planet is so finely-tuned to maintain life, then it suggests a fine tuner - God. The Sun and the Moon are not just random objects floating in the [[Milky Way]], rather they serve us day and night, and the way nature works and how life is formed, humankind benefits from it. Rushd essentially comes to a conclusion that there has to be a higher being who has made everything perfectly to serve the needs of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/ibnrushd/#H4|title=Ibn Rushd (Averroes)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/25/61|title=Quranic Parable|last=|first=|date=|website=Quran.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/78/6-16?translations=20|title=Quranic Parable|last=|first=|date=|website=Quran.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/80/24-33|title=Quranic Parable|last=|first=|date=|website=Quran.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses ben Maimon, widely known as [[Maimonides]], was a Jewish scholar who tried to logically prove the existence of God. Maimonides offered proofs for the existence of God, but he did not begin with defining God first, like many others do. Rather, he used the description of the earth and the universe to prove the existence of God. He talked about the Heavenly bodies and how they are committed to eternal motion. Maimonides argued that because every physical object is finite, it can only contain a finite amount of power. If everything in the universe, which includes all the planets and the stars, is finite, then there has to be an infinite power to push forth the motion of everything in the universe. Narrowing down to an infinite being, the only thing that can explain the motion is an infinite being (meaning God) which is neither a body nor a force in the body. Maimonides believed that this argument gives us a ground to believe that God is, not an idea of what God is. He believed that God cannot be understood or be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/maimonides/#GodViaNeg|title=Maimonides|last=Seeskin|first=Kenneth|date=|website=plato.stanford|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-personal definitions of God====
In [[pantheism]], God and the universe are considered to be the same thing.  In this view, the natural sciences are essentially studying the nature of God. This definition of God creates the philosophical problem that a universe with God and one without God are the same, other than the words used to describe it.

[[Deism]] and [[panentheism]] assert that there is a God distinct from, or which extends beyond (either in time or in space or in some other way) the universe. These positions deny that God intervenes in the operation of the universe, including communicating with humans personally. The notion that God never intervenes or communicates with the universe, or may have evolved into the universe, makes it difficult, if not by definition impossible, to distinguish between a universe with God and one without.

====Debate about how theism should be argued====
In Christian faith, theologians and philosophers make a distinction between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.

The argument that the existence of God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. St. Paul made this argument when he said that pagans were without excuse because "since the creation of the world God's invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Romans|1:20|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas&lt;ref&gt;For the proofs of God's existence by Saint Thomas Aquinas see Quinquae viae.&lt;/ref&gt; and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.

Another apologetical school of thought, including Dutch and American [[Reformed Churches|Reformed]] thinkers (such as [[Abraham Kuyper]], [[Benjamin Warfield]], [[Herman Dooyeweerd]]), emerged in the late 1920s. This school was instituted by [[Cornelius Van Til]], and came to be popularly called [[presuppositional apologetics]] (though Van Til himself felt "transcendental" would be a more accurate title). The main distinction between this approach and the more classical evidentialist approach is that the presuppositionalist denies any common ground between the believer and the non-believer, except that which the non-believer denies, namely, the assumption of the truth of the theistic worldview. In other words, presuppositionalists do not believe that the existence of God can be proven by appeal to raw, uninterpreted, or "brute" facts, which have the same (theoretical) meaning to people with fundamentally different worldviews, because they deny that such a condition is even possible. They claim that the only possible proof for the existence of God is that the very same belief is the necessary condition to the intelligibility of all other human experience and action. They attempt to prove the existence of God by means of appeal to the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] necessity of the belief—indirectly (by appeal to the unavowed presuppositions of the non-believer's worldview) rather than directly (by appeal to some form of common factuality). In practice this school utilizes what have come to be known as [[Transcendental argument for the existence of God|transcendental arguments]]. In these arguments they claim to demonstrate that all human experience and action (even the condition of unbelief, itself) is a proof for the existence of God, because God's existence is the necessary condition of their intelligibility.

Alvin Plantinga presents an argument for the existence of God using [[modal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Alvin | last=Plantinga | authorlink=Alvin Plantinga | title=The Nature of Necessity | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1974 | page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have said that the logical and philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God miss the point. The word ''God'' has a meaning in human culture and history that does not correspond to the beings whose existence is supported by such arguments, assuming they are valid. The real question is not whether a "most perfect being" or an "uncaused first cause" exist. The real question is whether [[Jehovah]], [[Zeus]], [[Ra]], Krishna, or any gods of any religion exist, and if so, which gods? On the other hand, many theists equate all monotheistic or henotheistic "most perfect Beings", no matter what name is assigned to them/him, as the one monotheistic God (one example would be understanding the Muslim [[Allah]], Christian [[YHWH|Yhwh]], and Chinese [[Shangdi]] as different names for the same Being). Most of these arguments do not resolve the issue of which of these figures is more likely to exist. These arguments fail to make the distinction between immanent gods and a Transcendent God.

Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} Christians note that the Christian faith teaches "[[salvation]] is by faith",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb|2|Timothy|3:14–15|NIV}} &lt;cite&gt;NIV&lt;/cite&gt; "But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." ''The Holy Bible, New International Version''. International Bible Society. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In ''The Justification of Knowledge'', the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theologian [[Robert L. Reymond]] argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position is similar to that of his mentor [[Gordon Clark]], which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a "[[leap of faith]]". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.

===Atheism===
{{Main|Atheism}}
The atheistic conclusion is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient reason to believe that any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say something about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has no reason to believe that a god exists.

====Positive atheism====
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
[[Positive atheism]] (also called "strong atheism" and "hard atheism") is a form of atheism that asserts that no deities exist.&lt;ref name=Flew1976&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The strong atheist explicitly asserts the non-existence of gods. Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} strong atheists further assert that the existence of gods is logically impossible, stating that the combination of attributes which God may be asserted to have (omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, transcendence, omnibenevolence) are logically contradictory, incomprehensible, or absurd, and therefore the existence of such a god is ''a priori'' false. Metaphysical naturalism is a common worldview associated with strong atheism.

====Negative atheism====
Negative atheism (also called "weak atheism" and "soft atheism") is any type of atheism other than positive, wherein a person does not believe in the existence of any deities, but does not explicitly assert there to be none.&lt;ref name="Flew1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmartin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="synonyms"/&gt;

===Agnosticism===
{{Main|Agnosticism}}
Agnosticism is the view that the [[truth value]] of certain claims—especially claims about the existence of any deity, but also other religious and metaphysical claims—is unknown or unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/agnosticism.html|title=agnosticism|last=Carroll|first=Robert|date=2009-02-22|website=The Skeptic's Dictionary|publisher=skepdic.com|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnosticism as a broad umbrella term does not define one's belief or disbelief in gods; agnostics may still identify themselves as theists or atheists.&lt;ref name="Agnostic Types"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/p/overview.htm|title=What is Agnosticism?|last=Cline|first=Austin|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strong agnosticism====
[[Strong agnosticism]] is the belief that it is impossible for humans to know whether or not any deities exist.

====Weak agnosticism====
{{Main|Weak agnosticism}}
Weak agnosticism is the belief that the existence or nonexistence of deities is unknown but not necessarily unknowable.

====Agnostic theism====
{{Main|Agnostic theism}}
Agnostic theism is the [[philosophical]] view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism. An agnostic theist believes in the existence of a god or God, but regards the basis of this proposition as ''unknown or inherently unknowable''. Agnostic theists may also insist on ignorance regarding the properties of the gods they believe in.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/theism.htm |title=Introduction to Agnosticism: What is Agnostic Theism? Believing in God, but not Knowing God |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agnostic atheism====
{{Main|Agnostic atheism}}
Agnostic atheism is a philosophical position that encompasses both atheism and agnosticism. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a [[belief]] in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a [[deity]] is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.

The theologian [[Robert Flint]] explains:
{{quote|If a man have failed to find any good reason for believing that there is a God, it is perfectly natural and rational that he should not believe that there is a God; and if so, he is an atheist, although he assume no superhuman knowledge, but merely the ordinary human power of judging of evidence. If he go farther, and, after an investigation into the nature and reach of human knowledge, ending in the conclusion that the existence of God is incapable of proof, cease to believe in it on the ground that he cannot know it to be true, he is an agnostic and also an atheist, an agnostic-atheist—an atheist because an agnostic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Robert|title=Agnosticism|publisher=C.

===Apatheism===
{{Main|Apatheism}}
An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or denying any claims that gods exist or do not exist. An apatheist lives as if there are no gods and explains natural [[phenomena]] without reference to any deities. The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to [[personal life|life]], nor influence [[everyday life]], according to this view.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignosticism===
{{Main|Ignosticism}}
The ignostic (or igtheist) usually concludes that the question of God's existence or nonexistence is usually not worth discussing because concepts like "God" are usually not sufficiently clearly defined. Ignosticism or igtheism is the theological position that every other theological position (including [[agnosticism]] and atheism) assumes too much about the concept of God and many other theological concepts. It can be defined as encompassing two related views about the existence of God. The view that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed. Furthermore, if that definition is [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], the ignostic takes the [[theological noncognitivism|theological noncognitivist]] position that the question of the existence of God (per that definition) is meaningless.{{cn|reason= Citation needed for what seems very dubious Original Research (OR). The OR seems especially dubious as seemingly coming from a pseudo-Popperian perspective; Karl Popper objected to Logical Positivists' insistence that what was not verifiable was meaningless, and brought in Falsifiability partly to oppose them, but he also said that they were abusing the word 'meaningless' in a way that would wrongly render many important areas of human thought and experience 'meaningless'; there's no reason to suppose that ignostics are generally pseudo-Popperians, nor to unwittingly or wittingly imply it in this article. But all that's probably a lot less relevant here than the fact that the statement is seemingly OR.|date=August 2018}} In this case, the concept of God is not considered meaningless; the term "God" is considered meaningless. The second view is synonymous with theological noncognitivism, and skips the step of first asking "What is meant by 'God'?" before proclaiming the original question "Does God exist?" as meaningless.

Some philosophers have seen ignosticism as a variation of agnosticism or atheism,&lt;ref name="The Argument From Non-Cognitivism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others{{Who|date=December 2016}} have considered it to be distinct.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} An ignostic maintains that he cannot even say whether he is a [[Theism|theist]] or an atheist until a sufficient definition of theism is put forth.

The term "ignosticism" was coined in the 1960s by [[Sherwin Wine]], a [[rabbi]] and a founding figure of [[Humanistic Judaism]]. The term "igtheism" was coined by the [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] [[Paul Kurtz]] in his 1992 book ''The New Skepticism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/07/definitions_1 |title=isms of the week: Agnosticism and Ignosticism |accessdate=December 19, 2011 | work=The Economist |date=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical issues==

===The problem of the supernatural===
One problem posed by the question of the existence of God is that traditional beliefs usually ascribe to God various [[supernatural]] powers. Supernatural beings may be able to conceal and reveal themselves for their own purposes, as for example in the tale of [[Baucis and Philemon]]. In addition, according to concepts of God, God is not part of the natural order, but the ultimate creator of nature and of the scientific laws. Thus in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], God is viewed as part of the explanatory structure needed to support scientific conclusions and any powers God possesses are—strictly speaking—of the natural order that is derived from God's place as originator of nature (see also [[Monadology]]).

In [[Karl Popper]]'s [[philosophy of science]], belief in a supernatural God is outside the natural domain of scientific investigation because all scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable in the natural world. The [[non-overlapping magisteria]] view proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] also holds that the existence (or otherwise) of God is irrelevant to and beyond the domain of science.

[[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] viewed any talk of gods as literal nonsense. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, statements about religious or other transcendent experiences can not have a [[truth value]], and are deemed to be without meaning, because such statements do not have any clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist [[Scott C. Todd]] put it "Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic."&lt;ref&gt;Scott C. Todd, "A View from Kansas on that Evolution Debate," Nature Vol. 401, Sep. 30, 1999, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; This argument limits the domain of science to the empirically observable and limits the domain of God to the unprovable.

===Nature of relevant proofs and arguments===
[[John Polkinghorne]] suggests that the nearest analogy to the existence of God in physics is the ideas of [[quantum mechanics]] which are seemingly paradoxical but make sense of a great deal of disparate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=John | last=Polkinghorne | authorlink=John Polkinghorne | title=Belief in God in an Age of Science | year=1998 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=978-0-300-07294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvin Plantinga compares the question of the existence of God to the question of the existence of [[Problem of other minds|other minds]], claiming both are notoriously impossible to "prove" against a determined skeptic.&lt;ref&gt;see his ''God and Other Minds: A Study of the Rational Justification of Belief in God'' Cornell (1990) {{ISBN|0-8014-9735-3}} and ''Warranted Christian Belief'' OUP (2000) {{ISBN|0-19-513193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach, suggested by writers such as Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] as though they were two hypotheses in the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the [http://www.starcourse.org/discussion/ Beale/Howson debate] published [[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]] May, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously suggested by proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the [[prior probability]] that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''[[The Probability of God]]'' by ''Stephen D. Unwin'' its criticism in [[The God Delusion]], and the critical comment in that article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers, such as [[Wittgenstein]], take a view that is considered [[Anti-realism|anti-realist]] and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] contends that the real is whatever will not go away. If we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, then perhaps God is as real as anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens/ |title=iep.utm.edu |publisher=iep.utm.edu |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Berkeley]]'s ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' of 1710, he argued that a "naked thought" cannot exist, and that a perception is a thought; therefore only minds can be proven to exist, since all else is merely an idea conveyed by a perception. From this Berkeley argued that the universe is based upon observation and is non-objective. However, he noted that the universe includes "ideas" not perceptible to humankind, and that there must, therefore, exist an omniscient superobserver, which perceives such things. Berkeley considered this proof of the existence of the Christian god.

[[C.S. Lewis]], in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' and elsewhere, raised the [[argument from desire]]. He posed that all natural desires have a natural object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies the existence of such things, though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mere Christianity, Bk. III|chapter=10|first=C.S.|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside of Western thought===
Existence in absolute truth is central to [[Vedanta]] epistemology. Traditional sense perception based approaches were put into question as possibly misleading due to preconceived or superimposed ideas. But though all object-cognition can be doubted, the existence of the doubter remains a fact even in ''[[nastika]]'' traditions of ''[[mayavada]]'' schools following [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-7914-7081-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Klostermaier, Klaus K. |title=A survey of Hinduism |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2007 |page=357|isbn=978-0-7914-7081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five eternal principles to be discussed under ontology, beginning with God or Isvara, the [[Ultimate Reality]] cannot be established by the means of [[logic]] alone, and often require superior proof.&lt;ref&gt;Sudesh Narang (1984)''The Vaisnava Philosophy According to Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Vaisnavism]] [[Vishnu]], or his intimate ontological form of [[Krishna]], is equated to personal absolute God of the Western traditions. Aspects of Krishna as ''[[svayam bhagavan]]'' in original Absolute Truth, ''[[sat chit ananda]]'', are understood originating from three essential attributes of Krishna's form, i.e., "eternal existence" or ''{{IAST|sat}}'', related to the ''[[brahman]]'' aspect; "knowledge" or chit, to the ''[[paramatman]]''; and "bliss" or ''ananda'' in [[Sanskrit]], to ''[[bhagavan]]''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-231-12256-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Ekstrand |author2=Bryant, Edwin H. |title=The Hare Krishna movement: the postcharismatic fate of a religious transplant |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |year=2004 |page=7|isbn=978-0-231-12256-6|title-link=Hare Krishna movement }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for the existence of God==

===Empirical arguments===

====Argument from beauty====
One form of the [[argument from beauty]] is that the elegance of the laws of physics, which have been empirically discovered, or the [[Mathematical beauty|elegant laws of mathematics]], which are abstract but which have empirically proven to be useful, is evidence of a [[creator deity]] who has arranged these things to be beautiful and not ugly.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Argument from consciousness====
The [[argument from consciousness]] claims that human consciousness cannot be explained by the physical mechanisms of the human body and brain, therefore, asserting that there must be non-physical aspects to human consciousness.  This is held as indirect evidence of God, given that notions about [[soul]]s and the [[afterlife]] in Christianity and Islam would be consistent with such a claim.  Critics point out that non-physical aspects of consciousness could exist in a universe without any gods; for example, some religions that believe in [[reincarnation]] are compatible with atheism, monotheism, and polytheism.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The notion of the soul was created before modern understanding of [[neural network]]s and the physiology of the brain.  Decades of experimentation lead [[cognitive science]] to consider thought and emotion as physical processes although the experience of consciousness still remains poorly understood.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  The [[hard problem of consciousness]] remains as to whether different people subjectively experience the world in the same way — for example, that the color blue looks the same inside the minds of different people, though this is a philosophical problem with both physical and non-physical explanations.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Aquinas' Five Ways====
{{Main|Quinque viae}}
{{Hatnote|For in depth analysis of the individual arguments, see [[unmoved mover]], [[first cause]], [[argument from contingency]], [[argument from degree]], or [[teleological argument]].}}
In article 3, question 2, first part of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed his five arguments for God's existence. These arguments are grounded in an Aristotelian ontology and make use of the [[infinite regress|infinite regression argument]].&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|year=1274|location=Part 1, Question 2, Article 3|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aquinas|first1=Thomas|last2=Kreeft|first2=Peter|title=Summa of the Summa|year=1990|publisher=Ignatius Press|pages=65–69|isbn=9780898703009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas did not intend to fully prove the existence of God as he is orthodoxly conceived (with all of his traditional attributes), but proposed his Five Ways as a first stage, which he built upon later in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Thought of Thomas Aquinas | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Davies, Brian | year=1992 | page=26 | isbn=9780191520440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas' Five Ways argued from the [[unmoved mover]], [[first cause]], [[necessary being]], [[argument from degree]], and the [[teleological argument]].

*The unmoved mover argument asserts that, from our experience of motion in the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) we can see that there must have been an initial mover. Aquinas argued that whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another thing, so there must be an unmoved mover.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*Aquinas' argument from first cause started with the premise that it is impossible for a being to cause itself (because it would have to exist before it caused itself) and that it is impossible for there to be an infinite chain of causes, which would result in infinite regress. Therefore, there must be a first cause, itself uncaused.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*The argument from [[Argument from contingency|necessary being]] asserts that all beings are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], meaning that it is possible for them not to exist. Aquinas argued that if everything can possibly not exist, there must have been a time when nothing existed; as things exist now, there must exist a being with necessary existence, regarded as God.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*Aquinas argued from degree, considering the occurrence of degrees of goodness. He believed that things which are called good, must be called good in relation to a standard of good—a maximum. There must be a maximum goodness that which causes all goodness.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*The teleological argument asserts the view that things without intelligence are ordered towards a purpose. Aquinas argued that unintelligent objects cannot be ordered unless they are done so by an intelligent being, which means that there must be an intelligent being to move objects to their ends: God.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;

==== Dialectical argument ====
Philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] signed a publishing contract in 1831 for his final book, ''Lectures on the Proofs of the Existence of God'' (1831). Sadly, Hegel died that year, before completing his first draft of that work.  What we know about this planned work we find in the pages of his ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1818-1831). There we find that Hegel proposed a dialectical reworking of the three classical proofs of the existence of God, namely: (1) the [[cosmological argument]]; (2) the [[teleological argument]]; and (3) the [[ontological argument]]. Hegel recognized that [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' had sharply criticized the three classical proofs, and as a veteran critic of Kantian epistemology, Hegel chose to show where Kant, [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]] had been mistaken in their negative positions over the three classical proofs.  Thus, Hegel went about reworking these classical arguments by using his own dialectical logic.

====Rational warrant====
Philosopher [[Stephen Toulmin]] is notable for his work in the history of ideas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Edelston Toulmin|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/600670/Stephen-Edelston-Toulmin|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that features the (rational) warrant: a statement that connects the premises to a conclusion.

Joseph Hinman applied Toulmin's approach in his argument for the existence of God, particularly in his book ''The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of attempting to prove the existence of God, Hinman argues you can "demonstrate the rationally-warranted nature of belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=On Rational Warrant|url=http://metacrock.blogspot.com/2010/07/on-rational-warrant.html|website=Metacrock|accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinman uses a wide range of studies, including ones by Robert Wuthnow, Andrew Greeley, Mathes and Kathleen Nobel to establish that mystical experiences are life-transformative in a way that is significant, positive and lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=85–92|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He draws on additional work to add several additional major points to his argument. First, the people who have these experiences not only do not exhibit traditional signs of mental illness but, often, are in better mental and physical health than the general population due to the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=90–92|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the experiences work. In other words, they provide a framework for navigating life that is useful and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=100–103|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the evidence of the positive effects of the experience upon people's lives he, adapting a term from [[Derrida]], terms "the trace of God": the footprints left behind that point to the impact.

Finally, he discusses how both religious experience and belief in God is, and has always been, normative among humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=104–105|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; people do not need to prove the existence of God. If there is no need to prove, Hinman argues, and the Trace of God (for instance, the impact of mystical experiences on them), belief in God is rationally warranted.{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}

===Deductive arguments===
====Ontological argument====
{{Main|Ontological argument}}
The ontological argument has been formulated by philosophers including [[St. Anselm]] and [[René Descartes]]. The argument proposes that God's existence is self-evident. The logic, depending on the formulation, reads roughly as follows:&lt;ref name="Nolan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nolan|first=Lawrence|title=Descartes' Ontological Argument|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/|publisher=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Whatever is contained in a clear and distinct idea of a thing must be predicated of that thing; but a clear and distinct idea of an absolutely perfect Being contains the idea of actual existence; therefore since we have the idea of an absolutely perfect Being such a Being must really exist.&lt;ref name="Nolan" /&gt;}}

Thomas Aquinas criticized the argument for proposing a definition of God which, if God is transcendent, should be impossible for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|year=1274|location=Part 1, Question 2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant criticized the proof from a logical standpoint: he stated that the term "God" really signifies two different terms: both idea of God, and God. Kant concluded that the proof is equivocation, based on the ambiguity of the word God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kreeft|first=Peter|title=Socrates Meets Kant|year=2009|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=9781586173487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also challenged the argument's assumption that existence is a predicate (of perfection) because it does not add anything to the essence of a being. If existence is not a predicate, then it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] that the greatest possible being exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ont-arg | title=Ontological Argument | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=27 April 2005 | accessdate=October 12, 2011 | author=Himma, Kenneth Einar}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common rebuttal to Kant's critique is that, although "existence" does add something to both the concept and the reality of God, the concept would be vastly different if its referent is an unreal Being.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Another response to Kant is attributed to Alvin Plantinga who explains that even if one were to grant Kant that "existence" is not a real predicate, "Necessary Existence", which is the correct formulation of an understanding of God, is a real predicate, thus according to Plantinga Kant's argument is refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/plantinga.html |title=Plantinga 'The Ontological Argument' Text |publisher=Mind.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314123846/http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/plantinga.html |archivedate=2013-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inductive arguments===
Inductive arguments argue their conclusions through [[inductive reasoning]].
* Another class of philosophers asserts that the proofs for the existence of God present a fairly large probability though not absolute certainty. A number of obscure points, they say, always remain; an act of faith is required to dismiss these difficulties. This view is maintained, among others, by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] statesman [[Arthur Balfour]] in his book ''The Foundations of Belief'' (1895). The opinions set forth in this work were adopted in [[France]] by [[Ferdinand Brunetière]], the editor of the ''[[Revue des deux Mondes]]''. Many orthodox Protestants express themselves in the same manner, as, for instance, Dr. E. Dennert, President of the Kepler Society, in his work ''Ist Gott tot?''&lt;ref&gt;(Stuttgart, 1908)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other arguments====
* The hypothesis of well design proposes that certain features of the universe and of [[Life|living things]] are the product of an [[Intelligence|intelligent]] [[Causality|cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentdesign.org/whatisid.php |title=Intelligent Design |publisher=Intelligent Design |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents are mainly Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

===Subjective arguments===
====Arguments from historical events or personages====
* The sincere seeker's argument, espoused by Muslim Sufis of the Tasawwuf tradition, posits that every individual who follows a formulaic path towards guidance, arrives at the same destination of conviction in the existence of God and specifically in the monotheistic tenets and laws of Islam. This could only be true if the formula and supplication were being answered by the same Divine entity being addressed, as claimed in Islamic revelations.  This was formally organized by Imam Abu Hamid [[Al-Ghazali]] in such notable works as "Deliverance from Error" and "The Alchemy of Happiness," in Arabic "[[Kimiya-yi sa'adat]]".  The path includes following the golden rule of no harm to others and treating others with compassion, silence or minimal speech, seclusion, daily fasting or minimalist diet of water and basic nourishment, honest wages, and daily supplication towards "the Creator of the Universe" for guidance.&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1100"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hamid|title=Deliverance from Error|year=1100|url=http://ghazali.org/books/md/gz101.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hamid|title=The Alchemy of Happiness|year=1105|url=http://www.ghazali.org/books/alchemy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] assert that God intervened in key specific moments in history, especially at [[the Exodus]] and the giving of the [[Ten Commandments]] in front of all the tribes of Israel, positing an argument from empirical evidence stemming from sheer number of witnesses, thus demonstrating his existence.{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=Citation|https://books.google.com/books?id=CfVDG8aAcLIC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=Christianity+and+Judaism+assert+that+God+intervened+in+key+specific+moments+in+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-SDrY9TP90&amp;sig=1RRyylUjmHO1zkSDxkQQlBjNHoY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzsOSnmb3PAhXSix4KHaN2DIsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false=}}
* [[Christological argument]]s assert that certain events of the Christian [[New Testament]] are historically accurate, and prove God's existence, namely:
** The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=John | last=Polkinghorne | authorlink=John Polkinghorne | title=Science and Christian Belief | pages=108–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an [[argument from miracles]])
** The claims of Jesus, as a morally upstanding person, to be the son of God (an [[argument from authority]])
** The belief of Jesus, as a wise person, that God exists (an [[argument from authority]])
* Islam asserts that the revelation of its holy book, the [[Qur'an]], and its unique literary attributes, vindicate its divine authorship, and thus the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Islamic Awareness: The Challenge of the Qur'an | url=http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Miracle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Inimitability of the Qur'an | url=http://www.hamzatzortzis.com/essays-articles/exploring-the-quran/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], also known as [[Mormonism]], similarly asserts that the miraculous appearance of God, Jesus Christ, and angels to [[Joseph Smith]] and others and subsequent finding and translation of the [[Book of Mormon]] establishes the existence of God. The whole [[Latter Day Saint movement]] makes the same claim for example [[Community of Christ]], [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], [[Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]], [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]], etc.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
** The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), similarly asserts that the finding and translation of the [[Plates of Laban]], also known as the [[Brass Plates]], into the [[Book of the Law of the Lord]] and [[Voree plates]] by [[James Strang]], [[One Mighty and Strong]], establishes the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
** Various sects that have broken from the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) (such as [[Church of Christ "With the Elijah Message"]] and [[Church of Christ (Assured Way)]]) claim that the message brought by [[John the Baptist]], One Mighty and Strong, to [[Otto Fetting]] and [[W. A. Draves]] in [[The Word of the Lord|The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel]] establishes the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Arguments from testimony====
Arguments from testimony rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, possibly embodying the propositions of a specific revealed [[religion]]. Swinburne argues that it is a principle of rationality that one should accept testimony unless there are strong reasons for not doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Richard | last=Swinburne | authorlink=Richard Swinburne | title=Is there a God? | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-19-823545-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[witness argument]] gives credibility to personal [[witness]]es, contemporary and throughout the ages. A variation of this is the [[argument from miracles]] (also referred to as "the priest stories") which relies on testimony of supernatural events to establish the existence of God.
* The [[argument from common consent|majority argument]] argues that the theism of people throughout most of recorded history and in many different places provides ''[[prima facie]]'' demonstration of God's existence.

=====Arguments grounded in personal experiences=====
{{See also|Anecdotal evidence}}
* The sincere seeker's argument, espoused by Muslim Sufis of the Tasawwuf tradition, posits that every individual who follows a formulaic path towards guidance, arrives at the same destination of conviction in the existence of God and specifically in the monotheistic tenets and laws of Islam. This apparent natural law for guidance and belief could only be consistent if the formula and supplication were being answered by the same Divine entity being addressed, as claimed in Islamic revelations.  This was formally organized by Imam Abu Hamid [[Al-Ghazali]] in such notable works as "Deliverance from Error" and "The Alchemy of Happiness," in Arabic "[[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat]]".  The path includes following the golden rule of no harm to others and treating others with compassion, silence or minimal speech, seclusion, daily fasting or minimalist diet of water and basic nourishment, honest wages, and daily supplication towards "the Creator of the Universe" for guidance.&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1105"/&gt;
* The [[Argument from a proper basis]] argues that belief in God is "properly basic"; that it is similar to statements like "I see a chair" or "I feel pain".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Such beliefs are non-falsifiable and, thus, neither provable nor disprovable; they concern perceptual beliefs or indisputable mental states.
* In [[Germany]], the School of [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] taught that human reason is able to perceive the suprasensible. Jacobi distinguished three faculties: sense, [[reason]], and understanding. Just as sense has immediate perception of the material so has reason immediate perception of the immaterial, while the understanding brings these perceptions to a person's consciousness and unites them to one another.&lt;ref&gt;([[A. Stöckl]], ''Geschichte der neueren Philosophie'', II, 82 sqq.)&lt;/ref&gt; God's existence, then, cannot be proven (Jacobi, like Immanuel Kant, rejected the absolute value of the principle of causality), it must be felt by the mind.
* The same theory was advocated in Germany by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], who assumed an inner religious sense by means of which people feel religious truths. According to Schleiermacher, religion consists solely in this inner perception, and dogmatic doctrines are inessential.&lt;ref&gt;(Stöckl, loc. cit., 199 sqq.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion was established in 1936, when God was said to enter the body of diamond merchant [[Lekhraj Kripalani]] (1876–1969) in Hyderabad, Sindh and started to speak through him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brahmakumaris.org/about-us/history/60.html "Based on our real life experiences we clearly know that it was God, the Supreme Soul, Shiva, Himself, had entered into his body. It was God who had revealed the truth about the coming destruction, and of the establishment of the heavenly world which would then follow. And it was God Himself who had given the sign that he, Dada, was to be His medium and the engine for creating such a divine world."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725102100/http://brahmakumaris.org/about-us/history/60.html |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babb, Lawrence A.

===Hindu arguments===
The school of Vedanta argues that one of the proofs of the existence of God is the law of [[karma]]. In a commentary to [[Brahma Sutras]] (III, 2, 38, and 41), [[Adi Sankara]] argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like [[adrsta]] by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being ([[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Reichenbach | first =Bruce R. | title =Karma, causation, and divine intervention | journal =Philosophy East and West | volume =39 | issue =2 | pages = 135–149 [145] | date = April 1989 | url =http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm | accessdate = 2009-12-29 | doi=10.2307/1399374| jstor =1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyaya]] school make similar arguments.

== Arguments against the existence of God ==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Atheism]]--&gt;
{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}{{Irreligion sidebar |atheism}}Each of the arguments below aims to show that a particular set of gods does not exist—by demonstrating them to be inherently meaningless, [[proof by contradiction|contradictory]], or at odds with known [[science|scientific]] or [[history|historical]] facts—or that there is insufficient proof to say that they do exist.

===Empirical arguments===
The following empirical arguments rely on observations or experimentation to yield their conclusions.
* The [[argument from inconsistent revelations]] contests the existence of the deity called God as described in [[scriptures]]—such as the Hindu [[Vedas]], the Jewish [[Tanakh]], the Christian [[Bible]], the Muslim [[Qur'an]], the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] or the Baha'i [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas|Aqdas]]—by identifying apparent contradictions between different scriptures, within a single scripture, or between scripture and known facts.
* The [[problem of evil]] contests the existence of a god who is both omnipotent and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] by arguing that such a god should not permit the existence of [[evil]] or [[suffering]]. The theist responses are called [[theodicy|theodicies]].
* The [[destiny of the unevangelized]], by which persons who have never even heard of a particular revelation might be harshly punished for not following its dictates.
* The [[argument from poor design]] contests the idea that God created life on the basis that lifeforms, including humans, seem to exhibit poor design.
* The [[argument from nonbelief]] contests the existence of an omnipotent God who wants humans to believe in him by arguing that such a god would do a better job of gathering believers.
* The argument from parsimony (using [[Occam's razor]]) contends that since natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the [[development of religion]] and belief in gods,&lt;ref&gt;''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', Pascal Boyer, Basic Books (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the actual existence of such supernatural agents is superfluous and may be dismissed unless otherwise proven to be required to explain the phenomenon.
* The analogy of [[Russell's teapot]] argues that the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] for the existence of God lies with the theist rather than the atheist; it can be considered an extension of Occam's Razor.

===Deductive arguments===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Atheism]] --&gt;
The following arguments deduce, mostly through self-contradiction, the existence of a God as "the Creator". 
*Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'' that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings.&lt;ref&gt;p. 172, ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'', Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow&lt;/ref&gt; Christian mathematicians and scientists, most notably [[Leonhard Euler#Commemorations|Leonhard Euler]], [[Bernard d'Espagnat]]&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;Gefter, Amanda [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16769-concept-of-hypercosmic-god-wins-templeton-prize/ "Concept of 'hypercosmic God' wins Templeton Prize,"] ''The New Scientist'', Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Lennox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Professor John Lennox |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1308599/Stephen-Hawking-wrong-You-explain-universe-God.html |title=Stephen Hawking is wrong. You can't explain the universe without God &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2013-05-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagree with that kind of skeptical argument.
* A counter-argument against God as the Creator takes the assumption of the Cosmological argument ("the chicken or the egg"), that things cannot exist without creators, and applies it to God, setting up an infinite regress.
* Dawkins' [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]] analogizes the above. Some theists argue that [[evolution]] is akin to a hurricane assembling a Boeing 747 —  that the universe (or life) is too complex ''not'' to have been designed by someone, who theists call God. Dawkin's counter-argument is that such a God would himself be complex — the "Ultimate" Boeing 747 — and therefore require a designer.
* [[Theological noncognitivism]] is the argument that religious language – specifically, words such as "God" – are not cognitively meaningful and that irreducible definitions of God are circular.
Some arguments focus on the existence of specific conceptions of God as being omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect.
* The [[omnipotence paradox]] suggests that the concept of an [[omnipotent]] entity is logically contradictory by considering questions such as "Can God create a rock so big that He cannot move it?" or "If God is all powerful, could God create a being more powerful than Himself?"
* Similarly, the omniscience paradox argues that God cannot be omniscient because he would not know how to create something unknown to himself.
* Another argument points to the contradiction of omniscience and omnipotence arguing that God is bound to follow whatever God foreknows himself doing.
* [[Argument from free will]] contends that omniscience and the free will of humanity are incompatible and that any conception of God that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently contradictory: if God is omniscient, then God already knows humanity's future, contradicting the claim of free will.
* The anthropic argument states that if God is omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect, he would have created other morally perfect beings instead of imperfect ones, such as humans.
* The [[problem of hell]] is the idea that eternal damnation contradicts God's omnibenevolence and [[omnipresence]].

===Inductive arguments===
Inductive arguments argue their conclusions through inductive reasoning.
* The [[Atheistic existentialism|atheist-existential]] argument for the [[non-existence]] of a perfect sentient being states that if [[existence precedes essence]], it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the meaning of the term ''sentient'' that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. It is touched upon by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''. Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a ''pour-soi'' [a being-for-itself; a consciousness] who is also an ''en-soi'' [a being-in-itself; a thing]: which is a contradiction in terms. The argument is echoed thus in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[Grimus]]'': "That which is complete is also dead."
* The "no reason" argument tries to show that an omnipotent and omniscient being would not have any reason to act in any way, specifically by creating the universe, because it would have no needs, wants, or desires since these very concepts are subjectively human. Since the universe exists, there is a contradiction, and therefore, an omnipotent god cannot exist. This argument is expounded upon by [[Scott Adams]] in the book ''[[God's Debris]]'', which puts forward a form of [[Pandeism]] as its fundamental theological model. A similar argument is put forward in [[Ludwig von Mises]]'s "Human Action". He referred to it as the "praxeological argument" and claimed that a perfect being would have long ago satisfied all its wants and desires and would no longer be able to take action in the present without proving that it had been unable to achieve its wants faster—showing it imperfect.
* The "historical induction" argument concludes that since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. [[ancient Egyptian religion]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religion]]) and their gods ultimately come to be regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote a short piece about the topic entitled "Memorial Service" in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[["H.L. Mencken: Where is the Graveyard of Dead Gods?" http://jonathongreen.co.uk/h-l-mencken-where-is-the-graveyard-of-dead-gods/]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Subjective arguments===
{{see also|Anecdotal evidence}}
Similar to the [[Wiktionary:subjective#Pronunciation|subjective]] arguments for the existence of God, subjective arguments against the supernatural mainly rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, or the propositions of a revealed religion in general.

* The witness argument gives credibility to personal witnesses, contemporary and from the past, who disbelieve or strongly doubt the existence of God.
* The conflicted religions argument notes that many religions give differing accounts as to what God is and what God wants; since all the contradictory accounts cannot be correct, many if not all religions must be incorrect.
* The disappointment argument claims that if, when asked for, there is no visible help from God, there is no reason to believe that there is a God.

===Hindu arguments===
[[Atheism in Hinduism|Atheistic Hindu doctrines]] cite various arguments for rejecting a creator God or ''Ishvara''. The ''[[Samkhyapravachana Sutra|{{IAST |Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra}}]]'' of the [[Samkhya]] school states that there is no philosophical place for a creator God in this system. It is also argued in this text that the existence of Ishvara (God) cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thesamkhyaphilos00sinhuoft/thesamkhyaphilos00sinhuoft_djvu.txt Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra] I.92.&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Samkhya argues against the existence of God on metaphysical grounds. For instance, it argues that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever-changing world. It says God is a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rajadhyaksha|title=The six systems of Indian philosophy|year=1959|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihkRAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sutras of Samkhya endeavor to prove that the idea of God is inconceivable and self-contradictory, and some{{Which|date=June 2012}} commentaries speak plainly on this subject. The ''Sankhya- tattva-kaumudi'', commenting on Karika 57, argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world, and if God's motive is kindness, Samkhya questions whether it is reasonable to call into existence beings who while non-existent had no suffering. Samkhya postulates that a benevolent deity ought to create only happy creatures, not an imperfect world like the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and Buddhism, Vol II. (of 3)|first=Charles|last=Eliot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4ZpPleiyokC|page=243|isbn=9781406862966|date=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charvaka]], originally known as Lokāyata, a heterodox Hindu philosophy states that there is "no God, no [[samsara]] (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin."&lt;ref&gt;Haribhadrasūri (Translator: M Jain, 1989), Saddarsanasamuccaya, Asiatic Society, {{oclc|255495691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the school of [[Mimamsa]], which is based on [[ritual]]s and [[orthopraxy]], decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God is insufficient. They argue that there is no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there is no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a god to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51|isbn=9780791447789|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mimamsa argues that the gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. In that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114|isbn=9780791473368 |date=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Several authors have offered psychological or sociological explanations for belief in the existence of God.

Psychologists observe that the majority of humans often ask existential questions such as "why we are here" and whether life has purpose. Some psychologists{{Weasel inline|date=June 2012}} have posited that religious beliefs may recruit cognitive mechanisms in order to satisfy these questions. [[William James]] emphasized the inner religious struggle between [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] and happiness, and pointed to [[trance]] as a cognitive mechanism. [[Sigmund Freud]] stressed fear and pain, the need for a powerful parental figure, the obsessional nature of ritual, and the hypnotic state a community can induce as contributing factors to the psychology of religion.

[[Pascal Boyer]]'s ''Religion Explained'' (2002), based in part on his anthropological field work, treats belief in God as the result of the brain's tendency towards [[agency detection]]. Boyer suggests that, because of evolutionary pressures, humans err on the side of attributing agency where there isn't any. In Boyer's view, belief in supernatural entities spreads and becomes culturally fixed because of their memorability. The concept of "minimally counterintuitive" beings that differ from the ordinary in a small number of ways (such as being invisible, able to fly, or having access to strategic and otherwise secret information) leave a lasting impression that spreads through word-of-mouth.

[[Scott Atran]]'s ''In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion'' (2002) makes a similar argument and adds examination of the socially coordinating aspects of shared belief. In ''Minds and Gods: The Cognitive Foundations of Religion'', [[Todd Tremlin]] follows Boyer in arguing that universal human cognitive process naturally produces the concept of the supernatural. Tremlin contends that an agency detection device (ADD) and a [[theory of mind]] module (ToMM) lead humans to suspect an agent behind every event. Natural events for which there is no obvious agent may be attributed to God (c.f. [[Act of God]]).

'''''Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat''''' is a 2014 non-fiction book by [[Philip Lymbery]] and [[Isabel Oakeshott]]. It surveys the effects of [[industrial livestock production]] and industrial [[fish farming]] around the world. The book is the result of Lymbery's investigations for which he travelled the world over three years. Isabel Oakeshott is the political editor of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', Philip Lymbery is CEO of [[Compassion in World Farming]]. The book was published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].

==Synopsis==
The thesis examined in the book is that globalised production chains of industrialised agricultural systems negatively affect farmed animals, human health, the countryside, rivers and oceans, biodiversity in rainforests and many of the world's poorest people. The authors seek to shed light on the conditions in intensive agriculture which, according to them, often differ from the image that the industry wants to sell to the public. Intensification in animal farming goes along with a growing demand of cropland to grow animal feed – factory farming is thus not a means to save space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/02/farmageddon-philip-lymber-review-farming Farmageddon by Philip Lymbery with Isabel Oakeshott – review], Lucy Siegle, ''The Observer'', 2 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph10620308&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/10620308/Farmageddon-by-Philip-Lymbery-with-Isabel-Oakeshott-review.html Farmageddon by Philip Lymbery with Isabel Oakeshott, review], Tom Fort, ''The Daily Telegraph'', 10 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They argue consequently that to feed the world population factory farming is not the solution but a threat, not least since more than a third of the world's arable harvests are being used to supply farmed animals.&lt;ref name=guardian20140129&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/farmageddon-cost-cheap-meat-lymbery-review Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat by Philip Lymbery – review], Tristram Stuart, ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book the consumer price of [[cheap meat]] does not include the overall costs of industrial meat production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philiplymbery.com/farmageddon-book/ Farmageddon], website of Philip Lymbery&lt;/ref&gt;

The reader follows Lymbery's journey from his start in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. There he finds dairies where 10,000 cows can be milked at once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philiplymbery.com/farmageddon-book/ Farmageddon, first chapter (online), p.19]&lt;/ref&gt; He travels to enormous piggeries in China and visits the [[fish meal|fishmeal industry]] of Peru, which converts millions of tonnes of anchovies to fishmeal for supplying the livestock industry with feed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/farmageddon-by-philip-lymbery-with-isabel-oakeshott-book-review-9112828.html Farmageddon by Philip Lymbery (with Isabel Oakeshott): Book review], Mike McCarthy, ''The Independent'', 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Taiwan he visits a farm (labelled "organic") where 300,000 laying hens are being starved and held in batteries. A visit is paid to the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, US where he finds the marine ecosystem impacted by waste from the poultry industry. The author talks to a community in Mexico in an area dominated by pig sheds.  There he documents a lake of effluent and air and water pollution, and discusses the outbreak of swine flu.&lt;ref name=telegraph10620308/&gt;  

One chapter of ''Farmageddon'' is dedicated to the question "What happened to the vet?" Lymbery says that veterinarians work in an industry with an "inbuild flaw". He states that veterinarians often comply with the industrialization of animals, for example in the prophylactic use of antibiotics which are applied in the [[mass production]] [[meat industry|of animals]], eggs and milk instead of demanding a different (pasture-based) agricultural system. According to Lymbery veterinarians should not support systems that are "inherently bad for animal welfare", which allegedly is the case in "mass production of broiler chickens, caged production of eggs, the large-scale permanent housing of dairy cows (so-called mega dairies) and highly intensive pig production where mothering pigs are kept in confinement where they can't turn around for weeks at a time".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/20/vets-industrial-agri-business "Have vets really sold out to industrial agri-business?"], Lucy Siegle, ''The Guardian'', 19 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent ''Farmageddon'' the authors come up with suggestions for consumers, policy makers and farmers: Consumers should eat less meat. Fish should be fed to people rather than converted into fishmeal. Animals should be fed with grass and animal farming should be a pasture-based system. These changes would save resources by reducing the competition of humans and animals for food and land.&lt;ref name=telegraph10620308/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Tristram Stuart]] wrote in a review for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that although he is critical towards the "orthodoxy that large-scale farms and industrial agricultural technology are inherently wrong", "this catalogue of devastation will convince anyone who doubts that industrial farming is causing ecological meltdown".&lt;ref name=guardian20140129/&gt;

The '''''Fayan''''',&lt;!--Chinese in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; also known in [[English language|English]] as the '''''Model Sayings''''' or '''''Exemplary Figures''''', is an [[Classical Chinese|ancient Chinese]] text by the [[Han dynasty]] writer and poet [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] that was completed around {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}9. It comprises a collection of dialogues and aphorisms in which Yang gives responses to a wide variety of questions relating to philosophy, politics, literature, ethics, and scholarship.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=213}}  

==Contents==
The text of the ''Fayan'' is divided into 13 chapters. It is presented in the form of dialogues between Yang and an anonymous interlocutor who asks him questions, to which Yang responds with terse, authoritative pronouncements that rely more on wit and puns than on logical exposition.{{sfnp|Knechtges|1993|p=100}} The style is deliberately{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=213}} modeled on the ''[[Analects]]'' of [[Confucius]]{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=100}} and was intended to counter the ideas of the "syncretic" philosophical school, which Yang believed was contrary to the orthodox teachings of [[Confucianism]] and the ancient Chinese sages.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=213}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5879">'''Fonds Coislin''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le fonds Coislin'''}}) is a collection (or [[fonds]]) of Greek manuscripts acquired by [[Pierre Séguier]], but named after [[Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin|Henri-Charles de Coislin]], its second owner. It is now held in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]], as one of three fonds of Greek manuscripts: ''fonds grec'', ''fonds Coislin'', and ''supplément grec''.

[[File:Seguier.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Pierre Seguier painted by [[Henri Testelin]] (ca. 1668)]]

== History of collection ==

The majority of these manuscripts were collected between 1643 and 1653, by Père Athanase the Rhetor, who bought them for [[Pierre Séguier]] (1588–1672), chancellor of France from 1635. Athanase bought the manuscripts in [[Cyprus]], [[Constantinople]], [[Mount Athos]], and in other territories bordering the northern and western [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref&gt;
Henri Omont, {{fr icon}} ''Missions archéologiques françaises en Orient au XVII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; et XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècles'', (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1902), pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection contains almost 400 manuscripts. Athanase collected more than 300 manuscripts (probably 358) personally. After Séguier's death, all this collection was inherited by his grandson, Henri-Charles de Coislin (1664–1732), [[bishop of Metz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Omont]], [https://archive.org/stream/inventairesomma00manugoog#page/n25/mode/2up ''Inventaire sommaire des manuscrits grecs de la Bibliothèque nationale''], p. XIII&lt;/ref&gt; He gave it to the Benedictine monks of [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in [[Paris]].

[[File:Bernard de Montfaucon - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|Bernard de Montfaucon]]
The first catalogue of this collection, the Coislin catalogue, was made in 1715, in which 42 manuscripts were described ([[Bernard de Montfaucon]], ''Bibliotheca Coisliniana olim Segueriana'', Paris: Ludovicus Guerin &amp; Carolus Robustel, 1715). A large part of the collection was burned in 1793, and in 1795 ''Fonds Coislin'' was deposited in the [[National Library of France]], where it has been held until the present day. A few manuscripts, bought by Russians in time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], now are held at [[Saint Petersburg]], (s.v. Dubrowski).&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick William Hall]], ''A Companion to Classical Texts'', Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]], 1968, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known manuscripts of the collection is the fragmentary uncial [[Codex Coislinianus]]. The collection also includes [[Minuscule 35]] (Coislin 199), now considered to be one of the best witness of the [[Byzantine text-type]], and the basis for ''The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition'' (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart 2007). The collection also includes further witnesses to the text of the New Testament, as well as to the [[Septuagint]], [[Josephus]], and other ancient, and medieval authors.

'''FreeOTFE''' is a discontinued [[open-source software|open source]] computer program for [[on-the-fly encryption|on-the-fly]] [[disk encryption]] (OTFE). On [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Windows Mobile]] (using FreeOTFE4PDA), it can create a [[RAM drive|virtual drive]] within a file or [[Disk partitioning|partition]], to which anything written is automatically encrypted before being stored on a computer's [[hard disk drive|hard]] or [[USB flash drive|USB]] drive. It is similar in function to other disk encryption programs including [[TrueCrypt]] and Microsoft's [[BitLocker]].&lt;ref&gt;David A. Karp, Windows Vista annoyances, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-52762-4}}, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author, Sarah Dean, went absent as of 2011. The FreeOTFE website is unreachable as of June 2013 and the domain name is now registered by a [[domain squatter]]. The original program can be downloaded from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeotfe.mirror/ a mirror at Sourceforge]. In June 2014, a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the project now named LibreCrypt appeared on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/t-d-k/librecrypt LibreCrypt on GitHub]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

''FreeOTFE'' was initially released by Sarah Dean in 2004, and was the first open source code disk encryption system that provided a modular architecture allowing 3rd parties to implement additional algorithms if needed. Older FreeOTFE licensing required that any modification to the program be placed in the [[public domain]]. This does not conform technically to section 3 of the [[Open Source definition]]. Newer program licensing omits this condition. The FreeOTFE license has not been approved by the [http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical Open Source Initiative] and is not certified to be labeled with the open-source certification mark.

This software is compatible with Linux encrypted volumes (e.g. [[LUKS]], [[cryptoloop]], [[dm-crypt]]), allowing data encrypted under Linux to be read (and written) freely. It was the first open source transparent disk encryption system to support [[Windows Vista]] and PDAs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130305192701/http://freeotfe.org/docs/Main/version_history.htm FreeOTFE version history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mandaville, Citizen-Soldier Handbook: 101 Ways Every American Can Fight Terrorism, Dog Ear Publishing, 2009 {{ISBN|1-59858-671-8}}, page 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory B. White, Wm. Arthur Conklin, Dwayne Williams, Roger L. Davis, Chuck Cothren, ''CompTIA Security+ All-in-One Exam Guide'', Second Edition, McGraw Hill Professional, 2008, {{ISBN|0-07-160127-9}}, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Burns, Jennifer Stisa Granick, Steve Manzuik, Paul Guersch, Dave Killion, Nicolas Beauchesne, ''Security power tools'', O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, {{ISBN|0-596-00963-1}}, page 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Optional [[two-factor authentication]] using [[smart card]]s and/or [[hardware security module]]s (HSMs, also termed [[security tokens]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090401045551/http://www.freeotfe.org/docs/pkcs11_support.htm Security Token/Smartcard Support]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in v4.0, using the [[PKCS11|PKCS#11]] (Cryptoki) standard developed by [[RSA Laboratories]].

''FreeOTFE'' also allows any number of "hidden volumes" to be created, giving [[plausible deniability]] and [[deniable encryption]], and also has the option of encrypting full partitions or disks (but not the system partition).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130124091508/http://freeotfe.org/docs/Main/advanced_topics.htm#level_3_heading_2 Partition/Entire Disk Based Volumes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portable use==

[[File:FreeOTFEExplorer.png|thumb|left|FreeOTFE Explorer allows access to encrypted disks, without installing any drivers.]]

FreeOTFE can be used in "portable" (or "traveller") mode, which allows it to be kept on a USB drive or other portable media, together with its encrypted data, and carried around. This allows it to be used under [[Microsoft Windows]] without installation of the complete program to "mount" and access the encrypted data through a virtual disk.

The use of this mode requires installing [[device drivers]] (at least temporarily) to create virtual disks, and as a consequence administrator rights are needed to start this traveller mode. As with most open source software that uses device drivers, the user must enable test signing&lt;ref&gt;[https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/4c0e8b2a-a543-4c49-9629-8c4538acd0b5/what-is-windows-7-test-mode?forum=w7itproinstall What is Windows 7 Test Mode]&lt;/ref&gt; when running Windows Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64 systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130124091539/http://freeotfe.org/docs/Main/impact_of_kernel_driver_signing.htm Additional Information for Windows Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64 Users]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driverless operation===

Packaged with FreeOTFE is another program called "FreeOTFE Explorer",&lt;ref name="explorer"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130305192649/http://freeotfe.org/main_explorer_differences.html FreeOTFE v. FreeOTFE Explorer Comparison]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a ''driverless system'' that allows encrypted disks to be used without administrator rights.

This allows FreeOTFE encrypted data to be used on (for example) public computers found in libraries or computer kiosks ([[interactive kiosk]]s), where administrator rights are unavailable.

Unlike FreeOTFE, FreeOTFE Explorer does not provide on-the-fly encryption through a virtual drive.&lt;ref name="explorer"/&gt; Instead it lets files be stored and extracted from encrypted disk images, in a similar manner as [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] and [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] archives, by using a [[Windows Explorer]] like interface.

== Algorithms implemented ==
Due to its architecture, FreeOTFE provides great flexibility to the user with its encryption options.

=== Ciphers ===
FreeOTFE implements several ciphers, including:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-2}}
* [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]
* [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]]
* [[CAST5]] / [[CAST6]]
* [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] / [[Triple DES]]
{{col-2}}
* [[MARS (cryptography)|MARS]]
* [[RC6]]
* [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]]
* [[Twofish]]
{{col-end}}

It includes all [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) finalists, and all ciphers can be used with multiple different keylengths.

==== Cipher modes ====
FreeOTFE originally offered encryption using [[cipher-block chaining]] (CBC) with encrypted salt-sector initialization vector ([[ESSIV]]), though from v3.00 introduced [[LRW#LRW|LRW]] and also the more secure [[disk encryption theory#XTS|XTS]] mode, which supersedes LRW in the [[IEEE P1619]] standard for disk encryption.

=== Hashes ===
As with its cipher options, FreeOTFE offers many different hash algorithms:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-4}}
* [[MD2 (cryptography)|MD2]]
* [[MD4]]
* [[MD5]]
* [[RIPEMD-160|RIPEMD-128]]
{{col-4}}
* [[RIPEMD-160]]
* [[RIPEMD|RIPEMD-224]]
* [[RIPEMD|RIPEMD-320]]
* [[SHA-1]]
{{col-4}}
* [[SHA-224]]
* [[SHA-256]]
* [[SHA-384]]
* [[SHA-512]]
{{col-4}}
* [[Tiger (hash)|Tiger]]
* [[WHIRLPOOL|Whirlpool]]
{{col-end}}

There are lots of [[free software]] and many of them need [[donation]] and support to continue their works. There are some [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundations]] to support these free software, and many organizations support these foundations. Knowing about these foundations and organizations might help in spending money in the right way and advancement of [[free software movement]].

'''George Elder Davie''' (1912–2007) was a prominent Scottish philosopher whose well-received book, ''[[The Democratic Intellect]]'' (1961), concerns the treatment of philosophy in 19th century Scottish universities.

== Life ==
He was born at no. 4 Baxter Park Terrace, [[Dundee]] on 18 March 1912. His father, George Myles Davie was a [[pharmacist]] and chemistry teacher, and his mother was Isabella Calder Elder. He married Elspeth Mary Dryer, an art teacher, on 5 October 1944 at [[Bonnyrigg]] Church in [[Midlothian]]. [[Elspeth Davie]] later became a respected writer and was awarded the [[Katherine Mansfield]] Prize in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] Obituary, 23 March 2007, but this does not appear to be the New Zealand Katherine Mansfield Prize.&lt;/ref&gt; They had one daughter with whom he resided at [[Sutton Veny]], Wiltshire at the time of his death on 20 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Births, marriages and deaths information available at the General Register Office for Scotland, Scotlands People Centre in Edinburgh, and also at http://scotlandspeople.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
* George Davie was educated at the [[High School of Dundee]] after which he was offered a place at [[Oxford University]] but turned it down in favour of [[Edinburgh University]] where graduated MA in 1935 with a [[first class honours degree]] in [[Classics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Obituary]] in [[The Independent]], Thursday, 29 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1939 he was appointed assistant lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at Edinburgh University. He was assistant to [[Norman Kemp Smith]] and he later co-edited the latter's collected papers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Credibility of Divine Existence: The collected papers of Norman Kemp Smith'', edited by A. J. D. Porteus, R. D. Maclennan and G.E. Davie. London: Macmillan, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;
* His war service between 1941 and 1945 was in the [[Royal Corps of Signals]].
* After the war, he was appointed lecturer in philosophy at [[Queens University, Belfast]] where he remained till 1959 when he returned to [[Edinburgh University]] as Lecturer. He retired in 1982 and was appointed Reader Emeritus at Edinburgh in 1987.
* In 1953 he was awarded the degree of DLitt by [[Edinburgh University]] for his thesis, "A Scotch Metaphysics – the Theory of Knowledge in the Scottish Universities 1730–1860". This thesis was published in 2000 under the title, ''The Scotch Metaphysics : a Century of Enlightenment in Scotland.''
* A Conference was held in his honour at [[Edinburgh University]] on 13 to 15 September 1996. It was entitled: 'The Legacy of Empiricism, A Conference in Honour of George Davie', and held in the David Hume Tower. On Sunday 15 September 1996, he delivered a conference paper entitled “Five Philosophical Theses from [[James Frederick Ferrier|Ferrier]]". In spite of suffering blindness by that time he held the rapt attention of his audience for an hour and a half.

== Honours ==
* Honorary Doctorate at [[Dundee University]]
* Honorary Doctorate at [[Edinburgh University]], awarded 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12097075.EDINBURGH/ |title=Doctor Honoris Causa |work=The Herald |date=13 July 1995 |accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fellow of [[the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]
* Fellow of the [[Educational Institute of Scotland]]
* [http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/view_item.aspx?item_id=3700&amp;open2=false Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun Award] of [[the Saltire Society]]
* [[Festschrift]] published in his honour by Dr. Vincent Hope in 1984&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment''. Edited by Vincent Hope. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Democratic Intellect'' ==
In this book, Davie deals with the struggle during the 19th century in Scotland to maintain a generalist form of education which is not only philosophical but also scientific, humanistic and democratic. The book has been described as  "a thesis about liberal education – pursued by a micro-historical investigation of the culture and academic politics of Scotland's universities in the 19th century. More than 40 years on, the book's discussions of the restriction of academic independence by centralisation, inter-university competition for prestige, research versus teaching and even versus scholarship, notions of abandoning moral discourse for ill-examined claims regarding scientific advance, are still relevant."&lt;ref&gt;[[Obituary]] in [[The Independent]], Thursday, 29 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Davie's somewhat prolix style of writing is exemplified here:&lt;br /&gt;
“It is possible to confirm still further the importance which this ideal of a philosophical education had for the Scots if we turn from the achieved pattern of national pedagogy to the plans which were being mooted for its development. What these plans reveal – until well on in the nineteenth century – is the remarkable hold on the country of the belief in the possibility of general education through philosophy. Not that the Scots had any dislike of professional accomplishment; on the contrary, they admired it even to excess, and were eager for the introduction into their educational system of training centres for higher education and specialisation in the new subjects. But the distinctive mark of their thinking about these matters and of the organised projects it inspired was that they wanted to retain philosophy as a compulsory part of what we would now call secondary education (fifteen to nineteen), and that admission to the specialist schools – though it was to be granted early – nevertheless would require, as a preliminary, philosophical education in the old style.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Democratic Intellect'', second edition, 1964, paperback edition, 1981, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6938">'''Henning Arnisaeus''' (Arniseus) (1570–1636) was a German physician and moral philosopher.&lt;ref name = Scholasticon&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.scholasticon.fr/Database/Scholastiques_fr.php?ID=172&lt;/ref&gt; He is now known for his writings on political theory.

==Life==

He was born in [[Schlanstedt]], a village in the present-day [[Harz (district)|Harz district]] of Germany, near [[Huy, Germany|Huy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} http://www.schlanstedt.de/chronik.php?start=1&amp;ppp=300&lt;/ref&gt; He studied philosophy and medicine at the Protestant [[University of Helmstedt]] from 1589.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PCNN_blc77kC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=Arnisaeus+Helmstedt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mg9e8Uqc1X&amp;sig=bTp2RXqwBmBw1gdN6PYe-lJRZTY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=euN8TJ_pM8bd4Abtz9neBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arnisaeus%20Helmstedt&amp;f=false Herbert Jaumann, ''Handbuch Gelehrtenkultur der Frühen Neuzeit'' (2004), p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt; After travels in England and France, he became court physician to [[Christian IV of Denmark]].&lt;ref name = Scholasticon/&gt;

==Views==
At Helmstedt, Arnisaeus became a pupil of [[Cornelius Martini]], a [[Lutheran]] metaphysician who also influenced [[Hermann Conring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} http://www.kirchenlexikon.de/m/martini_c.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ferratermora.org/essa_suarez-modern.html&lt;/ref&gt; He used an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] analysis to distinguish in political thought between the ''[[civitas]]'' and the ''[[res publica]]'', in a critique of [[Jean Bodin]], [[Johannes Althusius]], Busius (Paulus Buis or Buys, died 1617), and [[Bartholomäus Keckermann]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yBY8M6xCvysC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=arnisaeus+Aristotelian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zzqwMlc8Oe&amp;sig=4-iIlwFhXo25aWT4Jx6hcnGol5E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=u-58TJDXLsiN4gajzIyRBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arnisaeus%20Aristotelian&amp;f=false Martin van Gelderen, ''Aristotelians, Monarchomachs and Republicans: Sovereignty and respublica mixta in Dutch and German Political Thought, 1580-1650'', p. 209, in Martin van Gelderen, Quentin Skinner (editors), ''Republicanism and Constitutionalism in Early Modern Europe'' (2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; He particularly criticized Bodin's strictures on [[mixed government]] in his 1606 ''Doctrina politica''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.potowmack.org/mcilwain.html&lt;/ref&gt; That work also incorporated [[Tacitean]] ideas, under the influence of [[Arnold Clapmar]], within the Aristotelian and humanist framework he proposed, attacking the [[Ramist]] critics of Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tuck, ''Philosophy and Government 1572-1651'' (1993), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Arnisaeus saw a role for [[civil society]], he did not admit any qualification of the power of the 'magistrate'. In 1610 in ''De jure majestatis'' he took Bodin's part against the mixed state; even so, in relation to [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its institutions he admitted that sovereignty could in practical terms be distributed among several authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/theory-of-sovereignty&lt;/ref&gt; He is therefore classed as an 'absolutist', a supporter of [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WxvOUQbwLQC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=Althusius+Arnisaeus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d7hYAStUy3&amp;sig=KymDq9eBCTaXnmRCjem2GQIfy_g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0vp8TJm6JcqL4gbz-p24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Althusius%20Arnisaeus&amp;f=false Conal Condren, Stephen Gaukroger, Ian Hunter, ''The Philosopher in Early Modern Europe: the nature of a contested identity'' (2006), p. 167.]&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, in the case of the Empire, he argued that sovereignty lay with the [[Prince-elector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tuck, ''Philosophy and Government 1572-1651'' (1993), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; This was very much a minority view among Germans, opposed by Althusius and Keckermann, as well as Hermann Kirchner, Daniel Otto, and Tobias Paurmeister, all of whom took the view that the Emperor was a true monarch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2004/9.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Against Althusius, he argued that (true) monarchy could be compromised by concessions of power that distorted the 'form' of the state, and that this was a more accurate description of the actual French state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TiVKeH-cMPUC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=Althusius+Arnisaeus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w80ai5k3an&amp;sig=HEIj_L-_pCRJEF2ady68lWOBdcQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nfx8TJ6FDZC74Aa7p6G_Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Althusius%20Arnisaeus&amp;f=false James Henderson Burns, J. H. Burns, Mark Goldie. ''The Cambridge History of Political Thought, 1450-1700'' (1995), p. 314.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnisaeus died in Copenhagen.

His ideas were influential in the setting up of [[Danish absolutism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cliothemis.com/Elegant-Jurisprudence-in&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hovnan Mayravanetsi''' ({{lang-hy|Հովհան Մայրավանեցի}}, c. 572-650) was an Armenian theologian and philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Heritage of Armenian Literature volume II: From the sixth to the eighteenth century|url= |year=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=9780814330234|volume=|pages=48–49|editor1=A. J. Hacikyan |editor2=Gabriel Basmajian |editor3=Edward S. Franchuk |editor4=Nourhan Ouzounian }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ardent defender of [[Miaphysite]] position of the [[Armenian Church]]. He was one of the first theologians to address issues of social justice in the light of the Christian teaching, which set him on a collision course with his contemporary feudal socioeconomic structures. In his later years he had become an [[ascetic]].

'''Imperativus Pro Infinitivo''' (IPI) is a [[Syntax|syntactical feature]] in which a verbal form superficially resembling the [[imperative mood|imperative]] is realized, instead of the expected [[infinitive]].

The Imperativus Pro Infinitivo is a remarkable feature of, for example the [[Frisian languages]].

* North Frisian (Mooring): Ik häi änjörsne niinj lust än mååg seelew wat tu ääsen klåår.
* Sater Frisian: Ik hiede jêrsene neen lûst on moakje selwen wet to iten kloar.
* West(erlauwer) Frisian: Ik hie juster gjin nocht en meitsje sels wat te iten klear.

The sentences reads in English "Yesterday I did not feel like making dinner myself".

Born into an [[Dhaka Nawab Family|aristocrat ''Nawab'']] family in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] in 1894, he was educated at the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] before pursuing his education at the [[Cambridge University]] to secure his graduation. Upon returning, he started his political career on a [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] platform where he primary focused on education causes in Bengal before leading the [[Independence of Pakistan|cause]] for separate Muslim homeland, Pakistan, under the leadership of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. From 1943–45, he served as the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] and later becoming the [[List of current Pakistani chief ministers|Chief Minister]] in 1947 until 1948 when he ascended as Governor-General after Jinnah's passing.

In 1951, he took over the control of the [[Government of Pakistan|government]] as Prime Minister of Pakistan upon the [[Assassination of liaqat ali khan|assassination]] of Liaquat Ali Khan, and relinquished the post of Governor-General to [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Sir Malik Ghulam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pakistanherald.com/Profile/Khawaja-Nazimuddin-1176 |title= PakistanHerald.com : Khwaja Nazimuddin |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Prime Minister, he struggled to run the [[Pakistani government|government]] effectively on the internal and foreign fronts, and thus he tenured for only two years. On the home front, he struggled to maintain [[Law and order in Pakistan|law and order]] in the country and instructed the [[Pakistani military|military]] to impose [[Martial law in Pakistan|martial law]] in [[Lahore]] due to [[1953 Lahore riots|religious riots]] and [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. He also faced a populist [[Bengali Language Movement|language movement]] in his native Bengal that eventually led to the shutdown of [[Government of East Pakistan]]. [[Foreign relations of Pakistan|Foreign relations]] with the [[Pakistan–United States relations|United States]], [[Pakistan–Soviet Union relations|Soviet Union]], [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|Afghanistan]], and [[India–Pakistan relations|India]] soured as [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|republicanism]] and [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialism]] gained popularity at home.

Eventually, he was forced to step down in favor of diplomat [[Mohammad Ali Bogra]] by his own appointed Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam and conceded defeat in [[East Pakistani legislative election, 1954|elections held in 1954]]. Upon retiring from [[Politics of Pakistan|national politics]], he suffered a brief illness and died in 1964. He was buried at a [[Mausoleum of three leaders|Mausoleum in Dhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/heritage/memory-the-three-leaders-1268149&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazimuddin returned to India to join his brother [[Khwaja Shahabuddin|Khwaja Shahbuddin]] from England, taking interest in civil and public affairs that led him to join the [[Politics of Bangladesh|Bengali politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ikram |first=S.M. |year=1995 |orig-year=First published 1992 |title=Indian Muslims and Partition of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7q9EubOYZmwC&amp;pg=PA311 |edition=2nd |location=Delhi |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |pages=310–311 |isbn=978-81-7156-374-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both brother joined the [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]], and Nazimuddin successfully ran for the municipality election and elected as [[Mayor|Chairman]] of Dhaka Municipality from 1922 until 1929.&lt;ref name=pakstory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P011|title=Khwaja Nazimuddin|publisher=Story of Pakistan |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he was appointed as [[Ministry of Education (Bangladesh)|Education minister]] and later secured a political appointment in [[Viceroy's Executive Council]] in 1934 which he served until 1937.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press, Chatterji"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chatterji |first=Joya |year=2002 |orig-year=First Published 1994 |title=Bengal Divided: Hindu Communalism and Partition, 1932-1947 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDNAQcoVqoMC&amp;pg=PA80 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=80 |isbn=978-0-521-52328-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He participated in regional elections held on 1937 on a Muslim League's platform but conceded his defeat in favor of [[A. K.

In the India Office Records, Political and Secret Department Records (1756–1950), Category L/P&amp;S, Record 5/250, 3/79, one comes across the Fortnightly Report (February 1947) to the Viceroy by the then Governor of Punjab Sir Evan Jenkins. According to this report when inquired about the Pakistan project, Khawaja Nazimuddin candidly told him that ″he did not know what Pakistan means and that nobody in the Muslim League knew.″ This remark clearly shows that so few as six months before the creation of Pakistan, even senior Muslim League leaders had no clarity as to the basic features of the State they were asking for.{{efn|Further on this: Husain Haqqani, ″Magnificent Delusions,″ New York: Public Affairs, 2013, p. 17}}

===Home and Prime Minister of Bengal and Chief Minister of East Bengal (1940–47)===
Upon the formation of the [[coalition government]] in an agreement facilitated between [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]]  and the [[Praja Party|Krishak Praja Party]], Nazimuddin was appointed as the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Bangladesh)|home minister]] under Haq's premiership., which he continued until 1943.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow Press, Kunal and Shubhra Chakrabarti"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chakrabarti|first1=Kunal|last2=Chakrabarti|first2=Shubhra|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|date=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=UK|isbn=9780810880245|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=khawaja+nazimuddin+politics+1934#v=onepage&amp;q=khawaja%20nazimuddin%20politics%201934&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}}

Due to his conservative elite position, he became close associate of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], then-[[President of Pakistan Muslim League (N)|President]] of [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]], who appointed him as a member of the executive committee to successfully promote Muslim League' party agenda and program that gained popularity in East Bengal.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow Press, Kunal and Shubhra Chakrabarti"/&gt;{{rp|332}}&lt;ref name="Random House India, Jaffrelot"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaffrelot|first1=Christophe|title=The Pakistan Paradox: Instability And Resilience|publisher=Random House India|isbn=9788184007077|edition=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gQDzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;dq=khawaja+nazimuddin+chief+minister#v=onepage&amp;q=khawaja%20nazimuddin%20chief%20minister&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940–41, Nazimuddin broke away from the coalition led by Premier [[A.

==Governor-General of Pakistan (1948–51)==

On [[Fourteenth of August|14 August]] of 1947, [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] relinquished the party presidency of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) to Khawaja Nazimuddin who took over the party of [[President of Pakistan Muslim League|President]] of Pakistan Muslim League (PML), due to his party electoral performance.&lt;ref name="Northern Book Centre, Nair" /&gt;{{rp|50–51}} On 1 November 1947, he was appointed as [[Acting President of Pakistan|acting]] Governor-General in the absence of Governor-General Jinnah due to worsening health, and eventually appointed as Governor-General after passing of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], in a crucial support provided by [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] on 14 September 1948 to the President Nazimuddin.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Affairs, 1948"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pakistan Affairs|date=1948|publisher=Information Division, Embassy of Pakistan.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HE8dAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Nazimuddin+acting+Governor&amp;dq=Nazimuddin+acting+Governor|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[oath of office]] was supervised by [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] Sir [[Abdul Rashid (judge)|Abdul Rashid]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]], in attendance with Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]].&lt;ref name="pakstory" /&gt;

As Governor-General, Nazimuddin set a precedent of neutrality and non-interference in the government, and provided his political support to [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]'s government, which was seen as essential to the working of the [[Good governance|responsible government]] at that time.&lt;ref name="Mittal Publications, Akbar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akbar|first1=M.

Nazimuddin's administration took place during a poor economy and the rise of [[Nationalism in Pakistan|provincial nationalism]] in [[Four Provinces (Pakistan)|four provinces]] and [[East Bengal]] which made him unable to run the country's affairs effectively.&lt;ref name="Sterling Publishers, Kulkarni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulkarni|first1=V.

In 1951, Prime Minister Nazimuddin's government conducted the country's first nationwide [[Census in Pakistan|census]] where it was noted that 57% population of the country was [[Indians in Pakistan|Indian immigrants]], mostly residing in [[Karachi]] that further complicated the situation in the country.&lt;ref name="I.B.Tauris, Pike"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pike|first1=Francis|title=Empires at War: A Short History of Modern Asia Since World War II|date=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris, Pike|location=New Yorks|isbn=9780857730299|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EKD3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT512&amp;dq=nazimuddin+prime+Muslim+League+split#v=onepage&amp;q=nazimuddin%20prime%20Muslim%20League%20split&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 March 2017|language=en|format=google books|chapter=The Night of Intellectuals}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxx}}

In 1953, a violent religious movement led by far-right [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] began to agitate for the removal of the [[Ahmadi]] religious minority from power positions, and demanded a declaration of this minority as non-[[Muslims]].&lt;ref name="Oneworld, Ziring"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ziring|first1=Lawrence|title=Pakistan: At the Crosscurrent of History|date=2003|publisher=Oneworld|isbn=9781851683277|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cehtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=nazimuddin+punjab+riots&amp;dq=nazimuddin+punjab+riots|accessdate=21 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}}

The agitations and violence spread through the successful [[Bengali language movement]] and the [[1953 Lahore riots|riots]] in [[Lahore]] proved the inability of Prime Minister Nazimuddin's government as he was widely seen as weak in running the government administration.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press, Jennings"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jennings|first1=Sir Ivor|title=Constitution-Maker|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107091115|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A853CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=nazimuddin+weak#v=onepage&amp;q=nazimuddin%20weak&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 March 2017|language=en|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|288}}

Nazimuddin then requested the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]'s intervention against this action but the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]], [[Muhammad Munir|Moh'd Munir]] did not rule on the legality of the dismissal, but instead forced [[East Pakistani legislative election, 1954|new elections]] to be held in 1954.&lt;ref name="Routledge, Chak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chak|first1=Farhan Mujahid|title=Islam and Pakistan's Political Culture|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, U.S.|isbn=9781317657941|pages=180|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xndsBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=moulvi+tamizuddin+khan|accessdate=6 March 2017|language=en|format=googlebooks|chapter=The Constitutional cases}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Malik Ghulam]] appointed another Bengali politician, [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]] who was then tenuring as the [[Pakistan Ambassador to the United States|Pakistan ambassador]] to the [[United States]], as the new Prime Minister until the [[East Pakistani legislative election, 1954|new elections]] to be held in 1954.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press, Jennings"/&gt;{{rp|289}} The dismissal of Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin's administration, the Prime Minister, by the Governor-General [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Malik Ghulam]], signalled a troubling trend in [[Political history of Pakistan|political history of the country]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press, Jennings"/&gt;{{rp|289}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rashiduzzaman|first1=M.|title=Pakistan: A Study of Government and Politics|publisher=Ideal Library|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b-0DAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=khawaja+nazimuddin+ayub&amp;q=khawaja+president|language=en|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}}

===Wealth and honours===

Nazimuddin and his brother, [[Khwaja Shahabuddin|Shahabuddin]], belonged to an aristocrat wealthy family who were known for their wealth. In thesis written by Joya Chatterji, Nazimuddin was described for unquestionable loyalty to [[Viceroy of India|British administration]] in [[British Rule of India|India]]:

{{Quote|text=[[Human height|Short]] statured with a bulging pear-like figure, he was known for his insatiable appetite and his unfailing submission to the .... [[British people|Britishers]]...

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1926, and was [[Knight of the Order of the Star of India|knighted]] in 1934 by the [[King-Emperor]], [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34056/pages/3560&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Government of Pakistan]], Nazimuddin has been honored from time to time after his death. In [[Karachi]], the residential areas, [[Nazimabad]] and [[North Nazimabad]] in suburbs of Karachi, had been named after his name. In [[Islamabad]], there is a road intersection, Nazimuddin Road, that has been named in his honor; while in Dacca, there is also a road after his namesake.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In his honour, the [[Pakistan Post]] issued a commemorative stamp in accordance to his respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stamp of Sir Nazimuddin|url=http://www.cybercity-online.net/pof/khawaja_nazimuddin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">'''Kidding Aside''' (The British Childfree Association) was founded in 2000 and exists in order to campaign for the rights of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[childfree]] people. It is thought to be the first politically active childfree movement in the world{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and strives to introduce the childfree voice into relevant British political debate.  It also works to promote the childfree [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] as a legitimate and equal alternative to [[parenting|parenthood]], and campaigns for equality of opportunity for childfree people in employment and with regard to UK tax legislation. In addition to the voluntary childfree, the issues Kidding Aside speaks on also affect the lives of those who are involutarily childfree.

'''Leonard Hodgson''' (24 October 1889 in [[Fulham]], [[London]] – 15 July 1969 in [[Leamington Spa]]) was an [[Anglican]] [[priest]], [[philosopher]], [[theologian]], [[historian]] of the early Church and [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1944 to 1958.

==Early life ==
Hodgson was the son of Walter Hodgson (1853–1934), a shorthand writer to the [[House of Lords]] and the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and of his wife Lillias Emma, a daughter of William Shaw of [[County Durham]]. He was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], London, and [[Hertford College, Oxford]], where he took a second in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin) in 1910, a first in [[Literae Humaniores|Greats ]] (Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1912 and a first in [[Theology]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar 1914'', Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1914, pp.198, 209, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; He then trained for the ministry at [[St Michael's College, Llandaff|St Michael's College]], [[Llandaff]].

==Career==
He was [[ordination|ordained]] a deacon of the [[Church of England]] in 1913, after a year at Llandaff. He served briefly as a curate at St Mark's Church, [[Portsmouth]], then in 1914, in a meteoric promotion, he became vice-principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]]. In 1919 he was elected tutor in theology and dean of divinity at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He was appointed professor of Christian apologetics the [[General Theological Seminary]], [[New York City]], in 1925. He was a canon of [[Winchester]] from 1931 to 1938, when he was elected as [[Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology]] and canon of [[Christ Church, Oxford]].

During the 1930s he became an active [[ecumenist]] and served on the Anglican Council on Foreign Relations. He was also general secretary of the Edinburgh world conference on faith and order in 1937. From 1944 to 1958, he was Oxford's [[Regius Professor of Divinity]]. Twice nominated for episcopal office, he declined to become [[Bishop of Carlisle]], and also refused the bishopric of [[Monmouth]] in 1940 in a move&lt;ref&gt;Peart-Binns J.S, 1990: Edwin Morris, Archbishop of Wales, Llandyssul, Gomer Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which some in the Church in Wales believe deprived the Province of a new and invigorating presence among its prelates. He delivered the Gifford lectures, ''For Faith and Freedom'', from 1955 to 1957 at [[Glasgow University]]. From 1954 until 1966 (some of this time overlapping with his positions in Oxford) he was Warden of William Temple College, [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]. In his book ''Sex and Christian Freedom'' (1967) he tried to "talk twentieth-century common sense without being disloyal to our ordination vows".

A '''meaningless statement''' posits nothing of substance with which one could agree or disagree. In the context of [[logical argument]]s, the inclusion of a meaningless statement in the premises will undermine the validity of the argument since that premise can neither be true nor false.

There are many classes of meaningless statement:

* A statement may be considered meaningless if it asserts that two categories are disjoint without proposing a criterion to distinguish between them. For example, the claim, "I wouldn't know how [[pornography]] differs from [[erotica]]" is a [[distinction without a difference]].
* A statement may be meaningless if its terms are undefined, or if it contains unbound variables. For instance, the sentence "All ''X'' have ''Y''" is meaningless unless the terms ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined (or bound).
* A grammatically correct sentence may be meaningless if it ascribes properties to particulars which admit of no such properties. For example, the famous sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" cannot be taken literally.
* An ungrammatical sentence admits of no meaning. For instance, the string of words "deities Olympus Greek reside The. upon" offers no information regarding the Greek deities, or their whereabouts.
* [[Lewis Carrol]]'s poem [[Jabberwocky]] is a famous example of the [[nonsense verse|nonsensical as literature]].

==Biography==
Ovsyannikov was born 21 November 1915 in the settlement of [[Manturovsky District, Kursk Oblast|Puzachi]] in the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] [[Kursk Governorate]] (presently in [[Kursk Oblast]]). He completed a degree at V.I. Lenin Moscow State Pedagogical University in 1939, subsequently earning a ''[[Kandidat nauk]]'' (primary-level doctoral degree) in 1943 for a dissertation titled "The Fate of Art in the Capitalist Milieu of Hegel and [[Balzac]]" («Судьба искусства в капиталистическом обществе у Гегеля и Бальзака»). In 1961 he earned the academic title ''[[Doktor nauk]]'' (higher-level doctoral degree) for ''The Philosophy of Hegel'', coming to be exceptionally regarded as a specialist on the critical analysis of Hegel's works.

{{Japanese name|Miyake}}
{{nihongo|'''Miyake Setsurei'''|三宅 雪嶺||July 7, 1860 - November 26, 1945}} was a famous philosopher and author from Japan. He graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]]'s Department of Philosophy in 1883. He helped found the Society for Political Education and its magazine "Nihonjin" (Japanese People). In 1907 the [[Nihonjin Magazine]] was renamed "Nihon Oyobi Nihonjin" (Japan and The Japanese People). It was at this time that [[Hasegawa Nyozekan]] was recruited to the magazine.

Miyake's other works included "[[Shinzenbi Nihonjin]]" (Goodness, truth and beauty of The Japanese People) and "[[Giakushu Nihonjin]]" (Falsehoods, evil and ugliness of the Japanese People).

==Political views==
Miyake was a Cooperative Nationalist and differed in opinion from Universalists. He felt that Japan was first a member of the Asian community and secondly a member of the global community. Also Japan should hold onto and preserve its cultural heritage from before the Meiji era as it helped to strengthen Asian culture and, by doing so, world culture.

Miyake felt Japan should make it its mission to study Asia, oppose western imperialism, and nurture the distinctive Japanese sense of beauty.

'''N. C. Paul''' was a 19th-century [[Bengal]]i physician and scientist. He described studies of [[physiology|physiologic changes]] in persons performing [[yoga]] and introduced yoga to a wider Western audience.

==Biography==
Born Nobin Chunder Pal (also transcribed as Navina Chandra Pal, Nobin Chundra Pal, and Navina Candra Pala) he anglicized his name. Paul enrolled at the [[Bengal Medical College]] at [[Calcutta]] and graduated in 1841.,&lt;ref name=broad20&gt;{{cite book |author=[[William J. Broad]] |title=The Science of Yoga.| publisher=Simon and Schuster, 2012| page=20f |isbn=978-1-4516-4142-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; - his name is often followed by G.B.M.C. to designate him as a graduate of the institution. Transferred to [[Benares]] (today Varanasi) he had a "commanding view of yogic life."&lt;ref name=broad20/&gt; As a result of his observations and studies, he published ''Treatise on Yoga Philosophy'', its first edition published in London in 1851&lt;ref name=broad20/&gt; (or 1850)&lt;ref name=singleton/&gt; and a second edition in 1882.

==''Yoga Philosophy''==
Paul's book has been viewed as perhaps the first attempt to link yoga and modern medicine.&lt;ref name=broad20/&gt;&lt;ref name=singleton&gt;{{cite book| author=Mark Singleton |title= Yoga Body. The Origin of Modern Posture Practice| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], 2010 |isbn=978-0-19-539535-8 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines yoga "as nothing more than prolonged sleep".&lt;ref&gt;N. C. Paul, 1882, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise contains case studies of people who went into prolonged [[hibernation]]. Paul is the first to indicate that yoga induces [[hypercapnia]].&lt;ref name=broad20/&gt; He describes yoga positions and exercises for Raja and Hatha yoga and their benefits.

The world traveler and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]] came across the book, erroneously believing the author to be an English physician. She noted that one of his yoga acquaintances was Captain Seymour, an Englishman who became a yogi. She observed that "(t)he book produced a sensation among the representatives of medicine in India, and a lively polemic between Anglo-Indian and native journalists."&lt;ref name=blavatsky&gt;{{cite book| author=H. P. Blavatsky, edited by Mary K. Neff| title=Personal Memoirs of H. P. Blavatsky| publisher= |isbn=978-0766132658| page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7359">'''Neurophenomenology''' refers to a scientific research program aimed to address the [[hard problem of consciousness]] in a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] way.&lt;ref&gt;D. Rudrauf, A. Lutz, D. Cosmelli, J.-P. Lachaux, M. Le Van Quyen. [http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~lutz/VarelaHommage_Biological_research_2003.pdf "From autopoiesis to neurophenomenology: Francisco Varela's exploration of the biophysics of being"], Biol Res 36: 21-59, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It combines [[neuroscience]] with [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] in order to study [[experience]], [[mind]], and [[consciousness]] with an emphasis on the [[embodied cognition|embodied]] condition of the human mind.&lt;ref name= "Gallagher"&gt;Gallagher, S. 2009. Neurophenomenology. In T. Bayne, A. Cleeremans and P. Wilken (eds.), ''Oxford Companion to Consciousness'' (470-472). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The field is very much linked to fields such as [[neuropsychology]], [[neuroanthropology]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] (also known as biopsychology) and the study of [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology in psychology]].

The label was coined by [[Charles Laughlin|C. Laughlin]], J. McManus and E. d'Aquili in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;C. Laughlin, J. McManus and E. d'Aquili: ''Brain, Symbol and Experience: Toward a Neurophenomenology of Consciousness'' (New York: Columbia University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was appropriated and given a distinctive understanding by the cognitive neuroscientist [[Francisco Varela]] in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. 1996.  Neurophenomenology: A methodological remedy for the hard problem''.  Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 3: 330-49.&lt;/ref&gt; whose work has inspired many philosophers and neuroscientists to continue with this new direction of research.

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] is a philosophical method of inquiry of everyday experience. The focus in phenomenology is on the examination of different phenomena (from Greek, ''phainomenon'', "that which shows itself") ''as they appear to consciousness'', i.e. in a first-person perspective. Thus, phenomenology is a discipline particularly useful to understand how is it that appearances present themselves to us, and how is it that we attribute meaning to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:'' Phenomenology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= G&amp;Z&gt;Gallagher, S. and Zahavi, D. 2008. ''The Phenomenological Mind''. London: Routledge, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuroscience]] is the scientific study of the brain, and deals with the third-person aspects of consciousness{{cn|date=September 2016}}. Some scientists studying consciousness believe that the exclusive utilization of either first- or third-person methods will not provide answers to the difficult questions of consciousness.

Historically, [[Edmund Husserl]] is regarded as the philosopher whose work made phenomenology a coherent philosophical discipline with a concrete methodology in the study of consciousness, namely the [[epoche]]. Husserl, who was a former student of [[Franz Brentano]], thought that in the study of mind it was extremely important to acknowledge that consciousness is characterized by [[intentionality]], a concept often explained as "aboutness"; consciousness is always consciousness ''of'' something. A particular emphasis on the phenomenology of [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] was developed by philosopher [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in the mid-20th century.

Naturally, phenomenology and neuroscience find a convergence of common interests. However, primarily because of ontological disagreements between phenomenology and [[philosophy of mind]], the dialogue between these two disciplines is still a very controversial subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/chalmersdeb3dft.htm Husserl himself was very critical towards any attempt to "naturalizing" philosophy, and his phenomenology was founded upon a criticism of [[empiricism]], "[[psychologism]]", and "anthropologism" as contradictory standpoints in philosophy and logic. Debate Between D. Chalmers and D. Dennett: The Fantasy of First-Person Science]&lt;/ref&gt; The influential critique of the ontological assumptions of computationalist and representationalist cognitive science, as well as [[artificial intelligence]], made by philosopher [[Hubert Dreyfus]] has marked new directions for integration of neurosciences with an embodied ontology. The work of Dreyfus has influenced cognitive scientists and neuroscientists to study phenomenology and [[embodied cognitive science]] and/or [[enactivism]]. One of such cases is neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]], whose [[neurodynamics|neurodynamical]] analysis has a marked Merleau-Pontyian approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.class.uh.edu/cogsci/dreyfus.html Hubert Dreyfus 'Intelligence Without Representation: Merleau-Ponty's Critique of Mental Representation']&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent trends on the matter appear to reject Dreyfus's interpretation of Husserl while at the same time maintaining a high interest in the integration of Husserlian phenomenology into the sciences of mind, as demonstrated by Evan Thompson's recent work.&lt;ref&gt;"Evan Thompson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">'''Normal science''', identified  and elaborated on by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'',&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; is the  regular work of [[scientists]] theorizing, observing, and experimenting within a settled [[paradigm]] or explanatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding [[science]] as puzzle-solving,&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1970) p. 35-42&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn explained normal science as slowly accumulating detail in accord with established broad [[theory]], without questioning or challenging the underlying assumptions of that theory.

==The route to normal science==
Kuhn stressed that historically the route to normal science could be a difficult one.  Prior to the formation of a shared paradigm or research consensus, would-be scientists were reduced to the accumulation of random facts and unverified observations, in the manner recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] or [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p.  10-22&lt;/ref&gt; while simultaneously beginning the foundations of their field from scratch through a plethora of competing theories.

Arguably at least the [[social sciences]] remain at such a pre-paradigmatic level today.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rosenberg, ''Philosophy of Science'' (2005) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normal science at work==
Kuhn considered that the bulk of scientific work was that done by the 'normal' scientist, as they engaged with the threefold tasks of articulating the paradigm, precisely evaluating key paradigmatic facts, and testing those new points at which the theoretical paradigm is open to empirical appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 25-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==The breakdown of consensus==
For the normal scientist anomalies represent challenges to be puzzled out and solved ''within'' the paradigm. Only if an anomaly or series of anomalies resists successful deciphering long enough and for enough members of the scientific community will the paradigm itself gradually come under challenge, and perhaps be subjected to a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 52-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way however, according to Kuhn, normal science possesses a built-in mechanism that ensures the relaxation of the restrictions that previously bound [[research]], whenever the paradigm from which they derive ceases to function effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Karl Popper]] has criticised Kuhn's view of normal science as excessively conservative and dogmatic&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Bernstein, ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism'' (2011) p. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;—though whether Kuhn is prescriptive or merely descriptive here is open to doubt. Popper, [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] and [[John W. N. Watkins|Watkins]] have also questioned whether the contrast between normal science versus revolutionary science is as stark as portrayed by Kuhn.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Schneider''' (born 1937) is a [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] priest, founder of Beginner's Mind Zen Center, located in [[Northridge, California]].

==Biography==
Peter and Jane Schneider were early students of [[Shunryu Suzuki]]-roshi in the 1960s. Both served as Suzuki-roshi's [[jisha]] (personal attendant) in the early years of the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. Peter and Jane also assisted in transcription of his dharma talks for later publishing. Following Suzuki-roshi’s death, they accepted scholarships from the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] to study [[Buddhism]] in Japan. They lived and studied in [[Japan]] from 1973 to 1995. They founded the Beginner’s Mind Zen Center (originally the Northridge Zen Center) in 2004.

Peter Schneider first studied with Shunryu Suzuki-roshi in 1962 and returned to continue in 1967. He served as the second director of Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, as well as president of the San Francisco Zen Center.&lt;ref name="Downing2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Downing|first=Michael|title=Shoes Outside the Door: Desire, Devotion, and Excess at San Francisco Zen Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYHUv6XUNrQC&amp;pg=PA175|accessdate=11 May 2012|date=2002-08-15|publisher=Counterpoint Press|isbn=9781582432540|pages=175–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter received priest ordination from Suzuki-roshi in 1970. In 2002 he received [[dharma transmission]] from Sojun [[Mel Weitsman]]-roshi of the [[Berkeley Zen Center]]. Peter is a member of the American Zen Teacher’s Association.

Jane Schneider studied with Shunryu Suzuki-roshi from 1967 until his death in 1971. She served as secretary for the San Francisco Zen Center. In 1973 Jane received priest ordination from [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]]-roshi. Currently she is studying with Myoan Grace Schireson, a dharma heir in the Suzuki-roshi tradition, in preparation for dharma transmission.

'''Ricardo Guillermo Maliandi''' (born in [[La Plata]], 1930, died 12 February 2015)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201502/95142-murio-en-mar-del-plata-el-filosofo-ricardo-maliandi.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer and philosopher, devoted to ethics.
[[File:Ricardomaliandi.jpg|thumb|300px|Philosopher Ricardo Maliandi]]
He was professor in many Argentine universities and researcher in [[CONICET]]. Doctor in Philosophy for Mainz University, Germany. He received '''Konex Prize''' in 1986 for his labor on ethics.

As well he is chairman of Argentine Association of Ethical Researches, fellow of National Academy of Sciences and honorary member of Argentine Association of Bioethics.

His researches started on axiology, especially the works of [[Nicolai Hartmann]], from who he has translated many books. Afterward he made an approach to Discourse Ethics and became friend of one of his founders, [[Karl-Otto Apel]]. From many years he works in an original propose which he call "ethics of convergence".

==Ethics of convergence==
From the beginning of his philosophical career Ricardo Maliandi has researched on material ethics of values, especially Nicolai Hartmann's approach (see Maliandi's doctoral thesis, Mainz University, ''Wertobjektivität und Realitätserfahrung''). Two problems were always under his attention in ethics: foundation and conflictivity. He was convinced the intuitionism of axiological ethics is not enough for a rigorous foundation, but aware as well of the very suggestions of Hartmann analysis on conflictive relations among values, ethical thinking of Maliandi develops as a pursuit of an ethical foundation non-intuitionist, that recognizes conflicts. Sometimes, this research was close to Philosophical Anthropology (see ''Cultura y conflicto'').

In his newest works are very important transcendental pragmatics and Discourse Ethics of  [[Karl-Otto Apel]]. They both offer a new aprioristic foundation, but different of the intuitionist. Maliandi introduces, as a programmatic propose, an approaching between Harmtann's and Apel's ethics, in the sense of the conflictive structure of  ''ethos'' (enfasized by Hartmann) and a pragmatic-trascendental reflexive foundation (held by Apel) (see, ''Transformación y síntesis''). The aproristic axis that, despite of multiple differences of these approaches, linked these two philosophers, allows Maliandi to make a defense of universalism against the unilateral stressing of difference, as appeared in actual irrational trends (see ''Dejar la posmodernidad. La ética frente al irracionalismo actual''). This effort is complemented with the development of a theory of reason and stresses its  "bidimensionality" (foundation and critique) and its "dialogicity" (the fact that reason only works as dialogical communication as it is exposed in ''Volver a la razón'').

Maliandi's ethical conception can be summarized, as he proposed, as "ethics of convergence", he continues working on this topic. (See ''La ética cuestionada.. Prolegómenos para una ética convergente'', 1998. ''Ética: dilemas y convergencias'', 2006, ''Teoría y praxis de los principios bioéticos'' –with Oscar Thüer—Buenos Aires, UNLa, 2008 ). “Convergence” is understood as:

1) an approaching between material ethics of values and discourse ethics, and as a result, between the admission of the inevitability of conflicts and a propose for strong foundation, a priori (conjunction of that “a priori of conflictivity” derives from).

2) a basic feature of an ethics that recognizes a plurality of principles, but as well, at the same time, demands to maximize armony between them.

'''Richard L. Velkley''' (born March 17, 1949) is an American philosopher and Celia Scott Weatherhead Distinguished Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Tulane University]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Christopher and Marks, Jonathan, eds. (2016) Principle and Prudence in Western Political Thought, SUNY Press, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;
Velkley is known for his expertise on [[Kant]], [[Rousseau]], and [[post-Kantian philosophy]]. He was associate editor of ''[[The Review of Metaphysics]]'' (1997-2006) and is president of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] (2017-18).

==Philosophy==
Velkley's writing treats questions about the status of [[philosophic reason]] and its relation to society and politics since the late 18th century: the principles of [[Enlightenment thought]] and their revision, criticism and sometimes complete rejection; conceptions of [[freedom]] and their role in attempts to address social and psychic division and alienation; the turn to [[aesthetic experience]] and aesthetic education; criticisms of modernity inspired by ancient thought; the meaning and the consequences of the historical turn in modern philosophy; accounts of crisis in the [[philosophical tradition]] and critical analyses of the grounds of the tradition. He conceives the study of the [[history of philosophy]] as a way to become aware of persisting perplexities in human life that remain unresolved in the modern period. His historical inquiry starts from Rousseau's criticism of modern philosophy and considers responses of later thinkers to it, in the first place Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chance|first1=Brian|title=Review of Kant's Observations and Remarks: A Critical Guide|date=27 February 2013|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/kant-s-observations-and-remarks-a-critical-guide/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velkley|first1=Richard|title=Review of Rousseau and Hobbes: Nature, Free Will, and the Passions|date=18 August 2015|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/rousseau-and-hobbes-nature-free-will-and-the-passions/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velkley|first1=Richard|title=Review of Images of History: Kant, Benjamin, Freedom and the Human Subject|date=14 February 2017|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/images-of-history-kant-benjamin-freedom-and-the-human-subject/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zank|first1=Michael|title=Review of Heidegger, Strauss, and the Premises of Philosophy: On Original Forgetting|date=3 September 2013|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/heidegger-strauss-and-the-premises-of-philosophy-on-original-forgetting/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=German|first1=Andy|title=What is 'First Philosophy'?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">'''Sacro-Egoism''' is a term defining a sociological approach in [[Western world|Western society]] wherein the ultimate authority regarding religious thought and interpretation rests with the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Definition created by Dr. John S. Knox, PhD in Theology &amp; Religion (2009), [[University of Birmingham]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

As theological thought evolved, specifically after the advent of [[liberalism]] in the nineteenth century, a change began to take place in the religious world. Religious attitudes and prioritization seem to begin shifting from Sacro-Clericalism, where authority is given to the church and its representatives, to Sacro-Egoism, where the individual assumes greatest authority. The role of the individual, the self, was elevated more than ever before and self-reliance was glamorized, epitomized, and utilized in society—even until the present.

[[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theologians]] like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and Tillich ". . . sought to anchor that faith in common human experience, and interpret it in ways that made sense within the modern worldview."&lt;ref&gt;Alister McGrath, Historical Theology: An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 1998), 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher, known as the father of modern liberal theology, considered religion and Christianity to be ". . . the distinctly human awareness of something infinite beyond the self on whom the self is dependent for everything."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Olson, The Story of Christian Theology: Twenty Centuries of Tradition &amp; Reform (Illinois, IN: [[Inter-Varsity Press|InterVarsity Press]], 1999), 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though first a subtle and infrequent occurrence, more and more the authority and centrality of the Church began to lose ground to the prominence of the individual. Culturally, the expression of religion and Christianity encountered ". . . a turn towards life lived by reference to one's own subjective experiences (relational as much as individualistic)."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heelas and Linda Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution: Why Religion is Giving Way to Spirituality (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2005), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaning on one's own understanding became an asset, not a detriment, to religious life and approval.

According to Heelas and Woodhead, "The subjectivities of each individual become a, if not the, unique source of significance, meaning and authority."&lt;ref&gt;Heelas and Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution, 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Grasso continues this understanding stating, "Liberalism's movement toward an ever deeper [[individualism]] receives signal expression in the ascendancy of the type of liberalism that dominates our intellectual scene, in the ascendancy . . . termed the liberalism of the unencumbered self."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Grasso, ‘Christianity, Enlightenment Liberalism, and the Quest for Freedom,’ Modern Age (Fall 2006): 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Starks and Robinson comment that modernists ". . . see individuals and not a deity as the ultimate arbiters of [[moral authority]] and hold to a largely individually directed universe."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Starks and Robert Robinson, ‘Moral Cosmology, Religion, and Adult Values for Children,’ Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 46, no. 1 (March 2007): 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious focus has moved from the institution to the individual.

Currently, this shift can be observed in a variety of ways as mentioned earlier, most visibly in lowered membership and attendance numbers. This situation has been attributed to poor religious offerings, to a modern emphasis on the secular world, to ineffective participation and devotion of believers worldwide, or to the will of God (in some religious circles). While all these may be partially true, the danger is making a synecdoche of the products of decline and overestimating their importance and influence in religion.

Christian society has never operated from a vacuum. Furseth and Repstad state, "It is simply not true that individuals invent their own world-view in a void."&lt;ref&gt;Inger Furseth and Pål Repstad, An Introduction to the [[Sociology of religion|Sociology of Religion]] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; From its earliest beginnings, this [[Religion|religious movement]] has interacted closely with culture, as did its founder. Thus, this interaction ". . . is two-way: Christianity both influences and is influenced by culture."&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Historical Theology, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the expression of [[Christianity|Christian faith]] has never been static. Sociological studies of Religion such as the Kendal Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/projects/ieppp/kendal/methods.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the McMinnville Project&lt;ref&gt;John S. Knox PhD Dissertation Research Project (2006-7).&lt;/ref&gt; aptly demonstrate a religious transformation from older traditional patterns. Sacro-Egoism suggests that at the heart and in the origins of Christianity and modern religion is a personalized, dynamic, individualistic faith. This is Sacro-Egoism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9537">A '''semantic decomposition''' is an algorithm that breaks down the meanings of phrases or concepts into less complex concepts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The result of a semantic decomposition is a representation of meaning. This representation can be used for tasks, such as those related to [[artificial intelligence]] or [[machine learning]]. Semantic decomposition is common in [[natural language processing]] applications. 

The basic idea of a semantic decomposition is taken from the learning skills of adult humans, where words are explained using other words. It is based on [[Meaning-text theory]]. [[Meaning-text theory]] is used as a theoretical linguistic framework= to describe the meaning of concepts with other concepts. 

== Background ==
Given that an [[AI]] does not inherently have language, it is unable to think about the meanings behind the words of a language. An artificial notion of meaning needs to be created for a strong AI to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Loizos|date=2015-07-27|title=Jumping to conclusions|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2907094.2907102|publisher=CEUR-WS.org|pages=43–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI today is able to capture the syntax of language for many specific problems, but never establishes meaning for the words of these languages, nor is it able to abstract these words to higher-order concepts &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=aZ9_QwAACAAJ}}|title=Knowledge Representation|last=Sowa|first=John F.|date=2003|publisher=China Machine Press|year=|isbn=9787111121497|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Creating an artificial representation of meaning requires the analysis of what meaning is. Many terms are associated with meaning, including semantics, pragmatics, knowledge and understanding or word sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=UZ2lCQAAQBAJ}}|title=Semantik: Eine Einführung|last=Löbner|first=Sebastian|date=2015-05-19|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|year=|isbn=9783110350906|location=|pages=|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each term describes a particular aspect of meaning, and contributes to a multitude of theories explaining what meaning is. These theories need to be analyzed further to develop an artificial notion of meaning best fit for our current state of knowledge.

== Graph representations ==
[[File:Knowledge_Reasoning.pdf|thumb|Abstract approach on how knowledge representation and reasoning allow a problem specific solution (answer) to a given problem (questions)]]

Representing meaning as a graph is one of the two ways that both an AI cognition and a linguistic researcher think about meaning ([[Connectionism|connectionist]] view). Logicians utilize a formal representation of meaning to build upon the idea of symbolic representation, whereas description logics describe languages and the meaning of symbols. This contention between 'neat' and 'scruffy' techniques has been discussed since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minsky|first=Marvin L.|date=1991-06-15|title=Logical Versus Analogical or Symbolic Versus Connectionist or Neat Versus Scruffy|url=https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/894|journal=AI Magazine|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=2|pages=34–34|doi=10.1609/aimag.v12i2.894|issn=2371-9621}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research has so far identified semantic measures and with that [[Word-sense disambiguation]] (WSD) - the differentiation of meaning of words - as the main problem of language understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781402048081|title=Word Sense Disambiguation - Algorithms and Applications {{!}} Eneko Agirre {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an AI-complete environment, WSD is a core problem of natural language understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Ide and Jean Veronis.

The abstract approach is shown in Figure. First, a connectionist knowledge representation is created as a [[semantic network]] consisting of concepts and their relations to serve as the basis for the representation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sycara|first=Katia|last2=Klusch|first2=Matthias|last3=Widoff|first3=Seth|last4=Lu|first4=Jianguo|date=1999-03-01|title=Dynamic service matchmaking among agents in open information environments|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309844.309895|journal=ACM SIGMOD Record|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47–53|doi=10.1145/309844.309895|issn=0163-5808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Oaks|first=Phillipa|title=Capabilities: Describing What Services Can Do|date=2003|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24593-3_1|work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=1–16|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-24593-3_1|isbn=9783540206811|access-date=2018-11-30|last2=ter Hofstede|first2=Arthur H.

The node and edge interpretation model is the symbolic influence of certain concepts.

Future work uses the created representation of meaning to build heuristics and evaluate them through capability matching and agent planning, [[Chatbot|chatbots]] or other applications of [[natural language understanding]].

==Life==
Seyid Yahya Bakuvi was born in [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]] into a rich family. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi lived in the 15th century, in [[Baku]] in the palace of [[Khalilullah I]].&lt;ref&gt;A. H.

Mustakimzde – Şerhi Virdü – Settar, SK: Pertev Paşa, N611&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he was engaged in [[Sufism]], and was a follower of the eminent Sheikh Sadr ad-Din al Khalvati, leader of the tariqa’s [[Shirvan]]. After the sheikh’s death, Seyid Yahya quarreled with a student Pirizade about who would lead Khalvati’s sect; he then left Shamakhi to move to Baku. In Baku he settled in the palace of Khalilullah I, where he enjoyed wide popularity as a philosopher and scientist. Soon the number of his followers (in countries of the [[Near East]], too) exceeded ten thousand people.

==Death==
According to one source, the date of Bakuvi’s death was 862 AH (1457), to another it was 868 AH (1463). There is a [[Mausoleum of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi]] in the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshahs’ Palace]] complex. The date on that building is the date of mausoleum's construction.

==Bakuvi’s works==
15 works of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi have been saved up to date. His works have a sufistic and mystic character. They are kept in cities of [[Turkey]]: [[Istanbul]] (“Muradiye” library), [[Konya]], [[Manisa]]. Seyid Yahya wrote such philosophic treatises as “Sharkh-I Gulshani-raz”(“Comments to flower garden of secrets”), “Asrar at-Talibin” (“Secrets of searchers of the truth”), “Symbolism of signs”, “Comments to the Safavids dynasty”, “Secrets of spirits” and others, penetrated through religious and mystic ideas which are valuable sources in the sphere of investigation of philosophy, astronomy and math.

'''''Shams al-Ma'arif''''' or '''''Shams al-Ma'arif wa Lata'if al-'Awarif''''' ({{lang-ar|كتاب شمس المعارف ولطائف العوارف}}, lit. "The Book of the Sun of Gnosis and the Subtleties of Elevated Things") is a 13th-century [[grimoire]] written on [[Arabic]] [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and a manual for achieving esoteric [[spirituality]]. It was written by [[Ahmad al-Buni]] in [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid Egypt]], who died around 1225 [[Common Era|CE]] (622 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]). The ''Shams al-Ma'arif'' is generally regarded as the most influential textbook of its type in the [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Muslim world]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Owen Davies, ''Grimoires: A History of Magic Books'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and is arguably as important as, if not more than, the [[Picatrix]] in both hemispheres.

In contemporary form the book consists of two volumes; ''Shams al-Ma'arif al-Kubra'' and ''Shams al-Ma'arif al-Sughra'', the former being the larger of the two.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamsu al-Ma‘aref al-Kubrah'', Al Nour Library, Beirut, Lebanon: 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shamsu al-Ma‘aref al-Sughra'', Al Nour Library, Beirut, Lebanon: 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The first few chapters introduce the reader to [[magic square]]s, and the combination of [[number]]s and the [[alphabet]] that are believed to bring magical effect, which the author insists is the only way to communicate with [[jinn]], [[angels in Islam|angels]] and spirits. The table of contents that were introduced in the later printed editions of the work contain a list of unnumbered chapters (''faṣl''), which stretch to a number of 40. However, prior to the [[printing press]] and various other standardisations, there were three independent volumes that circulated, each one differing in length.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Maddison, Emilie Savage-Smith, Ralph H. Pinder-Wilson, Tim Stanley, ''Science, Tools And Magic Vol. 12'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

While being popular, it also carries a reputation for being suppressed and banned for much of Islamic history,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ipgrave, ''Scriptures in Dialogue: Christians and Muslims Studying the Bible and the Qur'an Together'', Church Publishing Inc, 2004, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; but still flourishes in being read and studied up to the present day. Many Sufi orders, such as the [[Naqshbandi-Haqqani Golden Chain|Naqshbandi-Haqqani order]] have recognised its legitimacy and use as a compendium for the occult, and hold it in high regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eshaykh.com/halal_haram/shamsul-maarif/ |title=Shamsu’l-Ma`arif |publisher=eshaykh.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023182733/http://eshaykh.com/halal_haram/shamsul-maarif |archivedate=October 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another title by the same author, namely ''[[Manba' Usool al-Hikmah]]'' ("The Source of the Essentials of Wisdom"), is considered its companion text.

==Translations==
Although full-volume translations into English are not known, there have been numerous renditions of a few of the more popular rituals found within the main treatise, as well as those that lie in its accompanying text. Some of these rituals have had various degrees of notability, but one of recurring presence in many publications is that of the ''[[Birhatiya]]''&lt;ref&gt;Wahid Azal, ''The Birhatiya Conjuration Oath &amp; the meaning of its first 28 names'', N.U.R.-Fatimiya Sufi Order, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nineveh Shadrach, ''Magic That Works: Practical Training for the Children of Light'', Ishtar Publishing, 2005, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nineveh Shadrach, ''Ancient Magick Conjuration of Power: Beginners Guide to the Berhatiah'', Ishtar Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as ''The Ancient Oath'' or ''Red Sulphur''&lt;ref&gt;Nineveh Shadrach, ''Magic That Works: Practical Training for the Children of Light'', Ishtar Publishing, 2005, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;).

Outside of the Arab and Western world, several editions of the book have been published in the [[Urdu]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal al-Din Ahmad, ''Shams al-Ma'arif al-Kubra Wa Lata'if al-'Awarif. Urdu'', Darul Ishaat, Karachi, Pakistan: 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basir Ahmad Hadrat Kalianwala, ''Shams al-Ma'arif Lata'if al-'Awarif. Urdu Tarjama'', Kutub Khana Shan-e-Islam, Lahore, Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selahattin Alpay, ''Sems’ül Maarif. Büyük Bilgiler Güneşi'', P.K. 157 Beyazid, Istanbul: 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smartha tradition''' is a movement in [[Hinduism]] that developed during its classical period around the beginning of the Common Era. It reflects a Hindu synthesis of four philosophical strands: [[Mimamsa]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], and [[theism]].&lt;ref name="Milner 1994 p. 195"/&gt; The Smartha tradition rejects theistic sectarianism,&lt;ref name="Milner 1994 p. 195"/&gt; and it is notable for the domestic worship of five shrines with five deities, all treated as equal – [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Ganesha]], [[Surya]] and [[Parvati]] ([[Shakti]]).{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=113}} The Smartha tradition contrasted with the older Shrauta tradition, which was based on elaborate rituals and rites.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=113}}{{sfn|Knipe|2015|pp=36-37}} There has been considerable overlap in the ideas and practices of the Smartha tradition with other significant historic movements within Hinduism, namely [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]], and [[Shaktism]].{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=113, 134, 155-161, 167-168}}&lt;ref name="Sanderson, Alexis 2009. pp. 276-277"&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. ''"The Saiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of Saivism during the Early Medieval Period."'' In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 276-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Shephard (2009), Ninian Smart on World Religions, Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0754666387}}, page 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smartha tradition is aligned with [[Advaita Vedanta]], and regards [[Adi Shankara]] as its founder or reformer.&lt;ref&gt;U Murthy (1979), Samskara, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195610796}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt; Shankara championed the ultimate reality is impersonal and ''Nirguna'' (attributeless) and any symbolic god serves the same equivalent purpose.&lt;ref name=williamsonp89&gt;L Williamson (2010), Transcendent in America: Hindu-inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion, New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0814794500}}, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this belief, the Smartha tradition followers, along with the five Hindu gods include a sixth impersonal god in their practice.&lt;ref name=williamsonp89/&gt; The tradition has been called by William Jackson as "advaitin, monistic in its outlook".&lt;ref&gt;William Jackson (1994), Tyāgarāja and the Renewal of Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120811461}}, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Smartha'' also refers to [[Brahmin]]s who specialize in the [[Smriti]] corpus of texts named the Grihya Sutras, in contrast to Shrauta Sutras.{{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=36}}&lt;ref&gt;Buhnemann, Gudrun, ''Puja: A Study in Smarta Ritual'', Publications of the De Nobili Research Library, Gerold &amp; Co., Vienna, 1988. pg. 32-33;&lt;br&gt;Buhnemann, Gudrun, ''Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions'', Leiden, Brill, 2003. pg. 57. ''"Initially a brief explanation of the word Smārta may be in order. Smārta is a rather loosely used term which refers to a Brahmin who is an ‘adherent of the Smrti’ and of the tradition which is ‘based on the Smrti.’"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 1996 pg. 17"&gt;Flood, Gavin (1996), ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge University Press. pg. 17. ''"There is also an important tradition of Brahmans called Smārtas, those who follow the smrti or secondary revelation..."'' pg.56. ''"The Brahmans who followed the teachings of these texts were known as Smārtas, those who followed the smrtis..."'' pg.113. ''"The Brahmans who followed the puranic religion became known as smārta, those whose worship was based on the Smrtis, or pauranika, those based on the Purānas."''&lt;/ref&gt; Smartha Brahmins with their focus on the Smriti corpus, contrast from [[Shrauta|Srauta]] Brahmins who specialize in the [[Sruti]] corpus, that is rituals and ceremonies that follow the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Gavin Flood 2006 6–7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin Flood |title=The Tantric Body: The Secret Tradition of Hindu Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Uer8W670IoC |year=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn= 978-1-84511-011-6 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Smartha is an adjective derived from [[Smriti]] ({{indic|lang=sa|indic=स्मृति|trans=Smṛti|indicipa=s̪mr̩.t̪i}}).&lt;ref name=SSD-Smarta /&gt; The smriti are a specific body of Hindu texts usually attributed to an author, traditionally written down but constantly revised, in contrast to [[Śruti]]s (the Vedic literature) considered authorless, that were transmitted verbally across the generations and fixed.&lt;ref name="Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty 1988 pages 2-3"&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-1867-6}}, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}}

Smartha has several meanings:&lt;ref name=SSD-Smarta&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+smArta&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Spoken Sanskrit Dictionary, ''smArta'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssmarta&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1154|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1154}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Relating to memory
*Recorded in or based on the [[Smriti]]
*Based on tradition, prescribed or sanctioned by traditional law
*Orthodox [[Brahmin]] versed in or guided by traditional law and Vedanta doctrine

In Smartha tradition context, the term ''Smartha'' means "follower of Smriti".&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Killingley (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Editors: Denise Cush et al), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700712670}}, page 456&lt;/ref&gt; Smartha is specially associated with a "sect founded by [[Adi Shankara|Shankaracharya]]", states Monier Williams.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssmarta/&gt;

==History==

The [[Vedanga]] texts, states [[Alf Hiltebeitel]], are Smriti texts that were composed in the second half of the Vedic period that ended around 500 BCE.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|p=13}} The Vedanga texts include the [[Kalpa (Vedanga)]] texts consisting of the Srautasutras, Grihyasutras and Dharmasutras, many of which were revised well past the Vedic period.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=13-14}} The Grihyasutras and Dharmasutras, states Hiltebeitel, were composed between 600 BCE and 400 CE, and these are sometimes called the Smarthasutras, the roots of the Smriti tradition.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=13-14}} The Smriti texts accept the knowledge in the Sruti (Ve  , the Mimamsa and Vedanta have sometimes been called the ''Smartha'' schools which emphasize the Vedas with reason and other ''[[pramanas]]'', in contrast to ''Haituka'' schools which emphasize ''hetu'' (cause, reason) independent of the Vedas while accepting the authority of the Vedas.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=18-19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mircea Eliade|author2=Charles J. Adams|title=The encyclopedia of religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aYjAAAAYAAJ|volume=6|year=1987|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-909750-2|pages=345–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two Smartha traditions, Mimamsa focussed on Vedic ritual traditions, while Vedanta focussed on [[Upanishadic]] knowledge tradition.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=18-19}}

Around the start of the common era, and thereafter, a syncretism of ''Haituka'' schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya and Yoga), the ''Smartha'' schools (Mimamsa, Vedanta) with ancient theistic ideas (bhakti, tantric) gave rise to a growth in traditions such as [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaktism]].{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=18-22}} Hiltebeitel and Flood locate the origins of a revived orthodox Smartha Tradition in the (early) Classical Period of Hinduism, particularly with [[nondualism|nondualist]] (Advaita) interpretation of Vedanta,{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=18-22, 29-30}} around the time when different Hindu traditions emerged from the interaction between Brahmanism and local traditions.{{sfn|Flood|1996}}

===The Synthesis===
The revived Smartha Tradition attempted to integrate varied and conflicting devotional practices, with its ideas of nondual experience of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (self, soul) as [[Brahman]].{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=29-30}} The rapprochement included the practice of ''pancayatana-puja'' (five shrine worship), wherein a Hindu could focus on any ''saguna'' deity of choice (''istadevata'') such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Surya or Ganesha, as an interim step towards realizing the ''nirguna'' Brahman.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=29-30}} The growth of this Smartha Tradition began in the Gupta period (4th-5th century CE), and likely was dominated by [[Dvija]] classes, in particular the [[Brahmin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Smarta-sect Smarta sect], Encyclopædia Britannica (2012), Quote: "Smarta sect, orthodox Hindu sect composed of members of the “twice-born,” or initiated upper classes (Brahmin, Kshatriya, and Vaishya), whose primarily Brahmin followers (...)."&lt;/ref&gt; of the early medieval Indian society.&lt;ref name="Jackson1994p212"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Joseph Jackson |title=Tyāgarāja and the Renewal of Tradition: Translations and Reflections |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZBnppBQgOsC |year=1994|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-1146-1|pages=212–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Smartha Tradition competed with other major traditions of Hinduism such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism.&lt;ref name="Jackson1994p212"/&gt; The ideas of Smartha Tradition were historically influential, creative with concepts such as of [[Harihara]] (half Shiva, half Vishnu deity) and [[Ardhanarishvara]] (half woman, half man deity), and many of the major scholars of Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Bhakti movement came out of the Smartha Tradition.&lt;ref name="Jackson1994p212" /&gt;

===Recognition of Smartha as a tradition===
Medieval era scholars such as Vedanta Desika and Vallabhacharya recognized Smartha Tradition as competing with Vaishnavism and other traditions. According to Jeffrey Timm, for example, in verse 10 of the ''Tattvarthadipanibandha'', [[Vallabhacharya]] states that, "Mutually contradictory conclusions are non-contradictory when they are considered from their respective contexts, like Vaishnava, Smartha, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey R. Timm|title=Texts in Context: Traditional Hermeneutics in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryswPhIBcZkC |year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0796-7|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Murray Milner Jr., a professor of Sociology, the Smartha tradition refers to "Hindus who tend toward Brahmanical orthodoxy in both thought and behavior". Smarthas are usually committed to a "relatively unified Hinduism" and they reject extreme forms of sectarian isolationism, reminiscent of the European discourse about church and Christian sects.&lt;ref name="Milner 1994 p. 195"&gt;{{cite book | last=Milner | first=M. | title=Status and Sacredness: A General Theory of Status Relations and an Analysis of Indian Culture | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-19-535912-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdqMMcYQ7r8C&amp;pg=PA195 | access-date=2018-06-18 | pages=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition, states Milner, has roots that emerged sometime between 3rd century BCE and 3rd century CE, likely in response to the growth of Jainism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Milner 1994 p. 195"/&gt; It reflected a Hindu synthesis of four philosophical strands: Mimamsa, Advaita, Yoga and theism.&lt;ref name="Milner 1994 p. 195"/&gt;

Smartha tradition emerged initially as a synthesis movement to unify Hinduism into a nonsectarian form based on the Vedic heritage. It accepted ''varnasrama-dharma'', states Bruce Sullivan, which reflected an acceptance of ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' (caste/class) and ''[[Ashrama (stage)|ashrama]]'' (four stages of human life) as a form of social and religious duty. In the later second half of the 1st millennium, [[Adi Shankara]] reformed and brought ideas to the movement in the form of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sullivan | first=B.M. | title=Historical Dictionary of Hinduism | publisher=Scarecrow Press | series=Historical dictionaries of religions, philosophies, and movements | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8108-3327-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvhGP8NRx4QC&amp;pg=PA213 | pages=213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Upinder Singh, the Smartha tradition's religious practice emerged as a transformation of [[Brahmanism]] and can be described as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=U. | title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century | publisher=Pearson Education | year=2008 | isbn=978-81-317-1120-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA514 | pages=509–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smartha as a tradition emphasized all gods as equal and different ways of perceiving the all-pervasive metaphysical impersonal [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Melton | first=J.G. | title=Faiths Across Time: 5,000 Years of Religious History | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-61069-026-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bI9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA578 | page=578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smartha Brahmins===
{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
The adjective ''Smārtha'' is also used to classify a [[Brahmin]] who adheres to the [[Smriti]] corpus of texts.&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 1996 pg. 17"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buhnemann, Gudrun, ''Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions'', Leiden, Brill, 2003. pg. 57. ''"Initially a brief explanation of the word Smārta may be in order. Smārta is a rather loosely used term which refers to a Brahmin who is an ‘adherent of the Smrti’ and of the tradition which is ‘based on the Smrti.’"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartha Brahmins specialize in the Smriti corpus of texts,{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=56-57}} are differentiated from [[Shrauta|Srauta]] Brahmins who specialize in the [[Sruti]] corpus of texts such as the [[Brahmana]]s layer embedded inside the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Gavin Flood 2006 6–7"/&gt; Smartha Brahmins are also differentiated from Brahmins who specialize in the [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] (non-Vedic, [[Tantra]]) literature such as the [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Adi Shaiva]] Brahmins, [[Sri Vaishnavism|Sri Vaishnava]] Brahmins and Shaiva [[Kashmiri Pandits]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson, Alexis 2009. pp. 276-277"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin Flood |title=The Tantric Body: The Secret Tradition of Hindu Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Uer8W670IoC |year=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn= 978-1-84511-011-6 |pages=7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these identities are not clearly defined, and active groups such as "Agamic Smartha Saiva Brahmins" have thrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fred W.

===Smartha Vishwakarmas===
Vishwakarmas are artisans found in South India, such as in the state of [[Karnataka]]. They are known for their traditional expertise and skills as blacksmiths, carpenters, coppersmiths, sculptors and goldsmiths. Smartha Vishwakarmas are vegetarian artisans who follow the Smartha tradition. They contrast with Vaishnava Vishwakarmas who follow the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of Hinduism and some of whom may consume non-vegetarian food.&lt;ref name="Ridder1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stein257&gt;{{cite book|author1=Burton Stein|author2=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title=Institutions and economic change in South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcrsAAAAMAAJ |year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-563857-8|pages=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-marriage of widows is a tradition found among the Smartha Vishwakarmas, but has been atypical among Vaishnava Vishwakarma.&lt;ref name=stein257/&gt;

According to Brouwer, examples of Smartha Vishwakarmas include Niligundapanta (traditionally blacksmiths and carpenters), Konnurpanta (all five artisan trades) and Madipattar (goldsmiths).&lt;ref name="Ridder1987"/&gt; The Smartha Vishwakarmas are not considered to be Brahmins.&lt;ref name="Ridder1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

==Philosophy and practices==
===Saguna and Nirguna Brahman===
According to Smarthism, supreme reality, Brahman, transcends all of the various forms of personal deity.{{sfn|Espin|Nickoloff|2007|p=563}}{{refn|group=note|By contrast, the dualistic [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] traditions consider [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]] to be the supreme God who grants salvation. Similarly, the dualistic subtradition of [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] holds the same beliefs about [[Shiva]]. Other traditions of Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism hold a spectrum of beliefs between dualism and [[nondualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= McDaniel |first=June |title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC | year =2004| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-534713-5| pages=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiyokazu Okita (2010), Theism, Pantheism, and Panentheism: Three Medieval Vaishnava Views of Nature and their Possible Ecological Implications, Journal of Vaishnava Studies, Volume 18, Number 2, pages 5-26&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Smarthas follow an orthodox Hindu philosophy, which means they accept the Vedas, and the ontological concepts of Atman and Brahman therein.

The Smartha Tradition accepts two concepts of Brahman, which are the ''[[saguna Brahman]]'' – the Brahman with attributes, and ''[[nirguna Brahman]]'' – the Brahman without attributes.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Anantanand Rambachan (2001), [https://dx.doi.org/10.7825/2164-6279.1250 Heirarchies {{sic|hide=y}} in the Nature of God? Questioning The "Saguna-Nirguna" Distinction in Advaita Vedanta], Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies, Vol. 14, No. 7, pages 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nirguna Brahman'' is the unchanging Reality, however, the ''saguna Brahman'' is posited as a means to realizing this ''nirguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name=williamw/&gt; The concept of the ''saguna Brahman'' is considered in this tradition to be a useful symbolism and means for those who are still on their spiritual journey, but the saguna concept is abandoned by the fully enlightened once he or she realizes the identity of their own soul with that of the ''nirguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name=williamw&gt;William Wainwright (2012), [http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/entries/concepts-god/ Concepts of God], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; A Smartha may choose any ''saguna'' deity (''istadevata'') such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Surya, Ganesha or any other, and this is viewed in Smartha Tradition as an interim step towards realizing the ''nirguna'' Brahman and its equivalence to one's own Atman.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=29-30}}

===Panchayatana Puja===
The Smarthas evolved a kind of worship which is known as [[Panchayatana puja]]. In this Puja, one or more of the five Hindu Deities ([[Surya]], [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Ganesha]] and [[Devi]] or Shakti) are the objects of veneration.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=29-30}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}} The five symbols of the major Gods are placed on a round open metal dish called Panchayatana, the symbol of the deity preferred by the worshiper being in the center. A similar arrangement is also seen in the medieval temples, in which the central shrine housing the principal Deity is surrounded by four smaller shrines containing the figures of the other deities.{{sfn|Goyal|1984}} Some of the Smarthas of South India add a sixth god [[Kartikeya]] (See [[Shanmata]]). According to [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham|Basham]], "[m]any upper-class Hindus still prefer the way of the Smarthas to Saiva and Vaisnava forms of worship".{{sfn|Basham|1991|p=109}}

===Shankara and Advaita Vedanta===
{{main|Adi Shankara|Advaita Vedanta}}
Traditionally, Sri Adi Shankaracharya (8th century) is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smartha tradition.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Shankara himself, and his influential predecessor [[Gaudapada]], used Buddhist terminology and mention Buddhist doctrines in their work,{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}}{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=60-64}} suggesting that they were influenced by Buddhism.{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177-178}}{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}} Gaudapada, states Raju took over the Buddhist doctrines that [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]]{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}} and "that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation", then "wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the ''Mandukaya Upanisad'', which was further developed by Shankara".{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177-178}} In Gaudapada's text, similarly, the Buddhist concept of [[Ajativada|"ajāta"]] from [[Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna's]] [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy is found.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} In contrast, other scholars such as Murti, assert that while there is borrowed terminology, Gaudapada's doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Gaudapada's influential text consists of four chapters; Chapter One, Two and Three of which are entirely Vedantin and founded on the [[Upanishads]], with little Buddhist flavor.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114&gt;TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-0-415-46118-4}}, pages 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology and incorporates Buddhist doctrines, state both Murti and Richard King, but Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada through the 17th century never referenced nor used Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=iepgauda&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/gauḍapad/ Gaudapada], Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaudapada tradition is Vedantin with its foundation of Atman and Brahman, and his doctrines fundamentally different from Buddhism which deny these foundational concepts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="trvmurti114"/&gt;{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=81}}}}

According to Hiltebeitel, Adi Shankaracharya established the [[nondualist]] interpretation of the [[Upanishads]] as the touchstone of a revived ''Smartha'' tradition:
{{quote|Practically, Adi Shankara Acharya fostered a rapprochement between Advaita and ''smarta'' orthodoxy, which by his time had not only continued to defend the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varnasramadharma]]'' theory as defining the path of ''karman'', but had developed the practice of ''pancayatanapuja'' ("five-shrine worship") as a solution to varied and conflicting devotional practices. Thus one could worship any one of five deities (Vishnu, Siva, Durga, Surya, Ganesa) as one's ''istadevata'' ("deity of choice").{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}}}}

==Texts==
{{See also|Shastras}}
Smarthas follow the [[Hindu scriptures]]. Like all traditions within Hinduism, they accept as an [[epistemic]] premise that [[Śruti]] (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439"&gt;Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248&lt;/ref&gt; The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts - the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name="Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty 1988 pages 2-3"/&gt; Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts.{{sfn|Deutsch|1988|pp=4-6 with footnote 4}}&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'', and their unchanging, eternal nature, are the basic truths in this tradition. The emphasis in Vedic texts here is the ''jnana-kanda'' (knowledge, philosophical speculations) in the Upanishadic part of the Vedas, not its ''karma-kanda'' (ritual injunctions).{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}} Along with the Upanishads, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Brahma Sutras]] are the central texts of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, providing the truths about the identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'' and their changeless nature.{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35}}

The Brahmasutra is considered as the ''Nyaya Prasthana'' (canonical base for reasoning).{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35-36}} The Bhagavad Gita is considered as the ''Smriti Prasthana''.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35-36}} The text relies on other ''Smritis'', such as the [[Vedangas]], [[Itihasa]], [[Dharmasastras]], [[Puranas]] and others.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=113}} Some of this ''smriti'' literature incorporated shramanic and Buddhist influences{{sfn|Larson|2009|p=185}} of the period from about 200 BC to about AD 300 {{sfn|Larson|2009|p=185}}{{sfn|Cousins|2010}} and the emerging ''bhakti'' tradition into the Brahmanical fold.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002}}{{sfn|Larson|2009|p=185}}

==Institutions==

Adi Shankara is one of the leading scholars of the Smartha Tradition, and he founded some of the most famous monasteries in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ryanjonesmatha&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D.

{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
Vaitheespara notes the adherence of the Smartha Brahmans to "the pan-Indian Sanskrit-brahmanical tradition" and their influence on pan-Indian nationalism:
{{quote|The emerging pan-Indian nationalism was clearly founded upon a number of cultural movements that, for the most part, reimagined an 'Aryo-centric', neo-brahmanical vision of India, which provided the 'ideology' for this hegemonic project. In the Tamil region, such a vision and ideology was closely associated with the Tamil Brahmans and, especially, the Smarta Brahmans who were considered the strongest adherents of the pan-Indian Sanskrit-Brahmanical tradition.{{sfn|Vaitheespara|2010|p=91}}}}

'''The Abode of the Message''' is a Universal Sufi community founded in 1975 by [[Vilayat Inayat Khan]]. The Abode is the central residential community of the [[Sufi Order Ināyati|Inayati]] order (formerly Sufi Order International), a conference and retreat center, and a center of esoteric study.&lt;ref name="Jackman1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whilden2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulloch2010"/&gt; The Abode is located in the eastern heights of the [[Taconic Mountains]] in [[New Lebanon, New York]], and housed in historic [[Shaker]] buildings built between 1834 and 1870.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutek1998"/&gt;

The described intent of the Abode as a community is to "collectively embody spiritual awakening," through "mutual commitment to practicing...the Sufi teachings," "shared devotion to the ideals of Love, Harmony and Beauty, and to the specific transformational work whereby these ideals are progressively realized," for "mutual dedication and visionary collaboration."&lt;ref name="Abode_vision"/&gt;

==History of the site==
[[File:Abode-main-campus-shaker-barn.jpg|thumbnail|left|alt=Photo of a red barn.|Shaker Barn, the Shaker community's horse barn]]Most of the Abode's Main Campus structures were built in the mid-19th century by the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Village]] community as housing and workspaces for their South Family group.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulloch2010"/&gt; Formally established in 1787, the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society|New Lebanon Shaker Society]] (renamed the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society in 1861&lt;ref name="Stein1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP"/&gt;) was the second major [[Shakers|Shaker]] society formed in the recently created [[United States of America]]. The society established its home at the Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, which became the primary Shaker spiritual residential community.&lt;ref name="Gutek1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShakerMuseum_MtLebanon"/&gt;

The [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Village]] was organized into Family groups living in clustered buildings sited around the property.&lt;ref name="Gutek1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShakerMuseum_MtLebanon"/&gt; Three main groups of buildings survive as of 2010. The Church Family property is occupied by the [[Darrow School]], a private residential high school.&lt;ref name="Becksvoort2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Darrow_history"/&gt; The North Family property is occupied and being restored by the [[Shaker Museum and Library|Shaker Museum]], [[Mount Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Becksvoort2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShakerMuseum_history"/&gt; The South Family property was owned by the [[Shaker Village Work Group]]&lt;ref name="Becksvoort2000"/&gt; (a camp for urban teenagers established in 1947 as the Shaker Village Work Camp and later renamed&lt;ref name="Opdahl2004"/&gt;) until it was purchased in 1975 for the [[Sufi Order International]], which established it as a new residential spiritual community&amp;mdash;The Abode of the Message.&lt;ref name="Sutton2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abode_history"/&gt;

==Community==
Today the Abode continues as one of the few enduring [[intentional communities]] among those that arose by the thousands&lt;ref name="Miller1999"/&gt; from North America's [[New Age|new spirituality movement]] and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]]. The Abode community meets for common meals in the Rezak Hall dining room, also used for that purpose by the South Family Shakers.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt; There are also regular classes and events associated with the activities of the [[Sufi Order International]].&lt;ref name="Webb1995"/&gt; The Abode’s revenue sources include fees from residents, leasing space on the Main Campus to the Flying Deer Nature Center, operating a meditation Retreat Center, and event facility rentals of meeting and housing space on the Main Campus and the Mountain Camp.&lt;ref name="Whilden2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulloch2010"/&gt;

The Abode community in 2010 included approximately 40 adults and 10 to 12 children living in houses along Chair Factory Road and apartments in Main Campus buildings, as well as off-site members living in the area.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulloch2010"/&gt; In 2016, the residential population was approximately 24 adults and 6 children.  The population expands with temporary staff and students during the summer. The Abode’s extended community includes past residents and the many Inayati Order members who regularly or occasionally attend events at the Abode, numbering several thousand.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb1995"/&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:Abode-main-campus-retreathut2.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Photo of a small lean-to style wooden hut with a sliding glass front door.|Meditation retreat hut, for individual spiritual retreats]]
The ''Abode Programs Office'' administers event scheduling and oversees operations and services for the Abode. The Office operates the Main Campus and the Mountain Camp, and other Abode facilities that are available to rent for public events. Overnight accommodations are also available for individual visitors staying overnight.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt; The Office manages programs for volunteer interns, work-exchange residents, as well as ''Khidmat,'' the Abode’s combined work service-study program.

The ''Abode Retreat Center'' arranges individual, spiritual [[Retreat (spiritual)|meditative retreats]] of three to forty days, either in a private retreat hut or cabin, or a room in the Meditation Hall. A certified retreat guide meets at least once daily with the retreatant to suggest the day's schedule of practices and to offer feedback on the retreatant's experience.&lt;ref name="Whilden2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuller1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeliefNet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virtanen2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abode_retreats"/&gt;

The Inayati Order ''Secretariat'' is the headquarters for The Inayati Order, which founded the Abode of the Message. ''Suluk Academy'' is a school of esoteric studies that holds classes at the Abode as part of a program of two-year courses of intensive study, training and practice in the Sufi path. The ''Abode Farm'' includes {{convert|5|acre|km2|2}} of organic vegetable gardens with 35 landscaped beds, a greenhouse, and flower and herb gardens.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt;
&lt;!-- The following paragraph lists 'minor' activities, most of which are presented in the External Links section with descriptions there, so I'm commenting it out to see how that works out. --MouseRancher 2008-08-28
The ''Abode Sufi Center'' is the local centre of the Sufi Order's Esoteric School activity, and offers Message Classes in the teachings of [[Hazrat Inayat Khan]] and leads regular [[Dhikr|Zikr]]. A ''[[Universal Worship Service]]'' is held in the Meditation Hall every Sunday morning.&lt;ref name="Kuller1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virtanen2008"/&gt; The ''Sufi Healing Order'' maintains its central office at the Abode. ''Omega Publications'' publishes and distributes books associated with the Sufi Order, Sufi path and other sacred paths. The ''Abode Healing Arts Center'' is a group of independent practitioners who offer a wide range of healing modalities to meet individual needs using modern and ancient healing and bodywork techniques. ''Sacred Spirit Music'' publishes and distributes sacred music and spiritual teachings, emphasizing but not limited to the Sufi tradition. The ''Flying Deer Nature Center'' operates a summer camp on the Abode grounds.&lt;ref name="Whilden2004"/&gt; The ''Mountain Road School'' is a private primary school that was first established to teach the children of Abode residents,&lt;ref name="Sutton2003"/&gt; but is now an independent school that leases its space on the Main Campus. --&gt;

Some additional activities based at the Abode are listed below under [[#External_links|''External links'']].

==Facilities==
The Abode occupies approximately {{convert|320|acre|km2|1}} of forest that spans the border between New York State and Massachusetts. Most of its shared community facilities are grouped within two areas, the Main Campus and the Mountain Conference Center.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2010"/&gt;

===Main Campus===
[[File:Abode-main-campus-meditation-hall.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Photo of a wooden building with a winged heart logo over the door.|Meditation Hall on the Main Campus, a replica of a Shaker-style apple barn.]]The Main Campus is a cluster of buildings at the south end of Darrow Road, most of which are the original South Family structures of the Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, demonstrating "preservation through use."&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt; Many of the buildings are named for spiritual qualities that Sufis value, drawn from the [[Names of God in Islam|99 Names of God in Islam]]. ''Rezak'' was the South Family's main communal building and now contains the library and community dining room. ''Vakil'' houses the Abode Programs Office, and served as the Shaker [[Caning (furniture)|chair-caning]] shop. ''Mughni'' is the former Shaker trustees building.  ''Fatah'' (the 1867 Shaker women's workhouse) holds men's and women's dorms. Recently renovated, the ''Shaker Barn'' was built in 1850 as a horse barn, but now hosts offices and art studios. The ''Meditation Hall'' was built in 1975 by Abode community members, and is used as a sacred space used for public events. Three personal retreat huts are located in the ''Retreat Hut Field'' on the hill behind the Meditation Hall, and several retreat huts and cabins are situated beside a stream south of the Shaker Barn.&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulloch2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abode_retreats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newman1989"/&gt;

===Mountain Camp===
[[File:Abode-mtn-camp-main-tent.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Photo of a large white tent on a wooden platform with stairs leading up to it.|Main Tent, at the Mountain Conference Center.]]The ''Mountain Camp'' hosts large group events for the Abode and The Inayati Order as well as being available as a woodland [[Conference centre|conference center]].&lt;ref name="Tulloch2009"/&gt; The Mountain Camp comprises dining pavilions and meeting spaces, along with shared bathroom and shower facilities for those staying on the mountain overnight. Meals are prepared in the distinctive octagonal ''Kitchen'' building. Housing on the mountain is provided by two shared cabins that hold a total of twenty two-person rooms, sixteen private huts that are simple, rustic retreat huts without electricity, and extensive space for tenting along the mountain's walking paths.

A '''truth claim''' is a proposition or statement that a particular person or [[belief system]] holds to be true. The term is commonly used in philosophy in discussions of [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]], particularly when discussing the [[Doctrine|doctrinal]] statements of religions; however, it is also used when discussing non-religious [[Ideology|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=people of every religion, as well as of no religion, have a reason for wanting it to be possible to face other people with challenges to their faith, namely that this is the only way those people can be brought to see the truth.|author1=Michael Herz|author2=Peter Molnar|title=The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC0gAwAAQBAJ|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-37561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Positive and negative ===
A major division of truth claims is that between positive and negative truth claims. Positive truth claims proclaim the existence of an object or [[entity]]. Negative truth claims, which are the opposite of truth claims, proclaim the non-existence of an object or [[entity]].

== Religions ==
{{anchor|In religion}}
Some religions make strong [[Absolute truth|absolutist]] truth claims about the [[Laws of science|laws of nature]] and [[human nature]] while others make [[Relativism|relativist]] or [[Universalism|universalist]] truth claims.

===Hinduism===
{{anchor|Hindu}}
In the post-modern period Hinduism is generally known to be Universalist and accepts
all other religions to be true and valid. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] is credited to be the original proponent. However, this seems to be true from a socio-political perspective, since Hinduism itself is a congregation of large numbers of individual sects and peoples that have long lived in harmony among themselves without persecuting each other. But if one goes into what is in the scriptures of
more organised Hindu sects like Vedanta; we do find exclusive truth claims.

Bhagavad Gita says -

''ye me matamidaM nityamanutishhThanti maanavaaH .&lt;br /&gt;''
''shraddhaavanto.anasuuyanto muchyante te.api karmabhiH .. 3.31''

Those who continuously practice what I preach they will be freed from Karma.

''ye tvetadabhyasuuyanto naanutishhThanti me matam.h .&lt;br /&gt;''
''sarvaGYaanavimuuDhaa.nstaanviddhi nashhTaanachetasaH .. 3.32''

But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them regularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to ignorance and bondage.

A Hindu is expected to examine a truth claim based on his intellect. He can add or improve upon the vast ocean of Hindu philosophy. This is unlike religions such as [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], where, because of the truth claim is endowed as infallible, a contradiction of single verse is a contradiction of the entire claim.

Traditionally Hinduism (more specifically Vedanta) considers itself to be eternal religion (Sanatana Dharma).  Fundamental belief is that all beings are divine, that the human condition is one of ignorance to not recognize this divinity inside, and that direct experience of God is achievable for all human beings.

== Science ==
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
It has been debated as to whether science makes any truth claims of its own, or if it is a set of [[Scientific method|methods]] for evaluating or [[Falsifiability|falsifying]] other truth claims.

=== Agnosticism ===
Agnosticism makes the claim that the existence or non-existence of any deity is unknown and possibly unknowable.  This is a claim about what we can or do know, not a metaphysical claim as to the nature of the world.

===Atheism===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
The truth claims of atheism are divided between negative atheism, which does not accept the positive truth claims of religions, and positive atheism, which specifically claims the non-existence of deities (and other spiritual phenomena).
