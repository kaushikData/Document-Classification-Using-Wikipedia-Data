'''''A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity''''' is a 2006 book by [[Manuel DeLanda]].&lt;ref name="Karaman"&gt;Karaman, Ozar: "Book Review" in ''Antipode'', November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The book is an attempt to loosely define a new [[ontology]] for use by [[social theory|social theorists]] — one that challenges the existing [[paradigm]] of meaningful social analyses being possible only on the level of either individuals (micro-reductionism) or "society as a whole" (macro-reductionism). Instead, the book employs [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s [[Assemblage theory|theory of assemblages]] from ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) to posit social entities on all scales (from sub-individual to transnational) that are best analysed through their components (themselves assemblages).

==Main ideas==
Components are characterized along two primary axes/dimensions: a material-expressive axis which defines the variable roles a component may play, and a [[Reterritorialization|territorializing]]-[[Deterritorialization|deterritorializing]] axis indicating processes in which a component is involved. These components are defined by relations of [[exteriority]], that is, their "role" within a larger assemblage is not what defines them (this would be a relation of interiority). This means that a component is self-subsistent and may be "unplugged" from one assemblage and "plugged" into another without losing its identity. A third axis defines processes in which specialized expressive media (genetic/linguistic resources) intervene in "coding"/"decoding" the assemblage.

According to DeLanda, following Deleuze's ideas of [[difference and repetition]] (what DeLanda calls "variable repetition"), assemblages necessarily exist in [[heterogeneous]] populations. The relationship between an assemblage and its components is complex and [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]]: assemblages are formed and affected by heterogeneous populations of lower-level assemblages, but may also act back upon these components, imposing restraints or adaptations in them.

DeLanda merges Deleuze's ideas of both assemblages and strata into his model of assemblages, regarding the distinction as inconsequential in the context of ''A New Philosophy of Society''. He does however maintain the idea of assemblages as non-essentialist (they are historically contingent actual entities, not instances of ideal forms) and non-totalizing (assemblages are not seamless totalities but collections of heterogeneous components that should be analysed as such).

==Examples==
As an example of an assemblage (as defined by DeLanda) consider an ecosystem:

* The material role here is performed by the soil, sunlight, trees, animals, etc.
* The expressive role is performed by the forms, colours, habits, etc. of the aforementioned components.
* The territorializing role would be played by factors such as [[food chains]], [[adaptive traits]], conducive climate and other elements that maintain the components and their relationships and thus the identity and durability of the assemblage.
* The deterritorializing role would be played by such factors as [[climate change]], [[invasion]] by exotic species, evolutionary [[mutation]] and other elements that recombine or replace various components and roles within the assemblage, leading to its dissipation or reformulation.
* A linguistic/coding role could be played by an environmental discourse seeking to protect an [[ecosystem]].

Consistent with DeLanda's [[materialist]] position, the book also includes as a secondary task a sustained criticism of the primacy of post-modernist linguistic analysis in [[social science]] (the theory of the linguistics of experience).

'''Climate resilience''' can be generally defined as the capacity for a [[socio-ecological system]] to: (1) absorb stresses and maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it by [[climate change]] and (2) adapt, reorganize, and evolve into more desirable configurations that improve the [[sustainability]] of the system, leaving it better prepared for future climate change impacts.

With the rising awareness of climate change impacts by both national and international bodies, building climate resilience has become a major goal for these institutions. The key focus of climate resilience efforts is to address the vulnerability that communities, states, and countries currently have with regards to the environmental consequences of climate change. Currently, climate resilience efforts encompass social, economic, technological, and political strategies that are being implemented at all scales of society. From local community action to global treaties, addressing climate resilience is becoming a priority, although it could be argued that a significant amount of the theory has yet to be translated into practice. Despite this, there is a robust and ever-growing movement fueled by local  and national bodies alike geared towards building and improving climate resilience.

== Introduction==

=== Definition of climate resilience===
In actuality, there is still a great deal of abstract discussion and debate regarding a number of subtle nuances associated with the precise definition of the climate resilience perspective, such as its relation to [[climate change adaptation]], the extent to which it should encompass actor-based versus systems-based approaches to improving stability, and its relationship with the [[balance of nature]] theory or [[homeostatic]] equilibrium view of ecological systems. 
&lt;ref name="folke"/&gt;
Currently, the majority of work regarding climate resilience has been centered around examining the capacity for social-ecological systems to sustain shocks and maintain the integrity of functional relationships in the face of external forces. However, there is a growing consensus in academic literature which argues that greater attention needs to be focused on investigating the other critical aspect of climate resilience, which is the capacity for social-ecological systems to renew and develop, and to utilize disturbances as opportunities for innovation and evolution of new pathways that improve the system’s ability to adapt to macroscopic changes.
&lt;ref name="folke"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="tomkins"&gt;Tompkins, Emma L., and W. Neil Adger. 2004. "Does Adaptive Management of Natural Resources Enhance Resilience to Climate Change?" Ecology &amp; Society. http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/202863/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|last2=Yamagata|first2=Yoshiki|title=Principles and criteria for assessing urban energy resilience: A literature review|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=July 2016|volume=60|pages=1654–1677|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.03.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|title=A critical review of selected tools for assessing community resilience|journal=Ecological Indicators|date=October 2016|volume=69|pages=629–647|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate resilience vs. climate adaptation===

The fact that climate resilience encompasses a dual function, to absorb shock as well as to self-renew, is the primary means by which it can be differentiated from the concept of climate adaptation. In general, [[adaptation]] is viewed as a group of processes and actions that help a system absorb changes that have already occurred, or may be predicted to occur in the future. For the specific case of environmental change and climate adaptation, it is argued by many that adaptation should be defined strictly as encompassing only active decision-making processes and actions - in other words, deliberate changes made in response to climate change.
&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
Of course, this characterization is highly debatable: after all, adaptation can also be used to describe natural, involuntary processes by which [[organisms]], [[populations]], [[ecosystems]] and perhaps even social-ecological systems evolve after the application of certain external stresses. However, for the purposes of differentiating climate adaptation and climate resilience from a policymaking standpoint, we can contrast the active, actor-centric notion of adaptation with resilience, which would be a more systems-based approach to building social-ecological networks that are inherently capable of not only absorbing change, but utilizing those changes to develop into more efficient configurations.

===Inter-connectivity between climate resilience, climate change, adaptability, and vulnerability===
[[File:Climate Resilience Model.PNG|thumb|A graphic displaying the inter-connectivity between climate change, adaptability, vulnerability, and resilience.]]
A conversation about climate resilience is incomplete without also incorporating the concepts of adaptations, vulnerability, and [[global warming|climate change]]. If the definition of resiliency is the ability to recover from a negative event, in this case climate change, then talking about preparations beforehand and strategies for recovery (aka adaptations), as well as populations that are more less capable of developing and implementing a resiliency strategy (aka vulnerable populations) are essential. This is framed under the assumed detrimental impacts of climate change to ecosystems and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;Smit, Barry, and Johanna Wandel. "Adaptation, adaptive capacity and vulnerability." Global environmental change 16.3 (2006): 282-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical overview of climate resilience===

Climate resilience is a relatively novel concept that is still in the process of being established by academia and policymaking institutions. However, the theoretical basis for many of the ideas central to climate resilience have actually existed since the 1960s. Originally an idea defined for strictly ecological systems, [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] was initially outlined by C.S. Holling as the capacity for ecological systems and relationships within those systems to persist and absorb changes to “state variables, driving variables, and parameters.”
&lt;ref name="holling"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holling | first1 = CS | year = 1973| title = Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition helped form the foundation for the notion of ecological [[Island biogeography|equilibrium]]: the idea that the behavior of natural ecosystems is dictated by a homeostatic drive towards some stable set point. Under this school of thought (which maintained quite a dominant status during this time period), ecosystems were perceived to respond to disturbances largely through [[negative feedback]] systems – if there is a change, the ecosystem would act to mitigate that change as much as possible and attempt to return to its prior state. However, the idea of resilience began evolving relatively quickly in the coming years.

As greater amounts of scientific research in ecological adaptation and natural resource management was conducted, it became clear that oftentimes, natural systems were subjected to dynamic, transient behaviors that changed how they reacted to significant changes in state variables: rather than work back towards a predetermined equilibrium, the absorbed change was harnessed to establish a new baseline to operate under.  Rather than minimizes imposed changes, ecosystems could integrate and manage those changes, and use them fuel the evolution of novel characteristics. This new perspective of resilience as a concept that inherently works synergistically with elements of [[uncertainty]] and [[entropy]] first began to facilitate changes in the field of [[adaptive management]] and environmental resources, through work whose basis was built by Holling and colleagues yet again.
&lt;ref name="folke" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="schoon"&gt;Schoon, M. (2005, 2 21). A short historical overview of the concepts of resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation . Retrieved from http://michaelschoon.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/historical_critique-of-resilience-working-paper.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1970s, resilience began gaining momentum as an idea in [[anthropology]], [[culture theory]], and other [[social sciences]]. Even more compelling is the fact that there was significant work in these relatively non-traditional fields that helped facilitate the evolution of the resilience perspective as a whole. Part of the reason resilience began moving away from an equilibrium-centric view and towards a more flexible, malleable description of social-ecological systems was due to work such as that of Andrew Vayda and [[Bonnie McCay]] in the field of social anthropology, where more modern versions of resilience were deployed to challenge traditional ideals of cultural dynamics.
&lt;ref name="vayda"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vayda | first1 = Andrew P. | authorlink2 = Bonnie McCay | last2 = McCay | first2 = Bonnie J. | year = 1975 | title = New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 293–306 | doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually by the late 1980s and early 1990s, resilience had fundamentally changed as a theoretical framework. Not only was it now applicable to social-ecological systems, but more importantly, resilience now incorporated and emphasized ideas of management, integration, and utilization of change rather than simply describing reactions to change. Resilience was no longer just about absorbing shocks, but also about harnessing the changes triggered by external stresses to catalyze the evolution the social-ecological system in question.

As the issues of [[global warming]] and climate change have gained traction and become more prominent since the early 1990s, the question of climate resilience has also emerged. Considering the global implications of the impacts induced by climate change, climate resilience has become a critical concept that scientific institutions, policymakers, governments, and international organizations have begun to rally around as a framework for designing the solutions that will be needed to address the [[effects of global warming]].

==Climate resilience and environmental justice==

=== Applications of a resilience framework: addressing vulnerability===

A climate resilience framework offers a rich plethora of contributions that can improve our understanding of environmental processes, and better equip governments and policymakers to develop sustainable solutions that combat the effects of climate change. To begin with, climate resilience establishes the idea of multi-stable socio-ecological systems. As discussed earlier, resilience originally began as an idea that extended from the stable equilibrium view – systems only acted to return to their pre-existing states when exposed to a disturbance. But with modern interpretations of resilience, it is now established that socio-ecological systems can actually stabilize around a multitude of possible states. Secondly, climate resilience has played a critical role in emphasizing the importance of [[preventive action]] when assessing the effects of climate change. Although adaptation is always going to be a key consideration, making changes after the fact has a limited capability to help communities and nations deal with climate change. By working to build climate resilience, policymakers and governments can take a more comprehensive stance that works to mitigate the harms of global warming impacts before they happen.&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
&lt;ref name="tschakert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tschakert | first1 = P | last2 = Dietrich | first2 = K A | year = 2010 | title = Anticipatory Learning for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience | url = | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 15 | issue = | page = 11 | doi=10.5751/es-03335-150211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, a climate resilience perspective encourages greater cross-scale connectedness of systems. Climate change scholars have argued that solely relying on theories of adaptation is also limiting because inherently, this perspective does not necessitate as much full-system cohesion as a resilience perspective would. Creating mechanisms of adaptation that occur in isolation at local, state, or national levels may leave the overall social-ecological system vulnerable. A resilience-based framework would require far more cross-talk, and the creation of environmental protections that are more holistically generated and implemented.
&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="malhi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malhi | first1 = Yadvinder | last2 = Roberts | first2 = J Timmons | last3 = Betts | first3 = Richard A | last4 = Killeen | first4 = Timothy J | last5 = Li | first5 = Wenhong | last6 = Nobre | first6 = Carlos A | year = 2008 | title = Climate Change, Deforestation, and the Fate of the Amazon | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5860/169.abstract | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5860| pages = 169–72 | doi=10.1126/science.1146961| bibcode = 2008Sci...319..169M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability=== 
Negative impacts of climate change are those that are least capable of developing robust and comprehensive climate resiliency infrastructure and response systems. However what exactly constitutes a vulnerable community is still open to debate. 
The International Panel on Climate Change has defined vulnerability using three characteristics: the “adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure” to the effects of climate change.  The adaptive capacity refers to a community’s capacity to create resiliency infrastructure, while the sensitivity and exposure elements are both tied to economic and geographic elements that vary widely in differing communities. There are, however, many commonalities between vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. McCarthy, O.F. Canziani, N.A. Leary, D.J. Dokken, K.S. White (Eds.), Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability can mainly be broken down into 2 major categories, economic vulnerability, based on [[socioeconomic]] factors, and geographic vulnerability. Neither are mutually exclusive.

====Economic vulnerability====

[[File:GNI PPP Per Capita.png|thumb|World gross national income per capita.]]

At its basic level, a community that is economically vulnerable is one that is ill-prepared for the effects of climate change because it lacks the needed financial resources. Preparing a climate resilient society will require huge investments in infrastructure, city planning, engineering sustainable energy sources, and preparedness systems. From a global perspective, it is more likely that people living at or below poverty will be affected the most by climate change and are thus the most vulnerable, because they will have the least amount of resource dollars to invest in resiliency infrastructure.   They will also have the least amount of resource dollars for cleanup efforts after more frequently occurring natural climate change related disasters.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Collier et al. "Transitioning to resilience and sustainability in urban communities" Cities 2013. 32:21–S28&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geographic vulnerability====
A second definition of vulnerability relates to geographic vulnerability. The most geographically vulnerable locations to climate change are those that will be impacted by side effects of natural hazards, such as rising sea levels and by dramatic changes in ecosystem services, including access to food.  Island nations are usually noted as more vulnerable but communities that rely heavily on a sustenance based lifestyle are also at greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hewitt (Ed.), Interpretations of Calamity for the Viewpoint of Human Ecology, Allen and Unwin, Boston (1983), pp. 231–262&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasperson of the Stockholm Environmental Institute compiled a list of vulnerable communities as having one or more of these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Kasperson, Roger E., and Jeanne X. Kasperson.

*food insecure 
*water scarce

===Vulnerability and equity:  environmental justice and climate justice===
Equity is another essential component of vulnerability and is closely tied to issues of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]].   Who participates in and who has access to climate resiliency services and infrastructure are more than likely going to fall along historically unequitable patterns of distribution.  As the most vulnerable communities are likely to be the most heavily impacted, a [[climate justice]] movement is coalescing in response. There are many aspects of climate justice that relate to resiliency and many climate justice advocates argue that justice should be an essential component of resiliency strategies.  
Similar frameworks that have been applied to the [[Climate Justice]] movement can be utilized to address some of these equity issues.  The frameworks are similar to other types of justice movements and include- contractariansim which attempts to allocate the most benefits for the poor, utilitarianism which seeks to find the most benefits for the most people, egalitarianism which attempts to reduce inequality, and libertarianism which emphasizes a fair share of burden but also individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, F. (2000). Environmental justice analysis: Theories, methods and practice. Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act for Climate Justice Campaign [http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/] has defined climate justice as “a vision to dissolve and alleviate the unequal burdens created by climate change. As a form of environmental justice, climate justice is the fair treatment of all people and freedom from discrimination with the creation of policies and projects that address climate change and the systems that create climate change and perpetuate discrimination”.&lt;ref&gt;Act for Climate Justice. (February 2014)  What Is Climate Justice.  Retrieved from http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Justice can incorporate both grassroots as well as international and national level organizing movements.

====Local level issues of equity====
Many indigenous peoples live sustenance based lifestyles, relying heavily on local ecosystem services for their livelihoods. According to some definitions, indigenous peoples are often some of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and advocating for participation of marginalized groups is one goal of the indigenous people’s climate justice movement. Climate change will likely dramatically alter local food production capacity, which will impact those people who are more dependent on local food sources and less dependent on global or regional food supplies. The greatest injustice is that people living this type of lifestyle are least likely to have contributed to the causes of global climate change in the first place.  Indigenous peoples movements often involve protests and calling on action from world leaders to address climate change concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Chwala, A. Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength. Climate Connections. State of the World. (2009). 119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Another local level climate justice movement is the adaptation finance approach  which has been found in some studies to be a positive solution by providing resource dollars directly to communities in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = Sam | year = 2013 | title = Local Level Climate Justice? Adaptation Finance and Vulnerability Reduction | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 1819–29 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International and national climate justice ====
The [[carbon market]] approach is one international and national concept proposed that tries to solve the issue by using market forces to make carbon use less affordable, but vulnerable host communities that are the intended beneficiaries have been found to receive little to no benefit.&lt;ref name="Mather"&gt;Mathur, Vivek N., et al. "Experiences of Host Communities with Carbon Market Projects: Towards Multi-Level Climate Justice." Climate Policy 14.1 (2014): 42-62. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  One problem noted with the carbon market approach is the inherent conflict of interest embedded between developed and sustenance based communities.  Developed nations that have often prioritized growth of their own [[gross national product]] over implementing changes that would address climate change concerns by taxing carbon which might damage GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Towers | first1 = G | year = 2000 | title = Applying the political geography of scale: Grassroots strategies and environmental justice | url = | journal = Professional Geographer | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 23–36 | doi=10.1111/0033-0124.00202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the pace of change necessary to implement a carbon market approach is too slow to be effective at most international and national policy levels.&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;

Alternatively, a study by V.N Mather, et al. proposes a multi-level approach that focuses on addressing some primary issues concerning climate justice at local and international levels.  The approach includes:&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;
*developing the capacity for a carbon market approach
*focusing on power dynamics within local and regional government
*managing businesses in regard to carbon practices
*special attention given to developing countries

====Climate justice, environmental justice, and the United States====

The issue of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]] is relevant within the United States because historically communities of color and low socioeconomic communities have been under served and underrepresented in terms of distribution and participation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dorceta E. "Women of color, environmental justice, and ecofeminism."Ecofeminism: Women, culture, nature (1997): 38-81&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of “by and for whom” resiliency strategies are targeted and implemented is of great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friend | first1 = R. | last2 = Moench | first2 = M. | year = 2013 | title = What is the purpose of urban climate resilience?

[[File:New Orleans USACE-17th Canal-A-09-04-05 0004.JPG|thumb|New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina levee damage.]]

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People[[NAACP]] has recently begun a Climate Justice campaign&lt;ref name=NAACP&gt;[http://www.naacp.org/programs/entry/climate-justice Climate Justice: NAACP]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to  events such as Hurricane Katrina and in preparation for future climate change related natural disasters.  The goal of this campaign is to address the 3 R’s of climate justice: resilience, resistance, and revisioning.   The NAACP’s climate justice initiative will address climate resilience through advocacy, outreach, political actions, research and education.&lt;ref name=NAACP/&gt;

=====Climate gap=====

Another concept important for understanding vulnerability in the United States is the [[climate gap]].  The climate gap is the inequitably negative impact on poor people and people of color due to the effects of climate change. Some of these negative impacts include higher cost of living expenses, higher incidences of heat related health consequences in urban areas that are likely to experience [[urban heat island]] effects, increased pollution in urban areas, and decreases in available jobs for poor people and people of color.  Some suggested solutions to close the climate gap include suggesting legislative policies that would reduce the impact of climate change by reducing [[carbon emissions]] with the emphasis of reductions in [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and toxic [[air pollution]] in neighborhoods that are already heavily impacted, usually urban centers.  Other solutions include increasing access to quality health care for poor people and people of color, preparedness planning for urban heat island effects, identifying neighborhoods that are most likely to be impacted, investing in alternative fuel and energy research, and measuring the results of policy impacts.&lt;ref name= "Schonkoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shonkoff | first1 = Seth B. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = The climate gap: environmental health and equity implications of climate change and mitigation policies in California—a review of the literature | url = http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 109 | issue = 1| pages = 485–503 | doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical foundations for building climate resilience==
As the threat of environmental disturbances due to [[climate change]] becomes more and more relevant, so does the need for strategies to build a more resilient society. As climate resiliency literature has revealed, there are different strategies and suggestions that all work towards the overarching goal of building and maintaining societal resiliency.

===Urban resilience===
There is increasing concern on an international level with regards to addressing and combating the impending implications of [[climate change]] for urban areas, where populations of these cities around the world are growing disproportionately high. There is even more concern for the rapidly growing urban centers in developing countries, where the majority of urban inhabitants are poor or “otherwise vulnerable to climate-related disturbances.”&lt;ref name=Moench&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moench | first1 = Marcus | last2 = Tyler | first2 = Stephen | year = 2012 | title = A Framework for Urban Climate Resilience | url = | journal = Climate and Development | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban centers around the world house important societal and economic sectors, so resiliency framework has been augmented to specifically include and focus on protecting these urban systems.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) defines resilience as “the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity of self-organization, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  One of the most important notions emphasized in urban resiliency theory is the need for urban systems to increase their capacity to absorb environmental disturbances. By focusing on three generalizable elements of the resiliency movement, Tyler and Moench’s urban resiliency framework serves as a model that can be implemented for local planning on an international scale.

The first element of urban climate resiliency focuses on “systems’ or the physical infrastructure embedded in urban systems. A critical concern of urban resiliency is linked to the idea of maintaining support systems that in turn enable the networks of provisioning and exchange for populations in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  These systems concern both physical infrastructure in the city and ecosystems within or surrounding the urban center; while working to provide essential services like food production, flood control, or runoff management.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  For example, city electricity, a necessity of urban life, depends on the performance of generators, grids, and distant reservoirs. The failure of these core systems jeopardizes human well-being in these urban areas, with that being said, it is crucial to maintain them in the face of impending environmental disturbances. Societies need to build resiliency into these systems in order to achieve such a feat. Resilient systems work to “ensure that functionality is retained and can be re-instated through system linkages”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt; despite some failures or operational disturbances. Ensuring the functionality of these important systems is achieved through instilling and maintaining flexibility in the presence of a “safe failure.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Resilient systems achieve flexibility by making sure that key functions are distributed in a way that they would not all be affected by a given event at one time, what is often referred to as spatial diversity, and has multiple methods for meeting a given need, what is often referred to as functional diversity.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  The presence of safe failures also plays a critical role in maintaining these systems, which work by absorbing sudden shocks that may even exceed design thresholds.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Environmental disturbances are certainly expected to challenge the dexterity of these systems, so the presence of safe failures almost certainly appears to be a necessity.

Further, another important component of these systems is bounce-back ability. In the instance where dangerous climatic events affect these urban centers, recovering or "bouncing-back" is of great importance. In fact, in most disaster studies, urban resilience is often defined as "the capacity of a city to rebound from destruction." This idea of bounce-back for urban systems is also engrained in governmental literature of the same topic. For example, the former government's first Intelligence and Security Coordinator of the United States described urban resilience as "the capacity to absorb shocks and to bounce back into functioning shape, or at the least, sufficient resilience to prevent...system collapse." Keeping these quotations in mind, bounce-back discourse has been and should continue to be an important part of urban climate resiliency framework.&lt;ref&gt;Coaffee, Jon. "Towards Next-Generation Urban Resilience in Planning Practice: From Securitization to Integrated Place Making." Planning Practice and Research 28:3. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists have critiqued this idea of bounce-back, citing this as privileging the status quo, rather advocating the notion of ‘bouncing forward’, permitting system evolution and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the ‘business as usual’ paradox|url = http://epc.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/09/01/0263774X15602022|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 0263-774X|pages = 0263774X15602022|doi = 10.1177/0263774X15602022|language = en|first = Paul|last = O'Hare|first2 = Iain|last2 = White|first3 = Angela|last3 = Connelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next element of urban climate resiliency focuses on the social agents (also described as social actors) present in urban centers. Many of these agents depend on the urban centers for their very existence, so they share a common interest of working towards protecting and maintaining their urban surroundings.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Agents in urban centers have the capacity to deliberate and rationally make decisions, which plays an important role in climate resiliency theory. One cannot overlook the role of local governments and community organizations, which will be forced to make key decisions with regards to organizing and delivering key services and plans for combating the impending effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Perhaps most importantly, these social agents must increase their capacities with regards to the notions of “resourcefulness and responsiveness.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Responsiveness refers to the capacity of social actors and groups to organize and re-organize, as well as the ability to anticipate and plan for disruptive events. Resourcefulness refers to the capacity of social actors in urban centers to mobilize varying assets and resources in order to take action.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Urban centers will be able to better fend for themselves in the heat of climatic disturbances when responsiveness and resourcefulness is collectively achieved in an effective manner.

The final component of urban climate resiliency concerns the social and political institutions present in urban environments. Governance, the process of decision making, is a critical element affecting climate resiliency. As climate justice has revealed, the individual areas and countries that are least responsible for the phenomenon of climate change are also the ones who are going to be most negatively affected by future environmental disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Timmons | year = 2009 | title = The International Dimension of Climate Justice and the Need for International Adaptation Funding | url = | journal = Environmental Justice | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true in urban centers. Those who are most responsible for climate change are going to disproportionately feel the negative effects of climatic disturbances when compared to their poorer, more vulnerable counterparts in society. Just like the wealthier countries have worked to create the most pollution, the wealthier subpopulations of society who can afford carbon-emitting luxuries like cars and homes undoubtedly produce a much more significant carbon footprint. It is also important to note that these more vulnerable populations, because of their inferior social statuses, are unable to participate in the decision-making processes with regards to these issues. Decision-making processes must be augmented to be more participatory and inclusive, allowing those individuals and groups most affected by environmental disturbances to play an active role in determining how to best avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lebel | first1 = L. | last2 = Anderies | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Campbell | first3 = B. | last4 = Folke | first4 = C. | last5 = Hatfield-Dodds | first5 = S. | last6 = Hughes | first6 = T.

Individual communities who have access to timely information with regards to hazards are better able to respond to these threats.&lt;ref&gt;Satterthwaite, D., Huq, S., Pelling, M., Reid, H., &amp; Lankao, P.R. (2007). Adapting to Climate Change in Urban Areas: The Possibilities and Constraints in Low- and Middle-Income Nations. International Institute for Environment and Development, Discussion Paper&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human resilience===
Global climate change is going to increase the probability of extreme weather events and environmental disturbances around the world, needless to say, future human populations are going to have to confront this issue. Every society around the world differs in its capacity with regards to combating climate change because of certain pre-existing factors such as having the proper monetary and institutional mechanisms in place to execute preparedness and recovery plans. Despite these differences, communities around the world are on a level-playing field with regards to building and maintaining at least some degree “human resilience”.&lt;ref name=Keim&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keim | first1 = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Building Human Resilience: The Role of Public Health Preparedness and Response As an Adaptation to Climate Change | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.022 | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages=508–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resilience has two components: that provided by nature, and that provided through human action and interaction. An example of climate resilience provided by nature is the manner in which porous soil more effectively allows for the drainage of flood water than more compact soil. An example of human action that affects climate resilience would be the facilitation of response and recovery procedures by social institutions or organizations. This theory of human resilience largely focuses on the human populations and calls for building towards the overall goal of decreasing human vulnerability in the face of climate change and extreme weather events. Vulnerability to climatic disturbances has two sides: the first deals with the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards, which one can effectively identify as susceptibility. The second side deals with the capacity to recover from disaster consequences, or resilience in other words.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The looming threat of environmental disturbances and extreme weather events certainly calls for some action, and human resiliency theory seeks to solve the issue by largely focusing on decreasing the vulnerability of human populations.

How do human populations work to decrease their vulnerability to impending and dangerous climatic events? Up until recently, the international approach to environmental emergencies focused largely on post-impact activities such as reconstruction and recovery.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  However, the international approach is changing to a more comprehensive risk assessment that includes “pre-impact disaster risk reduction - prevention, preparedness, and mitigation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodruff | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Climate Change and Human Health: Review of the Evidence | url = | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health | volume = 30 | issue = | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of human resiliency, preparedness can largely be defined as the measures taken in advance to ensure an effective response to the impact of environmental hazards.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  Mitigation, when viewed in this context, refers to the structural and nonstructural measures undertaken to limit the adverse impacts of climatic disturbances.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  This is not to be confused to mitigation with regards to the overall topic of climate change, which refers to reduction of carbon or greenhouse emissions. By accounting for these impending climate disasters both before and after the occur, human populations are able to decrease their vulnerability to these disturbances.

A major element of building and maintaining human resilience is public health.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The institution of public health as a whole is uniquely placed at the community level to foster human resilience to climate-related disturbances. As an institution, public health can play an active part in reducing human vulnerability by promoting “healthy people and healthy homes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Srinivasan | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Creating Healthy Communities, Healthy Homes, Healthy People: Initiating a Research Agenda on the Built Environment and Public Health | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = | year = 2003 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.9.1446 | pages=1446–1450| pmc = 1447991}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Healthy people are less likely to suffer from disaster-related mortality and are therefore viewed as more disaster-resilient. Healthy homes are designed and built to maintain its structure and withstand extreme climate events. By merely focusing on the individual health of populations and assuring the durability of the homes that house these populations, at least some degree human resiliency towards climate change can be achieved.

==Climate resilience in practice==
The building of climate resilience is a highly comprehensive undertaking that involves of an eclectic array of actors and agents: individuals, [[community organizations]], micropolitical bodies, [[corporations]], [[governments]] at local, state, and national levels as well as [[international organizations]]. In essence, actions that bolster climate resilience are ones that will enhance the adaptive capacity of social, industrial, and environmental infrastructures that can mitigate the effects of climate change.
&lt;ref name="adger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adger | first1 = W. N. | last2 = Arnell | first2 = N. W. | last3 = Tompkins | first3 = E. L. | year = 2005 | title = Successful adaptation to climate change across scales | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume =  15| issue = | pages =  77–86| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, research indicates that the strongest indicator of successful climate resilience efforts at all scales is a well-developed, pre-existing network of social, political, economic and financial institutions that is already positioned to effectively take on the work of identifying and addressing the risks posed by climate change. Cities, states, and nations that have already developed such networks are, as expected, to generally have far higher net incomes and GDP. 
&lt;ref name="sather"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Satterthwaite | first1 = D | year = 2013 | title = The political underpinnings of cities' accumulated resilience to climate change | url = | journal = Environment and Urbanization | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 381–391 | doi = 10.1177/0956247813500902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it can be seen that embedded within the task of building climate resilience at any scale will be the overcoming of macroscopic [[socioeconomic]] inequities: in many ways, truly facilitating the construction of climate resilient communities worldwide will require national and international agencies to address issues of global [[poverty]], [[industrial development]], and [[food justice]]. However, this does not mean that actions to improve climate resilience cannot be taken in real time at all levels, although evidence suggests that the most climate resilient cities and nations have accumulated this resilience through their responses to previous weather-based disasters. Perhaps even more importantly, empirical evidence suggests that the creation of the climate resilient structures is dependent upon an array of social and environmental reforms that were only successfully passed due to the presence of certain sociopolitical structures such as [[democracy]], activist movements, and [[decentralization]] of government.
&lt;ref name="berkhout"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkhout | first1 = Frans | last2 = Hertin | first2 = Julia | last3 = Gann | first3 = David M. | year = 2006 | title = Learning to Adapt: Organisational Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts | url = | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 135–56 | doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Thus it can be seen that to build climate resilience one must work within a network of related social and economic decisions that can have adverse effects on the success of a resilience effort given the competing interests participating in the discussion. Given this, it is clear that the social and economic scale play a vital role in shaping the [[feasibility study|feasibility]], [[cost]]s, empirical success, and [[efficiency]] of climate resilience initiatives. There is a wide variety of actions that can be pursued to improve climate resilience at multiple scales – the following subsections we will review a series of illustrative case studies and strategies from a broad diversity of societal contexts that are currently being implemented to strengthen climate resilience.

===Local and community level===

====Housing and workplace conditions====

[[File:Housing, Kenya 2006. Photo- AusAID (10704025714).jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Improving housing conditions in Kenya is a prime target for local climate resilience efforts]]

[[Housing inequality]] is directly related to the ability for individuals and communities to sustain adverse impacts brought on by extreme weather events that are triggered by climate change, such as severe winds, storms, and flooding. Especially for communities in developing nations and the Third World, the integrity of housing structures is one of the most significant sources of vulnerability currently. 
&lt;ref name="mertz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mertz | first1 = Ole | last2 = Halsnaes | first2 = Kirsten | last3 = Olesen | first3 = Jørgen E | last4 = Rasmussen | first4 = Kjeld | year = 2009 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change in Developing Countries | url = | journal = Environmental management | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 743–52 | doi=10.1007/s00267-008-9259-3| bibcode = 2009EnMan..43..743M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in more developed nations such as the US, there are still multitudes of socioeconomically disadvantaged areas where outdated housing infrastructure is estimated to provide poor climate resilience at best, as well as numerous negative health outcomes.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

Efforts to improve the resiliency of housing and workplace buildings involves not only fortifying these buildings through use of updated materials and foundation, but also establishing better standards that ensure safer and health conditions for occupants. Better housing standards are in the course of being established through calls for sufficient space, natural lighting, provision for heating or cooling, insulation, and ventilation. Another major issue faced more commonly by communities in the [[Third World]] are highly disorganized and inconsistently enforced housing rights systems. In countries such as [[Kenya]] and [[Nicaragua]], local [[militias]] or corrupted government bodies that have reserved the right to seizure of any housing properties as needed: the end result is the degradation of any ability for citizens to develop climate resilient housing – without property rights for their own homes, the people are powerless to make changes to their housing situation without facing potentially harmful consequences.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grassroots community organizing and micropolitical action====

Modern climate resilience scholars have noted that contrary to conventional beliefs, the communities that have been most effective in establishing high levels of climate resilience have actually done so through “bottom-up” political pressures. “Top-down” approaches involving state or federal level decisions have empirically been marred with dysfunction across different levels of government due to internal mismanagement and political gridlock.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="berkhout" /&gt; As a result, in many ways it is being found that the most efficient responses to climate change have actually been initiated and mobilized at local levels. Particularly compelling has been the ability of bottom-up pressures from local civil society to fuel the creation of micropolitical institutions that have compartmentalized the tasks necessary for building climate resilience. For example, the city of [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] has developed a robust network of micropolitical agencies all dedicated to building resilience in specific industrial sectors: [[transportation]], workplace conditions, emergency shelters, and more.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
Due to their compact size, local level micropolitical bodies can act quickly without much stagnation and resistance from larger special interests that can generate bureaucratic dysfunction at higher levels of government.

====Low-cost engineering solutions====
Equally important to building climate resilience has been the wide array of basic technological solutions have been developed and implemented at community levels. In developing countries such as [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]], the construction of [[concrete]] “breaker” walls and concentrated use of sandbags in key areas such as housing entrances and doorways has improved the ability of communities to sustain the damages yielded by extreme weather events. Additional strategies have included digging homemade drainage systems to protect local infrastructure of extensive water damage and flooding.

In more urban areas, construction of a “[[green belt]]” on the peripheries of cities has become increasingly common. Green belts are being used as means of improving climate resilience – in addition to provide natural air filtering, these belts of trees have proven to be a healthier and sustainable means of mitigating the damages created by heavy winds and storms.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oak"&gt;adaptOakland.

===State and national level===
{{Missing information|section=yes|Dominica's new goal to become the world's first climate resilient nation|date=March 2018}}
====Infrastructural development disaster preparedness protocols====

At larger governmental levels, general programs to improve climate resiliency through greater [[disaster]] preparedness are being implemented. For example, in cases such as [[Norway]], this includes the development of more sensitive and far-reaching early warning systems for extreme weather events, creation of emergency [[electricity]] power sources, enhanced public transportation systems, and more.

To examine another case study, the state [[California]] in the US has been pursuing more comprehensive federal financial aid systems for communities afflicted by natural disaster, spurred in part by the large amounts of criticism that was placed on the US federal government after what was perceived by many to be a mishandling of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]] relief.

Additionally, a key focus of action at state and federal levels is in improving water management infrastructure and access. Strategies include the creation of [[emergency]] drinking water supplies, stronger [[sanitation]] technology and standards, as well as more extensive and efficient networks of water delivery.

====Social services====

Climate resilience literature has also noted that one of the more indirect sources of resilience actually lies in the strength of the [[social services]] and [[social safety net]] that is provided for citizens by public institutions. This is an especially critical aspect of climate resilience in more socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, cities, and nations. It has been empirically found that places with stronger systems of [[social security]] and [[pensions]] oftentimes have better climate resiliency.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt; This is reasoning in the following manner: first of all, better social services for citizens translates to better access to [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[life insurance]], and emergency services. Secondly, stronger systems of social services also generally increase the overall ownership of relevant economic assets that are correlated with better quality of life such as savings, house ownership, and more. Nations where residents are on more stable economic footing are in situations where there is a far higher incentive for private investment into climate resilience efforts.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

===Global level===

====International treaties====

At the global level, most action towards climate resilience has been manifested in the signing of international agreements that set up guidelines and frameworks to address the impacts of climate change. Notable examples include the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the UNFCCC, and the 2010 Cancun Agreement.&lt;ref name="unfcc"&gt;
Unfccc. 2007. "Climate Change: Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation in Developing Countries." United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: 68. http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/impacts.pdf.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, as is the case with the Kyoto Protocol for example, these international treaties involve placing legally binding requirements on participant nations to reduce processes that contribute to global warming such as greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prins | first1 = Gwyn | year = 2011 | title = Climate Change: Beyond Kyoto | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 474 | issue = | pages = 576–77 | doi=10.1038/474576a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rabe | first1 = Barry G | year = 2007 | title = Beyond Kyoto: Climate Change Policy in Multilevel Governance Systems | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00365.x | journal = Governance | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 423–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other cases, such as the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Cancun, proposals for the creation of international funding pools to assist developing nations in combating climate change are seen.&lt;ref name="raj"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajamani | first1 = Lavanya | year = 2011 | title = The Cancun Climate Agreements: Reading the Text, Subtext and Tea Leaves | url = | journal = International and Comparative Law Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 499–519 | doi=10.1017/s0020589311000078}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, that enforcement of any of the requirements or principles that are established in such international treaties has ambiguous: for example, although the 2010 Cancun conference called for the creation of a 100 billion dollar “Green Climate Fund” for developing nations, if and how this fund will actually be created still remains unclear.&lt;ref name="ober"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oberthür | first1 = Sebastian | year = 2011 | title = Global Climate Governance after Cancun: Options for EU Leadership | url = | journal = The International Spectator | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 5–13 | doi=10.1080/03932729.2011.567900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case studies===
As the looming threat of [[climate change]] and environmental disturbances becomes more and more immediate, so does the need for policy to combat the issue. As a relatively new phenomenon, climate change has yet to receive the political attention it deserves. However, the climate justice and [[climate change]] movements are gaining momentum on an international scale as both grass roots campaigns and supranational organizations begin to gain influence.&lt;ref&gt;Chawla, Ambika, “Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength,” WorldWatch, State of the World. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the most significant and impacting changes come from national and state governments around the world, as they have the political and monetary power to more effectively enforce their proposals.

====United States (as a country)====
As it stands today, there is no country-wide legislation with regards to the topic of climate resiliency in the United States. However, in mid February 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] announced his plan to propose a $1 billion “Climate Resilience Fund”.&lt;ref name=News&gt;Malakoff, David. "Obama to Propose $1 Billion Climate Resilience Fund." Sciencemag.org. http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/02/obama-propose-1-billion-climate-resilience-fund. 15, February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The details of exactly what the fund will seek to accomplish are vague since the fund is only in the stage of being proposed for Congress’s approval in 2015. However, in the speech given the day of the announcement of this proposal, Obama claimed he will request “...new funding for new technologies to help communities prepare for a changing climate, set up incentives to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure. And finally, my administration will work with tech innovators and launch new challenges under our [[Climate Data Initiative]], focused initially on rising sea levels and their impact on the coasts, but ultimately focused on how all these changes in weather patterns are going to have an impact up and down the United States - not just on the coast but inland as well - and how do we start preparing for that.”&lt;ref name=News/&gt;  Obama’s fund incorporates facets of both urban resiliency and human resiliency theories, by necessarily improving communal infrastructure and by focusing on societal preparation to decrease the country’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.

====Phoenix, Arizona====
Phoenix’s large population and extremely dry climate make the city particularly vulnerable to the threats of drought and extreme heat. However, the city has recently incorporated climate change into current (and future) water management and urban design. And by doing so, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has taken steps to ensure sustainable water supplies and to protect populations that are vulnerable to extreme heat, largely through improving the sustainability and efficiency of communal infrastructure. For example, Phoenix uses renewable surface water supplies and reserves groundwater for use during the instance when extended droughts arise. The city is also creating a task force to redesign the downtown core to minimize the way buildings trap heat and increase local temperatures.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;EPA. “Climate Impacts and Adaptation Examples in the Southwest.” http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/southwest-adaptation.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Phoenix skyline Arizona USA.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text| The outdated infrastructure pictured here in the Phoenix downtown will be undergoing drastic changes geared towards improvements in efficiency.]]

====Denver, Colorado====
The city of [[Denver]] has made recent strides to combat the threat of extreme wildfires and precipitation events. In the year 1996, a fire burned nearly 12,000 acres around [[Buffalo Creek, Colorado|Buffalo Creek]], which serves as the main source of the city’s water supply. Two months following this devastating wildfire, heavy thunderstorms caused flash floods in the burned area, having the effect of washing sediment into the city’s reservoir. In fact, this event washed more sediment into the reservoir than had accumulated in the 13 years prior. Water treatment costs were estimated to be $20 million over the next decade following the event. Denver needed a plan to make sure that the city would not be devastated by future wildfire and flash flood events. DenverWater and the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region are working together to restore more than 40,000 acres of [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s lands through processes like reforestation, erosion control, and the decommissioning of roads. Further, [[Denver]] has installed sensors in the reservoirs in order to monitor the quality of the water and quantity of debris or sediment. These accomplishments will have the effect of building a more resilient Denver, Colorado towards the impending increase of extreme weather events such as wildfire and flooding.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

====China====
[[File:Juncture of three main rivers in Ningbo China.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text| Pictured here is the conversion of three large rivers in Ningbo, China. The country is taking substantial measures to combat the flash floods predicted to intensify in the future.]]
[[China]] has been rapidly emerging as a new superpower, rivaling the [[United States]]. As the most populated country in the world, and one of the leaders of the global economy, China’s response to the impending effects of climate change is of great concern for the entire world. A number of significant changes are expected to affect China as the looming threat of [[climate change]] becomes more and more imminent. Here’s just one example; China has experienced a seven-fold increase in the frequency of floods since the 1950s, rising every decade. The frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and is predicted to continue to increase in the western and southern parts of China. The country is currently undertaking efforts to reduce the threat of these floods (which have the potential effect of completely destroying vulnerable communities), largely focusing on improving the infrastructure responsible for tracking and maintaining adequate water levels. That being said, the country is promoting the extension of technologies for water allocation and water-saving mechanisms. In the country’s [[National Climate Change Policy Program]], one of the goals specifically set out is to enhance the ability to bear the impacts of climate change, as well as to raise the public awareness on climate change. China’s National Climate Change Policy states that it will integrate climate change policies into the national development strategy. In China, this national policy comes in the form of its "Five Year Plans for Economic and Social Development". China’s Five Year Plans serve as the strategic road maps for the country’s development. The goals spelled out in the Five Year Plans are mandatory as government officials are held responsible for meeting the targets.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;King et al. 2012.

University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
As the world’s second most populous country, [[India]] is taking action on a number of fronts in order to address [[poverty]], natural resource management, as well as preparing for the inevitable effects of [[climate change]]. India has made significant strides in the energy sector and the country is now a global leader in renewable energy.  In 2011 India achieved a record $10.3 billion (USD) in clean energy investments, which the country is now using to fund solar, wind, and hydropower projects around the country. In 2008, India published its National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which contains several goals for the country. These goals include but are not limited to: covering one third of the country with forests and trees, increasing renewable energy supply to 6% of total energy mix by 2022, and the further maintenance of disaster management. All of the actions work to improve the resiliency of the country as a whole, and this proves to be important because India has an economy closely tied to its natural resource base and climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and forestry.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], '''connotation''' arises when the [[Denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] relationship between a signifier and its signified is inadequate to serve the needs of the [[community]]. A second level of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]s is termed connotative. These meanings are not [[object (philosophy)|objective]] representations of the ''thing'', but new usages produced by the language group.

==Discussion==
Drawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] has two parts:
*as a signifier, i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, or hear, and
*as the signified, i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. 
Connotative meanings are developed by the community and do not represent the inherent qualities of the thing or [[concept]] originally signified as the meaning. The addition of such meanings introduces complexity into the [[code (semiotics)|coding]] system. If a signifier has only a single denotational meaning, the use of the sign will always be unambiguously decoded by the [[audience]]. But connotative meanings are context-dependent, i.e. the addresser must  learn how to match the meaning intended by the addresser to one of the various possible meanings held in [[memory]]. 

The power of connotation is that it enables the addresser to more easily consider [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts and to introduce subtlety into the [[discourse]]. For example, a digital [[thermometer]] produces a numerical value that indicates the current state of a specific operational parameter. This technology provides an ''indexical'' sign of [[heat]] (adopting the classification of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914), an indexical sign by real connection between the signifier and the signified). The number is a denotative value, i.e. it speaks only for itself. The doctor, nurse or patient will relate to the number as a visual [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]], in this case a [[metaphor]], for the health of the body. Such [[information]] adds to other [[data]] forming a symptomology for the patient, a summation that takes place at a connotative [[cognitive]] level. Hence, the meanings as to health or illness are selected from the connotational framework which the interpreter has constructed through training and experience given that each possible state of well-being is represented by a cluster of [[symbol]]ic attributes, one of which is the patient's temperature.

Connotation is concerned with how the sign system is used in each message. The [[semantic]] content is selected by the addresser and represents that individual's [[value (semiotics)|values]] and intentions. Limiting an analysis purely to the sign system comprised by [[paradigm]]s and [[syntagm]]s excludes key elements in the interpretive process. Thus, [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] tests such as the [[commutation test]] have been developed to map connotations and so decode more of the addresser's intentions. This is achieved by changing the form of the signifiers, by substituting signifiers to assess what the alternative connotations would be and by considering what signifiers are absent and why their absences might be significant. Changes of form would require substituting different [[typeface|font]]s for the same text, or different colours or designs for the same visual content. The use of [[synonym]]s and [[antonym]]s clarifies connotational choices as between, say, [[pejorative]] and [[euphemistic]] usages. As to absences, if a modern image of a group of people employed in a major public enterprise only contains individuals of the same gender and ethnicity, the analyst would enquire into the significance of the exclusion of those of the opposite gender and a different ethnicity. The editorial decision may be supporting social values, attitudes and beliefs that are embedded into the culture—for example, that nations ought to conscript only men to serve on the front-lines of a war. Other explanations of different contexts may expose cultural [[mythology|myth]]s and [[prejudice]]s which are less reasonable.

[[Image:Whitecliffs Sheep.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sheep on a paddock]]
'''Counting sheep''' is a mental exercise used in some [[culture]]s as a means of putting oneself to [[sleep]]. 

In most depictions of the activity, the practitioner envisions an endless series of identical white [[sheep]] jumping over a fence, while counting them as they do so. The idea, presumably, is to induce [[boredom]] while occupying the mind with something simple, [[wikt:repetitive|repetitive]], and rhythmic, all of which are known to help humans sleep.

Although the practice is largely a [[stereotype]], and rarely used as a solution for [[insomnia]], it has been so commonly [[reference]]d by [[cartoon]]s, [[comic strip]]s, and other [[mass media]], that it has become deeply engrained into [[popular culture]]'s notion of sleep. The term "counting sheep" has entered the [[English language]] as an [[idiom]]atic term for insomnia. Sheep themselves have become associated with sleep, or lack thereof. 

The effectiveness of the method may depend upon the mental power required. An [http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_1780000/1780803.stm experiment] conducted by researchers at [[Oxford University]], though not involving livestock as the object of visualization, found that subjects who imagined "a [[beach]] or a [[waterfall]]" were forced to expend more mental energy, and fell asleep faster, than those asked to "simply distract from thoughts, worries and concerns." &lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Allison G., and Suzanna Payne. 2002. “The management of unwanted pre-sleep thoughts in insomnia: distraction with imagery versus general distraction.” Behaviour Research and Therapy. 40 (3): 267-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep could be achieved by any number of complex activities that expend mental energy.

An early reference to counting sheep as a means of attaining sleep can be found in ''Illustrations of Political Economy'' by [[Harriet Martineau]], from 1832:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was a sight of monotony to behold one sheep after another follow the adventurous one, each in turn placing its fore-feet on the breach in the fence, bringing up its hind legs after it, looking around for an instant from the summit, and then making the plunge into the dry ditch, tufted with locks of wool. The process might have been more composing if the field might have been another man's property, or if the flock had making its way out instead of in; but the recollection of the scene of transit served to send the landowner to sleep more than once, when occurring at the end of the train of anxious thoughts which had kept him awake." (p. 355–356)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An even earlier reference can be found in "Don Quixote" by [[Miguel de Cervantes]], from 1605 (the exception being Cervantes substituting "goats" for "sheep"): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cervantes probably adapted the story of counting goats from a story of counting sheep in the early twelfth-century Spanish work [[Disciplina Clericalis]].  The section The King and his Story-teller (section 12) uses the idea of counting sheep humorously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://purplemotes.net/2013/09/01/origin-counting-sheep-fall-asleep/ Ancient origins of counting sheep to fall asleep]&lt;/ref&gt;  Disciplina Clericalis draws mainly on literary sources from the Islamic world.  Counting sheep was probably a widely recognized practice in the Islamic world before the early twelfth century.

==In popular culture==
[[Serta (company)|Serta]], an [[United States|American]] mattress manufacturer has had their own herd of "Counting Sheep" used in advertisements for the company since at least 2000 and have even sold plush toys of the sheep.

''[[Shaun the Sheep]]'' entitled its 2012 series "[[List of Shaun the Sheep episodes#Shaun The Sheep Championsheeps (2012)|Championsheeps]]" to celebrate the London [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The episode "Steeplechase" featured Shaun and his fellow sheep participating in the [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] event. Blitzer the dog, who was referee, and the other sheep and farm animals, who were spectators, all fall asleep watching Shaun and the other sheep running around the track and jumping over the hurdles.

'''David Greetham''' (born October 21, 1941) is an Anglo-American literary critic and the founder of the [[Society for Textual Scholarship]].

==Career==

Greetham received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1963 and completed his Ph.D. in English at the [[City University of New York]].

[[Marta Werner]] of [[D'Youville College]] describes Greetham as "drawn to texts that spill over the boundaries of genre, that exist in multiple versions, that explore intertextuality, and that complicate in various other ways the notion of text as fixed or stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=Marta|title=Post-Everything|journal=Text|date=2003|volume=15|pages=337–349|ref=post_everything|jstor=30227799}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works, Greetham has sought to co-opt "the terminology
and practice of literary theory in re-designating textual operations in
the guise of ... literature, anthropology, sociology,
gender studies, history, political science, linguistics, psychology, [and]

As a theorist of scholarly editing, Greetham has taken up a middle ground between [[intentionalist]] positions like that of [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] and the [[social textual criticism]] of [[Jerome McGann]], maintaining the goal of establishing an authoritative text while allowing the possibility that multiple authorized versions can exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathijsen|first1=Marita|title=The Concept of Authorisation|journal=Text|date=2002|volume=14|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later work, Greetham has moved away from the idea that an editor can establish a "psychic" connection with the author through which he or she can determine the author's true intentions, instead seeing editing as an occasion for reflections on the ideology underlying scholarly practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Marta|title=Signals from a Distance: Editing, Telepathy, Elegy|journal=Textual Cultures|date=2008|volume=3|issue=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and professional career ==
David Ray Griffin is a longtime resident of [[Santa Barbara, California]] and was a full-time academic from 1973 until April 2004. He is currently a co-director of the Center for Process Studies and is one of the foremost contemporary exponents of [[process theology]], founded on the [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]].

Griffin grew up in a small town in [[Oregon]], where he was an active participant in his [[Disciples of Christ]] church.  After deciding to become a minister, Griffin entered [[Northwest Christian College]] but became disenchanted with the conservative-fundamentalist theology that was taught there. While getting his master's degree in counseling from the [[University of Oregon]], Griffin attended a lecture series delivered by [[Paul Tillich]] at the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in [[Berkeley, California]].  At this time, Griffin made his decision to focus on [[philosophical theology]]. He eventually attended the [[Claremont Graduate University]], where Griffin received his Ph.D. in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=American Historical Association|title=Directory of history departments and organizations in the United States and Canada|year=1991|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student in Claremont, Griffin was initially interested in Eastern religions, particularly [[Vedanta]].  However, he started to become a process theologian while attending [[John B. Cobb]]'s seminar on Whitehead's philosophy. According to Griffin, [[process theology]], as presented by Cobb, "provided a way between the old [[supernaturalism]], according to which [[God]] miraculously interrupted the normal causal processes now and then, and a view according to which God is something like a cosmic hydraulic jack, exerting the same pressure always and everywhere (which described rather aptly the position to which I had come)" (''Primordial Truth and Postmodern Theology''). Griffin applied Whitehead's thought to the traditional theological subjects of [[christology]] and [[theodicy]] and argued that process theology also provided a sound basis for addressing contemporary social and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David R. Griffin|title=Whitehead's radically different postmodern philosophy: an argument for its contemporary relevance|publisher=State University of New York|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching theology and Eastern religions at the [[University of Dayton]], Griffin came to appreciate the distinctively [[postmodern]] aspects of Whitehead's thought. In particular, Griffin found Whitehead's nonsensationist [[epistemology]] and panexperientialist [[ontology]] immensely helpful in addressing the major problems of modern philosophy, including the problems of mind-body interaction, the interaction between free and determined things, the emergence of experience from nonexperiencing matter, and the emergence of time in the evolutionary process. In 1973, Griffin returned to Claremont to establish, with Cobb, the Center for Process Studies at the [[Claremont School of Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie A. Muray|publisher=Greenwood Press|title=Liberal Protestantism and science|year=2008|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on research leave in 1980–81 at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and Berkeley, the contrast between [[modernity]] and [[postmodernity]] became central to his work. Many of Griffin's writings are devoted to developing postmodern proposals for overcoming the conflicts between religion and modern science. Griffin came to believe that much of the tension between religion and science was not only the result of reactionary supernaturalism but also the mechanistic worldview associated with the rise of modern science in the seventeenth century. In 1983, Griffin started the Center for a Postmodern World in Santa Barbara and became editor of the [[State University of New York|SUNY]] Series in Constructive Postmodern Philosophy between 1987 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kevin J. Vanhoozer|title=The Cambridge companion to postmodern theology|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|year=2003|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statements and publications on the September 11 attacks ==
Following the [[September 11 attacks]], David Ray Griffin moved his focus from questions of philosophy and religion to ones of politics and history, specifically [[American expansionism]] and [[American imperialism|imperialism]]. He intended to write a book on the subject, presenting 9/11 in terms of "blowback" for aggressive [[United States foreign policies]] of the 20th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until the spring of 2003, I had not looked at any of the evidence. I was vaguely aware there were people, at least on the internet, who were offering evidence against the official account of 9/11... I knew the US government had 'fabricated' evidence to go to war several times before. Nevertheless... I did not take this possibility seriously... I was so confident that they must be wrong.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Griffin | first = David Ray | author2 = Richard Falk | title = The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11 | url = http://bogusstory.com/TheNewPearlHarbor.html/ | accessdate = July 26, 2007 | isbn = 1-56656-552-9 | year = 2004 | page = 13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070728081622/http://bogusstory.com/TheNewPearlHarbor.html | archivedate = July 28, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After reading the work of [[The Terror Timeline|Paul Thompson]] and [[Nafeez Ahmed]], he became convinced that there was a ''[[prima facie]]'' case for the contention that there must have been complicity from individuals within the United States and joined the [[9/11 Truth Movement]] in calling for an extensive investigation from the [[United States media]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[9/11 Commission]].  At this time, he set about writing his first book on the subject, which he called ''[[The New Pearl Harbor|The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Griffin | first = David Ray | author2 = Richard Falk | title = The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11 | url = http://bogusstory.com/TheNewPearlHarbor.html/ | accessdate = July 26, 2007 | isbn = 1-56656-552-9 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070728081622/http://bogusstory.com/TheNewPearlHarbor.html | archivedate = July 28, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part One of the book looks at the events of 9/11, discussing each flight in turn and also the behaviour of President [[George W. Bush]] and his [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] protection.  Part Two examines 9/11 in a wider context, in the form of four "disturbing questions."  David Ray Griffin discussed this book and the claims within it in an interview with Nick Welsh, reported under the headline ''Thinking Unthinkable Thoughts: Theologian Charges White House Complicity in 9/11 Attack''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestcouncil.org/tims_picks/view.php?id=32 Native Forest Council: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714153850/http://www.forestcouncil.org/tims_picks/view.php?id=32 |date=July 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Griffin's thesis, such as neoliberal activist [[Chip Berlet]], have said that many of the claims in the book are refutable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/Post911/dubious_claims.html PublicEye.org – Post 9/11 Conspiracism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin has rejected these criticisms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/Post911/Griffin1.html PublicEye.org – Response to Chip Berlet's Review of "The New Pearl Harbor"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and debated Berlet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/26/150221 Democracy Now! | The New Pearl Harbor: A Debate On A New Book That Alleges The Bush Administration Was Behind The 9/11 Attacks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050623180411/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04%2F05%2F26%2F150221 |date=June 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin's second book on the subject was a direct critique of the [[9/11 Commission Report]], called ''The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions And Distortions'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Griffin | first = David | year = 2004 | title = The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions | publisher = Olive Branch Press | isbn = 1-56656-584-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Griffin's article "The 9/11 Commission Report: A 571-page Lie" summarizes this book, presenting 115 instances of either omissions or distortions of evidence he claims are in the report, stating that "the entire Report is constructed in support of one big lie: that the official story about 9/11 is true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20050523112738404| title=David Ray Griffin's "The 9/11 Commission Report: A 571-page Lie"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his next book, ''Christian Faith and the Truth Behind 9/11: A Call to Reflection and Action'' (2006), he summarizes some of what he believes is evidence for government complicity and reflects on its implications for [[Christians]].  The [[Presbyterian Publishing Corporation]], publishers of the book, noted that Griffin is a distinguished theologian and praised the book's religious content, but said, "The board believes the conspiracy theory is spurious and based on questionable research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, Griffin, along with [[Peter Dale Scott]], edited ''9/11 and the American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out'', a collection of essays including [[Steven E. Jones|Steven Jones]]' paper ''Why Indeed Did The World Trade Center Towers Collapse?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Griffin | first = David Ray | year = 2006 | title = 9/11 and American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out, Vol. 1 | publisher = Olive Branch Press | isbn = 1-56656-659-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Debunking 9/11 Debunking'' (2007) looks at the way mainstream media such as ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' have sought to debunk the alternative 9/11 theories and the tactics he claims they employ to persuade the reader that they have done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Griffin | first = David Ray | year = 2007 | title = Debunking 9/11 Debunking: An Answer to Popular Mechanics and Other Defenders of the Official Conspiracy Theory. | publisher = Olive Branch Press| isbn = 978-1-56656-686-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''9/11 Contradictions: An Open Letter to Congress and the Press'' (2008), he presents chapters on 25 alleged contradictions involving elements of the "accepted story" of 9/11 and calls for Congress and the press to investigate and resolve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomsson|first=Lena|journal=Gefle Dagblad|title=25 frågor hela världen vill ha svar på|date=May 2, 2009|url=http://gd.se/kultur/boken/1.1008102|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709072036/http://gd.se/kultur/boken/1.1008102|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 9, 2012|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ray Griffin has delivered several lectures that are popular within the [[9/11 Truth Movement]] and has given interviews on alternative media shows such as ''[[The Alex Jones Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonplanet.tv/audio/200605griffin.htm Alex Jones Interviews David Ray Griffin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219080713/http://www.prisonplanet.tv/audio/200605griffin.htm |date=February 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A lecture entitled ''9/11 and American Empire: How should religious people respond?'', delivered on April 18, 2005, at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], was aired by [[C-SPAN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20050521102328420 911truth.org ::::: 9/11 and American Empire: How should religious people respond?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of one of his lectures entitled ''9/11: The Myth and the Reality'' Griffin was asked why a theologian would take such an interest in 9/11, to which he replied: "If 9/11 is not a religious issue, then I don't know what is."&lt;ref&gt;"9/11: The Myth and the Reality" Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review published in the magazine ''[[The Nation]]'', former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] agent [[Robert Baer]] dismissed the gist of Griffin's writings as one in a long line of [[conspiracy theories]] about national tragedies but stated that the Bush administration had created a climate of secrecy and mistrust that helped generate such explanations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040927/baer "Dangerous Liaisons," September 27, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the review, Baer said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As more facts emerge about September 11, many of Griffin's questions should be answered, but his suspicions will never be put to rest as long as the Bush Administration refuses to explain why it dragged this country into the most senseless war in its history. Until then, otherwise reasonable Americans will believe the Bush Administration benefited from 9/11, and there will always be a question about what really happened on that day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107334">The '''deductive-nomological model''' ('''DN model'''), also known as '''[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s model''', the '''Hempel–[[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] model''', the '''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]–Hempel model''', or the '''covering law model''', is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, "Why...?".  The DN model poses scientific explanation as a [[deductive inference|deductive]] structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or [[postdiction]] of the phenomenon to be explained.

Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know [[causality]], it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that ''derive'' the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general [[scientific law|law]]s.  Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors.  Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.

When [[logical empiricism]] fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it  remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to [[modern physics]].  In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized ''maximal specificity'' for relevance of the conditions and [[axiom]]s stated.  Together with Hempel's [[inductive-statistical model]], the DN model forms scientific explanation's '''covering law model''', which is also termed, from critical angle, '''subsumption theory'''.

== Form ==

The term ''[[deductive inference|deductive]]'' distinguishes the DN model's intended [[determinism]] from the [[probabilism]] of [[inductive inference]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel/&gt;  The term ''nomological'' is derived from the Greek word ''[[:wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]'' or ''nomos'', meaning "law".&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose ''conditions of adequacy'' (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are ''derivability'' (CA1), ''lawlikeness'' (CA2), ''empirical content'' (CA3), and ''truth'' (CA4).&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA113 p 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DN model, a law [[axiom]]atizes an [[enumerative induction|unrestricted generalization]] from antecedent ''A'' to consequent ''B'' by [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]]—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—by supporting [[counterfactual]] claims and thus suggesting what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "DN model of explanation and [[hypothetico-deductive model|HD model]] of theory development", pp 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "Axiomatic account of theories", pp 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon to be explained is the '''''explanandum'''''—an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas the [[premise]]s to explain it are '''''explanans''''', true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, "Afterword—1977", "Introduction", §1 "Swan song for positivism", §1A "Explanation and intertheoretical reduction", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619 pp 619–24], in Suppe, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC ''Structure of Scientific Theories'', 2nd edn] (U Illinois P, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the phenomenon ''E'' as explanandum is a deductive consequence, thereby scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;

[[Aristotle]]'s scientific explanation in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=Shaffner&gt;Kenneth F Schaffner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA79 "Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences"], pp 79–125, in Laudan, ed, ''Mind and Medicine'' (U California P, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq= p 81].&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework of [[Aristotelian physics]]—[[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]], an intrinsic [[ethics|morality]] in nature.&lt;ref name=Montalenti&gt;G Montalenti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMAf65cDmAQC&amp;pg=PA3 ch 2 "From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin"], in Ayala &amp; Dobzhansky, eds, ''Studies in the Philosophy of Biology'' (U California P, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  With emergence of [[Copernicanism]], however, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] introduced [[mechanical philosophy]], then [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th century, Descartes as well as [[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found [[teleology]] to be [[problem of demarcation|outside]] [[natural philosophy|science]]'s inquiry (Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq= pp 31–33]).  By 1650, formalizing [[heliocentrism]] and launching [[mechanical philosophy]], [[Cartesian physics]] overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics.  In the 1660s, [[Robert Boyle]] sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy.  Newton more especially sought the laws of nature—simply the regularities of phenomena—whereby [[Newtonian physics]], reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 1740, [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicknames for principles attributed to Hume—[[Hume's fork]], [[problem of induction]], [[Hume's law]]—were not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference.&lt;/ref&gt; staked [[Hume's fork]],&lt;ref&gt;By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as [[formal sciences]] are universal through "relations of ideas"—simply abstract truths—thus knowable [[a priori knowledge|without experience]].  On the other hand, the claimed truths of [[empirical science]]s are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] on "fact and real existence", knowable only [[a posteriori|upon experience]].  By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross.  Any treatises containing neither can contain only "sophistry and illusion".  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's fork", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156]).&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the [[problem of induction]],&lt;ref&gt;Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming [[constant conjunction]], make the unrestricted generalization of an [[enumerative induction]], and justify it by presuming [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].  Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience—the [[problem of induction]]—how humans irrationally presume discovery of causality.  (Chakraborti, ''Logic'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2u8C_ur8VIC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=uniformity+of+nature+problem+of+induction p 381]; Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.&lt;ref&gt;For more discursive discussions of types of causality—necessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, [[counterfactual]]—see Rothman &amp; Greenland, Parascandola &amp; Weed, as well as Kundi.  Following is more direct elucidation:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A ''necessary cause'' is a causal condition ''required'' for an event to occur.  A ''sufficient cause'' is a causal condition ''complete'' to produce an event.  Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors—that is, other ''component causes''—might be required to produce the event.  Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event.  Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors.  And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs.  (Language can state necessary causality as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—a statement whose terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]] render it is logically true by mere definition—which, as an [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''analytic'' statement]], is uninformative about the actual world.  A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''synthetic'' statement]], rather.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sufficient causality is more actually ''sufficient component causality''—a complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation—which, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover.  Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as ''necessary and sufficient''—a single factor both required and complete—the one and only cause, ''the'' cause.  One may so view flipping a light switch.  The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors—intact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], explanation of electricity by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], harnessing of electricity by [[Benjamin Franklin]], metal refining, metal mining, and on and on—while, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a [[David Hume|Humean]] perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on.  If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's ''mind'', but one's mind cannot know that the event violated ''nature''.  As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense+logical+natural p 156]).  Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject [[metaphysics]], Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=anti-Copernican p 154]).  Hume thus placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] (Buckle [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiq14nexzu0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Hume's+Newton+crowning#v=twopage pp 70–71], Redman [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=theism+moral+causal+induction#v=twopage pp 182–83], Schliesser [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-newton § abstract]).  Hume found [[enumerative induction]] an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–29]).  Hume found [[constant conjunction]] to reveal a modest causality type: ''[[counterfactual]] causality''.  Silent as to causal role—whether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism—counterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Hume also highlighted the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], as what ''is'' does not itself reveal what ''ought''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating [[normative|norms]]—supposedly what should be—with barely explanation.  Yet such values, as in [[ethics]] or [[aesthetics]] or [[political philosophy]], are not found true merely by stating facts: ''is'' does not itself reveal ''ought''.  Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable—that no statements of facts can ever justify norms—although Hume himself did not state that.  Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it.  Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by [[communal reinforcement]].  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's law", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Hume's+law p 157] &amp; "Naturalistic fallacy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=naturalistic+fallacy#v=twopage pp 240–41]; Wootton, ''Modern Political Thought'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Hume+communal+reinforcement p 306].)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critique of Pure Reason|Near 1780]], countering Hume's ostensibly radical [[empiricism]], [[Immanuel Kant]] highlighted extreme [[rationalism]]—as by [[Descartes]] or [[Spinoza]]—and sought middle ground.  Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into ''substance'', ''space'', and ''time'', Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] universally true,&lt;ref&gt;
Kant inferred that the [[category (Kant)|mind's constants]] arrange space holding [[Euclidean geometry]]—like Newton's [[absolute space]]—while objects interact temporally as modeled in [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]], whose [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]] is a truth ''[[synthetic a priori]]'', that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience.  Thus, the [[category (Kant)|mind's innate constants]] [[synthetic a priori|cross the tongs]] of [[Hume's fork]] and lay Newton's [[universal gravitation]] as ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' truth.&lt;/ref&gt; yet knowledge of [[ding-an-sich|things in themselves]] impossible.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Safeguarding [[natural philosophy|science]], then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakravartty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism/&gt;  Aborting [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[inductivist]] mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the ''[[noumena]]''—[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view of nature's [[essentialism|ultimate truths]]—Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] tasked science with simply modeling patterns of ''[[phenomena]]''.  Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the [[category (Kant)|mind's constant]]s holding also [[categorical imperative|universal moral truths]],&lt;ref&gt;Whereas a [[hypothetical imperative]] is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the [[categorical imperative]] is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched [[German idealism]], increasingly speculative.

[[Auguste Comte]] found the [[problem of induction]] rather irrelevant since [[enumerative induction]] is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth.  Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable.  Comte in the 1830s expounded [[positivism]]—the first modern [[philosophy of science]] and simultaneously a [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Bourdeau&gt;Bourdeau, "Auguste Comte", §§ "Abstract" &amp; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Int "Introduction"], in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—rejecting conjectures about [[unobservable]]s, thus rejecting search for ''causes''.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, ''A General View of Positivism'' (Trübner, 1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=59hUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=atheism+repudiated+causes+laws pp 49–50], including the following passage: "As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.  These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts".&lt;/ref&gt;  Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a ''law'', thereupon [[applied science|applied]] to benefit human society.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, ''Dictionary'' (St Martin's, 1984), "Positivism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=positivism+prediction p 283].&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe.&lt;ref name=Bourdeau/&gt;  Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's [[natural selection]] brought the [[Copernican Revolution]] into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]].&lt;ref name=Montalenti/&gt;

Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as ''description'', [[logical positivism]] emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better [[unity of science|unify empirical sciences]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but [[special science]]s, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §1 "Background and introduction", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat of [[National Socialism]] with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, ''logical empiricism''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;  All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,&lt;ref&gt;Any ''positivism'' placed in the 20th century is generally ''neo'', although there was [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science—traceable to the [[inductivist]] trend from [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] at 1620, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[research program]] at 1687, and [[Auguste Comte|Comptean]] positivism at 1830—that continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the quest of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Neopositivists are sometimes called "verificationists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]], researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Scientific realism]] takes scientific theory's statements at [[face value]], thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty&gt;Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §1.2 "The three dimensions of realist commitment", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world.  In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'.  According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false.  This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so-called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports.  Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today).  Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as [[instrumentalism]], holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty-Okasha&gt;
*Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism", §4.1 "Empiricism", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Traditionally, [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]]s maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of [[instrumentalism]] were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".
*Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Oxford U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;

DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl G Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G Hempel &amp; Paul Oppenheim, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185169 "Studies in the logic of explanation"], ''Philosophy of Science'', 1948 Apr; '''15'''(2):135–175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect,&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt; as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  DN model bypasses causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]]: first an event like ''A'', then always an event like ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;

Hempel held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by ''[[inductive-statistical model]]'' (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel/&gt;—together form ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Cornell U P, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the ''[[deductive-statistical model]]'' (DS model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", §2.3 "Inductive statistical explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, "Explanation", § "Covering-law model of explanation", in Sarkar &amp; Pfeifer, eds, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Routledge, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named the totality ''subsumption theory''.&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, "Causal and historical explanation", in Manninen &amp; Tuomela, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding'' (D Reidel, 1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Amid failure of [[neopositivism]]'s fundamental tenets,&lt;ref&gt;
Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of ''cognitive meaningfulness'', the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.  From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion.  In 1951 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] attacked the analytic/synthetic gap.  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson]] blurred the observational/theoretical gap.  In 1959, [[Karl Raimund Popper]] attacked all of verificationism—he attacked, actually, any type of positivism—by asserting falsificationism.  In 1962, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] overthrew [[foundationalism]], which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-reFall&gt;
Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], §3 "Scientific reasoning", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2013: "The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position.  At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit.  Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.  Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of ''cognitive significance'' in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation'' (1965d).  There he proposed that ''cognitive significance'' could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach.

Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the ''cognitive significance'' of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117).  The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic—explanatory and predictive—power of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b).  The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement".
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting [[falsificationism]], which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Popper, "Against big words", ''In Search of a Better World'' (Routledge, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L33XSZE77OkC&amp;pg=PA89#v=twopage pp 89-90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hachoben&gt;Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years'' (Cambridge U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Popper's 1934 book&lt;ref&gt;''[[Logik der Forschung]]'', published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', and arrived in the [[English-speaking world]] in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; embraces DN model,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;Woodward, "Scientific explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology&lt;ref&gt;As scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell [[organelle]]s beyond the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;The first famed biochemistry experiment was [[Edward Buchner]]'s in 1897 (Morange, ''A History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq= p 11]).  The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating [[colloid]]s in biological systems, a "biocolloidology" (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]; Bechtel, ''Discovering'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=biocolloidology+colloids+exemplifies+organic+proteins p 94]).  This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term ''macromolecule'' introduced by German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1922 (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[cell biology]] arose&lt;ref&gt;Cell biology emerged principally at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] through new technology ([[electron microscope]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]) and new techniques ([[cell fractionation]] and advancements in staining and fixation).&lt;/ref&gt; and established existence of cell [[organelle]]s besides the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  Launched in the late 1930s, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] cracked a [[genetic code]] in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as ''cell and molecular biology'', its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism&gt;Bechtel, ''Discovering Cell Mechanisms'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=empiricists+Salmon#v=twopage pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biology became a new model of science, while [[special sciences]] were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal ''conditions of adequacy'', [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] acknowledged redundancy of the third, ''[[empiricism|empirical content]]'', implied by the other three—''derivability'', ''lawlikeness'', and ''truth''.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113/&gt;  In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, [[Wesley Salmon]] called for returning ''cause'' to ''because'',&lt;ref&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer J, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=causality pp 121–122].&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[James H. Fetzer|James Fetzer]] helped replace CA3 ''empirical content'' with CA3' ''strict maximal specificity''.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=better p 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon introduced ''causal mechanical'' explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced ''[[statistical-relevance model]]'' (SR model).&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in [[applied science]]s,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt; most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.&lt;ref name=Glennan/&gt;

==Strengths==

As theory of knowledge, [[epistemology]] differs from [[ontology]], which is a subbranch of [[metaphysics]], theory of reality.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology/&gt;  Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 1], subch "Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science", § "Metaphysics", pp 8–9, § "Epistemology", p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural law]]s, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the ''[[epistemic]]''.  Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ''[[ontic]]''. Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a ''[[category mistake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop &amp; A Amann, "Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws", in Khrennikov, ed, ''Proceedings'' (World Scientific, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9B6b5WKuNWwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=ontic+epistemic+general pp 51–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA118 p 118], poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when [[epistemic]] can fail as [[ontic]]: "The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our ''knowledge'' of the universe.  Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws.  First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity.  Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature.  And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased".&lt;/ref&gt;

Discarding ontic commitments, including causality ''per se'', DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws.  The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Thus, the epistemic success of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian theory's [[law of universal gravitation]] is reduced to—thus explained by—[[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]&lt;ref&gt;This theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P60&amp;dq= pp 60–62]).&lt;/ref&gt; is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing [[absolute space]] despite [[absolute time]].

Covering law model reflects [[neopositivism]]'s vision of [[empirical science]], a vision interpreting or presuming [[unity of science]], whereby all empirical sciences are either [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—or are [[special sciences]], whether [[astrophysics]], chemistry, biology, [[geology]], psychology, economics, and so on.&lt;ref name=cplaws&gt;Reutlinger, Schurz &amp; Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus"], § 1.1 "Systematic introduction", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=fundamental+special+sciences p 305].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas fundamental physics has sought [[scientific law|law]]s of [[determinism|universal regularity]], special sciences normally include ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws, which are predictively accurate to high [[probability]] in "normal conditions" or with "all else equal", but have exceptions [Reutlinger ''et al'' § 1.1].  Chemistry's laws seem [[deterministic|exceptionless]] in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5], Schwarz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 Fig 1], and so are special sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  All special sciences would network via covering law model.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories" pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  And by stating ''boundary conditions'' while supplying ''bridge laws'', any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Theory reduction model and the [[unity of science]] program" pp 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long/&gt;  (''Boundary conditions'' are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur.

==Weaknesses==

By DN model, if one asks, "Why is that shadow 20 feet long?", another can answer, "Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of [[electromagnetism]]".&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, "Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?", another could answer, "Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of electromagnetism", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, "Why did that man not get pregnant?", one could in part answer, among the explanans, "Because he took birth control pills"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.

Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'' (Oxford U P, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=magj7kNrbpsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= pp 17–19].&lt;/ref&gt;  DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance ''Z'' always following ''Y'', but not ''Z'' because of ''Y'', instead ''Y'' and then ''Z'' as an effect of ''X''.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;  By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, [[Boyle's law]] permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain ''why'' to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas/&gt;

See "Notes", [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=atomism pp 79–80], #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].  The more relevant here is #12: "Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning [[atomism]].  First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the [[scientific realism|reality]] of atoms.  Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics.  Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience.  Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after [[J J Thomson]] and the distinction between [[electron]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905.  And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, via statistical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the phenomenon [[Brownian motion]]—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real.&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in ''particles'', doubted until this helped resolve [[atomic theory]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;
Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as ''mechanical'' energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq= pp 22–23]).  In the 1890s, the problem of [[blackbody radiation]] was paradoxical until [[Max Planck]] theorized ''[[quantum]]'' exhibiting [[Planck's constant]]—a minimum unit of energy.  The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as ''particles'', yet simply as units of ''energy''.  Another paradox, however, was the [[photoelectric effect]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency.  Within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]'s visible portion, frequency sets the color.  Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height.  In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity—higher wave amplitude—raises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect.  And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond—a certain frequency and higher—was found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital.  Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy—more total particles—each individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron.  Einstein's model, far more intricate, used [[probability theory]] to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles.  This revival of the [[particle theory of light|particle hypothesis of light]]—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted.  By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in [[atomic theory]], and thus [[quantum mechanics]] emerged.  In 1926, [[Gilbert N Lewis]] termed the particles ''[[photon]]s''.  [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] models them as the electromagnetic field's [[messenger particle]]s or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or [[timeline of electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''Simply Einstein'' (W W Norton &amp; Co, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwNJ_PDRnbkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Wrap p 67].&lt;/ref&gt; whose two theories misaligned.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated [[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]].  To fit [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s [[transverse wave]] theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with [[Augustin Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s [[luminiferous aether]] at 1814.  By [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether.  Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to—thus vary in relation to—light's speed.  Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an [[interferometer]] by [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson &amp; Morley at 1887]], revealed no apparent ''aether drift''—light speed apparently constant, an absolute.  Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible.  For brief summary, see Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ether pp 26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, ''Aether and Gravitation'' (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1903), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Aether pp 122–23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lodge&gt;Lodge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgYiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=action+constitute+distance+electron+empty+space+gravitation+Optical "The ether of space"], ''Sci Am Suppl'', 1909; '''67''':202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Mach, who shunned all hypotheses beyond direct sensory experience, presumed an aether, required for motion to not violate [[mechanical philosophy]]'s founding principle, ''No instant inter[[action at a distance]]'' (Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 15–18]).&lt;/ref&gt;  At experimental paradoxes,&lt;ref&gt;
Rowlands, ''Oliver Lodge'' (Liverpool U P, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BfLxqkSgBEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= pp 159–60]: "[[Sir Oliver Lodge|Lodge]]'s [[luminiferous aether|ether]] experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of [[special relativity]] and their significance is usually seen in this context.  Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics.  Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them.  With the emphasis on relativity, the [[Michelson–Morley]] experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium.

It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case.  The Michelson–Morley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether.  Its results—and the [[FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]]—could have been predicted on [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]]'s, or even [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place.  The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual.  Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists.  The ether which he always believed existed had to acquire entirely new properties as a result of this work".&lt;/ref&gt; physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly [[Hendrik Lorentz]] as well as [[Henri Poincaré]] modified [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamic theory]] and, more or less, developed special theory of relativity before Einstein did (Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85]).  Yet Einstein, free a thinker, took the next step and stated it, more elegantly, without aether (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertia is the state of a body experiencing no acceleration, whether by change in speed—either quickening or slowing—or by change in direction, and thus exhibits constant [[velocity]], which is speed plus direction.&lt;/ref&gt; which, by omitting aether,&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=ether pp 29–30].&lt;/ref&gt; converted space and time into ''relative'' phenomena whose relativity aligned [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]] with the Newtonian principle [[Galilean invariance|Galilean relativity or invariance]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To explain absolute light speed without aether, Einstein modeled that a body at motion in an electromagnetic field experiences [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], which [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] had already modeled as [[Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction]] and [[Lorentz transformation]] but by hypothesizing [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] states of the aether, whereas Einstein's special relativity was simply [[kinematics|kinematic]], that is, positing no causal mechanical explanation, simply describing positions, thus showing how to align measuring devices, namely, clocks and rods.

In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] independently formalized [[quantum mechanics]] (QM).&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq= pp 113–18].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite clashing explanations,&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=QMs&gt;Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] posed an [[electron]]'s charge smeared across space as a [[wavefunction|waveform]], later reinterpreted as the electron [[probability amplitude|manifesting across space probabilistically but nowhere definitely]] while eventually building up that deterministic waveform.  Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s''. [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism—interpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient—predictively identical with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; the two theories made identical predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]]'s 1928 [[Dirac equation|model of the electron]] was set to [[special relativity]], launching [[quantum mechanics|QM]] into the first [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p393-95&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P393&amp;dq= pp 393–95].&lt;/ref&gt;  From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's [[antiparticle]], soon discovered and termed ''[[positron]]'',&lt;ref name=Torretti-p394&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P394&amp;dq= p 394].&lt;/ref&gt; but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Elsewhere and otherwise, [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of strong force permitted [[Manhattan Project]] to engineer [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath—[[radioactive fallout]]—of diverse health consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism, which if taken toward ''interpretation'' as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism,&lt;ref name=QMs/&gt; although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms&gt;From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, ''QED'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq= p xiv]).  Schrödinger introduced [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], whose [[wave function]] is discerned by a [[partial differential equation]], now termed ''[[Schrödinger equation]]'' (p xiv).  Heisenberg, who also stated the [[uncertainty principle]], along with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] introduced [[matrix mechanics]], which rather confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s'' (p xiv).  If taken as causal mechanically [[explanatory]], the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible [[empirically]], that is, when not used for ''interpretation'', and taken as simply ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= p xv]).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, at a party in a tavern in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to [[Richard Feynman]] a different formalism suggested by [[Paul Dirac]], who developed [[bra–ket notation]], in 1932 (p xv).  The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as ''[[sum over histories]]'' or ''[[sum over paths]]'' or ''[[path integral formulation|path integrals]]'' (p xv).  Feynman would joke that this approach—which sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient—abolishes the uncertainty principle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= p xvi]).  All empirically equivalent, Schrödinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= pp xvi–xvii]).  By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the "canonical" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a "roaring comeback", became the predominant means to make predictions from [[quantum field theory|QFT]], and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq= p xviii]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  As each known [[fundamental force]]&lt;ref&gt;The four, known [[fundamental interactions]] are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  [[Louis de Broglie]]'s [[waveparticle duality]] had rendered [[atomism]]—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'' (Indiana U P, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq= pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting in 1947, [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] soon introduced ''[[renormalization]]'', a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq= p 395].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber&gt;Schweber, [https://books.google.com/books/about/QED_and_the_Men_who_Made_it.html?id=61n5dE7FJQgC ''QED and the Men who Made it''] (Princeton U P, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; subsuming [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;Feynman, ''QED'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5].&lt;/ref&gt;  QED thus won physicists' general acceptance.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]] criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq=Dirac pp 395–96].&lt;/ref&gt; and called for an aether.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=ether+Dirac+medium+vacuum#v=twopage pp 158–59].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] had found unexpected motion of [[electron configuration|electron orbitals]], [[Lamb shift|shift]]ed since the vacuum is not truly empty.&lt;ref&gt;Close, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/blog/tag/ether "Much ado about nothing"], ''Nova'', PBS/WGBH, 2012:

"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when [[Willis Lamb]] measured spectrum of hydrogen.  The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths.  This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on.  Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another.  According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million.  What could be causing this tiny but significant difference?

"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing.  Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons.  These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly.  This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances.  Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something—or at nothing—the more dramatic these energy fluctuations become.  Combine that with Einstein's E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void.  This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing".&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet ''emptiness'' was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; even suppressing it.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59/&gt;  Meanwhile, "sickened by untidy math, most [[philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] tend to neglect QED".&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;

According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe.  (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.)  The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena.  Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true.  But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it.  Again, we have an example of a false but empirically successful theory".&lt;/ref&gt; "relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since" 1905 brought [[special relativity]].&lt;ref name=Pigliucci&gt;Pigliucci, ''Answers for Aristotle'' (Basic Books, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=laZensALMSgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=antirealist+aether p 119]: "But the antirealist will quickly point out that plenty of times in the past scientists have posited the existence of unobservables that were apparently necessary to explain a phenomenon, only to discover later on that such unobservables did not in fact exist.  A classic case is the aether, a substance that was supposed by nineteenth-century physicists to permeate all space and make it possible for electromagnetic radiation (like light) to propagate.  It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since.  The antirealists will relish pointing out that modern physics features a number of similarly unobservable entities, from [[quantum foam|quantum mechanical 'foam']] to [[dark energy]], and that the current crop of scientists seems just as confident about the latter two as their nineteenth-century counterparts were about aether".&lt;/ref&gt;  Einstein was noncommittal to aether's nonexistence,&lt;ref name=Tavel/&gt; simply said it superfluous.&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30/&gt;  Abolishing Newtonian motion for electrodynamic primacy, however, Einstein inadvertently reinforced aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p78-80&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt; and to explain motion was led back to aether in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=Laughlin&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'' (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=ironic pp 120–21].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorentz aether theory|Lorentz aether]] was at absolute rest—acting ''on'' matter but not acted on ''by'' matter.  Replacing it and resembling [[Ernst Mach]]'s aether, Einstein aether is [[spacetime]] itself—which is the [[gravitational field]]—receiving motion from a body and transmitting it to other bodies while propagating at light speed, [[gravitational waves|waving]].  An unobservable, however, Einstein aether is not a privileged [[frame of reference|reference frame]]—is not to be assigned a state of absolute motion or absolute rest.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet resistance to [[relativity theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Relativity theory comprises both special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR).  Holding for inertial reference frames, SR is as a limited case of GR, which holds for all reference frames, both inertial and accelerated.  In GR, all motion—inertial, accelerated, or gravitational—is consequent of the geometry of 3D space stretched onto the 1D axis of time.  By GR, no force distinguishes acceleration from inertia.  Inertial motion is consequence simply of ''uniform'' geometry of spacetime, acceleration is consequence simply of ''nonuniform'' geometry of spacetime, and gravitation is simply acceleration.&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with earlier theories of aether, whose word and concept became taboo.&lt;ref name=Laughlin-quote/&gt;  Einstein explained special relativity's compatibility with an aether,&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 14–18].&lt;/ref&gt; but Einstein aether, too, was opposed.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Objects became conceived as pinned directly on [[spacetime|space and time]]&lt;ref&gt;In Einstein's 4D spacetime, 3D space is stretched onto the 1D axis of time flow, which [[time dilation|slows]] while space additionally [[space contraction|contracts]] in the vicinity of mass or energy.&lt;/ref&gt; by abstract geometric relations lacking ghostly or fluid medium.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretti-p180&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180].&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, QED along with [[weak force|weak nuclear field]] was reduced to [[electroweak theory]] (EWT), and the [[strong force|strong nuclear field]] was modeled as [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Comprised by EWT, QCD, and [[Higgs field]], this [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] is an "effective theory",&lt;ref&gt;As an effective field theory, once adjusted to particular domains, Standard Model is predictively accurate until a certain, vast energy scale that is a cutoff, whereupon more fundamental phenomena—regulating the effective theory's modeled phenomena—would emerge. (Burgess &amp; Moore, ''Standard Model'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLYECqs2geEC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=effective p xi]; Wells, ''Effective Theories'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKKAfrfCofcC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Natural+Standard+Model pp 55–56]).&lt;/ref&gt; not truly fundamental.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner&gt;Jegerlehner, "The Standard Model as a low-energy effective theory", [https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7813 arXiv:1304.7813]: "We understand the [[Standard Model|SM]] as a low energy effective emergence of some unknown physical system—we may call it 'ether'—which is located at the [[Planck scale]] with the [[Planck length]] as a 'microscopic' length scale.  Note that the cutoff, though very large, in any case is finite".&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[gluons|QCD's particles]] are considered nonexistent in the everyday world,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; QCD especially suggests an aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73/&gt; routinely found by physics experiments to exist and to exhibit relativistic symmetry.&lt;ref name=Laughlin-quote&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'', (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq= pp 120–21]: "The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity.  This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.  ...  Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry.  It turns out that such matter exists.  About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids.  Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness.  It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part.  The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether.  But we do not call it this because it is taboo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Confirmation of the [[Higgs particle]], modeled as a condensation within the [[Higgs field]], corroborates aether,&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt; although physics need not state or even include aether.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Organizing regularities of ''observations''—as in the covering law model—physicists find superfluous the quest to discover ''aether''.&lt;ref name=Ben-Menahem/&gt;

In 1905, from [[special relativity]], Einstein deduced [[mass–energy equivalence]],&lt;ref&gt;Mass–energy equivalence is formalized in the equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; particles being variant forms of distributed energy,&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA616&amp;dq=special p 13]: "[A]ccording to the special theory of relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy".&lt;/ref&gt; how [[particle accelerator|particles colliding at vast speed]] experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles,&lt;ref&gt;Braibant, Giacomelli &amp; Spurio, ''Particles and Fundamental Interactions'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8YUUG2pGeIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=electron+proton+neutron+collisions p 2]: "Any particle can be created in collisions between two high energy particles thanks to a process of transformation of energy in mass".&lt;/ref&gt; although physicists' talk promotes confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Greene]] explained, "People often have the wrong image of what happens inside the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], and I am just as guilty as anyone of perpetuating it.  The machine does not smash together particles to pulverise them and see what is inside.  Rather, it collides them at extremely high energy.  Since, by dint of Einstein's famous equation, [[mass-energy equivalence|E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], energy and mass are one and the same, the combined energy of the collision can be converted into a mass, in other words, a particle, that is heavier than either of the colliding [[proton]]s.  The more energy is involved in the collision, the heavier the particles that might come into being" [Avent, [https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/07/qa-brian-greene "The Q&amp;A"], ''Economist'', 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;  As "the contemporary locus of [[metaphysical]] research", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as ''excitation modes'' of fields,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P396&amp;dq= p 396].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt; the particles and their masses being states of aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13&gt;Wilczek, [http://ctpweb.lns.mit.edu/physics_today/phystoday/Ether.pdf "The persistence of ether"], ''Phys Today'', 1999; '''52''':11,13, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality,&lt;ref name=Riesselmann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), ch 8 "The grid (persistence of ether)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Ether+QCD p 73]: "For natural philosophy, the most important lesson we learn from [[quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is that what we perceive as empty space is in reality a powerful medium whose activity molds the world.  Other developments in modern physics reinforce and enrich that lesson.  Later, as we explore the current frontiers, we'll see how the concept of 'empty' space as a rich, dynamic medium empowers our best thinking about how to achieve the unification of forces".&lt;/ref&gt; as long ago foreseen.&lt;ref name=Lodge/&gt;  Yet a ''quantum'' field is an intricate abstraction—a ''mathematical'' field—virtually inconceivable as a ''classical'' field's physical properties.&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann&gt;Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate"], ''Sci Am'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature's deeper aspects, still unknown, might elude any possible field theory.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt;

(Whittaker, ''A History of Theories of Aether'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co: 1910), [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftheorie00whitrich#page/18/mode/2up pp 17–18])&lt;/ref&gt;  By now, most [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] infer that the four, known [[fundamental interactions]] would reduce to [[superstring theory]], whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms.&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;  Given uncertainties of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism&gt;Challenges to [[scientific realism]] are captured succinctly by Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'' (SUNY P, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq= pp 33–34], commenting about modern science, "But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet.  For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world.  For instance, [[Newton's first law of motion]] (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one.  This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events.  Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'', that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'.  Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'.  To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.  If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'.  But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations.  He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'.  In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; some conclude that the concept ''causality'' raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key [[folk science]], but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, [http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/003004.pdf "Causation as folk science"], in Price &amp; Corry, eds, ''Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality'' (Oxford U P, 2007), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oCXe4DvqUFMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[epidemiology]] is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karhausen&gt;{{Cite journal

In [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[logic]], '''differentia''' is one of the [[predicables]].  It is that part of a [[definition]] which is predicable in a given [[Genus (philosophy)|genus]] only of the [[definiendum]]; or the corresponding "metaphysical part" of the object.

==Origin of the notion==
The concept of differentia was, as a matter of fact, already employed by [[Plato]] when he conceived his method of [[diaeresis (philosophy)|''diairesis'']]. [[Aristotle]] used the term ''diafora'' in a systematical fashion; but he had no explicit theory about it, and his understanding of the term is controversial. A theory was only provided by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry's]] explicit treatment of the [[predicables]] presented in his ''[[Isagoge]]''. On the basis of [[Boethius|Boethius']] translation of the Isagoge, where the Greek term ''diafora'' was rendered as in Latin as "differentia", evolved the elaborate scholastic theory of the predicables.

==Logical meaning==
In the original, logical sense, a differentia is a concept — the notion of "differentia" is a second-order concept, or a "second intention", in the scholastic nomenclature. In the scholastic theory it is a kind of essential predicate — a predicate that belongs to its subjects [[de dicto and de re|''de re'']] necessarily. It is distinguished against the [[species (philosophy)|species]] by expressing the (specific) essence of the object only partially and against the [[genus (philosophy)|''genus'']] by expressing the determining rather than the determined part of the essence.

==Ontological meaning==
Although the primary meaning of "differentia" is logical or second-order, it may under certain assumptions have an ontological, first-order application. If it is assumed that the structuring of an essence into "determining" and "determinable" metaphysical parts (which corresponding to a differentia and a genus respectively) exists in reality independently of its being conceived, one can apply the notion "differentia" also to the determining metaphysical part itself, and not just to the concept that expresses it. This is common in [[Scotism]], where the metaphysical parts are said to be [[formal distinction|formally distinct]]. If, on the other hand, any mind-independent structuring on the part of the essence is denied (like in [[Thomism]] or [[Francisco Suárez|Suárezianism]]), then the partitioning of the essence into a generic and a differentiating part must be considered as merely conceptua, whereas the actual realities corresponding to the differentia and to the genus evade as really the same. These assumptions therefore do not permit any ontological application of the notion of differentia.

'''EU Directive 2010/63/EU'''&lt;ref name="DIRECTIVE 2010/63/EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:276:0033:0079:EN:PDF|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[European Union]] (EU) legislation "on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes" and is one of the most stringent ethical and welfare standards worldwide.&lt;ref name="Euroscience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroscience.org/news/euroscience-supports-directive-201063eu-on-the-protection-of-animals-used-for-scientific-purposes/|publisher=EuroScience|year=2015|accessdate=18 May 2016|title=EuroScience supports Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directive repealed EU Directive 86/609/EEC.  It became formally applied across the EU on 1 January 2013.  It protects live non-human [[vertebrate]]s including independently feeding [[larva]]l forms and foetal forms of [[mammal]]s from the last third of their normal development, and live cephalopods.

==History==
The Directive is based on the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes (ETS123) established in 1986. This Convention applies to a wider Europe, beyond just the EU.&lt;ref name="Understanding" /&gt;

The Directive repealed EU Directive 86/609/EEC.  It took nearly two years to revise, beginning in November 2008.  It was finalised and signed on 22 September 2010, coming into force on 9 November 2010.  Member States were then allowed one year to transpose it into their own words before it became formally applied across the EU on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/policy/european-directive/|accessdate=18 May 2016|publisher=Understanding Animal Research|title=European Directive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986L0609:EN:NOT |title=EURLex – 31986L0609 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur Lex |date=11 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate aim of the Directive is to replace animals in research.&lt;ref name="Hartung"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hartung, T.|year=2010|title=Comparative analysis of the revised directive 2010/63/EU for the protection of laboratory animals with its predecessor 86/609/EEC–a t4 report|journal=Altex|volume=27|issue=4|pages=285–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Because it is a Directive, it allows Member States certain flexibility in transposition of national rules. The status of the implementation of the new Directive in the EU is described by the EC General Environment Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/transposition_en.htm |title=Animals used for scientific purposes – Environment |publisher=European Commission |date=11 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purposes of this Directive are to provide scope (via Articles 1 &amp; 3), harmonise the current EU understanding of what defines an animal (Article 1.3), map resources, identify competent people and authorities (Articles 47.5 &amp; 48), establish a common framework, and promote collaboration of the Member States with the [[European Commission|EC]] to promote [[animal welfare]] in the EU as a European value in Article 13 of the [[Treaties of the European Union|Treaty of the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)]].

Animal welfare is not an EU policy area ''per se'' as it is for agriculture, [[fishery|fisheries]], research, etc., but rather that "In formulating and implementing the Union's agriculture, fisheries, [[transportation|transport]], internal markets, research, [[Technology|technological development]], and space policies, the Union and the Member States shall, since animals are [[sentience|sentient]] beings, pay full regard to the welfare of animals, while respecting the legislative or administrative provisions and customs of the Member States relating in particular to religious rites, cultural traditions and regional heritage". Therefore, no legal action can be taken by the EC when animal welfare is not respected; one must refer a complaint directly to the Member State. Promotion and use of alternative animal testing methods and 3Rs are written elsewhere within EU legislation (e.g. REACH, Cosmetics, PPP, Biocides&amp;nbsp;...). EU agencies (ECHA, EMA, EFSA) also contribute to the protection of [[laboratory animal]]s used for scientific purposes.
[[File:Squid_colors_2.tif|240px|thumb|The Directive now protects cephalopods such as this [[Caribbean reef squid]] (''Sepioteuthis sepioidea'')]]
:'''Article 1.3''': The new EU Directive applies to the following animals: (a) live non-human [[vertebrate]] animals, including: (i) independently feeding [[larva]]l forms; and (ii) foetal forms of [[mammal]]s from the last third of their normal development; (b) live cephalopods.

:'''Article 4''': The Directive refers directly to [[The Three Rs (animals)|'''Three Rs''' (3Rs)]]: "Principle of replacement, reduction and refinement" first described by Russell and Burch in 1959.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Russell, W.M.S.  |author2=Burch, R.L.|year=1959|title=The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique|publisher=Methuen, London|ISBN=0-900767-78-2|url=http://altweb.jhsph.edu/pubs/books/humane_exp/het-toc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Article 47-2''': Member States shall assist the Commission in identifying and nominating suitable specialised and qualified laboratories to carry out such validation studies.

==Laboratories for the Validation of Alternative Methods==
In July 2013, the Commission announced the creation of European Union Network of Laboratories for the Validation of Alternative Methods [https://eurl-ecvam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/eu-netval] (EU-NETVAL)&lt;ref name="ihcp.jrc.ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihcp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/our_labs/eurl-ecvam/eu-netval/Annex%202%20EU-NETVAL%20Selected%20June%202013%20for%20web%20v03.pdf |title=EURL ECVAM's |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU-NETVAL's primary role is to provide support for the European Union Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing [https://eurl-ecvam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/about-ecvam] (EURL ECVAM) validation projects, including aspects of training and dissemination, and the identification of methods that have a potential to reduce, refine or replace animals used for scientific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihcp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/our_labs/eurl-ecvam/eu-netval |title=EUNETVAL (European Union Network of Laboratories for the Validation of Alternative Methods) – Institute for Health and Consumer Protection – (JRC-IHCP), European Commission |publisher=European Commission |date=20 January 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any EU laboratory is allowed to apply as long as they follow the eligibility criteria listed by the EC, such as sufficient scientific staff, adequate equipment and GLP/or ISO certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihcp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/our_labs/eurl-ecvam/eu-netval/Annex%201%20EU-NETVAL-EligibilityCriteria%20Januari%202013%20for%20web.pdf |title=EURL ECVAM's |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, there are 38 test facilities: [[Belgium]] (3) [[Czech Republic]] (1), [[European Commission]] (1), [[Finland]] (1), France (3), (Germany) (6), [[Hungary]] (1), Italy (8), the [[Netherlands]] (2), [[Poland]] (2), [[Slovakia]] (1), Spain (3), [[Sweden]] (1), [[Switzerland]] (2) and the United Kingdom (2).&lt;ref name="38Members"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurl-ecvam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-research/eu-netval-ncp-march-2016|accessdate=19 May 2016|year=2016|publisher=European Commission|title=European Union network of laboratories for the validation of alternative methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Arthur Burtt''' (October 11, 1892 – September 6, 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Edwin Burtt, Professor And Author, Dies at 96| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/09/obituaries/edwin-a-burtt-professor-and-author-dies-at-96.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 9, 1989 | accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), usually cited as '''E. A. Burtt''', was an [[American philosopher]] who wrote extensively on the [[philosophy of religion]]. His doctoral thesis published as a book under the title ''The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science'' has had a significant influence upon the [[History of science and technology|history of science]] that is not generally recognized, according to [[H. Floris Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;Diane Davis Villemaire, 2002, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on October 11, 1892 in [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], [[Massachusetts]]. His missionary parents took Burtt to China for several of his teenage years.  He was educated at [[Yale University]]. He graduated from Yale in 1915, where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]].&lt;ref name="BTP"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGs4AAAAMAAJ | title=Catalogue of Beta Theta Pi | publisher=J. T. Brown | year=1917 | accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|983}} He attended [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and [[Columbia University]]. He became the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Philosophy at [[Cornell University]] in 1941.

He died on September 6, 1989 in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Work==
Though he maintained throughout his life a sympathy towards religious values and beliefs, he acknowledged that his philosophy had been marked by a reaction towards what he saw as his own father's too narrow outlook.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3130401 A Eulogy with young life details]. Retrieved March 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Burtt participated in drafting the [[Humanist Manifesto I]], he did not work on the project further, because he lost interest after his ideas that spiritual experience is the identification with categories of space, time, causality, and other fundamental physical principles were never included in the final publications.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Davis Villemaire, 2002, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1973 he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Based on his own statements, [[Thomas Kuhn]] may very well have been unaware that in building on the philosophy of [[Alexandre Koyré]], he was in turn building on the philosophy of Burtt whose influence upon Koyré has been demonstrated as substantial.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Davis Villemaire, 2002, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained within the [[Neo-Kantian]] Marburg School, he initially followed his mentor [[Hermann Cohen]] in attempting to supply an idealistic [[philosophy of science]].

After Cohen's death, Cassirer developed a theory of symbolism and used it to expand [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[epistemology|knowledge]] into a more general [[philosophy of culture]]. Cassirer was one of the leading 20th-century advocates of philosophical [[idealism]]. His most famous work is the ''Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'' (1923–1929).

== Biography ==
Born in [[Wrocław|Breslau]] in [[Silesia Province|Silesia]] (modern-day southwest Poland), into a [[Jew]]ish family, Cassirer studied literature and philosophy at the [[University of Marburg]] (where he completed his doctoral work in 1899 with a dissertation on [[Descartes]]'s analysis of mathematical and natural scientific knowledge entitled ''Descartes' Kritik der mathematischen und naturwissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis''—''Descartes' Critique of Mathematical and Scientific Knowledge'') and at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (where he completed his [[habilitation]] in 1906 with the dissertation ''Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der neueren Zeit: Erster Band''—''The Problem of Knowledge in Philosophy and Science in the Modern Age: Volume I'').&lt;ref&gt;A second volume appeared in 1907, a third one in 1920, and a fourth one in 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Politically, Cassirer supported the liberal [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Larry Eugene |title=Crossing Boundaries: The Exclusion and Inclusion of Minorities in Germany and the United States |date=2001 |publisher=Berghahn Books |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working for many years as a [[Privatdozent]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin, Cassirer was elected in 1919 to the [[philosophy]] chair at the newly founded [[University of Hamburg]], where he lectured until 1933, supervising amongst others the doctoral theses of [[Joachim Ritter]] and [[Leo Strauss]]. Because he was Jewish, he left Germany after the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s came to power in 1933.

After leaving Germany he taught for a couple of years in [[Oxford]],{{where|date=January 2018}} before becoming a professor at [[Gothenburg University]]. When Cassirer considered Sweden too unsafe, he applied for a post at [[Harvard University]], but was rejected because thirty years earlier he had rejected a job offer from them.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1941 he became a visiting professor at [[Yale University]], then moved to [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], where he lectured from 1943 until his death in 1945.

Cassirer died of a [[heart attack]] in April 1945 in New York City. His grave is located in Westwood (New Jersey) on the Cedar Park Beth-El Cemeteries in the graves of the Congregation Habonim. His son, [[Heinz Cassirer]], was also a Kantian scholar.

== Influences ==

Donald Phillip Verene, who published some of Cassirer’s papers kept at Yale University, gave this overview of his ideas:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Cassirer as a thinker became an embodiment of Kantian principles, but also of much more, of an overall movement of spirit stretching from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, and on to Herder’s conception of history, Goethe’s poetry, Wilhelm von Humboldt’s study of the Kavi language, Schelling’s &lt;I&gt;Philosophie Der Mythologie,&lt;/i&gt; Hegel’s &lt;I&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit,&lt;/i&gt; and Vischer’s conception of the aesthetic symbol, among many others. Cassirer’s own position is born through a mastery of the whole development of this world of the humanistic understanding, which included the rise of the scientific world view &amp;mdash; a mastery evident both in his historical works and in his systematic philosophy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassirer|first1=Ernst|editor1-last=Verene|editor1-first=Donald Phillip|title=Symbol, Myth, and Culture: Essays and Lectures of Ernst Cassirer 1935-1945|date=1979|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-02666-8|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Work ==

=== History of science ===
Cassirer's first major published writings were a history of modern thought from the Renaissance to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. In accordance with his Marburg neo-Kantianism he concentrated upon epistemology. His reading of the scientific revolution, in books such as ''The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy'' (1927), as a “Platonic” application of mathematics to nature, influenced historians such as [[E. A. Burtt]], [[E. J. Dijksterhuis]], and [[Alexandre Koyré]].

=== Philosophy of science ===
In ''Substance and Function'' (1910), he writes about late nineteenth-century developments in physics including [[relativity theory]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]]. In ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (1921) he defended the claim that modern physics supports a neo-Kantian conception of knowledge. He also wrote a book about [[Quantum mechanics]] called ''Determinism and Indeterminism in Modern Physics'' (1936).

=== Philosophy of symbolic forms ===
At Hamburg Cassirer discovered the Library of the Cultural Sciences founded by [[Aby Warburg]]. Warburg was an art historian who was particularly interested in ritual and myth as sources of surviving forms of emotional expression. In ''Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'' (1923–29) Cassirer argues that man (as he put it in his more popular 1944 book ''Essay on Man'') is a "[[symbolicum|symbolic animal]]". Whereas animals perceive their world by [[instinct]]s and direct [[sensory perception]], humans create a universe of [[symbol]]ic meanings. Cassirer is particularly interested in natural language and myth. He argues that science and mathematics developed from natural language, and religion and art from myth.

=== The Cassirer–Heidegger debate ===
{{Main|Cassirer–Heidegger debate}}
In 1929 Cassirer took part in an historically significant encounter with [[Martin Heidegger]] in [[Davos]]. Cassirer argues that while Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' emphasizes human temporality and finitude, he also sought to situate human cognition within a broader conception of humanity. Cassirer challenges Heidegger's relativism by invoking the universal validity of truths discovered by the exact and moral sciences.

=== ''Philosophy of the Enlightenment'' ===
Cassirer believed that reason's [[self-realization]] leads to human liberation. Mazlish (2000) however notes that Cassirer in his ''The Philosophy of the Enlightenment'' (1932) focuses exclusively on ideas, ignoring the political and social context in which they were produced.

=== ''The Logic of the Cultural Sciences'' ===
In ''The Logic of the Cultural Sciences'' (1942) Cassirer argues that objective and universal validity can be achieved not only in the sciences, but also in practical, cultural, moral, and aesthetic phenomena. Although inter-subjective objective validity in the natural sciences derives from universal laws of nature, Cassirer asserts that an analogous type of inter-subjective objective validity takes place in the cultural sciences.

=== ''The Myth of the State'' ===
Cassirer's last work, ''The Myth of the State'' (1946), was published posthumously; at one level it is an attempt to understand the intellectual origins of [[Nazi Germany]]. Cassirer sees Nazi Germany as a society in which the dangerous power of myth is not checked or subdued by superior forces. The book discusses the opposition of [[logos]] and [[mythology|mythos]] in Greek thought, [[Plato]]'s [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], the medieval theory of the state, [[Machiavelli]], [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s writings on [[Great Man theory|hero worship]], the racial theories of [[Arthur de Gobineau]], and [[Hegel]]. Cassirer claimed that in 20th century politics there was a return, with the passive acquiescence of [[Martin Heidegger]], to the irrationality of myth, and in particular to a belief that there is such a thing as destiny. Of this passive acquiescence, Cassirer says that in departing from Husserl's belief in an objective, logical basis for philosophy, Heidegger attenuated the ability of philosophy to oppose the resurgence of myth in German politics of the 1930s.

'''Functional theories of grammar''' are those approaches to the study of [[language]] that see functionality of language and its elements to be the key to understanding [[linguistic]] processes and structures. Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analyzed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from [[structural linguistics]] or formalist language theories, in that the latter approaches seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other only as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former additionally takes into account the context where linguistic elements are used and studies the way they are instrumentally useful or functional in the given environment. This  means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used in communicative context. The formal relations between linguistic elements are assumed to be functionally-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Functional Theories of Grammar|author=Nichols, Johanna|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=13|year=1984|pages= 97–117|quote=[Functional grammar] ''analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that structural or formal approaches are not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but are inadequate even as structural accounts. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation.''|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.13.1.97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frameworks==
There are several distinct grammatical frameworks that employ a functional approach.

*The structuralist functionalism of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague school]] was the earliest functionalist framework developed in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Newmeyer, Frederick. (2001). The Prague School and North American functionalist approaches to syntax. Journal of Linguistics vol. 37. 101 - 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novak, P., Sgall, P. 1968. On the Prague functional approach. Trav. Ling. Prague 3:291-97. Tuscaloosa: Univ. Alabama Press&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[André Martinet]]'s Functional Syntax, with two major books, ''A functional view of language'' (1962) and ''Studies in Functional Syntax'' (1975). Martinet is one of the most famous French linguists and can be regarded as the father of French functionalism.
*[[Simon C. Dik|Simon Dik]]'s [[Functional discourse grammar|Functional Grammar]], originally developed in the 1970s and 80s, has been influential and inspired many other functional theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dik, S. C. 1980. Studies in Functional Grammar. London: Academic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dik, S. C. 1981. Functional Grammar. Dordrecht/Cinnaminson NJ: Foris.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been developed into Functional Discourse Grammar by the linguist [[Kees Hengeveld]].&lt;ref&gt;Hengeveld, Kees &amp; Mackenzie, J. Lachlan (2010), Functional Discourse Grammar. In: Bernd Heine and Heiko Narrog eds, The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analysis. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 367-400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hengeveld, Kees &amp; Mackenzie, J. Lachlan (2008), Functional Discourse Grammar: A typologically-based theory of language structure. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Michael Halliday]]'s [[systemic functional grammar]] argues that the explanation of how language works "needed to be grounded in a functional analysis, since language had evolved in the process of carrying out certain critical functions as human beings interacted with their ... 'eco-social' environment".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. forthcoming. Meaning as Choice. In Fontaine, L, Bartlett, T, and O'Grady, G. Systemic Functional Linguistics: Exploring Choice. Cambridge University Press. p1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M. A. K. 1984. A Short Introduction to Functional Grammar. London: Arnold&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday draws on the work of [[Karl Bühler|Bühler]] and [[Bronislaw Malinowski|Malinowski]]. The link between [[John Rupert Firth|Firthian]] linguistics and Alfred North Whitehead also deserves a mention.&lt;ref&gt;See David G. Butt, Whiteheadian and Functional Linguistics in [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2008, vol. II) ; cf. Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Role and reference grammar]], developed by [[Robert Van Valin]] employs functional analytical framework with a somewhat formal mode of description. In RRG, the description of a sentence in a particular language is formulated in terms of its semantic structure and communicative functions, as well as the grammatical procedures used to express these meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, W. A., Van Valin, R. D. Jr. 1984. Functional Syntax and Universal Grammar. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Valin, Robert D., Jr. (Ed.). (1993). ''Advances in Role and Reference Grammar''. Amsterdam: Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Copenhagen school (linguistics)#Danish functional school|Danish functional grammar]] combines  [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]]/[[Louis Hjelmslev|Hjelmslevian]] [[structuralism]] with a focus on [[pragmatics]] and [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;Engberg-Pedersen, Elisabeth; Michael Fortescue; Peter Harder; Lars Heltoft; Lisbeth Falster Jakobsen (eds.). (1996) Content, expression and structure: studies in Danish functional grammar. John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dik characterises the functional approach as follows:

{{blockquote|
In the functional paradigm a language is in the first place conceptualized as an instrument of social interaction among human beings, used with the intention of establishing communicative relationships. Within this paradigm one attempts to reveal the instrumentality of language with respect to what people do and achieve with it in social interaction. A [[natural language]], in other words, is seen as an integrated part of the [[communicative competence]] of the natural language user. (2, p.&amp;nbsp;3)}}

Because of its emphasis on usage, communicative function, and the social context of language, functional grammar differs significantly from other linguistic theories which stress purely [[formal grammar|formal approaches to grammar]], notably Chomskyan [[generative grammar]]. Functional grammar makes much use of [[corpus linguistics]] and [[linguistic typology]] to provide material.

==Grammatical functions==
Functions exist on all levels of grammar, and even in phonology, where the function of the [[phoneme]] is to distinguish between lexical material.
#Semantic function: ([[Agent (linguistics)|Agent]], [[Patient (linguistics)|Patient]], [[Recipient (linguistics)|Recipient]], etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.
#Syntactic functions: (e.g. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]]  and [[Object (grammar)|Object]]), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression.
#Pragmatic functions: ([[Topic–comment|Theme and Rheme]], [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], [[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction.

'''GLS Bank''' (full name '''GLS Gemeinschaftsbank eG''') is a German [[ethical banking|ethical bank]] that was founded in 1974 as an [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] initiative by [[Wilhelm Ernst Barkhoff]] and Gisela Reuther. It was the first bank in Germany that operated with an [[Ethical banking|ethical philosophy]].&lt;ref name=inaise&gt;''GLS Gemeinschaftsbank'', summary by International Association of Investors in the Social Economy, December 2006. [http://www.inaise.org For summary report enter 'GLS' in search box]&lt;/ref&gt; According to GLS Bank, its focus is on cultural, social and ecological initiatives, initiated by people, and not anonymous interests seeking capital or maximum profit. The name stands for ''Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken'' which translates as ''Community bank for loaning and giving''. With the main focus on cultural, social and environmental ventures, GLS tries to deal with challenges in the society by developing creative solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gls.de/die-gls-bank/ueber-uns/gls-bank/english-portrait.html |title=GLS Bank: A brief portrait - GLS Bank |work=gls.de |year=2011 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719033149/http://www.gls.de/die-gls-bank/ueber-uns/gls-bank/english-portrait.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GLS Bank.jpg|thumb|left| The head office of the German GLS Bank in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]]]]
The bank is based in [[Bochum]], Germany and is a [[co-operative]]. As of November 2006, the bank's total balance was EUR 645 million.&lt;ref name=inaise/&gt; As of 31 December 2008, the balance sheet total was EUR 1,013 million, further rising to EUR 1,847 million as of 31 December 2010.

In 2015, the bank received the first ''German Award for Excellence'' from the [[DQS|Deutschen Gesellschaft für Zertifizierung ''(German Certification Group)'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://umwelt-kompass.com/kompass/gls-bank-fuer-vorbildliche-geschaeftspolitik-ausgezeichnet/#more-251123 GLS Bank für vorbildliche Geschäftspolitik ausgezeichnet], Umwelt-Kompass&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nna-news.org/de/nachrichten/artikel/erstmals-verliehener-german-award-for-excellence-geht-an-gls-bank-2494/  Erstmals verliehener „German Award for Excellence“ geht an GLS-Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; The award was granted to honor the bank's fair business practices.

In December 2016 at the annual general assembly, about 80% of the 1200 people present at the assembly decided to introduce the ''GLS Beitrag''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.gls.de/gls-gemeinschaft/gls-beitrag-im-neuland/ GLS Beitrag: Im Neuland], GLS Blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bankspiegel.pageflow.io/gls-beitrag bankspiegel.pageflow.io/gls-beitrag], pageflow.io&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/gls-bank-gebuehr-ohne-schrecken/19333032.html |title=Gebühr ohne Schrecken |work=Handelsblatt |year=2017 |accessdate=25 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
In 2010, the bank acquired over 18,000 new customers and in February 2011 GLS announced a growth of 37 per cent, the largest in the bank's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nna-news.org/news/en/index.cgi/110215-01EN_GLS-RECORD-GROWTH.html |title=GLS Bank with 37 percent record growth |work=nna-news.org |year=2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006063933/http://www.nna-news.org/news/en/index.cgi/110215-01EN_GLS-RECORD-GROWTH.html |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of December 2016 the Genossenschaft (co-operative) has 46.313 members,&lt;ref name="GLS Bank"&gt;[https://www.gls.de/privatkunden/gls-bank/zahlen-fakten/ GLS Bank], Zahlen &amp; Fakten&lt;/ref&gt; compared to December 2015 with 41.982 members&lt;ref name="GLS Bank"/&gt; this is a growth of 10.3%.&lt;ref name="GLS Bank"/&gt;

A '''girlfriend''' is a female [[Friendship|friend]] or [[Interpersonal relationship|acquaintance]], often a regular female companion with whom one is [[Platonic love|platonic]], [[Romance (love)|romantically]] or [[Sexual relationship|sexually involved]].&lt;ref name="girlfriend at farlex"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|title=Girlfriend|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/girlfriend|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thesaurus.com|title=Boyfriend|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/boyfriend?s=t|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analogous male term is "[[boyfriend]]".

==Scope==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0310-0025, Berlin, Straßenszene.jpg|thumb|A man with his girlfriend at [[Alexanderplatz]] in March 1975.]]

Partners in committed relationships are also sometimes described as a "[[significant other]]" or simply "partner", especially if the individuals are cohabiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thesaurus.com|title=Significant other|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/significant+other?s=t|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Girlfriend" and "partner" mean different things to different people; the distinctions between the terms are subjective. How the term is used will ultimately be determined by personal preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=StackExchange|title=English Language &amp; Usage|url=http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/47852/word-for-partner-you-are-living-with-but-not-married-to|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sam|last=Killermann|title=Why I say "partner" instead of boyfriend or girlfriend|work=It's Pronounced Metrosexual|url=http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/12/why-i-sa-the-term-partner-instead-of-boyfriendgirlfriend-and-when/|date=7 December 2011|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a study was conducted of 115 people ages 21 to 35 who were either living with or had lived with a romantic partner. It notes that the lack of proper terms often leads to awkward situations, such as someone becoming upset over not being introduced in social situations to avoid the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jayson|first=Sharon|title=Adults stumble over what to call their romantic partners|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2008-06-22-adult-dating-descriptor_N.htm|accessdate=6 May 2012|work=USA Today|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists some ambiguity between the terms "girl friend," or a friend who is a girl, and "girlfriend." The transition between the two is a significant aspect of adolescent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Girl friend, boy friend, girlfriend, boyfriend: Broadening our understanding of heterosocial competence |first=R. L. |last=Grover |first2=D. W. |last2=Nangle |first3=A. |last3=Serwik |first4=K.

Both forms of "girlfriend" and "girl friend" are used by different people to mean different things. For example, when the term "girlfriend" is used by a female about another female in a non-[[human sexuality|sexual]], non-[[romantic love|romantic]] context, the two-word form "girl friend" is sometimes used to avoid confusion with the sexual or romantic meaning; however, this is not a rule. In this sense of its usage, "girlfriend" is used in terms of very close [[friendship|friends]] and has no sexual connotations, unless it is in the case of [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[pansexual]], [[transgender]] women. The term "girlfriend" is also used in [[LGBT]] communities and can refer to people of any sex or sexuality.&lt;ref name="Traps: African American"&gt;{{cite book

The term "girlfriend" does not necessarily imply a sexual relationship, but is often used to refer to a girl or woman who is [[dating]] a person she is not engaged to without indicating whether she is having sex with them. With differing expectations of sexual [[mores]], the term "dating" can imply romantic activity whereas simply using "friend" would likely avoid implying such intimacy. It is essentially equivalent to the term "sweetheart", which has also been used as a [[term of endearment]].&lt;ref name="sweetheart at farlex"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|title=Sweetheart|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sweetheart|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar relationship wherein there is no exclusivity is sometimes referred to by terms such as ''friend with benefits''.&lt;ref&gt;Wentland, Jocelyn J., and Elke Reissing. "Casual sexual relationships: Identifying definitions for one night stands, booty calls, fuck buddies, and friends with benefits." The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality 23.3 (2014): 167-177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "girlfriend" was first used in 1863 as "a woman's female friend in youth.” In 1922, the word girlfriend was used to mean a man’s sweetheart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Girlfriend|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=girlfriend|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "dating" entered the American language during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. Prior to that, courtship was a matter of family and community interest. Starting around the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], courtship became a private matter for couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Elaine|title=The History of Dating and Communication|url=http://www.communicationstudies.com/the-history-of-dating-and-communication|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
* A female engaged in an [[adultery|extramarital]] relationship with a married man is frequently considered a "[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]". The word "mistress" was originally used as a neutral counterpart for the words "mister" or "master".&lt;ref name="mistress at farlex"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|title=Mistress|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mistress|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The word "[[madam]]" is still a respectful form of address, but has had sexual connotations since the early 18th century and has been used to refer to the owner of a brothel since the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="mistress at farlex"/&gt; 
* Some [[terms of endearment]] directed to females, a romantic relationship not required, are "darling", "sweetheart", "love", etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson |first=J.A. |title=Terms of Endearment |url=http://www.yaelf.com/toe.shtml |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510051117/http://www.yaelf.com/toe.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Users of [[Internet slang]] and [[short message service|SMS]] slang often shorten "girlfriend" to the initialism "gf".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?Acronym=gf&amp;Find=find&amp;string=exact What does gf stand for?], ''AcronymFinder.com''. Retrieved on 30 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additionally, gender-indiscriminate terms also apply (e.g., lover, heartthrob, paramour, squeeze, sweetheart, true love, wooer, date, escort, steady, admirer, bae, or companion).

==Distinction from "lady friend"==
A similar, but not equivalent, concept is the more ambiguous "lady friend" &amp;ndash; a companion of the female gender who is possibly less than a girlfriend but potentially more than a friend. That is to say, the relationship is not necessarily platonic, nor is it necessarily an exclusive, serious, committed, or long-term relationship. The term avoids the overt sexual implications that come with referring to a woman as someone's "mistress" or "lover". In that sense, it can often be a euphemism. The term can also sometimes be employed when someone simply does not know the exact status of a woman that a man has been associating with. For instance, tabloid headlines often note that a celebrity has been seen with a new "lady friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2007/11/06/2007-11-06_sir_paul_mccartney_photographed_with_mar.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Sir Paul McCartney photographed with married Hamptons lady friend | first=Tracy | last=Connor | date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=lady+friend|title=WordNet Search|website=wordnetweb.princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lady friend" may also be used to signify a romantic relationship with an older woman, when the term "girl" as in "girlfriend" may be deemed age-inappropriate.

==Widening acceptance for describing people of all ages==
As of 2007, The ''[[New York Times]]'' style guide discouraged the use of the term "girlfriend" for an adult romantic partner, stating, "Companion is a suitable term for an unmarried partner of the same or the opposite sex."&lt;ref name="wolfowitzarticle"&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
'''Hanshan''' ({{zh|c=寒山|p=Hánshān|l=Cold Mountain}}, ''fl.'' 9th century) is a figure associated with a collection of poems from the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] in the [[Taoism|Taoist]] and [[Zen|Chan]] tradition. No one knows who he was, when he lived and died, or whether he actually existed. In the  [[Buddhism in China|Chinese]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, Hanshan and his [[sidekick]] [[Shide (monk)|Shide]] are honored as emanations of the [[bodhisattva]]s [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]] and [[Samantabhadra]], respectively. In Japanese and Chinese paintings, Hanshan is often depicted together with Shide or with [[Fenggan]], another monk with legendary attributes.

Little is known of his work, since he was a recluse living in a remote region and his poems were written on rocks in the mountains he called home.  Of the 600 poems he is thought to have written at some point before his death, 313 were collected and have survived.&lt;ref name="Notes 1997"&gt;Xiang Chu. ''寒山诗注 (i.e. "Cold Mountain Poems and Notes")'' (1997, 2000, 2010) 3rd edition, Zhonghua Book Company, Beijing, China {{ISBN|978-7-101-01645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 57 poems attributed to Hanshan's friend, Shide,&lt;ref name="Notes 1997"/&gt; seven appear to be authored by Hanshan, for a total of 320.&lt;ref&gt;''Cold Mountain Poems &amp; Notes (With Lost Poetry Notes)'' (1997, 2000, 2010), by Xiang Chu, Zhonghua Book Company, Beijing, China {{ISBN|978-7101-01645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
In Lu Jiuyin's ({{zh|c=閭丘胤|p=Lǘqiū yìn|w=Lu Ch'iu-Yin}}) preface to Hanshan's poems, he claims to have personally met both Hanshan and Shide at the kitchen of [[Guoqing Temple]], but they responded to his salutations with laughter then fled. Afterwards, he attempted to give them clothing and provide them housing, but Lu Jiuyin writes that the pair fled into a cave which closed itself and Shide's tracks disappeared. This led Lu Jiuyin, governor of Tai Prefecture, to collect Hanshan's writings, "the poems written on bamboo, wood, stones, and cliffs {{emdash}} and also to collect those written on the walls of peoples' houses."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Snyder, "Cold Mountain Poems", ''Evergreen Review'', vol. 2 no. 6, pp. 71f&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Burton Watson is of the opinion that Lu Jiuyin did not exist in reality and that his preface to Hanshan's poems is nothing more than myth.  In the introduction to his book, he says of Lu Jiuyin's preface to the poems:&lt;ref name="watson8"&gt;''Cold Mountain: 100 Poems by the T'ang Poet Han-shan'' (1970), tr. Burton Watson, Columbia University Press {{ISBN|0-231-03450-4}} p8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The preface], contrary to Chinese custom, is undated.  Lu-chiu Yin represents himself as a high official and prefixes his name with a very imposing title.  But there is only one mention of anyone by this name to be found in other works of the period, and it refers almost certainly to another person.  This fact alone is peculiar enough, if Lu-chiu Yin was in fact as high up in the bureaucracy as his title indicates.  Furthermore, the style of the preface, awkward and wordy, hardly suggests the writing of an eminent official.  All other sources that tell us anything about Han-shan and Shih-te appear to be later than the preface and based upon it.  For all we know, therefore, the whole picture of the two recluses built up in the preface may be nothing more than literary fiction.  The poems, however, remain &amp;mdash; over three hundred of them....If the reader wishes to know the biography of Han-shan, he must deduce it from the poems themselves.}}

If we follow Watson and discount the preface of Lu Jiuyin, accepting only the words of the poet himself, we see that Hanshan says only that he wrote his poems on the rocks. Nowhere in the poetry does he say that he wrote them on trees or bamboo or wood or the walls of people’s houses.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The collection of poems attributed to Hanshan may span the entire Tang Dynasty as [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]] asserts in his study ''Linguistic Evidence for the Date of Hanshan''.&lt;ref name="pulleyblank"&gt;Pulleyblank 1978. ''Linguistic Evidence for the Date of Hanshan'' in ''Studies in chinese poetry and poetics'' ed. by Ronald C. Mioa, Chinese Materials Center, 1978. Vol I p 163-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Chi-yu in ''A study of Han-shan''&lt;ref name="WuChiYu"&gt;Wu Chi-yu in ''A study of Han-shan'' in [[T'oung pao]], 45, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; identifies him as the monk [[Zhiyan]] (智岩, 577&amp;ndash;654), but that has been disputed by [[Paul Demiéville]] among others. The ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'' gives his date as around 712 and after 793. [[Jia Jinhua]] came to the conclusion, after a study of [[Zen|Chan]] phrases in some 50 of the poems, that this particular group of poems may be attributable to the Chan monk [[Caoshan Benji]] (840&amp;ndash;901).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jia Jinhua]] ''A study of the Authentic Author of the Chan Poems in the Collected Poems of Hanshan''. Bulletin of the Institute of Chinese Literature and Philosophy, Academia Sinica, Vol 22, Taiwan, March 2003. - 2003 no 3, p 65-90&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the dates for both Zhiyan and Caoshan Benji contradict Hanshan, who says that he was much older than either.

In the introduction to his translation of Han-shan's poems, Burton Watson writes, “If the reader wishes to know the biography of Han-shan, he must deduce it from the poems themselves.” Watson goes further to describe Han-shan as "a gentleman farmer, troubled by poverty and family discord, who after extensive wandering and perhaps a career as a minor official"&lt;ref name="watson_1962"&gt;Burton Watson, translator. ''Cold mountain: 100 poems by the Ta̓ng poet Han-shan'' (page 9) Grove Press, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; became a hermit. In Paul Rozer's translation of poem 302, Han-shan appears to say that after leaving home and traveling he arrived at [[Tiantai Mountain]] at age 30, and that he was trained in the Confucian classics:&lt;ref name="rouzer_2016"&gt;Paul Rouzer, translator.

A fanciful description of Han-shan is given by Lüqiu Yin in the introduction that is included in most editions of Han-shan's poems.

During his journey to his prefect appointment, Lüqiu Yin writes, he was visited by Fenggan, who said that he came from the Guoqing monastery. When Lüqiu Yin, who suffered from a headache, asked Fenggan to cure him, Fenggen laughed and said, "The human body consists of but four great elements, and illness is only illusion," then sprinkled water onto Lüqiu Yin, curing him instantly.&lt;ref name="WuChiYu" /&gt;

Lüqiu Yin then asked if there were any sages worthy of becoming of his tutor and Fenggan revealed that at Guoqing monastery were two Bodhisattva incarnations. The first, Han-shan, a man retired to the monastery, was, Fenggan said, an incarnation of [[Manjushri]]; the second, Shide, a man who "looked like a demented beggar coming and going, worked as an errand-boy at the stoves in the kitchen", was an incarnation of [[Samantabhadra]].&lt;ref name="WuChiYu" /&gt;

Three days after arriving at his government appointment, Lüqiu Yin asked his chief administrator if there were any information about Han-shan and Shide. The administrator reported that "seventy [[Li (unit)|li]] (approximately 35 km) to the west of the town of T'ang-hsing, there was a cliff where a poor scholar lived. This scholar was said to be seen going to the Kuo-ch'ing Monastery." Lüqiu Yin went to the monastery and asked where Fenggan, Han-shan, and Shide were living. The monks there told him that Fenggan lived behind the library, but now it was haunted by a tiger who often accompanied him. Lüqiu Yin visited Fenggan's room but all he found was a "house full of the tiger's footprints." When he asked what Fenggan was hired to do, the monks said that Fenggan was assigned to hull rice for the monks and would spend his nights singing to amuse himself.

Lüqiu Yin writes that no one knows where Han-shan came from. He relays descriptions of the poet given by elders from [[Guoqing Temple]] who said that Hanshan was "a poor and eccentric hermit" who "often went to the Kuo-ch'ing Monastery in order to take home the left-overs of the meal, which he carried in a bamboo tube given to him by Shih-te, a monk working in the dining-hall."&lt;ref name="WuChiYu" /&gt;

"Sometimes Han-shan would stroll for hours in a long corridor of the monastery, cry cheerfully, laugh or speak to himself. When he was taken to task or driven away by some of the monks armed with sticks, he would afterwards stand still and laugh, clapping his hands, and then disappear." Lüqiu Yin says that his appearance was that of "an emaciated beggar, but every word he uttered was pithy, meaningful and inspiring. He wore a cap make of birch bark, a simple fur garment, torn and threadbare, and wooden sandals for shoes."

Lüqiu Yin found Han-shan and Shide in the monastery kitchen, where he respectfully made obeisance to them. At sight of this, the two laughed and said, "Feng-kan has a long tongue. You did not recognize Maitreya at sight, why are you making obeisance to us now?" As Han-shan and Shide left hand in hand, the monks were stunned to see such a high official make obeisance to two poor scholars. Lüqiu Yin had two sets of clean clothing prepared and asked the monks to give them to Han-shan and Shide should they ever return. Lüqiu Yin later learned that the two hadn't reappeared at the monastery and had the presents delivered to their dwellings on Tiantai Mountain. When Hanshan saw these delivery men, it is said, he cried "Thieves! Thieves!" and retreated to a cave entrance, exclaiming, "Each of you should exert himself to the utmost," and withdrew into the cave, which closed itself behind him. Han-shan and Shide were never seen again at Guoqing temple.

Lüqiu Yin had all the writings left behind by Han-shan and Shide collected. Han-shan had written on rocks, bamboo bark, trees, and the walls of houses in neighboring villages, and Shide had written a 49-line poem on the wall of an Earth God temple.&lt;ref name="WuChiYu" /&gt;

==Poetry==
Hanshan's poetry consists of Chinese verse, in 3, 5, or 7 character lines; never shorter than 4 lines, and never longer than 34 lines. The language is marked by the use of more colloquial Medieval Vernacular Sinitic than almost any other Tang poet.&lt;ref name="mair26971"&gt;Mair 1992, pp. 269, 271&lt;/ref&gt;  The poems can be seen to fall into three categories: the biographical poems about his life before he arrived at Cold Mountain; the religious and political poems, generally critical of conventional wisdom and those who embrace it; and the transcendental poems, about his sojourn at Cold Mountain.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} They are notable for their straightforwardness, which contrasts sharply with the cleverness and intricateness that marked typical Tang Dynasty poetry.

Red Pine poem 283:
:''Mister Wang the Graduate''
:''laughs at my poor prosody.''
:''I don't know a wasp's waist''
:''much less a crane's knee.''
:''I can't keep my flat tones straight,''
:''all my words come helter-skelter.''
:''I laugh at the poems he writes-''
:''a blind man's songs about the sun!''
(All these terms refer to ways a poem could be defective according to the rigid poetic structures then prevalent.)

Thematically, Hanshan draws heavily on [[Buddhist]] and Taoist themes, often remarking on life's short and transient nature, and the necessity of escape through some sort of transcendence. He varies and expands on this theme, sometimes speaking of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism's]] 'Great Vehicle', and other times of Taoist ways and symbols like cranes.

The following poem begins with the imagery of the burning house and the three carts from the Parable of the Burning House found in [[Lotus Sutra|The Lotus Sutra]], then ends with typical Zen and Taoist imagery of freedom from conceptualizations.

Red Pine poem 253:
:''Children, I implore you''
:''get out of the burning house now.''
:''Three carts await outside''
:''to save you from a homeless life.''
:''Relax in the village square''
:''before the sky, everything's empty.''
:''No direction is better or worse,''
:''East just as good as West.''
:''Those who know the meaning of this''
:''are free to go where they want.''

This mixed influence is probably due to the high preponderance of Taoists and Buddhists in the same area.  The eminent Taoist [[Ge Hong]] acclaimed Mount Tiantai as 'the perfect place for practicing the arts of immortality,' which is probably also why so many Buddhist temples were established in the vicinity as well.

Red Pine poem 13:

:''"Brothers share five districts;''
:''father and sons three states."''
:''To learn where the wild ducks fly''
:''follow the white-hare banner!''
:''Find a magic melon in your dream!''
:''Steal a sacred orange from the palace!''
:''Far away from your native land''
:''swim with fish in a stream!''

Many poems display a deep concern for humanity, which in his view stubbornly refuses to look ahead, and short-sightedly indulges in all manner of vice, like eating animal flesh, piling up sins 'high as [[Mount Meru (Mythology)|Mount Sumeru']]. But he holds out hope that people may yet be saved; 'Just the other day/ a demon became a [[Bodhisattva]].'

Red Pine poem 18:
:''I spur my horse past ruins;''
:''ruins move a traveler's heart.''
:''The old parapets high and low''
:''the ancient graves great and small,''
:''the shuddering shadow of a tumbleweed,''
:''the steady sound of giant trees.''
:''But what I lament are the common bones''
:''unnamed in the records of immortals.''

While Hanshan eschewed fancy techniques and obscure erudition, his poems are still highly evocative at times:
Red Pine poem 106:
:''The layered bloom of hills and streams''
:''Kingfisher shades beneath rose-colored clouds''
:''mountain mists soak my cotton bandanna,''
:''dew penetrates my palm-bark coat.''
:''On my feet are traveling shoes,''
:''my hand holds an old vine staff.''
:''Again I gaze beyond the dusty world-''
:''what more could I want in that land of dreams?''

He is hard to pin down religiously. [[Zen|Chan]] concepts and terminology sometimes appear in his work.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} But he criticized the Buddhists at Tiantai, and he directed criticism at Taoists as well, having had no problem bringing Taoist scriptural quotations, and Taoist language when describing his mountains, into his poems.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Yet, he does not mince words, but tells us precisely where to find the path to Heaven.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Red Pine poem 117:
:''I deplore this vulgar place''
:''where demons dwell with worthies.''
:''They say they're the same,''
:''but is the Tao impartial?''
:''A fox might ape a lion's mien''
:''and claim the disguise is real,''
:''but once ore enters the furnace,''
:''we soon see if it's gold or base.''

Red Pine poem 246:
:''I recently hiked to a temple in the clouds''
:''and met some Taoist priests.''
:''Their star caps and moon caps askew''
:''they explained they lived in the wild.''
:''I asked them the art of transcendence;''
:''they said it was beyond compare,''
:''and called it the peerless power.''
:''The elixir meanwhile was the secret of the gods''
:''and that they were waiting for a crane at death,''
:''or some said they'd ride off on a fish.''
:''Afterwards I thought this through''
:''and concluded they were all fools.''
:''Look at an arrow shot into the sky-''
:''how quickly it falls back to earth.''
:''Even if they could become immortals,''
:''they would be like cemetery ghosts.''
:''Meanwhile the moon of our mind shines bright.''
:''How can phenomena compare?''
:''As for the key to immortality,''
:''within ourselves is the chief of spirits.''
:''Don't follow Lords of the Yellow Turban''
:''persisting in idiocy, holding onto doubts.''

The following poem is attributed to Hanshan's friend, Shide.

:''The higher the trail the steeper it grows''
:''Ten thousand tiers of dangerous cliffs''
:''The stone bridge is slippery with green moss''
:''Cloud after cloud keeps flying by''
:''Waterfalls hang like ribbons of silk''
:''The moon shines down on a bright pool''
:''I climb the highest peak once more''
:''To wait where the lone crane flies''

Red Pine's poem 307:

:''Whoever has Cold Mountain's poems''
:''is better off than those with sutras.''
:''Write them up on your screen''
:''and read them from time to time.''

==Legacy==

The poetry from Cold Mountain has influenced the poets of many generations and cultures. He is especially loved by the Japanese, who know him as Kanzan. Hanshan was a sympathetic and important figure for [[Beat Generation]] writers [[Gary Snyder]] and [[Jack Kerouac]]. In the introduction to his translation which appeared in the ''[[Evergreen Review]]'', Snyder wrote of Hanshan, "He and his sidekick Shih-te (Jittoku in Japanese) became great favorites with Zen painters of later days &amp;mdash; the scroll, the broom, the wild hair and laughter. They became Immortals and you sometimes run into them today in the skidrows, orchards, hobo jungles, and logging camps of America." Kerouac's [[The Dharma Bums]] closes with a vision of Hanshan, and at Snyder's suggestion, Kerouac dedicated the book to the fabled poet.&lt;ref&gt;Suiter 2002, pg. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Rouzer&lt;ref&gt;Rouzer, Paul. On Cold Mountain : A Buddhist Reading of the Hanshan Poems (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; reads the poems as Buddhist teaching poems, referring to [[Hakuin Ekaku]] Kanzan shi sendai kimon 寒山詩闡提記聞 (1746) ("Notes on the Lectures on Cold Mountain's Poems at Icchantika Cave") that largely ignores the biographical reading most commonly found in other sources.

The '''Hitler Youth conspiracy''' was a case investigated by the Soviet [[secret police]], during the [[Great Purge]] in the late 1930s. Essentially a theory in search of evidence, it nonetheless resulted in the arrest of numerous German teenagers and some in their twenties and beyond, who were accused of having been fascist, [[anti-communist]] members of the [[Hitler Youth]] and of working against the [[Soviet Union]]. Teenagers from the [[Karl Liebknecht School]], from [[Children's Home No. 6]], and adults from factories and elsewhere were arrested, tortured and imprisoned. Many were executed or died in custody. Some were the children of leading communists. Within years, the investigation was found to have been faulty and a number of the investigators were also arrested, with sentences ranging from imprisonment to execution. In the 1950s, following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], a new examination of the files revealed many of the accusations to have been baseless and a number of the victims were [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]].

== Background ==
Beginning with the earliest history of the Soviet Union, with the [[Red Terror]] and subsequent [[political repression]] of suspected opponents of the [[October Revolution]], there were purges&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]], ''Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives''. Anchor (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;152–155. {{ISBN|0-385-47954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mass repressions within the Soviet Union, as well as purges of the Communist Party, both within the Soviet Union and abroad. Waves of persecutions occurred, in which the number of those charged with being counter-revolutionary or fascist increased substantially. In his "[[Secret Speech]]", [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said that between 1936 and 1937, the number of arrests for counter-revolutionary crimes grew ten times.&lt;ref name="nk-speech"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/khrushchev/1956/02/24.htm "Speech to 20th Congress of the C.P.S.U."] Marxists Internet Archive. Retrieved November 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At the February–March 1937 [[plenary meeting]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), there was a renewed call to purge the party of [[Trotskyite]] elements, unleashing a wave of mass terror&lt;ref name="nk-speech" /&gt; in the summer of 1937.&lt;ref name="hs-1"&gt;Hans Schafranek, [http://www.iwk-online.de/2001-1_schafranek.html "Kontingentierte 'Volksfeinde' und 'Agenturarbeit'"] Internationale wissenschaftliche Korrespondenz zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung (January 2001). Retrieved November 26, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "counter-revolutionary fascist groups" came into use within the Soviet secret police in 1938 as they carried out the purges. German members of the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] reported at April 28, 1938 meeting that there had been 842 arrests.&lt;ref name="sergei"&gt;Sergej Shurawljow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vOGvnxuw5EC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=1PtMnbYHwt&amp;dq=angeblich%20hitler-jugend&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''"Ich bitte um Arbeit in der Sowjetunion": das Schicksal deutscher Facharbeiter im Moskau der 30er Jahre''] Christoph Links Verlag (March 2003), p.&amp;nbsp;163.

As early as 1930, the Soviet secret police, the [[Cheka]], later the [[NKVD|People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs]] (NKVD), investigated teenaged Germans suspected of being members of the [[Hitler Youth]], but these investigations preceded the Great Purge and those arrested were not given the harsh sentences of later years. Most were released before 1934.&lt;ref name="laqueur-171"&gt;Walter Laqueur (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-hgM5t1iu2MC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;ots=MZomupvnEh&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;171–172] Retrieved November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As the Great Purge swept up communist activists in massive arrests, their spouses and children were also persecuted.

== Aftermath ==
Mikhail Persitz was ousted from the NKVD and arrested in April 1939 and indicted with three paragraphs of [[Article 58]]. He was tortured and confessed his guilt, though he later recanted. An NKVD troop tribunal tried Persitz and found him guilty of all charges. He was shot on February 2, 1940.&lt;ref name="stalin-219" /&gt; Ivan Sorokin, who had been head of the 3rd Department of the [[Main Directorate of State Security]], was charged with mishandling prisoners and fabricating charges.

[[File:Jonestown Houses.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Houses in Jonestown.]]
The '''Jonestown conspiracy theories''' are [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] centering on the [[Jonestown|Peoples Temple Agricultural Project]] and the Jonestown massacre. Many proponents of such conspiracy theories contend that outside forces were involved in what occurred at the commune, including the massacre. These theories often include the assertion that the events in Jonestown represented CIA efforts in mind control or similar modes of social experimentation, often believed by proponents of such theories to be a covert example of [[Project MKUltra]] in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16582 |title=Reconstructing Reality: Conspiracy Theories About Jonestown |website=Jonestown.sdsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrepancies during investigation==
Headlines in the ''[[New York Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;New York Post, Nov 28, 1978: "Cult Dies in South American Jungle: 400 Die in Mass Suicide, 700 Flee into Jungle."&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Nov 21, 1978; Nov 22, 1978; Nov 23, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Examiner, Nov 22, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; originally cited reports from the Guyanese army that 408 people had killed themselves while more than 500 others managed to flee into the surrounding jungle.

The U.S. military arrived several days later and the body count quickly rose; first it was 700, then 780, to a final tally given seven days after the Guyanese report of 909 dead, 4 followers dead at the Temple offices in the capital of Georgetown, and 5 members of Representative Leo Ryan's delegation, including the Congressman himself, murdered at the Port Kaituma airstrip. Only 167 Jonestown inhabitants were reported to have survived.

In explaining the discrepancies, one U.S. official said the Guyanese "couldn't count"&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 25, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; while another said that the 400 corpses initially found had just been stacked in such a way that they hid more than 500 more. The dead littered the compound, with piles of bodies decomposing atop one another near the pavilion, and corpses in other buildings or far-flung positions were not readily apparent.

While the total number of settlers living in Jonestown at the time of the massacre has never been properly verified, based on the population estimates there could be anywhere between 20 and 120 followers not accounted for. Conspiracy theorists and at least one Congressional aide claimed these people formed the so-called "Red Brigade", which was armed guards (or perhaps brainwashed assassins) who carried out the attack at the airport as well as providing more typical duties maintaining security along the roads and around the compound.

According to the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 14, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; the first trained medical official on the scene was the Guyanese [[coroner]] Dr. Leslie C. Mootoo. He and his assistants examined over 100 of the bodies during a 32-hour period and found that the adults had all been injected with [[cyanide]] in places which they could not have reached without assistance, such as between the shoulder blades, and that many of them had also been shot. (Charles Huff, one of the first U.S. soldiers on the scene, also reported having seen "many gunshot victims", as well as other victims who had been shot with a [[crossbow]], all of whom appeared to have been attempting to flee.) Mootoo also felt that the children were incapable of consenting to suicide. Based on his preliminary findings, Mootoo speculated that the majority of those who died in Jonestown may have been [[murder]]ed.

Despite Guyana law requiring an [[autopsy]] for any unnatural death, the Americans insisted that the cause of death was readily apparent and additional inquiry was not necessary.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Relatives and officials back in the [[United States]] complained about being kept from the remains, and according to the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 12, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Sturmer, then President of the [[National Association of Medical Examiners]], sent an [[open letter]] to the U.S. Army complaining about the handling of remains and the illegal cremations of most of the Jonestown victims. For a number of reasons, some legal and some merely logistical, the bodies were not flown out of the remote jungle location of Jonestown for up to a week before being flown to [[New Jersey]], which allowed significant decomposition to occur. Ultimately seven autopsies were conducted but the medical examiners were not informed of Dr. Mootoo's preliminary findings and the corpses were far too decayed for injection sites or other wounds to remain identifiable during the procedures.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times November 26, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Richard Dwyer==
Despite the growing allegations of misconduct against the Peoples Temple in the U.S., the move to Jonestown was given the full support of the American Embassy in Guyana. Some{{who|date=November 2010}} claim their cooperation was facilitated by Larry Layton's brother-in-law, as well as people including [[Walter Mondale]], [[Rosalynn Carter]], and [[George Moscone]]. Others{{who|date=November 2010}} point out that the Georgetown CIA station was in office space within the U.S. Embassy building itself, and at least three diplomatic officials there were allegedly CIA assets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Richard Dwyer, whose name was listed in ''[[Who's Who in the CIA]],'' was [[State Department|Deputy Chief of Mission]] of the U.S. Embassy to Guyana at the time. There exists a strong likelihood{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} that Ryan would not have been at the airstrip during the attack without direct intervention by Dwyer. Ryan had intended to remain at the Jonestown compound to continue interviewing families while those wishing to return to the United States were taken to the airstrip, but as the dump truck was leaving Ryan was attacked by Peoples Temple follower and alleged Red Brigade member [[Don Sly]] (also known as Ujara). Ujara wielded only a knife and the attack was quickly ended. Ryan was cut in the attack&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/jonestown/|title=Jonestown:The Life and Death of the People's Temple|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to board the dump truck headed to the airstrip. Already on the dump truck was [[Larry Layton]], who, despite warnings by the defectors that Layton was a strong supporter of [[Jim Jones]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, had been allowed to join the group at the last minute. Layton participated in the attacks on the Ryan delegation, ultimately serving nearly twenty years in prison after being disarmed and failing to kill his targets on the [[Cessna]], becoming the only Peoples Temple follower to face criminal charges for these events.

On September 27, 1980, a column by investigative reporter [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] was published under the title "[[CIA]] Involved In Jonestown Massacre."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Jack, "CIA Involved In Jonestown Massacre, September 27, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anderson, Dwyer and Jones had ties to the CIA, with Dwyer's ties dating to at least 1959; when quizzed directly about this alleged CIA involvement, Dwyer responded "no comment." At one point on the sound-recording made during the mass suicide, Jones' own voice commands, "Take Dwyer on down to the east house" and a short time later, Jones says "Get Dwyer out of here before something happens to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=29081 |title=Jonestown Audiotape Primary Project : Transcripts, Tape Number : Q 042, the so-called "Death Tape" |accessdate=2007-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, rather than being in Jonestown, numerous witnesses, including reporters for the Washington Post and San Francisco Chronicle, saw Dwyer miles away at the [[Port Kaituma]] airstrip.&lt;ref name="Tim Reiterman 1982 page 527"&gt;Tim Reiterman (1982) "Raven: The Untold Story of The Rev. Jim Jones and His People" {{ISBN|0-525-24136-1}} page 527&lt;/ref&gt; Dwyer arrived there with some local constables just before the ambush by the Jonestown "Red Brigade" security squad.&lt;ref name="Tim Reiterman 1982 page 527"/&gt; Dwyer was also shot in the buttocks during the Red Brigade's ambush at that location.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Reiterman (1982) "Raven: The Untold Story of The Rev. Jim Jones and His People" {{ISBN|0-525-24136-1}} page 534&lt;/ref&gt; Dwyer stayed at the airstrip with the survivors during the night.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Reiterman (1982) "Raven: The Untold Story of The Rev. Jim Jones and His People" {{ISBN|0-525-24136-1}} page 537&lt;/ref&gt; Although no one can be certain, Jones' slurred speech and the apparent confusion evidenced in his followers on the tape at his reference to Dwyer may indicate that Jones mistook someone else (perhaps Charles Garry) for Dwyer.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Views from the Soviet Union==
''The Jonestown Carnage: A CIA Crime (1978)'' (Russian: ''Гибель Джонстауна - преступление ЦРУ'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bey.livejournal.com/36599.html |title=Джонстаун-1: bey |website=Bey.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614145413/http://bey.livejournal.com/36599.html |archivedate=2016-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by S.F. Alinin, B.G. Antonov and A.N. Itskov was published in 1987 in the Soviet Union, relying upon both unfounded allegations and some relatively indisputable facts. The book cites many characteristics of the Peoples Temple which may have made it unpopular with the U.S. Government. For example, citing the numerous tapes and writings of the Temple, the book notes that the Peoples Temple practiced [[Wikt:apostolic|apostolic]] [[socialism]], preached [[atheism]], and opposed what it termed to be [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[imperialism]] by the U.S. Government. The book also cites the numerous meetings that representatives of the Peoples' Temple had with Soviet embassy officials to negotiate a potential exodus to the [[Soviet Union]]. The book also references the October 2, 1978 visit to Jonestown by Soviet Embassy representative Feodor Timofeyev, who praised the commune for being a socialist haven, wagging its collective finger in the face of the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=27428 |title=Q352 Transcript |website=Jonestown.sdsu.edu |date=2014-04-07 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to documented events, the book also includes contentious allegations not revealed in the Jonestown tapes or other available evidence. One such item describes a statement by Timofeyev of a purported meeting on November 18, 1978, with Deborah Touchette, whom Timofeyev claimed passed him a briefcase with cash and Peoples Temple documents inside. Another report in the book concerned a call from Sharon Amos, staying at the Peoples Temple office in Georgetown with her three children on the day of the massacre, where Amos allegedly described a radio message from out of Jonestown about military helicopters and armed men approaching the compound. Amos and her three children died upon Jones' order.

Based upon these and other allegations, the author contends that the group members were assassinated by CIA agents and mercenaries to prevent further political emigration from the U.S. as well as suppress opposition to the U.S. regime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">'''Josephine Lazarus''' (23 March 1846 - 1910) was an American essayist, book critic, [[transcendentalist]], and [[Zionist]].{{sfn|Winter|2007|p=31}}

Lazarus was born March 23, 1846, in [[New York City]], the daughter of Moses and Esther (Nathan) Lazarus. The first piece of work to bring her into prominent notice was the biographical sketch of her sister, [[Emma Lazarus]], which first appeared in ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', October, 1888, and was afterward prefixed to “The Poems of Emma Lazarus” (New York and [[Boston]], 1889). Between 1890 and 1893 she wrote articles on [[Marie Bashkirtseff]] in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' and on [[Louisa May Alcott]] and [[Margaret Fuller]] in ''The Century Magazine''. In 1895, six of her essays on Jewish subjects, which had appeared from 1892 to 1895 in ''The Century Magazine'' and ''[[The American Hebrew|The Jewish Messenger]]'' were collected and published in book form under the title ''The Spirit of Judaism''. The plea addressed to Jews in these essays was to acquire a larger knowledge of the Jewish situation, to emerge from their spiritual isolation, and to enter into fellowship with those among whom they live; and the plea addressed to Christians was for a more liberal attitude toward Jews and Jewish thought.{{sfn|Singer|Adler|1906|p=652}}

Lazarus was a featured speaker at the [[Jewish Women’s Congress]] in conjunction with the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 with her essay, "The Outlook of Judaism".{{sfn|Jewish Publication Society of America|1894|p=263}}{{sfn|Appleby|Chang|Goodwin|2015|p=370}} Between 1897 and 1902 Lazarus wrote, in ''[[The American Hebrew]]'', ''The New World'', and ''The Maccabaean'' four articles on aspects of the [[Zionist]] movement, with which she was in sympathy. Besides, she published, in 1899, a book entitled ''Madame Dreyfus''; and for many years she was a contributor of numerous book-notices to ''[[The Critic (magazine)|The Critic]]''.{{sfn|Singer|Adler|1906|p=652}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3573">The '''King Alfred Plan''' was a fictional [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-led scheme supporting an international effort to eliminate [[African diaspora|people of African descent]]. Specifically it defined how to deal with the threat of a [[black people|black]] uprising in the [[United States]] by cordoning off black people into [[concentration camps]] in the event of a major racial incident.

== 1967 Novel ==
The Plan first appeared in [[John A. Williams]]' 1967 novel, ''The Man Who Cried I Am'', an account of the life and death of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]. In the afterword to later editions, Williams compares the King Alfred Plan to intelligence programs devised by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] in the 1960s to monitor the movements of black [[militant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040927/campbell/3 Campbell, James. "Black American in Paris", ''[[The Nation]]'', September 27, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It also bears similarities to rumors in the early 1950s surrounding the [[McCarran Act]], an [[anti-Communist]] law, in which [[Subversion (politics)|political subversives]] were to be rounded up and placed in concentrations camps during a [[National emergency#United States|national emergency]]. When his novel was first published, Williams photocopied portions of the book detailing the King Alfred Plan and left copies in subway car seats around [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83553062.html Boyd, Herbert. "The man and the plan: conspiracy theories and paranoia in our culture", ''Black Issues Book Review'', March-April 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Cultural dissemination ===
As a result, word of the King Alfred Plan spread throughout the black community. The truth of its existence was often assumed to be unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83553062.html Boyd, Herbert. "The man and the plan: conspiracy theories and paranoia in our culture", ''Black Issues Book Review'', March-April 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Performer and musician [[Gil Scott-Heron]] created the song "King Alfred Plan," included on his ([[1972 in music|1972]]) album [[Free Will (Gil Scott-Heron album)|''Free Will'']], that takes the Plan at face value.  [[Jim Jones]], head of the 'apostolic socialist'  [[People's Temple]], discussed the Plan at length in numerous recordings of his rant-style speeches both in the USA and in the [[Jonestown]] community in [[Guyana]], treating it as completely genuine.

In an interview with ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' Williams explained that he developed the idea when thinking about the question "What would any administration do in a situation when a large segment of the population was discontented and tearing down the neighborhood . . . threatening the order and the established regime?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Celebrated Authors saying Blacks facing genocide in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22King+Alfred+Plan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKmMnP-KXOAhVDDMAKHS0SBCw4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22King%20Alfred%20Plan%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 August 2016|publisher=Jet Magazine|date=14 October 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ZenBuddhism}}
The '''Línjì school''' ({{zh|t=臨濟宗}}) is a school of [[Chan Buddhism]] named after [[Linji Yixuan]] (d. 866). It took prominence in [[Song dynasty|Song China]] (960–1279), spread to Japan as the [[Rinzai school]] and influenced the [[nine mountain schools]] of [[Korean Seon]].

==History==

===Song dynasty===
Before the Song dynasty, the Linji school was rather obscure and very little is known about its early history.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979 CE)===
The [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] ({{zh|t=五代十國|s=五代十国|p=Wǔdài Shíguó}}) (907–960/979 CE) was an era of political upheaval between the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]] and the founding of the Song. During this period, five dynasties quickly succeeded one another in the north, and more than twelve independent states were established, of which only ten are traditionally listed.

The spallation of China in various regions and kingdoms led to a diversification of Chan factions{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} as reflected in the [[Five Houses of Chán]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The [[Fayan school]] was especially influential in the [[Southern Tang]] (937-975) and [[Wuyue]] (907-978).{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86-87}} It propagated ''jiaochan yizhi'', "harmony between Chan and the Teaching", in opposition to ''jiaowai biechuan'', "a special transmission outside the teaching", the latter eventually becoming one of the defining slogans of Chan.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86-91}}

===Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127)===
The Song was a ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] between 960 and 1279. It is divided into two distinct periods: Northern and Southern Song.

During the Northern Song (960–1127), the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now [[Kaifeng]]) and the dynasty controlled most of [[China proper]]. The Fayan school was the first faction to gain recognition at the Song court, due to the influence of the buddhist scholar-official Zanning (919–1001).{{sfn|Young|2009}} After his death this position was taken over by the Linji school.{{sfn|Young|2009}}

The Linji school brought together the classical elements of Chan Buddhism:
* The ''denlu''-genre, the "Transmission of the Lamp";{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}
* The ''yulu''-genre, the recorded sayings of the masters of the Tang;{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}
* The ''[[Kōan|gongan]]'' collections, describing dialogues and interactions between masters and students, supplemented with introductions, commentary and poetry;{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}
* The [[Hua Tou]] practice, the meditative concentration on the "word-head" of a gongan as an aid in attaining [[kenshō|jiànxìng]];{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}
* The notion of "a special transmission outside the scripture" as one of the defining characteristics of Zen.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

All of these elements, which shaped the picture of the iconoclastic Zen-master who transmits a wordless truth, were shaped by and dependent on ''literary''  products that shaped the [[Zen#Zen narratives|Traditional Zen Narrative]] which furthered the position of the Linji-school. It is possible that this narrative does not describe the actual Chan-practice, of the Song-Dynasty, nor of the Tang Dynasty.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

==== Linji====
The Linji-school became the dominant school within Chan at the beginning of the Song due to support from literati and the court.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} The figure of Linji, as one of the exemplary masters of Chan, was detailed in a series of writings in the tenth and eleventh century, which supported the Linji school and contributed to its influence and standing.{{sfn|Young|2009}}

=====Zutang ji (952)=====
The first mention of Linji is in the ''Zutang ji'' (祖堂集 "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall), compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} The ''Zutang ji'' was written to support the [[Xuefeng Yicun]] lineage. It pictures this lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou school.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It was written by two students of Zhaoqing Wendeng (884-972), a dharma descendant of [[Xuefeng Yicun]], whose lineage was traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]] (700-790). Xuefeng's student [[Yunmen Wenyan]] (862 or 864–949 CE) established the [[Yunmen school]], while Xuefeng's "grand-disciple" Fayan Wenyi  established the [[Fayan school]].{{sfn|Jones|2010}}

=====Jingde Chuangdeng lu (1004)=====
The ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (景德傳燈錄), compiled in 1004 by Daoyuan, is one of the essential Chan writings. It was compiled by a member of the [[Fayan school]], but published after editorial revision by Yang Yi (974-1020), a leading Song literati figure, and a supporter of the Linji faction at the Song court.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} The Fayang school still has prominence among the competing factions which are portrayed in the Chuangdeng lu, but the growing influence of the Linji-faction is emerging in this document.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

The ''Transmission of the Lamp'' first gives brief biographical information on Lijni, followed by Linji's interactions with Hunagbo, to strengthen the claim of Linji's descendancy form Hunagbo and the Mazu-lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

The ''Transmission of the Lamp'' served several needs and interests:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}
# The needs of the Song to use Buddhism in centralizing the new state, and maintain good relations with neighboring Buddhist nations;
# The interests of the Linji-faction, which was dominant around the capital city Bianjing;
# The wish of the new dynasty to establish its own cultural style (''wen'');{{refn|group=note|''Wen'' (文), which includes [[Chinese literature]], [[Chinese culture]] and [[Chinese writing]]}}
# The needs of literati, who were supporting a cultural style which endorsed free, spontaneous expression, different from a more traditional "ancient culture" (''guwen'').

The convergence of these influences lead to the creation of the image of the iconoclastic Chan-master, who fulfilled all these requirements:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}
{{quote|He was free and spontaneous, and so served the liberal ''wen'' faction in their struggle against the ''guwen'' partisans at court. He was untainted by any need for political power, and so did not threaten the authority of the dynasty or its bureaucracy. He was Buddhist, and so could be brought forward when the need arose to show that the empire supported Buddhism. He made for entertaining reading, which suited the needs of a newly-literated reading public. Finally, he asserted the superiority of the Linji lineage and its "golden age of Chan" style, thus suiting the then-dominant faction.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}}}

Nevertheless, this picture deviates from what is believed to be the character of many of the Chan-masters from earlier times, who were fairly conventional: "they routinely accepted invitations to court, received purple robes and honorary titles, and had monasteries built for them by rulers and officials".{{sfn|Jones|2010}}

=====Tiansheng Guangdeng lu (1029)=====
According to Welter, the real founder of the Linji school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (首山省念)(926-993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The ''Tiansheng-Era Expanded Lamp Record'' (天聖廣燈錄), compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗)(988-1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the [[Hongzhou school]] of [[Mazu Daoyi]], displacing the prominence of the Fayan lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It also established the slogan of "a special transmission outside the teaching", supporting the Linji-school claim of "Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings".{{sfn|Young|2009}}

Linji's teachings are already more or less completed in this document, and he is pictured as the dharma-heir of [[Huangbo Xiyun]] (d.850). The Guangdeng lu contains brief biographical details on the life and actions of Linji.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

The main elements of classical Chan are fully displayed in the ''Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record'': encounter dialogue, enlightenment verses, the sayings of the masters and the commentaries upon these sayings, the lack of historical contextualization and biographical detail.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}

=====Sijia Yulu (1066–1069)=====
The ''Sijia yulu'' "Discourse Records of the Four Masters", compiled 1066–1069 by Huanglong Huinan (1002–1069), contains the discourse records of [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788), [[Baizhang Huaihai]] (720–814), [[Huangbo Xiyun]] (d.850) and Linji, the major patriarchs of the Tang Dynasty according to the Linji faction. In this text, Linji is explicitly placed in line with these teachers of the [[Hongzhou school]].{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

Chan orthodoxy was still not settled by this time. At around the same time the ''Deshan Sijia lu'' was compiled, a comparable text containing the records of [[Deshan Xuanjian]] (780–865), whose lineage was traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]], and included the Chan-branch of [[Xuefeng Yicun]], Yumen and Fayan.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} Other ''Sijia lu'' included the ''Huanglong Sijia'' (compiled 1141) and the ''Ciming Sijia lu'' (compiled 1153).{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

=====Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi yulu (1120)=====
The ''Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi yulu'' ("The record of Linji"), compiled by Yuanjue Zongan in 1120, is the classic version of the record of Linji. Yuanjue Zongan belonged to the Yunmen-faction, and also re-issued the ''Yunmen yulu'', the "Discourse Records of Yunmen".{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

The separate publication of Linji's records signals the newly acquired status of Linji as one of Chan's major patriarchs.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It also reflects the changing identity of Chan during the Song Dynasty, and the growing status of yulu-texts.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

The text of Linji's record is the same as in the ''Tiansheng Guangdeng lu'', but in a different order. The ''Linji yulu'' opens with lectures given by Ljnji at the request of the prefect Governor and other officials, highlighting the close connection of the Linji-faction with the court. The biographical data on Linji's life are expanded, and appear at the end of the text.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

In the ''Linji yulu'' the phrase "a special transmission outside the scriptures" is ascribed to Linji himself. It served as a leading slogan for the establishment of the Linji Chan identity by the Linji-faction of Shoushan Shengnian, and was seen as trademark of the Linji Chan identity by Yang Yi and Li Zunxu, the court-related literati who had an essential role in the construction of Linji's record and reputation.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

===Southern Song Dynasty (1127–1279)===
The '''Southern Song''' ({{zh|c=南宋}}, 1127–1279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of [[northern and southern China|northern China]] to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the [[Yangtze]] and established their capital at Lin'an (now [[Hangzhou]]). The principal figures of the Linji-school also moved to the south.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=20}}

====Dahui and the hua-tou practice====
During the 12th century, a clear difference between the Linji and the Caodong schools emerged. The two schools were competing for support of the literati, who became more powerful when the Song-government started to limit her influence on society. [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (1091–1157) of the Caodong-school emphasized silent illumination or [[shikantaza]] as a means for solitary practice, which could be undertaken by lay-followers. [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163) introduced [[kōan|kanhua practice]], "observing the word-head", as a means of solitary practice.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}} He organized the study of koans into a system,{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=20}} which was exported to Japan in this period.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=21}}

===Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368)===
The ''Yuan Dynasty'' was the empire established by [[Kublai Khan]], the leader of the Mongol clan of the [[Borjigin]], after the [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] and the [[Song dynasty#Southern Song, 1127–1279|Southern Song]]. Chan teachings started to be mixed with [[Pure Land Buddhism]], as in the teachings of [[Zhongfeng Mingben]] (1263-1323).

===Ming dynasty (1368-1644)===
Chan Buddhism enjoyed something of a revival in the Ming dynasty with teachers such as [[Hanshan Deqing]] (憨山德清), who wrote and taught extensively on both Chan and Pure Land Buddhism; [[Miyun Yuanwu (17th century)|Miyun Yuanwu]] (密雲圓悟), who came to be seen posthumously as the first patriarch of the [[Ōbaku|Ōbaku Zen]] school; as well as [[Yunqi Zhuhong]] (雲棲祩宏) and [[Ouyi Zhixu]] (蕅益智旭).

Chan was taught alongside Pure Land Buddhism in many Chinese Buddhist monasteries. In time much of the distinction between them was lost, and many masters taught both Chan and Pure Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharf|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the downfall of the Ming, several Chinese Chan masters fled to Japan, founding the Ōbaku school.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=299}}

===Qing Dynasty (1644–1912)===
The [[Qing dynasty]] was the last imperial dynasty of China.

At the beginning of the Qing, Chan was "reinvented" by the "revival of beating and shouting practices" by Miyun Yuanwu (1566–1642), and the publication of the ''Wudeng yantong'' ("The strict transmission of the five Chan schools") by Feiyin Tongrong’s (1593–1662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of "lineage unknown" (''sifa weixiang''), thereby excluding several prominent [[Caodong]] monks.{{sfn|Meng-Tat Chia|2011}}

===Modern times (after 1912)===
[[File:Master Wei-Chueh.png|thumb|right|upright|Traditional Chan Buddhist Grand Master [[Wei Chueh]] in [[Taiwan]], sitting in meditation.]]
After further centuries of decline during the Qing, Chan was revived again in the early 20th century by [[Xuyun]], a well-known figure of 20th-century Chinese Buddhism. Many Chan teachers today trace their lineage back to Xuyun, including [[Sheng-yen]] (聖嚴, Shèngyán) and [[Hsuan Hua]] (宣化, Xuānhuà), who have propagated Chan in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st century.

Chan was repressed in China during the recent modern era in the early periods of the [[China|People's Republic]], but has more recently been re-asserting itself on the mainland, and has a significant following in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] as well as among [[Overseas Chinese]].

==Influence==

===Japan===
{{main article|Rinzai school|Japanese Zen}}

The Japanese Zen sect known as the [[Rinzai school]] is a branch of the lineage Linji founded. The smaller Japanese Ōbaku school came to Japan in the 17th century as a separate Linji lineage and existed in Japan for many years as a culturally Ming Dynasty Chinese Zen within Japan.

Later the Ōbaku semi-merged into the Rinzai lineage after [[Hakuin Ekaku]]'s revival of Rinzai in the 18th century. Today the Rinzai and Obaku schools are closely related.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html Joint Council for Japanese Rinzai and Obaku zen]&lt;/ref&gt;

The now-defunct [[Fuke-shū]] also had close ties to the Rinzai school and claimed affiliation with the Linji lineage.

===Korea===
The Linji school had a considerable influence on the already existing Korean [[Jogye Order]], the name adopted by the [[nine mountain schools]], which were established by students of [[Mazu Daoyi]]. [[Jinul]] (知訥) (1158-1210) took over the [[Hua Tou]] practice of Dahui, but mixed it with the intellectual teachings of [[Guifeng Zongmi]] (780–841). Jinul emphasized [[Subitism|sudden insight]], to be followed by gradual cultivation.{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}

'''Ljubomir Nedić''' (24 April 1858 – 29 July 1902) was a popular [[Serbia]]n writer, philosopher, and literary critic. In the 1890s, two groups were formed in literary criticism, one by the critics gathered around the literary journal ''Delo'', and the other led by Ljubomir Nedić. He was the first to apply aesthetic criteria to literature in his theoretical and critical contributions to the periodical ''Srpski pregled'', the Serbian Review.

==Biography==

Ljubomir Nedić was born in [[Belgrade]], Serbia, on 24 April 1858. His philosophical work was neglected by the historians of Serbian philosophy from the moment the Nazi occupied the country in 1941 and suppressed after the end of [[World War II]] by the communists who took power. It wasn't until the break-up of Communist Yugoslavia in the 1990s that an interest in his work re-kindled.

Nedić was educated chiefly in Belgrade, [[Jena]] and [[Leipzig]] where he studied medicine, attending lectures on anatomy and psychology and visiting hospitals. After some contemplation he abandoned medecine in favour of philosophy, logic and psychology. Ljubomir Nedić was a student of the world-renowned [[Wilhelm Wundt]], "the father of experimental psychology". Nedić's doctoral thesis, defended in 1884, was on contemporary British logic, primarily that of [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]]. In 1885 he was made a doctor of philosophy at the [[University of Leipzig]] in recognition of ''Die Lehre von der Quantification des Pradikats in der neuern englische Logik'' (The Doctrine Concerning the Quantified Predicate in Recent English Philosophy) his year-long research paper written in [[London]]. After ten years spent abroad studying at Jena, Leipzig and London universities, he completed his doctorate under Wundt, and obtained a professorship at [[Belgrade Higher School|Belgrade's Grande École (''Velika Škola'')]], where he acquired great influence by the dignity of his personal character. In Belgrade in 1889 he wrote and published ''O sofizmima'' (On Sophisms)., which brought him more recognition. During the following years he published works on Plato and Socrates, as well as a history of philosophy. The strain of the 14 years of continuous work undermined his health and he was compelled to retire from his professorship at the [[Grande École]] (which became accredited as the [[University of Belgrade]] in 1905) in 1899. After his retirement he further developed his philosophical position, a speculative eclecticism through which he endeavoured to reconcile metaphysical idealism with the naturalistic and mechanical standpoint of science. In 1890, two groups were formed in literary criticism: one led by Nedić, and the other by the critics gathered around the literary journal ''Delo''. Nedić was the first to apply in the 1890s [[aesthetic]] criteria to literature in his theoretical and critical contributions to the periodical ''Srpski pregled'', of which he was the editor.

In 1901 Nedić published his second book ''"Noviji srpski pisci"'', as an introduction included the chapter ''"O književnoi kritiki"''. By then, he was already established as a Serbian new literary critic.

==Thought==

Ljubomir Nedić's significance in the history of Serbian thought depends on his position as the philosopher of the great scientific movement of the second half of the nineteenth century, and of the friendship and admiration with which he was regarded by Wundt, and all of his contemporaries, disciples of Hamilton, and Spencer. Nedić was also influenced by the philosophical writings of [[Eufrosin Poteca]].

His part in philosophy and logic was that of a historian and commentator, for which he was especially qualified by his clarity of exposition; his point of view is one of the main Hegelian traits. Moreover, a synthetist who believes and practices synthetic methods or principles.

His ''Die Lehre von der Quintification des Pradikats in der neueren englische Logik'' (Leipzig, 1885) is perhaps the most accredited modern work of its kind before the start of the 20th century. He made valuable contributions to the study of modern literary criticism, along with [[Svetozar Marković]], [[Jovan Skerlić]], [[Bogdan Popović]], Pavle Popović, [[Slobodan Jovanović]], and Branko Lazarević. His work was quoted in [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]]'s ''Logic and Methaphysics'' (1892) and [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s ''Textbook of Logic'' (1893) even before the start of the 20th century. He died at Belgrade on 29 July 1902.

==His Work==

The last years of his life were devoted chiefly as a literary critic. He aimed sharp criticism at the utilitarian theory of art espoused by the late [[Svetozar Marković]], who accentuated the social role of literature in Realism. Quite the opposite, Nedić emphasized the aesthetic side of the lyric poem, using [[Vojislav Ilić]]'s work as examples. In 1893 he founded and edited ''Srpski pregled'', a literary review, for which he also acted as a literary and dramatic critic, and the influence of his individuality soon made itself noticed. His books in literary criticism are still being reprinted, ''Iz novije srpske lirike'' (1893), ''Noviji srpski pisci'' (1901), and ''Kritičke studije'' (1910).

As an academic critic educated abroad, Ljubomir Nedić and [[Bogdan Popović]] are responsible for the development of Serbian [[Modernism]] in prose, verse and art.

'''Friedrich Karl Christian Ludwig Büchner''' (29 March 1824 – 1 May 1899) was a German [[philosopher]], [[physiologist]] and [[physician]] who became one of the exponents of 19th-century [[scientific materialism]].

==Biography==
Büchner was born at [[Darmstadt]] on 29 March 1824. From 1842 to 1848 he studied [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[mineralogy]], [[philosophy]] and [[medicine]] at the [[University of Giessen]], where he graduated in 1848 with a dissertation entitled ''Beiträge zur Hall'schen Lehre von einem excitomotorischen Nervensystem'' (Contributions to the [[Hallerian physiology|Hallerian Theory]] of an Excitomotor Nervous System). Afterwards, he continued his studies at the [[University of Strasbourg]], the [[University of Würzburg]] (where he studied [[pathology]] with the great [[Rudolf Virchow]]) and the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1852 he became lecturer in [[medicine]] at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he published his magnum opus ''Kraft und Stoff: Empirisch-naturphilosophische Studien'' (''Force and Matter: Empiricophilosophical Studies'', 1855).&lt;ref&gt;Available online at [https://archive.org/details/kraftundstoff02bcgoog archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, the product, according to Lange, of a fanatical enthusiasm for humanity, he sought to demonstrate the indestructibility of [[matter]], and the finality of physical [[force]]. The extreme [[scientific materialism]] of this work caused so much opposition that he was compelled to give up his post at Tübingen, and he retired to [[Darmstadt]], where he practiced as a physician and contributed regularly to pathological and physiological magazines.

He continued his philosophical work in defense of materialism, and published ''Natur und Geist'' (''Nature and Spirit'', 1857), ''Aus Natur und Wissenschaft'' (''From Nature and Science'', vol. I., 1862; vol. II., 1884), ''Der Fortschritt in Natur und Geschichte im Lichte der Darwinschen Theorie'' (''Progress in Nature and History in the Light of the Darwinian Theory'', 1884), ''Tatsachen und Theorien aus dem naturwissenschaftlichen Leben der Gegenwart'' (''Facts and Theories in the Scientific Life of Present'', 1887), ''Fremdes und Eigenes aus dem geistligen Leben der Gegenwart'' (''Strangers and Selves in the Spiritual Life of the Present'', 1890), ''Darwinismus und Socialismus'' (''Darwinism and Socialism'', 1894), ''Im Dienste der Wahrheit'' (''In the Service of Truth'', 1899).

Ludwig Büchner's materialism was the founding ground for the [[Freethought|freethinker]]s' movement in Germany. In 1881 he founded in [[Frankfurt]] the "[[German Freethinkers League]]" ("Deutsche Freidenkerbund").

He died at Darmstadt on 1 May 1899.

In estimating Büchner's philosophy it must be remembered that he was primarily a [[physiologist]], not a [[metaphysics|metaphysician]]. Matter and force (or [[energy]]) are, he maintained, [[Infinity|infinite]]; the [[Conservation of energy|conservation of force]] follows from the [[Conservation of matter|imperishability of matter]], the ultimate basis of all science.

Büchner is not always clear in his theory of the relation between matter and force. At one time he refuses to explain it, but generally he assumes that all natural and spiritual forces are indwelling in matter. Just as a [[steam engine]], he says in ''Kraft und Stoff'' (7th ed., p.&amp;nbsp;130), produces [[motion (physics)|motion]], so the intricate [[organic (model)|organic]] complex of force-bearing substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects, which, when bound together in a unity, are called by us [[mind]], [[soul]], [[thought]]. Here he postulates force and mind as emanating from original matter, a materialistic [[monism]]. But in other parts of his works he suggests that mind and matter are two different aspects of that which is the basis of all things, a monism which is not necessarily materialistic.

Büchner was much less concerned to establish a scientific metaphysics than to protest against the romantic [[idealism]] of his predecessors and the [[theology|theological]] [[cosmology|interpretations of the universe]]. [[Nature]] according to him is purely physical; it has [[teleology|no purpose]], no will, no laws imposed by extraneous [[authority]], no [[supernatural]] [[ethics|ethical]] sanction.

Modern Christian apologists consider Büchner the father of [[atheistic evangelism]] in Germany, a counterpart to [[Thomas Huxley]].

Ludwig Büchner was the brother of [[Georg Büchner]], a famous playwright, and [[Luise Büchner]], a women's rights advocate; and the uncle of [[Ernst Büchner]], inventor of the [[Büchner flask]].

'''Lynn Alton de Silva''' (16 June 1919 – 22 May 1982) was a Sri Lankan theologian and [[Methodist]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]. He was the founder and editor of one of the first theological journals on [[Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhist-Christian]] encounter called ''Dialogue'' (1961–1981),&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;{{Citation

Lynn de Silva's book titled ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices in Sri Lanka'' {{Harv|de Silva|1974}} was mentioned in two journals in the early 1980s as being unparalleled as an introduction to Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Possibly his most notable contribution to theology is the book titled ''The Problem of the Self in Buddhism and Christianity'' {{Harv|de Silva|1979}},&lt;ref name="tribute"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he points out an age-old misconception held by Buddhists and Christians that the notion of an immortal soul is a biblical teaching. This book is considered by [[w:de:Perry Schmidt-Leukel|Schmidt-Leukel]] to be one of the classics in Buddhist-Christian dialogue, and one which has become well known among those actively involved in this dialogue. The book was also included in [[John Hick]]'s ''Library of Philosophy and Religion'' series.

Lynn de Silva's father and three of his brothers were Methodist ministers. According to Walter Small, Lynn de Silva and his brothers Fred and Denzil were among the most significant Methodist writers during the period 1931&amp;ndash;1964 in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="meth-church"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The most significant Methodist writer during this period, according to {{Harv|Small|1971|pp=529,530,531}}, is Rev. D.T. Niles. Some others include Rev. C.H. S. Ward and Rev. J. Simon de Silva. The following quote from {{Harv|Small|1971|pp=531}} describes the works by Fred and Denzil: "Fred, who was for over 10 years Editor of "Methodist Witness" (Sinhalese) as well as of the Church Record, has had two books published by the C.l.S., "Christhiani Wivahaya"  and "Vishudi Kamaya" and one by Gunasena’s, "Why to People Suffer?", as well as a number of pamphlets, including "Trouble in God’s world". Denzil has written "Sohon Ethara"".&lt;/ref&gt; After entering active service in the Methodist ministry in 1946, de Silva pursued his tertiary education, obtaining qualifications including a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degree, two [[Master's degree|Master's]] degrees, and a [[Doctor of Theology]] degree. In addition to serving in the ministry, de Silva participated for twenty years in the dialogical and ecumenical activities of the [[World Council of Churches]], and he was Executive President of the ''Presidium of the National Council for Religion and Peace'' in Sri Lanka (1979&amp;ndash;1980). He died shortly after this role while addressing an audience at a conference, having continued to work until the end. In 1999, the Study Center building of the EISD was dedicated to the memory of Lynn de Silva and Rev. G. B. Jackson, the first director of the EISD.

==Family, education and career==
Lynn Anton de Silva was born to a [[Methodist]] family on 16 June 1919, in the town of [[Kurana, Sri Lanka|Kurana]] in [[Katunayake]], Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=615}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John Simon de Silva (1868-1940), was a Methodist [[minister (Christianity)|minister]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=616}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Clara de Silva, was a [[housewife]]. Lynn de Silva was the second youngest out of one sister: Pearl (?-1999), and five brothers: Frederick Stanley (1904-1980), Roy, George Denzil (?-1996), Eric and Hugh. Little is known about de Silva's childhood, except that he had a Christian upbringing, growing up under the influence of pious parents.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{Citation

===Education===
Before being accepted as a candidate for the ministry, de Silva was a teacher from 1938 to 1942.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; In 1942, he trained for the ministry at the [[United Theological College (Bangalore)|United Theological College]] in [[Bangalore]], and entered active service in the Methodist ministry in 1946.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; He served as a minister in stations including Kollupitiya, [[Wellawatte]], [[Kandy]], [[Badulla]], [[Galle]], Kalahe, Mutwal and Seeduwa; he served a total of two years at the first two stations, half a year at Kandy, two years at Kalahe, three years at Mutuwal, and three and half years at Seeduwa.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; In September 1950, de Silva was ordained as a Methodist minister.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lynn and Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|left| Lynn and Lakshmi in the early 1950s]] A few months after being ordained, Lynn de Silva married Lakshmi Mendis, on 3 February 1951,&lt;ref name="lakshmi"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Colpetty Methodist Church in [[Colombo]]. Toward the end of the year, on 16 November 1951, Lynn and Lakshmi had their first son, Lahan Jayalath de Silva.

Starting from the 1950s, de Silva pursued his tertiary education. He obtained a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (B.D.) degree from [[Serampore College]] in India; a [[Master of Sacred Theology]] (S.T.M.) degree from the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York]]; a Diploma in Buddhism, with a specialisation in [[Theravada]] Buddhism, from the [[University of Kelaniya|Vidyalankara University]] in Sri Lanka; a [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) degree from [[University of Birmingham]] in England; and a [[Doctor of Theology]] (Th.D.) degree from [[Senate of Serampore College (University)|Senate of Serampore College]].&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; He also took a study course in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism at the [[Vidyodaya University]] in Sri Lanka. During his studies, Lynn and Lakshmi had their second son, Lalith Chrishantha de Silva, on 16 September 1954.

===Career and activities===
Lynn de Silva's pioneering work in Buddhist-Christian dialogue, and his work in Bible translation, began in the early 1960s after he had completed his service at Seeduwa. In 1962, de Silva was appointed to serve the National Christian Council at the Study Centre for Religion and Society in [[Wellawatte]], which later became the Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue—an important center for Buddhist studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; It was shortly before starting work at the Study Center that Lynn and Lakshmi had their third child, Shiromi Priyala de Silva (later Rodrigo), on 3 September 1961.

Whilst managing the Study Center, de Silva was appointed co-translator of the ''Sinhala Bible Revision Committee'' in 1964.&lt;ref name="bible-translation"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee consisted of around forty scholars, including [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] clergy, Buddhist [[monks]], and academics.&lt;ref name="bible-translation"/&gt; From 1964 to 1973, the committee focused on translating the Greek version of the [[New Testament]] of the Bible into [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]].&lt;ref name="bible-translation"/&gt; In the same year in which de Silva started working with the translation committee, Lynn and Lakshmi had their last child and third son, Shantha Asiri de Silva, on 6 March 1964.

[[File:Lynn de Silva At Son's Wedding.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Lynn de Silva with his family in 1977, at his eldest son's wedding. (Left to right) Shantha, Lakshmi, Lahan, Peace, Lynn, Lalith and Shiromi]] Around the age of fifty, in the late 1960s, de Silva experienced a severe heart attack.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; During his recovery, Lakshmi managed the home, watched over his health, and moderated his appointments.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; Furthermore, she guided the work at the Study Center by handling most of the administrative duties, organisation of conferences, and publication related tasks.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; She continued to take these responsibilities even after de Silva's recovery, so that he could focus on his research, writing and travel.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;

From 1970 to 1971, de Silva lived in England with Lakshmi while he served the World Churches as [http://www.uca.bham.ac.uk/PatonFell.html William Paton Lecturer] at [[Selly Oak Colleges]] in Birmingham.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; While in England, de Silva was also a [[Visiting Lecturer]] in Asian Religions at [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;

After his return to Sri Lanka, de Silva continued with Bible translation work, and he was appointed chief translator of the [[Old Testament]] into Sinhala in 1973.&lt;ref name="bible-translation"/&gt; Fr. Aloysius Peiris S.J. states the following in relation to de Silva's new position as chief translator:

{{quotation| His proficiency in his own mother-tongue coupled with his familiarity with Greek and Hebrew, as well as a thorough grounding in biblical theology, gave him an eminent position in the team that made the new Sinhala translation of the Bible. It was thanks to his ruthless criticism that many traditional Christian terms in Sinhala ... were eliminated from Biblical and liturgical use. He pointed out as nobody did before, such words when uttered in a Buddhist context, distort the Gospel message whilst doing violence also to the Sinhala language.}}

Lakshmi de Silva also played an important role in the Bible translation work. After three months of training, she was appointed secretary of the translation committee.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bible-translation"/&gt; Her role in the committee involved technical work such as proofreading, and clerical work such as typing and dealing with the press.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; She possessed sufficient knowledge in Greek and Hebrew to be able to check the accuracy and consistency of the Bible translation, which she continued at a full-time capacity even after she had fallen ill toward the latter part of her life.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; With the experience she had gained, Lakshmi compiled valuable material for use in future bible translations.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; Although she possessed the skills necessary to become a scholar in her own right, she was content to take a back seat to support her husband's work.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt; She died in 1980, just over a year before the ''Sinhala Bible'' translation was completed.&lt;ref name="lakshmi"/&gt;

[[File:Lynn de Silva and extended family.jpg|thumb|400px|right| Lynn de Silva in the early 1980s with some family and extended family]] Lynn de Silva's ecumenical responsibilities included membership in the Committees of the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC) that focused on the Christian approach to other faiths. In particular, he was a WCC committee member (Paris 1962, Geneva 1967 and 1973); a member of the working group of the Division of World Mission and Evangelism (Mexico 1963, Zurich 1966 and Cantebury 1969); and member of the working group on Dialogue with Faiths and Ideologies (DFI) since 1969.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his other significant ecumenical activities were visits to Buddhist study centres in Germany, England and the USA, and study tours of Buddhism in Burma, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

Lynn de Silva's quest for unity stretched beyond his dialogue with Buddhists. He was among a group of people that led the movement for the "[[Contextualization (Bible translation)|contextualisation]] and [[inculturation]] of the [[Gospel]]," and also among those who "advocated and struggled for Church Union in Sri Lanka."&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; After [[Sri Lankan riots of 1977|interracial riots in 1977]] between the Sinhalese and [[Tamils]], de Silva became deeply involved in issues of unity and reconciliation between the two cultures. He led a team of Sinhalese leaders for dialogue with the Tamils in [[Jaffna]], and wrote articles on the history of the conflict as well as his analysis of it, in an effort to promote interracial understanding.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; In 1979, de Silva was appointed to the [[Presidium]] of the National Council for Religion and Peace in Sri Lanka, where he was Executive President for one year.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Some of his other non-ecumenical activities included serving as editor of the ''Methodist Witness'' and ''Suba Hasun'' Sinhalese journals.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

Lynn de Silva's interests included writing Sinhalese short stories (e.g., ''Premaoushadaya'' {{Harv|de Silva|1952a}} and ''Premaye Rahasa'' {{Harv|de Silva|1952b}}) and painting.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; One of his paintings had appeared at an exhibit held at the [http://www.theertha.com/htm/lianelwent_galleri.htm Lionel Wendt Gallery] in Colombo, Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; In addition to his proficiency in English and Sinhalese, de Silva was familiar with [[Greek Language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]], and literate in [[Pali]].&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="niles"&gt;{{Citation

==History of Buddhist-Christian relations in Sri Lanka==
{{see also|Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Christianity in Sri Lanka|Buddhism and Christianity}}

Ever since the 16th century, during colonisations of Sri Lanka by the Portuguese, Dutch and English, [[Christian missionaries]] had attempted to convert the Buddhist population into Christianity, with the general belief during this period being that there was nothing worthy of study in non-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buddhism in Sri Lanka]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, this view started to change, into the conviction that every [[evangelism|evangelist]] should have sound knowledge in Buddhism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=570}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Christian scholars supporting this conviction were Daniel John Gogerly, C. H. S. Ward, and Robert Spence Hardy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

Despite their belief that knowledge in Buddhism was essential, their attitude toward Buddhism was still negative. Through their [[polemical]] writings, they revealed their negative attitudes and beliefs that Buddhism was in error and that Christianity should replace Buddhism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; This antagonised the Buddhists, and eventually led to a national Buddhist movement, starting from controversies held at [[Baddegama]] (1865), Udanwita (1866) and [[Gampola]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;[[Panadura#The historic Panadura Debate .27Panadura Vadaya.27]]&lt;/ref&gt; The last and most popular of these controversies was the historic debate [[Panadura#Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera|Panadura Vadaya]], held in [[Panadura]] (1873), between Rev. David de Silva and Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera. One of the rules of the debate was that Christians should try to prove that Buddhism is false, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, this negative attitude between Buddhists and Christians started to change. The main influences responsible for the change included (1) more accurate knowledge of Buddhism than was available in the past; (2) interest in and appreciation for Buddhism shown by Western scholars such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], whose philosophy was similar to that of the Buddha; (3) the book by [[Edwin Arnold]] titled [[The Light of Asia]], which created a popular interest in Buddhism; (4) the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of 1910, which set the tone for a new Christian ecumenical movement; (5) missionary activities of Buddhists such as [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] in the West; and (6) the Tambaram Missionary Conference in 1938, where one of the main themes for discussion was ''Christian message in a non-Christian world''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=574,575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first Methodist missionary to practice this more positive attitude toward Buddhism was Rev. Stanley Bishop, who made his attitude evident in a book titled ''Gautama or Jesus'' (1907).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the introductory chapter, Bishop states:

{{quotation| The apparently wide differences between the teachings of Gautama Buddha and of Jesus Christ have led many to suppose that there is very little in common between the two systems. Some have even been entrapped into the statement that Buddhist doctrine is in direct opposition to Christianity, or vice versa, and that there is no common ground upon which the Buddhist and the Christian may meet for mutual help. It is hard for anyone who is at all conversant with Buddhism to maintain the position so often adopted – that the Christian has nothing to learn and all to teach. Neither statement is based on anything surer than ignorance....These pages are written in an attempt to show that although the Christian may receive much light and stimulus from the teaching of the Buddha, the Buddhist may receive from Christ what Gautama was never in a position to give.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harv|Small|1971|pp=575}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another significant step toward dialogue between Christians and Buddhists was by Daniel T. Niles, in his book ''Eternal Life Now'' (1946).&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=576}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this book is twofold: (1) to convey the Christian message in the Buddhist context, by using terms such as [[anicca]], [[dukkha]], [[samsara]], sarana, [[anatta]], [[Śīla|sila]], [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]], panna, and [[arahant]]; and (2) to convey Buddhist truths within the context of Christianity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

With the resurgence of Buddhism after Sri Lankan [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence]], the conviction grew even stronger for the need to consider Christianity in the light of a culture and heritage that is predominantly Buddhist, which led to an increased need for dialogue between the two religions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;{{Harv|Small|1971|pp=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ''Study Center for Religion and Society'', which was later renamed to ''Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue'' (EISD), was established in [[Colombo]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/02/16/fea05.html Online edition of Sunday Observer – Business]&lt;/ref&gt; The center was initially managed by Rev. G. B. Jackson, and later directed by Lynn de Silva, whose focus was on Buddhist studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

[[File:Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue, Colombo.jpg|thumb|right| The new Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue building erected after Lynn de Silva's death, with funds that he had collected]] Lynn de Silva was the director of the ''Study Center for Religion and Society'' from 1962. The center was organised into two divisions: ''Division of Buddhist Studies'', and  ''Division of Frontier Studies''. The purpose of the former division was to promote study and research in Buddhism, while the purpose of the latter division was to explore the theological and social implications of the Christian faith in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=35,36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center was involved in successfully organising a number of dialogues, meetings, and seminaries,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became an internationally recognised center for dialogue with Buddhism and other ecumenical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|England|2002|pp=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the center was recognised in the 1970s and 1980s as one of the most active of all similar study centres worldwide.&lt;ref name="kitagawa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spae"&gt;{{Citation

===World Council of Churches assembly at Nairobi===
The assembly at [[Nairobi]] in 1975 of the [[World Council of Churches]] was an important milestone in the history of inter-religious dialogue. For the first time, representatives from five different faiths were present at the gathering, and the discussions were centred around the topic of inter-religious dialogue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a session that emphasised "seeking community" with people of other faiths, cultures and ideologies, the presentations were driven by, as the former director of the WCC sub-unit ''[http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/77glines-e.html Dialogue with People of Living Faiths and Ideologies]'' (DFI) – [[S. J. Samartha]] – put it: "fear of losing the 'uniqueness' of Christ, fear of weakening the sense of 'mission', and the persistent fear of '[[syncretism]]'."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; Presentations at this session were marked by conflicting opinions between a group of European theologians and a group of Asian and African theologians, which resulted from the conflicting viewpoints between the theologies practised by the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=28,29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Europeans voiced their fear of inter-religious dialogue, the African and Asian participants called for a more definite endorsement of dialogue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Silva was, in this debate, one of the leading voices in the Asian viewpoint. &lt;!--De Alwis also states that de Silva and [[Joshua Russell Chandran]] from India provided the weightiest and theologically most influential contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; [[S. J. Samartha]] notes de Silva's contribution as "one of the most powerful interventions in the Assembly in support of dialogue," and Carl Hallencreutz describes it as "the personal witness of an experienced theologian from Sri Lanka."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to the general assembly at Nairobi, de Silva asserted that his concern was to alleviate the fear voiced by Europeans about dialogue which, he claimed, arises in people who have not lived among people of other faiths.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{Harv|de Alwis|1982|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the spirituality of others can be shared without diminishing one's loyalty to one's own faith.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Further, he argued that dialogue is a safeguard against syncretism, not a temptation to syncretism, and that Asian Christians should overcome the obstacles that separate one religion from another, and seek to express the Christian faith in the thought-forms and life-forms of Asia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

In a publication titled ''Freedom from Teutonic Captivity'' (''Dialogue'', New Series, Vol. 3, No. 1), de Silva shared his thoughts on the Nairobi debate, and he presented the significance of the debate as follows:

{{quotation|1. It revealed the strength of the Afro-Asian solidarity in their commitment to dialogue; 2. it revealed more clearly than ever before that the Third World Churches will no longer tolerate being dictated to by the Western Churches; 3. it revealed their determination to break away from teutonic captivity and discover the Christ who "Frees and Unites" in the living context of Asian and African religions.}}

==The Asian theology of Lynn de Silva==
{{main|Lynn de Silva's theology}}

Lynn de Silva gained an interest in Buddhism and its culture at an early stage in his ministry.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; He believed that the credibility of Christianity depended on its ability to relate to Buddhism, which was the faith of the majority of the Sri Lankan population.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; His objective was to develop a richer appreciation of the [[similarities between Buddhism and Christianity]], in particular, to communicate the Christian message in a manner that the Sri Lankan culture understood, and to construct a theology that is focused towards the Buddhist cultural environment. To this end, he used Buddhist concepts to communicate Christian beliefs in a language understood from the Buddhist context, and he aimed at extending Christian theology with Buddhist concepts to gain a more thorough understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Brueggemann"&gt;{{Citation

To obtain the necessary background in Sri Lankan Buddhist practices, de Silva consulted reputed Buddhist monks and scholars, visited Buddhist places of worship, and consulted written sources on Sri Lankan Buddhism.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; Although most of his studies were completed in English, he took a special effort to master Sinhalese and the Sri Lankan culture.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; Furthermore, he became proficient in Pali, the language of the Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="niles" /&gt; His findings eventually led to the book titled ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices in Sri Lanka'' {{Harv|de Silva|1974}}, which is widely cited in religious literature (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This book was also considered by [[Aloysius Pieris]] to be de Silva's most outstanding contribution to Theology,&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; and by Perry Schmidt-Leukel to be one of the classics in Buddhist-Christian dialogue, and one that has become well known among those actively involved in this dialogue.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Furthermore, this book was included in [[John Hick]]'s ''Library of Philosophy and Religion'' series.&lt;ref name="kitagawa"/&gt; In this book, de Silva compares the [[biblical]] notion of "the [[immortal soul|soul]]" ([[pneuma]]) or "the self," with the Buddhist [[doctrine]] of "no soul" ([[Atman (Buddhism)|anattā]]) or "no self." Contrary to popular belief, de Silva shows that modern Christian scholarship does not support the notion of a soul as an immortal entity separate from the body.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="memoriam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt; He argues that such a misconception arose as a consequence of the translation of the Bible into Greek. Based on his observation, de Silva shows how the Buddhist doctrine of ''anattā'' is complementary to the Christian notion of [[personal identity]] – ''pneuma''.&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt; He distinguishes that, while ''pneuma'' focuses on man as a relational entity, ''anattā'' focuses on man as an isolated entity. Furthermore, de Silva infers that if we do consider ''anattā'' to be real in Buddhism or Christianity, ''pneuma'' must also be real for [[Nirvana|Nibbāna]] or the [[Kingdom of God]] to be a positive ideal.&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt;

In his review of de Silva's book, [[Joseph Kitagawa]] argues that de Silva is too narrow in his analysis of the anatta doctrine; he claims that a better analysis would have been for de Silva to take into consideration the broader implication of the anattā doctrine, and to challenge the very basis of Greek philosophy which had influenced much of Christian theology.&lt;ref name="kitagawa"/&gt; Furthermore, Kitagawa argues that de Silva could have entertained the possibility that [[Theravada]] Buddhism might look for [[Ultimate Reality]] more readily in the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist tradition, rather than turning towards Christianity.&lt;ref name="kitagawa"/&gt; In Donald Mitchell's analysis of the same book by de Silva, he states that a better framework for dialogue with Hindu traditions could be allowed if de Silva considered an expanded [[hermeneutical]] circle that includes a more positive notion of soul that is compatible with the biblical understanding of man.&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt; By doing so, Mitchell argues, de Silva would be able to "include inherently valuable insights from the Christian tradition on the nature of man."&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt;

From the evangelical theologians, Tissa Weerasinghe believed that de Silva needs to put more emphasis on the "glaring disharmony" between Christianity and Buddhism that their differing views on the biblical notion of ''soul'' suggest.&lt;ref name="tissa-wr"&gt;{{Citation

===Salvation===
With an [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view on religion in the early stages of his career, Lynn de Silva believed that [[salvation]] does not only apply to Christians, but also to other religions. He maintained that while Christians can use Christ as their means for salvation, other religions can use their own means for salvation. Later in his life, de Silva developed more of a [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]] view on religion, believing that neither of the two religions is superior to the other. Perry Schmidt-Leukel notes how this change of view is evident in de Silva's posthumous article ''Buddhism and Christianity Relativised'', in volume 9 of the ''Dialogue'' journal.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt;

In her PhD thesis containing a chapter on de Silva's work, Damayanthi Niles claims that there is a problem with de Silva's argument in relation to salvation, in that it "reconciles the exclusive Christ-event and the inclusive vision of God's salvific plan purely on Christian terms," and that it does not take the "religious visions and commitments of other faiths seriously."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harv|Niles|1998|pp=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she argues that de Silva's understanding of salvation, as found in his paper ''Non-Christian Religions and God's Plan of Salvation'' {{Harv|de Silva|1967b}}, borrows a religious idea from other religions and uses the idea to make Christianity more palatable to other religions and to Christians sensitive to [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Thanatology===
In the last few years before his death, de Silva focused his study towards the study of human death, namely, the field of [[Thanatology]]. His quest was motivated mainly by the death of his wife Lakshmi in December 1980, but also by his curiosity about the meaning of [[resurrection]].&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; With this frame of mind, de Silva studied the beliefs and practices of people with respect to death, such as the phenomenon of [[mediums]], with help from Buddhist exponents of reincarnation.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; Although traces of his findings can be seen in his last writings, de Silva died before completing his study.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; His last findings were published posthumously by his friend and colleague, [[Aloysius Pieris|Fr. Aloysius Pieris S.J.]], in the paper ''Buddhism and Christianity Relativised'', which appeared in volume 9 of the ''Dialogue'' journal.

In this paper, de Silva talks about "Life Beyond Death," and writes that theologians should not ignore data from [[Parapsychology]]. He urges that evidence about the paranormal is compelling, and that it is a field that merits careful study.
Regarding [[Purgatory]], de Silva states in this paper that the Hindu/Buddhist view, where Ultimate Reality is reached through a process of purification through liberation from ''self'' and elevation to stages of spiritual development, is more acceptable than the belief in a single life on earth and an everlasting hell or heaven after death. Furthermore, he insists that the Hindu/Buddhist view conforms to modern theological as well as [[psychical]] research. In agreement with the Hindu/Buddhist view, de Silva, in this paper, regards Purgatory to be a place of cleansing, which ultimately makes a person ready for eternal life in [[Heaven]].

Tissa de Alwis, in his Th.D. thesis studying the works of Lynn de Silva, argues that "de Silva's attempt to harmonise Rebirth, Purgatory, and an intermediate state, which is a kind of a continuum in which one passes from a near state of annihilation to the closest union with God, is inconsistent with the radical picture of Biblical anatta"; furthermore, de Alwis states that de Silva "fails to define lostness in the final sense and slides into an unrestricted [[universalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Death and legacy==
On 22 May 1982, while addressing the audience at a conference, Lynn de Silva succumbed to cardiac arrest. The conference was organised by the National Christian Council on the theme "Jesus Christ, Life of the World."&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; Being the third and final speaker, he completed his discourse on 2 Timothy 3: 15–17 and he stood up again to answer a question from the audience, but he was barely able to formulate a reply and sat back in his chair.&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt; He died soon afterward, having continued to work until the end.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sister-in law of Lynn de Silva, Langanee Mendis, who was trained by de Silva as his secretary after the death of his wife Lakshmi,&lt;ref name="langanee"/&gt; continues to work (as of 2008) as the Administrative Secretary at the institute. Mrs. Mendis is credited as being the main person responsible for the uninterrupted functioning of the institute after Lynn de Silva's death.&lt;ref name="langanee"/&gt; Furthermore, she was considered by Pieris in 2003 to be "a tower of strength [for the Ecumenical Institute] for well over 20 years."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In March 1999, the Study Center building of the EISD was dedicated to the memory of Rev. G. B. Jackson and Lynn de Silva, by Rt. Rev. [[Andrew Kumarage|Andrew Oliver Kumarage]] ([[Bishop of Kurunegala]]). This building is used by a number of institutions and church-related organisations to provide accommodation for participants involved in study programs at the EISD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalministries.org/sasia/partners/ecumenical-institute-for.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 2009, an [http://archives.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=/2009/11/17/fea20.asp article in the Daily News] newspaper promoting World Philosophy Day featured a picture and short description of Lynn de Silva, alongside other Sri Lankan philosophers such as [[K. N. Jayatilleke]] and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].

Jordan''' is the [[Andrew Mellon]] Professor of Christian Thought at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and Professor of the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. His focus is on [[European philosophy]], [[gender studies]], and [[sexuality]]. Much of his early work related to Catholic teachings of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In recent years, he has more specifically focused on religious doctrine and its relation to [[LGBT]] issues.

In addition to his scholarship and classroom teaching, Jordan has discussed sexual and religious issues to audiences that range from college lectureships to [[National Public Radio]], the ''[[New York Times]]'', and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2009/10/28/harvard-professor-seeks-gay-term-in-bible/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2002/July/erJuly.22/7_22_02profile.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/23/jordan-hds-professor/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan won the annual [[Randy Shilts Award]] for nonfiction for his 2011 book, ''Recruiting Young Love: How Christians Talk about Homosexuality''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishingtriangle.org/awards.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his return to Harvard in 2014, Jordan had held endowed professorships at [[Emory University|Emory]], [[Washington University at St. Louis]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and at [[Harvard]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.nd.edu/~newsinfo/pdf/2008_07_25_pdf/Jordan%20appointed%20first%20Niebuhr%20Professor%20at%20HDS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; He has received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], a Fulbright-Hays grant (Spain), a Luce Fellowship in Theology, and a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://wgs.fas.harvard.edu/people/mark-jordan]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meera Nanda''' (born 1954) is an Indian writer and [[philosopher of science]] based in the United States,&lt;ref name=three/&gt; who has authored several works critiquing the influence of [[Hindutva]], [[postcolonialism]] and [[postmodernism]] on science, and the flourishing of [[pseudoscience]] and [[Vedanga|vedic science]].

== Life and career ==

Nanda was educated in science and philosophy with a PhD in [[biotechnology]] from the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi]] and a PhD in science studies from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://calendar.iisc.ernet.in/abstract.php?mid=MID201018179 Reception of Darwinism in India (A talk by Professor Meera Nanda)], Indian Institute of Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mukto-mona.com/wordpress/?author=38|title=Mukto-Mona Writers' Corner -   Meera Nanda|website=mukto-mona.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a [[John Templeton Foundation]] Fellow in Religion and Science (2005–2007).&lt;ref name=three&gt;[http://www.threeessays.com/authors.php?id=4 Meera Nanda Profile] Three Essays.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In defence of secularism|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2006/11/21/stories/2006112100521400.htm |author= [[Ranjit Hoskote]]| publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, she was a Fellow at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute for Advanced Study, in the [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] for research in Science, Post-Modernism and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnu.ac.in/JNIAS/Scholars_invited.htm List of scholars invited to JNIAS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716191040/http://www.jnu.ac.in/jnias/Scholars_invited.htm |date=16 July 2010 }} JNIAS [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a visiting faculty of history and philosophy of science at [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali]] from 2010 to 15 May 2017.

==Religion and Hindu nationalism==
{{too few opinions|section|date=October 2016}}

Nanda has authored several works on religion, most notably ''Prophets Facing Backward: Postmodern Critiques of Science and Hindu Nationalism in India'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book Review: Paradigm shift  |url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2005/05/03/stories/2005050300281600.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |author= [[Ranjit Hoskote]]|date=3 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her 2009 book ''The God Market'' which examined how India is experiencing a rising tide of popular Hinduism, including [[Indian government|government]] financing of [[Hinduism]] despite the nation's secular characteristic. The book was also reviewed by [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] in ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=glitter&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: The Glitter in The Godliness|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263657|publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|accessdate=8 September 2013|author=William Dalrymple|authorlink=William Dalrymple (historian)|date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Books: A market for holy men: How globalization has had an impact on Hinduism and our public sphere |url= http://www.livemint.com/2009/08/21210545/A-market-for-holy-men.html?h=B|publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanda notes the popularity of yoga exercises in the west, and the discomfort of Indians with this popularisation, who "blame Americans and other 'decadent' Westerners for reducing their spiritually rich tradition to mere calisthenics."&lt;ref name="Not as old"/&gt; Yet, she questions the idea that yoga is a "timeless" and "eternal" practice, which lies at the heart of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Not as old"&gt;Meera Nanda, [http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/living/not-as-old-as-you-think ''Yoga. Not as Old as You Think''], OPEN 12 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She has criticised the Hindu American Foundation (HAF) for 
{{quote|The purist Hindu position [...] that all yoga, including its physical or hatha yoga component, is rooted in the Hindu religion/way of life that goes all the way back to the Vedic sages and [[yogi]]s.&lt;ref name="Not as old"/&gt;}}

Nanda notes that the yoga asanas do not have Vedic origins, and were treated with disdain by the 19th century Hindu elites, including Swami Vivekananda. She further notes that the separation of the physical practices from their cultural background started in India, not in the west, when Indian nationalists tried to counter western influences and
{{quote|... hatha yoga took on many elements of Western gymnastics and body-building, which show up in the world-renowned Iyengar and Ashtanga Vinyasa schools of yoga. Far from honestly acknowledging the Western contributions to modern yoga, we Indians simply brand all yoga as ‘Vedic,’ a smug claim that has no intellectual integrity.&lt;ref name="Not as old"/&gt;}}

HAF rebutted her claims in a reply which pointed out that even the few sources she mentions in her book such as Mark Singleton, have themselves not made the claims that she ascribes them to. HAF also presented a brief outline of the recorded history of yoga, which disproved her arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hafsite.org/whats-new/open-magazine-features-haf-yoga-piece-audacity-ignorance|title=OPEN Magazine features HAF Yoga Piece: The Audacity of Ignorance|website=Hindu American Foundation (HAF)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her critique has been rejected by the Hindu American Foundation. Swaminathan Venkataraman, of the [[Hindu American Foundation]], alleged that Nanda harboured "hatred" for [[Swami Vivekananda]], and that she feared the emergence of an articulate Hindu voice bringing Hindu perspectives into the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/international/disguised-hinduphobia|title= Disguised Hinduphobia|author= Swaminathan Venkataraman|date= 7 March 2011|publisher= OPEN Magazine|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajiv Malhotra]] criticised her for denouncing Indian culture and painting [[Hinduism]] as anti-scientific while allegedly praising [[Protestantism]] as scientific.&lt;ref name=leftwing&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rajiv |last1=Malhotra |authorlink1=Rajiv Malhotra |first2=Aravindan |last2=Neelakandan |title=Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines |publisher=Amaryllis |year=2011 |ISBN=8191067374 |chapter=India: A left-wing frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nanda has pointed out that her criticism was equally applicable to all "resurgent religious-political movements" not only among Hindus, but also Christians and Muslims. The Bush White House's recruitment of Christian evangelicals and corporate scientists to shape policies on issues such as open support for Biblical Flood geology and stem cell research was very similar to the state support for Vedic astrology by the Hindu nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Meera |last=Nanda |year=2005 |title=Response to my critics |journal=Social Epistemology: A Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Policy |volume=19 |number=1 |pp=147–191 |DOI=10.1080/02691720500084358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moses Ilyich Schönfinkel''', also known as '''Moisei Isai'evich Sheinfinkel'''' ({{lang-rus|Моисей Исаевич Шейнфинкель}}; 4 September 1889 – 1942), was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[logician]] and [[mathematician]], known for the invention of [[combinatory logic]].

== Life ==
Schönfinkel attended the [[Novorossiysk University]] of [[Odessa]], studying mathematics under [[Samuil Osipovich Shatunovskii]] (1859–1929), who worked in [[geometry]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]]. From 1914 to 1924, Schönfinkel was a member of [[David Hilbert]]'s group at the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref name="CardoneHindley"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 1920 he delivered a talk to the group where he outlined the concept of [[combinatory logic]]. [[Heinrich Behmann]], a member of Hilbert's group, later revised the text and published it in 1924.&lt;ref name="Archives"&gt;{{Citation | author = Curry, Haskell | title = Notes on Schönfinkel | version = 271128A (T271128A) | publisher = Curry archives | date = November 1927 | url = http://www.sadl.uleth.ca/cgi-bin/library?e=d-00000-00---off-0curry--00-0--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;cl=CL1.8&amp;d=T271128A | postscript = . }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Schönfinkel had one other paper published, on special cases of the decision problem (''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]''), that was prepared by [[Paul Bernays]].&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;{{Citation | first=G. L. | last=Kline | title=Review of Foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic by S. A.

After he left Göttingen, Schönfinkel returned to Moscow. By 1927 he was reported to be mentally ill and in a sanatorium.&lt;ref name="Archives"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt; His later life was spent in poverty, and he died in Moscow some time in 1942. His papers were burned by his neighbors for heating.&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt;

== Work ==

Schönfinkel developed a formal system that avoided the use of [[bound variables]]. His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators '''B''', '''C''', '''I''', '''K''', and '''S'''. Schönfinkel was able to show that the system could be reduced to just '''K''' and '''S''' and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same power as [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref name="Archives"/&gt;

His paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Christopher|last=Strachey|authorlink=Christopher Strachey|title=Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages|journal=[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]|volume=13|pages=11–49|year=2000|quote=There is a device originated by Schönfinkel, for reducing operators with several operands to the successive application of single operand operators.|doi=10.1023/A:1010000313106|ref=harv}} (Reprinted lecture notes from 1967.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John C.|last=Reynolds|authorlink=John C.

''Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages''. 1995. p.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt; This replacement mechanism simplifies work in both combinatory logic and [[lambda calculus]] and would later be called [[currying]], after [[Haskell Curry]]. While Curry attributed the concept to Schönfinkel, it had already been used by [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine]], introduction to "Bausteine der mathematischen Logik", pp.&amp;nbsp;305–316.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5618">'''NUSAP''' is a notational system for the management and communication of uncertainty in science for policy, based on five categories for characterizing any quantitative statement: Numeral, Unit, Spread, Assessment and Pedigree. NUSAP was introduced by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome Ravetz]] in the 1990 book [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]].&lt;ref name="UQSP"&gt;Funtowicz, S. &amp; Ravetz J., 1990, [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]], Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; See also van der Sluijs et al. 2005.&lt;ref name="vdS2005"&gt;van der Sluijs, J., Craye, M., Funtowicz, S., Kloprogge, P., Ravetz, J., and Risbey, J.  (2005) Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Measures of Uncertainty in Model based Environmental Assessment: the NUSAP System, Risk Analysis, 25 (2). p. 481-492.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
The name "NUSAP" is an acronym for the categories just mentioned.

* Numeral will usually be an ordinary number;
* Unit refers to the units used in Numeral
* Spread is an assessment of the error in the value of the Numeral.
* Assessment is a summary of salient qualitative judgements about the information - this can be of statistical nature (a significance level) or more general, e.g. involving terms such as 'conservative' or 'optimistic'.
* Pedigree is an evaluative description of the mode of production and of anticipated use of the information.

The pedigree can be expressed by means of a matrix; the columns represent the various phases of production or use of the information, and each column contains marks to rank the performance. Marks can be numerical as well as qualitative, see an example [http://www.nusap.net/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=14 here]. Recent applications of NUSAP are in the field of climate science,&lt;ref name="App1"&gt;Van Der Sluijs, J.P., Wardekker, J.A., 2015, Critical appraisal of assumptions in chains of model calculations used to project local climate impacts for adaptation decision support - The case of Baakse Beek, Environmental Research Letters, 10(4), doi:10.1088/1748-9326/10/4/045005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppE1"&gt;Lorenz, S; Dessai, S; Paavola, J; Forster, P M., 2015, The communication of physical science uncertainty in European National Adaptation Strategies, Climatic Change132.1 (Sep 2015): 143-155.&lt;/ref&gt; hydrology,&lt;ref name="AppE2"&gt;Zhu, Q., Xu, X., Gao, C., Ran, Q.-H., Xu, Y.-P., 2013, Qualitative and quantitative uncertainties in regional rainfall frequency analysis, Journal of Zhejiang University: Science A, Volume 16, Issue 3, 2015, Pages 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; medical research &lt;ref name="App2"&gt;Kloprogge, P., Van der Sluijs, J.P., Petersen, A.C., 2011, A method for the analysis of assumptions in model-based environmental assessments, Environmental Modelling and Software, 26(3), 289-301.&lt;/ref&gt; and risk assessment.&lt;ref name="App3"&gt;Ides   Boone, Yves   Van der Stede,  Jeroen   Dewulf, Winy   Messens, Marc   Aerts, Georges   Daube  and  Koen   Mintiens, 2010, NUSAP: a method to evaluate the quality of assumptions in quantitative microbial risk assessment, Journal of Risk Research, 13(3), 337-352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="App4"&gt;Christine Louise Berner, Roger Flage, 2016, Comparing and integrating the NUSAP notational scheme with an uncertainty based risk perspective, Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety, 156, Pages 185–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Sensitivity auditing]] NUSAP can be considered as a method useful at the science policy interface - when numbers produced by either experiment, survey or mathematical modelling need to be used in the appraisal or the formulation of a policy. See also [[Post-normal science]]

==Logic==
His work on logic, the ''al-Risāla al-Shamsiyya'' (''Logic for Shams al-Dīn''), was commonly used as the first major text on logic in [[madrasah]]s, right down until the twentieth century and is "perhaps the most studied logic textbook of all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Perspicacity''' (also called '''perspicaciousness''') is a penetrating discernment (from the Latin perspicācitās, meaning sharpsightedness, discrimination)—a clarity of [[Visionary|vision]] or [[intellect]] which provides a deep understanding and insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Curriculum Building in Nursing |author=Em Olivia Bevis |year=1989 |page=134 |isbn=978-0-7637-0941-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th-century Europe, [[René Descartes]] devised systematic rules for clear thinking in his work ''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind|Regulæ ad directionem ingenii]]'' (Rules for the direction of natural intelligence). In Descartes' scheme, intelligence consisted of two faculties: perspicacity, which provided an understanding or intuition of distinct detail; and sagacity, which enabled reasoning about the details in order to make deductions. Rule 9 was ''De Perspicacitate Intuitionis'' (On the Perspicacity of Intuition).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Regulæ ad directionem ingenii |author=[[René Descartes]], edited and translated by George Heffernan |isbn=978-90-420-0138-1 |year=1998 |publisher=Rodopi |page=122 |chapter=Regula IX De Perspicacitate Intuitionis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He summarised the rule as  {{quote|''Oportet ingenii aciem ad res minimas et maxime faciles totam convertere, atque in illis diutius immorari, donec assuescamus veritatem distincte et perspicue intueri.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should totally focus the vision of the natural intelligence on the smallest and easiest things, and we should dwell on them for a long time, so long, until we have become accustomed to intuiting the truth distinctly and perspicuously.}}

In his study of the elements of [[wisdom]], the modern psychometrician [[Robert Sternberg]] identified perspicacity as one of its six components or dimensions; the other five being [[reasoning]], [[wikt:sagacity|sagacity]], [[learning]], [[judgement]] and the expeditious use of [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Wisdom |author=[[Robert J. Sternberg]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-521-36718-9 |pages=146, 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis, perspicacity was described as {{quote|...has [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]; can offer solutions that are on the side of right and truth;  is able to see through things &amp;mdash; read between the lines; has the ability to understand and interpret his or her environment.|Robert J. Sternberg |Wisdom: its nature, origins, and development}}

In an article dated October 7, 1966, [[Science (journal)|the journal ''Science'']] discussed [[NASA]] [[NASA Astronaut Corps|scientist-astronaut program]] recruitment efforts:
{{quote|To quote an Academy brochure, the quality most needed by a scientist-astronaut is "perspicacity." He must, the brochure says, be able to quickly pick out, from among the thousands of things he sees, those that are significant, and to synthesize observations and develop and test working hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Scientist-Astronauts: Only the "Perspicacious" Need Apply |journal=Science |date=7 October 1966 |volume=154 |pages=133–135 |doi=10.1126/science.154.3745.133 |issue=3745 |pmid=17740099 |author=Carter LJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Being perspicacious about other people, rather than having false illusions, is a sign of good mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.atypon-link.com/GPI/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2006.25.5.542 |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |issn=0736-7236 |volume=25 | issue=5 |date=May 2006 |pages=542–564 |title=On Seeing Clearly and Thriving: Interpersonal Perspicacity as Adaptive (Not Depressive) Realism (Or Where Three Theories Meet) |doi=10.1521/jscp.2006.25.5.542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality is needed in  [[psychotherapist]]s who engage in person-to-person dialogue and counselling of the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Blaine Fowers |year=2005 |title=Virtue and psychology |pages=107–128 |publisher=American Psychological Association |isbn=978-1-59147-251-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[René Magritte]] illustrated the quality in his 1936 painting ''Perspicacity''. The picture shows an artist at work who studies his subject intently: it is an egg.  But the painting which he is creating is not of an egg; it is an adult bird in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Everyday Practice of Science |author=[[Frederick Grinnell (biologist)|Frederick Grinnell]] |page=84 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-506457-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Kindred Dick''' (December 16, 1928&amp;nbsp;– March 2, 1982) was an American writer known for his work in [[science fiction]]. His work explored philosophical, social, and political themes, with stories dominated by [[monopoly|monopolistic]] corporations, [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universes]], [[authoritarian]] governments, and [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]]. His writing also reflected his interest in [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]], and often drew upon his life experiences in addressing the nature of [[reality]], [[Personal identity|identity]], [[drug abuse]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] experiences.

Born in Illinois, he eventually moved to California and began publishing science fiction stories in the 1950s. His stories initially found little commercial success.&lt;ref name="Poverty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/pkdick.htm |title=Philip K.

His 1974 novel ''[[Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said]]'' won the [[Campbell award (best novel)|John W.

Dick]]'' (2011). He died in 1982, at age 53, due to complications from a stroke.

Dick's writing produced 44 published novels and approximately 121 short stories, most of which appeared in [[science fiction magazines]] during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Kimbell | first = Keith  | title = Ranked: Movies Based on Philip K.

A variety of popular films based on Dick's works have been produced, including &lt;!--This list is representative, not exhaustive--&gt; ''[[Blade Runner (film)|Blade Runner]]'' (1982), ''Total Recall'' (adapted twice: [[Total Recall (1990 film)|in 1990]] and [[Total Recall (2012 film)|in 2012]]), ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (2002), ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (2006), ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]'' (2011), and ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' (2017).

==Early life==
Philip Kindred Dick and his [[twin]] sister, Jane Charlotte Dick, were born six weeks prematurely on December 16, 1928, in [[Chicago]], Illinois, to Dorothy (née Kindred; 1900–1978) and Joseph Edgar Dick (1899–1985), who worked for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=PKDCanon&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kucukalic| first = Lejla| title = Philip K.

His family later moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. When Philip was five, his father was transferred to [[Reno, Nevada]]; when Dorothy refused to move, she and Joseph divorced. Both parents fought for custody of Philip, which was awarded to the mother. Dorothy, determined to raise Philip alone, took a job in Washington, D.C., and moved there with her son. Philip was enrolled at John Eaton Elementary School (1936–1938), completing the second through fourth grades. His lowest grade was a "C" in Written Composition, although a teacher remarked that he "shows interest and ability in story telling". He was educated in [[Quakers|Quaker]] schools.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitale |first=Joe |title=Interview with Philip K. Dick |work=Philip K.

Dick attended [[Berkeley High School (California)|Berkeley High School]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. He and fellow science fiction author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] were members of the same graduating class (1947) but did not know each other at the time. After graduation, he briefly attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], (September 1949 to November 11, 1949) with an honorable dismissal granted January 1, 1950. Dick did not declare a major and took classes in history, psychology, philosophy, and zoology. Through his studies in philosophy, he believed that existence is based on internal human perception, which does not necessarily correspond to external reality; he described himself as "an acosmic [[Panentheism|panentheist]]," believing in the universe only as an extension of God.&lt;ref name="Dick, Philip K 2011"&gt;Dick, Philip K. "An Interview With America's Most Brilliant Science-Fiction Writer" Interview by Joe Vitale. Interview With Philip K Dick. Print Interviews. Web. October 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After reading the works of [[Plato]] and pondering the possibilities of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realms, Dick came to the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the world is not entirely real and there is no way to confirm whether it is truly there. This question from his early studies persisted as a theme in many of his novels. Dick dropped out because of ongoing [[anxiety]] problems, according to his third wife Anne's memoir. She also says he disliked the mandatory [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] training. At Berkeley, Dick befriended poet [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]] and poet and [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Jack Spicer]], who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language. Dick claimed to have hosted a classical music program on [[KEAR (AM)|KSMO]] Radio in 1947.&lt;ref name=sutin1&gt;Sutin, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 to 1952, Dick worked at Art Music Company, a record store on [[Telegraph Avenue]].

==Career==

===Early writing===
[[File:Galaxy 195301.jpg|thumb|right|Dick's novelette "The Defenders" was the cover story for the January 1953 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', illustrated by [[Ed Emshwiller]]]]
[[File:Science fiction quarterly 195305.jpg|thumb|right|Dick's short story "The World She Wanted" took the cover of the May 1953 issue of ''[[Science Fiction Quarterly]]'']]
[[File:Satellite science fiction 195612.jpg|thumb|right|Dick's novel ''[[The Cosmic Puppets]]'' originally appeared in the December 1956 issue of ''[[Satellite Science Fiction]]'' as "A Glass of Darkness"]]
Dick sold his first story in 1951, and from then on wrote full-time. During 1952, his first speculative fiction publications appeared in July and September numbers of ''[[Planet Stories]]'', edited by Jack O'Sullivan, and in ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'' and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' that year.&lt;ref name=isfdb /&gt; His debut novel was ''[[Solar Lottery]]'', published in 1955 as half of [[Ace Double]] #D-103 alongside ''The Big Jump'' by [[Leigh Brackett]].&lt;ref name=isfdb /&gt; The 1950s were a difficult and impoverished time for Dick, who once lamented, "We couldn't even pay the late fees on a library book." He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre, but dreamed of a career in mainstream fiction.&lt;ref name="empireonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/philip-k-dick-man-movies/|title=Philip K. Dick: The Man And His Movies|first=HELEN|last=O'HARA|website=Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, he produced a series of non-genre, relatively conventional novels. In 1960, he wrote that he was willing to "take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer". The dream of mainstream success formally died in January 1963 when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency returned all of his unsold mainstream novels. Only one of these works, ''[[Confessions of a Crap Artist]]'', was published during Dick's lifetime.

In 1963, Dick won the Hugo Award for ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]''.&lt;ref name="WWE-1963" /&gt; Although he was hailed as a genius in the science fiction world, the mainstream literary world was unappreciative, and he could publish books only through low-paying science fiction publishers such as [[Ace Books|Ace]]. Even in his later years, he continued to have financial troubles. In the introduction to the 1980 short story collection ''The Golden Man'', Dick wrote:
{{Quote|Several years ago, when I was ill, [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]] offered his help, anything he could do, and we had never met; he would phone me to cheer me up and see how I was doing. He wanted to buy me an electric [[typewriter]], God bless him—one of the few true gentlemen in this world. I don't agree with any ideas he puts forth in his writing, but that is neither here nor there. One time when I owed the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] a lot of money and couldn't raise it, Heinlein loaned the money to me. I think a great deal of him and his wife; I dedicated a book to them in appreciation. Robert Heinlein is a fine-looking man, very impressive and very military in stance; you can tell he has a military background, even to the haircut. He knows I'm a flipped-out freak and still he helped me and my wife when we were in trouble. That is the best in humanity, there; that is who and what I love.}}

===Flight to Canada and suicide attempt===
In 1971, Dick's marriage to Nancy Hackett broke down, and she moved out of their house in [[Santa Venetia, California]]. Having struggled with [[amphetamine]] abuse for much of the past decade (stemming in part from his need to maintain a prolific writing regimen due to the financial exigencies of the science fiction field), he allowed other drug users to move into the house. Following the release of 21 novels between 1960 and 1970, these developments were exacerbated by unprecedented periods of [[writer's block]], with Dick ultimately failing to publish new fiction until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1Te3BhJh9sC|title=The Pocket Essential Philip K. Dick|first=Andrew M.|last=Butler|publisher=Oldcastle Books|date=May 24, 2012|access-date=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note: there are much better references than this possible. --&gt;

One day in November, Dick returned to his home to discover that it had been burglarized, with his safe blown open and personal papers missing. The police were unable to determine the culprit, and even suspected Dick of having done it himself.&lt;ref name="flight"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://amazingstoriesmag.com/2014/06/mad-flight-manic-phoenix-philip-k-dick-vancouver-1972/|title=Mad Flight of a Manic Phoenix, or: Philip K. Dick in Vancouver (1972)|last=Cameron|first=R. Graeme|magazine=[[Amazing Stories]]|date=June 20, 2014|access-date=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he was invited to be guest of honor at the [[Vancouver Science Fiction Convention]] in February 1972. Within a day of arriving at the conference and giving his speech ''The Android and the Human'', he informed people that he had fallen in love with a woman named Janis whom he had met there and announced that he would be remaining in Vancouver.&lt;ref name="flight" /&gt; An attendee of the conference, [[Michael Walsh (film critic)|Michael Walsh]], movie critic for local newspaper ''[[The Province]]'', invited Dick to stay in his home, but asked him to leave two weeks later due to his erratic behavior. This was followed by Janis ending her and Dick's relationship and moving away. On March 23, 1972, Dick attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the sedative [[potassium bromide]].&lt;ref name="flight" /&gt; Subsequently, after deciding to seek help, Dick became a participant in X-Kalay (a Canadian [[Synanon]]-type recovery program), and was well enough by April to return to California.&lt;ref name="flight" /&gt;

Upon relocating to [[Orange County, California]] at the behest of [[California State University, Fullerton]] professor Willis McNelly (who initiated a correspondence with Dick during his X-Kalay stint), he donated [[Manuscript format|manuscripts]], papers and other materials to the University's Special Collections Library, where they are archived in the Philip K. Dick Science Fiction Collection in the Pollak Library. During this period, Dick befriended a circle of Fullerton State students that encompassed several aspiring science fiction writers, including [[K. W. Jeter]], [[James Blaylock]] and [[Tim Powers]].

Dick returned to the events of these months while writing his 1977 novel ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/aug/12/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.philipkdick|title=The drugs did work|first=Philip|last=Purser-Hallard|date=August 11, 2006|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains fictionalized depictions of the burglary of his home, his time using amphetamines and living with addicts, and his experiences of X-Kalay (portrayed in the novel as "New-Path"). A factual account of Dick's recovery program participation was portrayed in his posthumously released book ''[[The Dark Haired Girl]]'', a collection of letters and journals from the period.

===Paranormal experiences===
On February 20, 1974, while recovering from the effects of [[sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]] administered for the extraction of an impacted [[wisdom tooth]], Dick received a home delivery of [[Dextropropoxyphene|Darvon]] from a young woman. When he opened the door, he was struck by the beauty of the dark-haired girl and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. "This is a sign used by the early Christians," she said, and then left. Dick called the symbol the "vesicle pisces". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian [[ichthys]] symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile) which the woman was wearing, and the [[vesica piscis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin |first=System |url=http://mindscapemagazine.com/2012/03/philip-k-dick-and-the-vesica-piscis/ |title=Philip K Dick and the Vesica Piscis « From Around The Web « Mindscape magazine |publisher=Mindscapemagazine.com |date=March 30, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick recounted that as the sun glinted off the gold pendant, the reflection caused the generation of a "pink beam" of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, Dick was startled by a separate recurrence of the pink beam. It imparted the information to him that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where his suspicion was confirmed by professional diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;"Prophets of Science Fiction: Philip K. Dick". The Science Channel. Aired Wednesday, November 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2017}}

After the woman's departure, Dick began experiencing strange hallucinations. Although initially attributing them to side effects from medication, he considered this explanation implausible after weeks of continued hallucinations. "I experienced an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind, as if I had been insane all my life and suddenly I had become sane," Dick told [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]].&lt;ref name=Platt /&gt;

Throughout February and March 1974, Dick experienced a series of hallucinations, which he referred to as "2-3-74",&lt;ref name="empireonline.com"/&gt; shorthand for February–March 1974. Aside from the "pink beam", Dick described the initial hallucinations as [[geometry|geometric]] patterns, and, occasionally, brief pictures of Jesus and [[ancient Rome]]. As the hallucinations increased in length and frequency, Dick claimed he began to live two parallel lives, one as himself, "Philip K. Dick", and one as "Thomas", a Christian persecuted by Romans in the first century AD. He referred to the "transcendentally rational mind" as "Zebra", "God" and "[[VALIS]]". Dick wrote about the experiences, first in the semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Radio Free Albemuth]]'' and then in ''VALIS'', ''[[The Divine Invasion]]'' and the unfinished ''[[The Owl in Daylight]]'' (the [[VALIS trilogy]]).

In 1974, Dick wrote a letter to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], accusing various people, including [[University of California, San Diego]] professor [[Frederic Jameson]], of being foreign agents of [[Warsaw Pact]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, Philip K.  'The Selected Letters of Philip K. Dick: 1974', Underwood-Miller, 1991, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that [[Stanisław Lem]] was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the [[Communist party]] to gain control over public opinion.&lt;ref name=mdavies&gt;[http://culture.pl/en/article/philip-k-dick-stanislaw-lem-is-a-communist-committee "Philip K. Dick: Stanisław Lem is a Communist Committee"], Matt Davies, April 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Dick felt that he had been taken over by the spirit of the prophet [[Elijah]]. He believed that an episode in his novel ''[[Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said]]'' was a detailed retelling of a biblical story from the [[Book of Acts]], which he had never read.&lt;ref name="Adherents"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Religious Affiliation of Science Fiction Writer Philip K. Dick| work=Famous Science Fiction Writers / Famous Episcopalians| publisher=Adherents.com| date = July 25, 2005| url = http://www.adherents.com/people/pd/Philip_K_Dick.html| access-date =April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick documented and discussed his experiences and faith in a private journal he called his "exegesis", portions of which were later published as ''[[The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick]]''. The last novel Dick wrote was ''[[The Transmigration of Timothy Archer]]''; it was published shortly after his death in 1982.

==Personal life==
Dick was married five times:
* Jeanette Marlin (May to November 1948)
* Kleo Apostolides (June 14, 1950 to 1959)
* Anne Williams Rubinstein (April 1, 1959 to October 1965)
* Nancy Hackett (July 6, 1966 to 1972)
* Leslie "Tessa" Busby (April 18, 1973 to 1977)

Dick had three children, Laura Archer Dick (born February 25, 1960 to Dick and his third wife, Anne Williams Rubenstein), Isolde Freya Dick (now [[Isa Dick Hackett]]) (born March 15, 1967 to Dick and his fourth wife, Nancy Hackett), and Christopher Kenneth Dick (born July 25, 1973 to Dick and his fifth wife, Leslie "Tessa" Busby).

In 1955, he and his second wife, Kleo Apostolides, received a visit from the [[FBI]], which they believed to be the result of Kleo's [[Socialism|socialist]] views and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing activities]]. The couple briefly befriended one of the FBI agents.&lt;ref name=sutin2&gt;Sutin, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

He was physically abusive with his third wife, Anne Williams Rubinstein; after one argument in 1963, he attempted to push her off a cliff in a car, then later claimed she was trying to kill him, and convinced a psychiatrist to commit her involuntarily. After filing for divorce in 1964, he moved to Oakland to live with a fan, [[Grania Davis]]. Shortly after, he attempted suicide by driving off the road while she was a passenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5lHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53 |pages=53–56 |title=The Divine Madness of Philip K. Dick |last=Arnold |first=Kyle |date=2016-05-02 |isbn=0190498315 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick tried to stay out of the political scene because of high societal turmoil from the [[Vietnam War]]; however, he did show some [[anti-Vietnam War]] and anti-governmental sentiments.  In 1968, he joined the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]",&lt;ref name="Dick, Philip K 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest". ''[[New York Post]]''. January 30, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; an anti-war pledge to pay no U.S. [[federal income tax]], which resulted in the [[confiscation]] of his car by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].

==Death==
On February 17, 1982, after completing an interview, Dick contacted his therapist, complaining of failing eyesight, and was advised to go to a hospital immediately, but did not. The following day, he was found unconscious on the floor of his [[Santa Ana, California]] home, having suffered a [[stroke]]. On February 25, 1982, Dick suffered another stroke in the hospital, which led to [[brain death]]. Five days later, on March 2, 1982, he was disconnected from [[life support]] and died. After his death, Dick's father, Joseph, took his son's ashes to Riverside Cemetery in [[Fort Morgan, Colorado]], (section K, block 1, lot 56), where they were buried next to his twin sister Jane, who died in infancy. Her tombstone had been inscribed with both of their names at the time of her death, 53 years earlier.&lt;ref name=carrere /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, pg.289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Find A Grave: Philip K.

==Style and works==

===Themes===
{{quote box
|quote= Dick's third major theme is his fascination with war and his fear and hatred of it. One hardly sees critical mention of it, yet it is as integral to his body of work as oxygen is to water.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Stories Of Philip K. Dick, Volume 1, ''[[The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford (collection)|The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford]]'', (1990), Citadel Twilight, p. xvi, {{ISBN|0-8065-1153-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick's stories typically focus on the fragile nature of what is real and the construction of [[personal identity]]. His stories often become surreal fantasies, as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion assembled by powerful external entities, such as the suspended animation in ''Ubik'',&lt;ref name="Ursula" /&gt; vast political conspiracies or the vicissitudes of an [[unreliable narrator]]. "All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality", writes science fiction author [[Charles Platt (science-fiction author)|Charles Platt]]. "Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely."&lt;ref name=Platt&gt;{{Cite book| last = Platt | first = Charles| authorlink = Charles Platt (science-fiction author)| title = Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction| publisher=Berkley Publishing| year = 1980| isbn = 0-425-04668-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Alternate universes]] and [[simulacrum|simulacra]] are common [[plot devices]], with fictional worlds inhabited by common, working people, rather than galactic elites. "There are no heroes in Dick's books", [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] wrote, "but there are heroics. One is reminded of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]: what counts is the honesty, constancy, kindness and patience of ordinary people."&lt;ref name="Ursula"&gt;{{cite web | title = Criticism and analysis| publisher=Gale Research| year = 1996| url = http://www.stud.hum.ku.dk/rydahl/pkd/PKDcritic1.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307193543/http://www.stud.hum.ku.dk/rydahl/pkd/PKDcritic1.htm| archivedate = March 7, 2007| access-date =April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick made no secret that much of his thinking and work was heavily influenced by the writings of [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref name=carrere&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Am Alive and You Are Dead: A Journey Into the Mind of Philp K. Dick |last=Carrère |first=Emmanuel |year=2004 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-5464-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philipkdick.com/media_sfeye87.html A Conversation With Philip K.

Dick's self-named ''[[Exegesis (book)|Exegesis]]'' also contained many notes on Jung in relation to theology and mysticism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Dick identified one major theme of his work as the question, "What constitutes the authentic human being?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dick|first=Philip K.|title=I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon|year=1985|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|isbn=0-385-19567-2|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In works such as ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', beings can appear totally human in every respect while lacking soul or compassion, while completely alien beings such as Glimmung in ''[[Galactic Pot-Healer]]'' may be more humane and complex than their human peers.

Mental illness was a constant interest of Dick's, and themes of mental illness permeate his work. The character Jack Bohlen in the 1964 novel ''[[Martian Time-Slip]]'' is an "ex-schizophrenic". The novel ''[[Clans of the Alphane Moon]]'' centers on an entire society made up of descendants of lunatic asylum inmates. In 1965, he wrote the essay titled "Schizophrenia and the Book of Changes".&lt;ref name=sutin&gt;Sutin, npg&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug use (including [[Entheogenic|religious]], [[Recreational drug use|recreational]], and [[Drug abuse|abuse]]) was also a theme in many of Dick's works, such as ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'' and ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]''. Dick himself was a drug user for much of his life. According to a 1975 interview in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web| last = Williams| first = Paul| title = The Most Brilliant Sci-Fi Mind on Any Planet: Philip K. Dick|work=Rolling Stone | date = November 6, 1975| url = http://www.philipkdickfans.com/mirror/articles/1974_Rolling_Stone.pdf| access-date = November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick wrote all of his books published before 1970 while on [[amphetamine]]s. "''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'' (1977) was the first complete novel I had written without speed", said Dick in the interview. He also experimented briefly with [[psychedelics]], but wrote ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'', which ''Rolling Stone'' dubs "the classic [[LSD]] novel of all time", before he had ever tried them. Despite his heavy amphetamine use, however, Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him, that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

Summing up all these themes in ''Understanding Philip K. Dick'', Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or 'ideas and motifs':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Link| first = Eric Carl| title = Understanding Philip K.

Dick| pages = 48–101| publisher=University of South Carolina Press| year = 2010| isbn = 978-1-57003-855-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pen names===
Dick had two professional stories published under the [[Pen name#Western literature|pen names]] Richard Phillipps and Jack Dowland. "Some Kinds of Life" was published in October 1953 in ''[[Fantastic Universe]]'' under byline Richard Phillipps, apparently because the magazine had a policy against publishing multiple stories by the same author in the same issue; "Planet for Transients" was published in the same issue under his own name.&lt;ref&gt;Levack, Daniel (1981). ''PKD: A Philip K. Dick Bibliography'', [[Underwood/Miller]], pp. 116, 126 {{ISBN|0-934438-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "[[Orpheus with Clay Feet]]" was published under the pen name Jack Dowland. The protagonist desires to be the [[muse]] for fictional author Jack Dowland, considered the greatest science fiction author of the 20th century. In the story, Dowland publishes a short story titled "Orpheus with Clay Feet" under the pen name Philip K. Dick.

The surname Dowland refers to [[Renaissance]] composer [[John Dowland]], who is featured in several works. The title ''[[Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said]]'' directly refers to Dowland's best-known composition, "Flow My Tears". In the novel ''[[The Divine Invasion]]'', the character Linda Fox, created specifically with [[Linda Ronstadt]] in mind, is an intergalactically famous singer whose entire body of work consists of recordings of John Dowland compositions.

===Selected works===
{{For|complete bibliography|Philip K. Dick bibliography}}
''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' (1962) is set in an [[alternate history]] in which the United States is ruled by the victorious [[Axis powers]]. It is the only Dick novel to win a [[Hugo Award]]. Most recently this has been adapted into a television series by [[Amazon Studios]].

''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' (1965) utilizes an array of science fiction concepts and features several layers of reality and unreality. It is also one of Dick's first works to explore religious themes. The novel takes place in the 21st century, when, under UN authority, mankind has colonized the [[Solar System]]'s every [[habitability|habitable]] [[planet]] and [[moon]]. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies. Most entertain themselves using "Perky Pat" [[doll]]s and accessories manufactured by Earth-based "P.P. Layouts". The company also secretly creates "Can-D", an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to "translate" into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat's boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.

''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968) is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population. It occurs on a dying, poisoned Earth de-populated of almost all animals and all "successful" humans; the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off-world. The 1968 novel is the literary source of the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="Sammon"&gt;^ Sammon, Paul M. (1996). Future Noir: the Making of Blade Runner. London: Orion Media. p. 49. {{ISBN|0-06-105314-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a conflation and an intensification of the pivotally Dickian question: What is real, what is fake? What crucial factor defines humanity as distinctly "alive", versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance?

''[[Ubik]]'' (1969) employs extensive psychic telepathy and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality. A group of psychics is sent to investigate a rival organisation, but several of them are apparently killed by a saboteur's bomb. Much of the following novel flicks between different equally plausible realities; the "real" reality, a state of half-life and psychically manipulated realities. In 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine listed it among the "All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels" published since 1923.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

''[[Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said]]'' (1974) concerns Jason Taverner, a television star living in a dystopian near-future [[police state]]. After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in a dingy Los Angeles hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet, but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience, as security checkpoints (manned by "pols" and "nats", the police and National Guard) are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID. Jason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his innate charm and social graces to help him as he tries to find out what happened to his past while avoiding the attention of the pols. The novel was Dick's first published novel after years of silence, during which time his critical reputation had grown, and this novel was awarded the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel]].&lt;ref name="WWE-1975"/&gt; It is the only Philip K. Dick novel nominated for both a Hugo and a [[Nebula Award]].

In an essay written two years before his death, Dick described how he learned from his Episcopal priest that an important scene in ''Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said'' – involving its other main character, the eponymous Police General Felix Buckman, was very similar to a scene in ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'',&lt;ref name="Adherents"/&gt; a book of the [[New Testament]]. Film director Richard Linklater discusses this novel in his film ''[[Waking Life]]'', which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, ''[[Time Out of Joint]]''.

''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'' (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and [[police procedural]] novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to the same permanently mind-altering drug, Substance D, he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to [[A Scanner Darkly (film)|film]] by [[Richard Linklater]].

''[[The Philip K. Dick Reader]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dick|first=Philip K.|title=Philip K. Dick Reader, The|year=1997|publisher=Citadel Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-8065-1856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an introduction to the variety of Dick's short fiction.

''[[VALIS]]'' (1980) is perhaps Dick's most [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[autobiographical novel]], examining his own unexplained experiences. It may also be his most academically studied work, and was adapted as an opera by [[Tod Machover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Machover| first = Tod
|authorlink = Tod Machover| title = Valis CD| publisher=[[MIT Media Lab]]| url = http://web.media.mit.edu/~tod/Tod/valiscd.html| access-date =April 14, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080312210723/http://web.media.mit.edu/~tod/Tod/valiscd.html |archivedate = March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later works like the [[VALIS trilogy]] were heavily autobiographical, many with "two-three-seventy-four" (2-3-74) references and influences. The word [[VALIS]] is the acronym for ''Vast Active Living Intelligence System''. Later, Dick theorized that VALIS was both a "reality generator" and a means of extraterrestrial communication. A fourth VALIS manuscript, ''Radio Free Albemuth'', although composed in 1976, was posthumously published in 1985. This work is described by the publisher (Arbor House) as "an introduction and key to his magnificent VALIS trilogy".

Regardless of the feeling that he was somehow experiencing a divine communication, Dick was never fully able to rationalize the events. For the rest of his life, he struggled to comprehend what was occurring, questioning his own sanity and perception of reality. He transcribed what thoughts he could into an eight-thousand-page, one-million-word [[diary|journal]] dubbed the ''[[Exegesis (book)|Exegesis]]''. From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick spent many nights writing in this journal. A recurring theme in ''Exegesis'' is Dick's hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century AD, and that "the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] never ended". He saw Rome as the pinnacle of [[materialism]] and [[despotism]], which, after forcing the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] underground, had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had communicated with him, and anonymously others, to induce the [[impeachment]] of U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor of Rome incarnate.

In a 1968 essay titled "Self Portrait", collected in the 1995 book ''The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick'', Dick reflects on his work and lists which books he feels "might escape World War Three": ''[[Eye in the Sky (novel)|Eye in the Sky]]'', ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', ''[[Martian Time-Slip]]'', ''[[Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb]]'', ''[[The Zap Gun]]'', ''[[The Penultimate Truth]]'', ''[[The Simulacra]]'', ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' (which he refers to as "the most vital of them all"), ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', and ''[[Ubik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Dick, "Self Portrait", 1968, (''The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick'', 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1976 interview, Dick cited ''A Scanner Darkly'' as his best work, feeling that he "had finally written a true masterpiece, after 25 years of writing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://philipkdick.com/media_sfreview.html AN INTERVIEW WITH PHILIP K. DICK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085817/http://philipkdick.com/media_sfreview.html |date=May 11, 2012 }} Daniel DePerez, September 10, 1976, Science Fiction Review, No. 19, Vol. 5, no. 3, August 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

====Films====
Several of Dick's stories have been made into films. Dick himself wrote a screenplay for an intended film adaptation of ''[[Ubik]]'' in 1974, but the film was never made. Many film adaptations have not used Dick's original titles. When asked why this was, Dick's ex-wife Tessa said, "Actually, the books rarely carry Phil's original titles, as the editors usually wrote new titles after reading his manuscripts. Phil often commented that he couldn't write good titles. If he could, he would have been an advertising writer instead of a novelist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Knight| first = Annie| author2 = John T Cullen| author3 = the staff of Deep Outside SFFH| title = About Philip K.

*''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), based on Dick's 1968 novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Harrison Ford]]. A screenplay had been in the works for years before Scott took the helm, with Dick being extremely critical of all versions. Dick was still apprehensive about how his story would be adapted for the film when the project was finally put into motion. Among other things, he refused to do a novelization of the film. But contrary to his initial reactions, when he was given an opportunity to see some of the special effects sequences of Los Angeles 2019, Dick was amazed that the environment was "exactly as how I'd imagined it!", though Ridley Scott has mentioned he had never even read the source material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Kermode, Mark| title = On the Edge of Bladerunner| medium = TV documentary|publisher=Channel 4 |location=UK | date = July 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the screening, Dick and Scott had a frank but cordial discussion of ''Blade Runner's'' themes and characters, and although they had wildly differing views, Dick fully backed the film from then on, stating that his "life and creative work are justified and completed by ''Blade Runner''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philipkdick.com/new_letters-laddcompany.html | title=Letter to Jeff Walker regarding "Blade Runner" | access-date=May 31, 2016 | last=Dick | first=Philip K. | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031213103657/http://www.philipkdick.com/new_letters-laddcompany.html | archivedate=December 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick died from a stroke less than four months before the release of the film.

In 1993, French writer [[Emmanuel Carrère]] published ''Je suis vivant et vous êtes morts'' which was first translated and published in English in 2004 as ''I Am Alive and You Are Dead: A Journey Into the Mind of Philip K. Dick'', which the author describes in his preface in this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;The book you hold in your hands is a very peculiar book. I have tried to depict the life of Philip K. Dick from the inside, in other words, with the same freedom and empathy – indeed with the same truth – with which he depicted his own characters.&lt;ref name=carrere /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Critics of the book have complained about the lack of fact checking, sourcing, notes and index, "the usual evidence of deep research that gives a biography the solid stamp of authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sean |last=O'Hagen |title=What a clever Dick |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/sciencefiction/0,6121,1504386,00.html#article_continue |work=The Observer |location=UK |date=June 12, 2005 |access-date=April 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Charles |last=Taylor |title=Just Imagine Philip K.

===Contemporary philosophy===
[[Postmodernism|Postmodernists]] such as [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Laurence Rickels]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]] have commented on Dick's writing's foreshadowing of postmodernity.&lt;ref name=Matrix&gt;{{Cite book| last = Myriam Díaz-Diocaretz, Stefan Herbrechter| title = The Matrix in theory| page = 136 |publisher=Rodopi |year=2006 |isbn=978-90-420-1639-2 &lt;!--|ISBN=90-420-1639-6 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Baudrillard offers this interpretation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move "through the mirror" to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/55/baudrillard55art.htm | title = 'Simulacra and Science Fiction'   | first =  Jean | last = Baudrillard | publisher=Science Fiction Studies | access-date =May 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For his anti-government skepticism, Philip K. Dick was afforded minor mention in ''Mythmakers and Lawbreakers'', a collection of interviews about fiction by anarchist authors. Noting his early authorship of ''[[The Last of the Masters]]'', an anarchist-themed novelette, author Margaret Killjoy expressed that while Dick never fully sided with [[anarchism]], his opposition to government centralization and organized religion has influenced [[Anarchism and religion#Gnosticism|anarchist interpretations of gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Killjoy|first=Margaret|title=Mythmakers and Lawbreakers|publisher=[[AK Press]]|location=Stirling|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84935-002-0|oclc=318877243|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pneumatics''' ("spiritual", from Greek {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα}}, [[Pneuma|"spirit"]]) were, in [[Gnosticism]], the highest order of humans, the other two orders being psychics and [[hylics]] ("matter"). A pneumatic saw itself as escaping the doom of the material world via the transcendent knowledge of [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]]'s [[Divine Spark]] within the soul.

{{quote|They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material, and animal .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption. The animal, if it make choice of the better part, finds repose in the intermediate place; but if the worse, it too shall pass into destruction. But they assert that the spiritual principles which have been sown by [[Achamoth]], being disciplined and nourished here from that time until now in righteous souls (because when given forth by her they were yet but weak), at last attaining to perfection, shall be given as brides to the angels of the Saviour, while their animal souls of necessity rest for ever with the [[Demiurge]] in the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|intermediate place]]. And again subdividing the animal souls themselves, they say that some are by nature good, and others by nature evil. The good are those who become capable of receiving the [spiritual] seed [and becoming ''pneumatic'']; the evil by nature are those who are never able to receive that seed [and become ''hylic''].|[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter VII.|Irenaeus, ''Adv. Haer''. I. 7, 5]]}}

In the New Testament a contrast is made between the ''psychikoi'' and the ''pneumatikoi'', in the former of whom the mere animal soul predominates, the latter exhibiting the working of a higher spiritual nature ({{bibleverse||Jude|19}}; {{bibleverse|1|Cor.|2:14-15}}; compare also {{bibleverse-nb|1|Cor.|15:44-46}}). In the [[Valentinianism|Valentinian system]] this contrast is sharpened, and is made to depend on an original difference of nature between the two classes of men, a mythical theory being devised which professed to account for the origin of the different elements in men's nature; the psychic element being something higher and better than the mere material element, but immeasurably inferior to the pneumatic. It may well be believed that in the language of the Gnostic sects, the "pneumatici" are "spiritual men who have attained to the perfect knowledge of God, and been initiated into these mysteries by Achamoth" herself ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter VI.|''Adv. Haer''. I. 6, 1]]), ordinary Christians being branded as "psychici."

Such was also the use made of the latter word by [[Tertullian]], who in his latest works, written after his [[Montanism]] had involved him in complete separation from the church, habitually uses the word ''Psychici'' to designate those from whom he had separated. 

==Descriptive term in religious studies==
In the [[Religious studies|academic study]] of religion and [[mysticism]] more generally, pneumatic has been used as a classification term to define similar trends in wider contexts. For example, [[Joseph G. Weiss]] describes "A Circle of Pneumatics in Pre-[[Hasidism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Chapter in ''Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism'', Joseph Weiss, Littman Library&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of [[Jewish mysticism]]. Here the pneumatic group have minor prophetic powers ("[[Ruah Ha-qodesh]]" in Jewish parlance), such as revealing the sins of their fellows. However they decide to renounce use of this, probably in response to communal suspicion in the wake of the [[Sabbatean]] Kabbalistic heresy. The [[Baal Shem Tov]], founder of Hasidism, seeks recognition in the group, but is initially hindered by his lower status as a [[Baal Shem]] exorcist.

The '''Potter Box''' is a model for making [[ethical decision]]s, developed by [[Ralph B. Potter, Jr.]], professor of social ethics [[professor emeritus|emeritus]] at [[Harvard Divinity School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph Benajah Potter, Jr.|url=http://hds.harvard.edu/people/ralph-benajah-potter|work=Harvard Divinity School website|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used by communication ethics scholars. According to this model, moral thinking should be a systematic process and how we come to decisions must be based in some reasoning.

==Steps==
The Potter Box is an ethical framework used to make decisions by utilizing four categories which Potter identifies as universal to all ethical dilemmas. Potter was a theologian when he developed this moral reasoning framework. The Potter Box uses four dimensions of moral analysis to help in situations where ethical dilemmas occur: Facts, Values, Principles, and Loyalties as described below. 
The Potter Box consists of a few simple steps, which can be completed in any order. You may also move between the steps several times before an adequate decision is made. The steps are numbered for simplicity's sake, and it may help you to organize the steps into quadrants (Cliff Christens came up with this idea).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christians|first=Clifford|title=Media Ethics: Cases and Moral Reasoning|year=2001|publisher=Longman|location=New York|isbn=0801333385|edition=6th|author2=Mark Fackler |author3= Kim B. Rotzoll }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition / Facts===
The definition stage of the Potter Box concerns the facts of the issue at hand. Here is where the analyst should set out all facts without making judgments or hiding any facts. 
Example: Using a photograph of a car wreck to promote safe driving, making it visible to the target viewers.

===Values===
At this stage the analyst should state and compare the merits of different values to acknowledge the influences on decision-making.  By referring to the specific concerns of the individuals involved, it allows the analyst to identify differences in perspectives.
We may judge something according to aesthetic values(harmonious, pleasing), professional values(innovative, prompt), logical values(consistent, competent), sociocultural values(thrift, hard work), and moral values(honesty, nonviolence).

Example (continued)- Will the shock value of the images encourage safe driving habits? Will the images stir up potentially disturbing memories for certain people?

===Principles===
Principles are ethical philosophies or modes of ethical reasoning that may be applicable to the situation. By considering the values stated above from several ethical philosophies, the decision-maker is better equipped to understand the situation. The following are some of the ethical philosophies that may be utilized under this segment of Potter's Box:

* '''Aristotle's Golden Mean'''. [[Aristotle]]'s Golden Mean defines moral virtue as a middle state determined by practical wisdom that emphasizes moderation and temperance.
* '''Confucius' Golden Mean'''. [[Confucius]]' Golden Mean is more commonly known as the compromise principle and says moral virtue is the appropriate location between two extremes.
* '''Kant's Categorical Imperative'''. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s Categorical Imperative dictates that you must do unto others what you would want them to do unto you, or to act as if your personal decisions and actions could become universal law.
* '''Mill's Principle of Utility'''. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s Principle of Utility dictates that we must seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.
* '''Rawls' Veil of Ignorance'''. [[John Rawls]]' Veil of Ignorance asks us to assume we don't know which stakeholder position we would find ourselves in, removing our personal interests from the analysis.
* '''Agape Principle'''. This principle, also known as the 'Persons as Ends' principle, emphasizes love for our fellow humans and the [[Ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]]. He stresses that when we love our neighbors, we shall seek to do good to them, therefore, we should love fellow humans the same way we love ourselves.

These help link concrete options to overarching principles, getting us to think about our own basic values.

===Loyalties===
Loyalties concern who the decision-maker has allegiances or loyalties to. For example, in journalism, the first allegiance is always to the public. Other allegiances a journalist might have would be to his or her employer, industry organizations or co-workers. Are we more concerned about being true to our own values or about the effectiveness of the campaign? Is the "greater good" more important than the "golden mean"?

===Understanding Values===
To understand the Potter Box method, you must first understand types of Values categorized that influence Ethical behavior:

'''Professional'''.
Proximity, Firstness, Impact/ magnitude, Recency, Conflict, Human Interest, Entertainment, Novelty, Toughness, Thoroughness, Immediacy, Independence, No prior restraint, Public’s right to know

'''Moral Values'''.
Truth-telling, Humanness, Justice/fairness, Freedom, Independence, Stewardship, Honesty, Nonviolence, Commitment, Self-control

'''Aesthetic'''.
Harmonious, Pleasing, Imaginative

'''Logical'''.
Consistent, Competent, Knowledgeable

'''Socio-cultural'''.
Thrift, Hard work, Energy, Restraint

==Using the Potter Box==
The Potter Box focuses on moral issues as opposed to pragmatic or legal ones, such as how to avoid getting sued or fired. With regard to ethics, however, it can be used to reflect on any situation that requires moral decision-making. Its four steps, at least initially, should be followed in order.

The Potter Box does not offer a single, clear-cut solution to ethical dilemmas. Indeed, two different people analyzing the same issue with the Potter Box could arrive at two very different conclusions. Moreover, the same person analyzing the same issue could come to different decisions when using the Box at two different times. Nevertheless, the Potter Box can help you think through what to do. It offers a process to help you weigh your options in a methodical manner.

In addition, the name "Potter Box" may indicate that this process is very rigid, but in fact it is fluid, and you may have to go back and forth among the steps before you can reach a conclusion that satisfies you. This process also becomes easier and quicker with practice. Over time, it can become second nature.

'''Robert Merrihew Adams''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born September 8, 1937) is an [[American philosophy|American]] [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] of [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of religion|religion]] and [[ethics|morality]].

==Biography==
Adams was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He taught for many years at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], before moving to [[Yale University]] in the early 1990s as the Clark Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics. As chairman, he helped revive the philosophy department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/03/02/philosophy-takes-steps-to-rebuild/|title=Philosophy takes steps to rebuild|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after its near-collapse due to personal and scholarly conflicts between analytical and Continental philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9803/asbad.html|title=Lingua Franca - As Bad As It Gets|website=linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adams retired from Yale in 2004 and taught part-time at the [[University of Oxford]] in England, where he was a senior research fellow of [[Mansfield College, Oxford|Mansfield College]]. In 2009 he became a Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Adams's late wife, [[Marilyn McCord Adams]], was also a philosopher, working on medieval philosophy and the philosophy of religion and was the [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. In 2013 both became visiting research professors at [[Rutgers University]], in conjunction with the founding of the Rutgers Center for the Philosophy of Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcpr.rutgers.edu/|title=Home|website=rcpr.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historical scholar, Adams has published on the work of the philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. His work in the philosophy of religion includes influential essays on the [[problem of evil]] and the relation between theism and ethics. In [[metaphysics]], Adams defends [[actualism]] in metaphysics of modality and [[Platonism]] about nature of so-called [[possible worlds]]. He is a past president of the [[Society of Christian Philosophers]]. In 1999, he delivered the Gifford Lectures on "God and Being." He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/2006/adams_r.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708042355/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/2006/adams_r.cfm |archivedate=2015-07-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3440">'''Ruth Lapide''' (née Ruth Rosenblatt; born 1929 in [[Burghaslach]]), [[Franconia]], [[Germany]], is a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[theology|theologian]] and [[history|historian]] who is foremost among [[German language]] scholars that endeavor to facilitate and improve understanding between Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]], to a degree also with [[Muslims]]. An important part of her work deals with [[Bible|biblical]] mistranslations and with the Jewish roots of Christianity. She worked in this endeavor with her husband [[Pinchas Lapide]] until his death in 1997, after which she began a writing career while teaching at the [[Evangelische Fachhochschule Nürnberg|Evangelischen Fachhochschule]] in [[Nuremberg]]. She is widely known from numerous [[television]] interviews about biblical topics broadcast by [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|Bavarian Broadcasting]] and [[Bibel TV]].

== Life ==
Ruth Lapide studied [[political science]], [[history]] and [[Judaism|Judaic studies]] at [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]]. She specialized in the evolution of Christianity as a Jewish-rooted religion and became full [[professor]]. Since her return to Germany, she has been putting much effort into helping to facilitate dialog and reconciliation between Jews and Christians, between Germany and the State of [[Israel]]. In this she and her [[Austria|Austrian-born]] husband worked as partners until his death.

Ruth Lapide has been living in [[Frankfurt am Main]] since the mid-1970s.

== Honors ==
In 2000, Ruth Lapide was awarded Germany’s most prestigious medal, the [[Bundesverdienstkreuz]], and on April 11, 2003, she received the ''Hessischen Verdienstorden am Bande'', the most prestigious medal of the German state of [[Hesse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://starweb.hessen.de/cache/STANZ/00035.tif StAnz. 35/2003 p. 3478]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 she received an honorary professorate and in 2008 received an honorary doctorate at the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Augustana-Hochschule]] in [[Neuendettelsau]], Central Franconia, [[Bavaria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5323">'''Schizoanalysis''' ({{lang-fr|schizanalyse}}; ''schizo-'' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σχίζειν ''skhizein'', meaning "to split") is a concept created by philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] and psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]] and first expounded in their book ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). Its formulation was continued in their follow-up work, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''. Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari.

In ''Chaosmosis'', Guattari explains that "rather than moving in the direction of [[reductionism|reductionist]] modifications which simplify the complex", schizoanalysis "will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and [[differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]], in short towards its ontological [[heterogeneity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Guattari (1992, 61).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the idea==
Schizoanalysis was developed over a long period of time as a response to the perceived shortcomings in the basic premises of psychoanalytic practice. Guattari was directly confronted with such problems in the work of [[Sigmund Freud]]—namely, the use of the [[Oedipus complex]] as a starting point for the analysis, and the authoritarian role of the psychoanalyst in relationship to the patient. Guattari was interested in a practice that could derive from given systems of enunciation and preexisting subjective structures new "assemblages [''agencements''] of enunciation" capable of forging new coordinates of analysis and to bring into existence unforeseen propositions and representations.

By the time of "Five Propositions on Psychoanalysis" (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, Desert Islands and Other Texts, 1953–1974, MIT Press, 2004 (pp. 274--280), originally published in "Relazione di Gilles Deleuze" and discussions in Armando Verdiglione, ed., ''Psicanalisi e Politica; Atti del Convegno di studi tenuto a Milano l'8—9 Maggio 1973''. Milan: Feltrinelli, 1973, pp. 7-11, 17-21, 37-40, 44-45, 169-172. Abridged and edited&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze said "we no longer want to talk about schizoanalysis, because that would amount to protecting a particular type of escape, schizophrenic escape".

==Components==
Schizoanalysis can be represented by four circular components that bud and form [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizomes]]:&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1980, 160-2).&lt;/ref&gt;

# The generative component: the study of concrete mixed [[semiotics]]; their mixtures and variations. Making a tracing of the mixed semiotics.
# The transformational component: the study of pure semiotics; their transformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics. Making the transformational map of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creation, for budding along the lines of the tracings.
# The diagrammatic component: the study of abstract machines, from the standpoint of semiotically unformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters. Making the diagram of the abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities or as effective [[emergence]]s.
# The machinic component: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content. Outlining the program of the assemblages that distribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives, jumps, and mutations.

Schizoanalysis also proposes a novel take on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari, [[Anti-Oedipus]] (1972, 351-352 and 381), &lt;/ref&gt; inasmuch as it concerns an analysis of the "''n'' sexes" of a subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12975">'''Significs''' ({{lang-nl|significa}}) is a linguistic and philosophical term introduced by [[Victoria, Lady Welby]] in the 1890s. It was later adopted&lt;ref&gt;As ''significa''.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Dutch Significs Group (or movement) of thinkers around [[Frederik van Eeden]], which included [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], founder of [[intuitionistic logic]], and further developed by [[Gerrit Mannoury]] and others.

== Overview ==
Significs, intended to be a theory of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], was developed by Lady Welby in quite close connection with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], her correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SS|Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence Between Charles S. Peirce and Victoria, Lady Welby]]'' (1977) edited by Charles S. Hardwick and J. Cook (1977), 2nd edition 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no scholarly consensus on its precise placing as an influence on later developments: on the ground now occupied by [[semantics]], [[semiotics]] and [[semiology]], it is closer to semiology than to the two others. While significs is a possible precursor of later semiology, it is still a matter of debate what the extent of that connection amounts to.

At a personal level Lady Welby did have some effect, particularly on [[C. K. Ogden]]. A mediating figure, she has not until quite recently been given great attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augustoponzio.com/authors.htm#Problems%20of%20Language%20in%20Welby's%20Significs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928225449/http://www.augustoponzio.com/authors.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}:''Her influence has gone largely unnoticed having been most often than not unrecognized. [...] Ogden promoted significs as a university student during the years 1910-1911, and contributed to spreading Welby's ideas. Recent research (cf. Gordon 1991; Petrilli) has documented the influence exerted by Welby and her significs on Ogden, and yet the importance of this relationship is not recognized by him in [[The Meaning of Meaning]] (1923), where she is very quickly disposed of in a footnote.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significs topics ==
The following sections are taken directly from the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] article written by Lady Welby.

===Definition===
The term "Significs" may be defined as the science of meaning or the study of significance, provided sufficient recognition is given to its practical aspect as a method of mind, one which is involved in all forms of mental activity, including that of logic. In [[James Mark Baldwin|Baldwin]]'s ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' (1901–1905) the following definition is given:

1. Significs implies a careful distinction between
:(a) sense or signification,
:(b) meaning or intention and
:(c) significance or ideal worth.
It will be seen that the reference of the first is mainly verbal (or rather sensal), of the second volitional, and of the third moral (e.g. we speak of some event ' the significance of which cannot be overrated, and it would be impossible in such a case to substitute the ' sense ' or the ' meaning ' of such event, without serious loss).
Significs treats of the relation of the sign in the widest sense to each of these.

2. A proposed method of mental training aiming at the concentration of intellectual activities on that which is implicitly assumed to constitute the primary and ultimate value of every form of study, i.e. what is at present indifferently called its meaning or sense, its import or significance.... Significs as a science would centralise and co-ordinate, interpret, inter-relate and concentrate the efforts to bring out meanings in every form, and in so doing to classify the various applications of the signifying property clearly and distinctly." Since this dictionary was published, however, the subject has undergone further consideration and some development, which necessitate modifications in the definition given. It is clear that stress needs to be laid upon the application of the principles and method involved, not merely, though notably, to language, but to all other types of human function. There is need to insist on the rectification of mental attitude and increase of interpretative power which must follow on the adoption of the significal view-point and method, throughout all stages and forms of mental training, and in the demands and contingencies of life.

=== Scope ===
In so far as it deals with linguistic forms, Significs includes "[[Semantics]]," a branch of study which was formally introduced and expounded in 1897 by [[Michel Breal]], the distinguished French philologist, in his Essai de semantique. In 1900 this book was translated into English by [[Henry_Cust#Marriage|Mrs Henry Cust]], the daughter of Lady Welby, with a preface by [[John Percival Postgate|Professor Postgate]]. M. Breal gives no more precise definition than the following: "Extraire de la linguistique ce qui en ressort comme aliment pour la réflexion et - je ne crains pas de l'ajouter - comme règle pour notre propre langage, puisque chacun de nous collabore pour sa part a l'évolution de la parole humaine, voila ce qui mérite d'être mis en lumière, voila ce qui j'ai essayé de faire en ce volume." In the Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology Semantics is defined as "the doctrine of historical word-meanings; the systematic discussion of the history and development of changes in the meanings of words." It may thus be regarded as a reform and extension of the etymological method, which applies to contemporary as well as to traditional or historical derivation. As human interests grow in constantly specialized directions, the vocabulary thus enriched is unthinkingly borrowed and reborrowed on many sides, at first in definite quotation, but soon in unconscious or deliberate adoption. Semantics may thus, for present purposes, be described as the application of Significs within strictly philological limits; but it does not include the study and classification of the "Meaning" terms themselves, nor the attainment of a clear recognition of their radical importance as rendering, well or ill, the expressive value not only of sound and script but also of all fact or occurrence which demands and may arouse profitable attention.

===Objectives===
The first duty of the Significian is, therefore, to deprecate the demand for mere linguistic reform, which is indispensable on its own proper ground, but cannot be considered as the satisfaction of a radical need such as that now suggested. To be content with mere reform of articulate expression would be fatal to the prospect of a significantly adequate language; one characterized by a development only to be compared to that of the life and mind of which it is or should be naturally the delicate, flexible, fitting, creative, as also controlling and ordering, Expression.

The classified use of the terms of expression-value suggests three main levels or classes of that value - those of Sense, Meaning and Significance.

:(a) The first of these at the outset would naturally be associated with Sense in its most primitive reference; that is, with the organic response to environment, and with the essentially expressive element in all experience. We ostracize the senseless in speech, and also ask "in what sense" a word is used or a statement may be justified.

:(b) But "Sense" is not in itself purposive; whereas that is the main character of the word "Meaning," which is properly reserved for the specific sense which it is intended to convey.

:(c) As including sense and meaning but transcending them in range, and covering the far-reaching consequence, implication, ultimate result or outcome of some event or experience, the term "Significance" is usefully applied.

These are not, of course, the only significal terms in common use, though perhaps sense and significance are on the whole the most consistently employed. We have also signification, purport, import, bearing, reference, indication, application, implication, denotation and connotation, the weight, the drift, the tenour, the lie, the trend, the range, the tendency, of given statements. We say that this fact suggests, that one portends, another carries, involves or entails certain consequences, or justifies given inferences. And finally we have the value of all forms of expression; that which makes worthwhile any assertion or proposition, concept, doctrine or theory; the definition of scientific fact, the use of symbolic method, the construction of mathematical formulae, the playing of an actor's part, or even art itself, like literature in all its forms.

The distinctive instead of haphazard use, then, of these and like terms would soon, both as clearing and enriching it, tell for good on our thinking. If we considered that any one of them were senseless, unmeaning, insignificant, we should at once in ordinary usage and in education disavow and disallow it. As it is, accepted idiom may unconsciously either illuminate or contradict experience. We speak, for instance, of going through trouble or trial; we never speak of going through well-being. That illuminates. But also we speak of the Inner or Internal as alternative to the spatial - reducing the spatial to the External. The very note of the value to the philosopher of the "Inner" as opposed to the "Outer" experience is that a certain example or analogue of enclosed space - a specified inside - is thus not measurable. That obscures. Such a usage, in fact, implies that, within enclosing limits, space sometimes ceases to exist. Comment is surely needless.

===Education===
The most urgent reference and the most promising field for Significs lie in the direction of education. The normal child, with his inborn exploring, significating and comparing tendencies is so far the natural Significian. At once to enrich and simplify language would for him be a fascinating endeavour. Even his crudeness would often be suggestive. It is for his elders to supply the lacking criticism out of the storehouse of racial experience, acquired knowledge and ordered economy of means; and to educate him also by showing the dangers and drawbacks of uncontrolled linguistic, as other, adventure. Now the evidence that this last has virtually been hitherto left undone and even reversed, is found on careful examination to be overwhelming.' Unhappily what we have so far called education has, anyhow for centuries past, ignored - indeed in most cases even balked - the instinct to scrutinise and appraise the value of all that exists or happens within our ken, actual or possible, and fittingly to express this.

== Significs movement ==
The Dutch significs thinkers, besides van Eeden and Brouwer, included [[David van Dantzig]], [[Herman Gorter]], [[Jacob Israël de Haan]], [[Henri Borel]], [[Gerrit Mannoury]]&lt;ref&gt;Mannoury, a mathematician, had been Brouwer's teacher. See ''[http://www.informationdynamics.nl/pwisse/htm/mannoury.htm Mannoury's significs, or a philosophy of communal individualism]'', by Pieter Wisse.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Evert W. Beth]], a group with varied professional affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Significs and the Origin of Analytic Philosophy'', Ahti-Veikko Pietarinen. ([http://www.helsinki.fi/~pietarin/brpage/significs-analytic-philosophy.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828083542/http://www.helsinki.fi/~pietarin/brpage/significs-analytic-philosophy.pdf |date=2005-08-28 }}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Signifische Kring&lt;ref&gt;Signific Circle in English&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1922 by Brouwer, Mannoury, [[Frederik van Eeden|van Eeden]] and [[Jacques van Ginneken]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brouwer/ Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer].&lt;/ref&gt; Its later Dutch institutional history included the advent of biologists [[Hermann Jacques Jordan]] and [[Christiaan Pieter Raven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sifa.unige.it/genoa04/talks/pietarinen.pd=latestReleased (PDF)], long paper in Dutch.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally there were set up the ''International Group for the Study of Significs'', followed by the ''International Society for Significs''.&lt;ref&gt;Pietarinen, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
One of Davies's first journal publications was 'The Expression of Emotion in Music', published in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1980 (Vol. 89, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–86). In this article Davies first outlined his theory that music is expressive of emotions in virtue of resembling the way that emotions appear. This theory is similar to one outlined by [[Peter Kivy]] in his book ''The Corded Shell'', also published in 1980. However, Davies developed his view independently as an undergraduate in the 1970s, and the theory was part of his PhD thesis awarded in 1976 from the University of London.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Kivy, Davies also places a greater emphasis on the resemblance between music and physical gesture, where Kivy tends to emphasize the resemblance to the expressive vocalisations. Davies was inspired when seeing an advertisement for [[Hush Puppies]] shoes, with the thought that we recognize sadness in the face of [[Basset Hound|Basset hounds]], despite knowing that they do not feel sad.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies also maintains a research interest in ethnomusicology, which he studied as an undergraduate,&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2003: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the aesthetics of [[Music of Bali|Balinese music]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., his article [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00234.x/abstract;jsessionid=BB7C33A7CCC63E4294B8FD7B672294D6.d03t01 'Balinese Aesthetics']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Taigu school''' (太谷学派 ''Tàigǔ xuépài''), also '''Great Perfection''' (大成教 ''Dàchéng jiào'') or '''Yellow Cliff teaching''' (黄崖教 ''Huángyá jiào''), is a [[mystical]] [[Chinese folk religion|folk religious]] sect of [[Confucianism]] spread especially in [[Jiangsu]], [[Anhui]] and [[Shandong]]. It was founded by Zhou Xingyuan, a man with [[shamanic]] skills entitled ''Taigu'' (太谷 "Great Valley") by followers.{{sfnb|Ma|2007|p=239}}

The purpose of the school is to help those who practice it to develop a clear and enlightened state of mind, in which man apprehends his true nature and recovers original simplicity.{{sfnb|Ma|2007|p=233}}

"'''Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana'''" is a [[Humour|humorous]] [[Adage|saying]] that is used in [[linguistics]] as an example of a [[garden path sentence]] or [[syntactic ambiguity]], and in [[word play]] as an example of [[pun]]ning, [[double entendre]], and [[antanaclasis]].

==Analysis of the basic ambiguities==
"'''Time flies like an arrow'''" is an English phrase often used to illustrate [[syntactic ambiguity]].&lt;ref name=mey&gt;
  Marc de Mey(1982), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tMCXlAXnVb8C&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=F-WjBvfk6p&amp;dq=The%20cognitive%20paradigm%3A%20an%20integrated%20understanding%20of%20scientific%20development%20D.%20Reidel%20%281992%29%2C%20University%20of%20Chicago%20Press%20%281992%29.&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22time%20flies%20like%20an%20arrow%22&amp;f=false The cognitive paradigm: an integrated understanding of scientific development]'' D. Reidel (1992), University of Chicago Press (1992).
&lt;/ref&gt; 
In this connection the sentence is often seen as part of the elaboration: "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana".

Modern English speakers understand the sentence to unambiguously mean "As a generalisation, time passes in the same way that an arrow generally flies (i.e. quickly)". But the sentence is syntactically ambiguous and alternatively could be interpreted as meaning, for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven |title=The Language Instinct |publisher=W. Morrow and Co. |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=209 |isbn=0-06-097651-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* (as an ''[[Imperative mood|imperative]]'') Measure the speed of flies like you would measure that of an arrow—i.e. (You should) time flies as you would time an arrow.
* (''imperative'') Measure the speed of flies in the way an arrow would—i.e. (You should) time flies in the same manner that an arrow would time them.
* (''imperative'') Measure the speed of flies with qualities resembling those of arrows—i.e. (You should) time those flies that are like an arrow.
* (''[[Declarative sentence|declarative]]'') Time moves in a way an arrow would.
* (''declarative'', i.e. neutrally stating a [[proposition]]) Certain flying insects, called "time flies", enjoy an arrow.

In addition, the sentence contains [[Syntactic ambiguity#Syntactic and semantic ambiguity|semantic ambiguity]]. For instance, the noun phrase "Time flies" could refer to all time flies or particular time flies, and "an arrow" to all arrows, a particular arrow, or different arrows for different flies; compare "Fruit flies like a banana", "Fruit flies ate a banana", "Fruit flies live on a banana".  Likewise, the noun "Time" could refer to the [[Time (magazine)|magazine]].

==History==
The expression is based on the proverb: "Time flies", a translation of the Latin ''[[Tempus fugit]]'', where "fly" is to be taken in the sense of  ''flee''.

An early example of a pun with the expression "Time flies" may be found in a 1930 issue of ''[[Boys' Life]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
;Flies Around
:''Scoutmaster'': Time flies.
:''Smart Tenderfoot'': You can't. They go too fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |journal= Boys' Life |quote= The official youth magazine for the Boy Scouts of America |date= February 1930 |page= 48 |publisher= Boy Scouts of America, Inc |issn= 0006-8608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= 
https://books.google.co.za/books?id=CgQU09UDVaIC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Boys%20Life%20Feb%201930&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |publisher= Boy Scouts of America |journal= Boys' Life |date= February 1930 |page= 48 |first= Francis J. |last= Rigney |title= Think and Grin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anthony Oettinger]] gives "fruit flies like bananas" as contrasted with "time flies like an arrow" as an example of the difficulty of handling ambiguous syntactic structures as early as 1963,&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Alumni Bulletin'', '''66''':205, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; although his formal publications with [[Susumu Kuno]] do not use that example.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Anthony Oettinger, Susumo Kuno, "Syntactic structure and ambiguity of English", ''Proceedings of the AFIPS'' Fall 1963:397-418. {{doi|10.1145/1463822.1463864}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is quoted by later authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The computer age and its potential for management|author=Gilbert Burck |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1965 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fuller exposition with the banana example appeared in a 1966 article by Oettinger.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony G. Oettinger, "The Uses of Computing in Science", ''[[Scientific American]]'' '''215''':3 (September 1966); republished as ''Information'', W.H. Freeman, 1966. Lib. of Congress No. 66-29386&lt;/ref&gt;

This article prompted the following response in a letter:&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific American'', November 1966, p. 12, correspondence column&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Time Flies Like an Arrow'''

An Ode to Oettinger
&lt;poem&gt;
Now, thin fruit flies like thunderstorms,
And thin farm boys like farm girls narrow;
And tax firm men like fat tax forms –
But time flies like an arrow.

When tax forms tax all firm men's souls,
While farm girls slim their boyfriends' flanks;
That's when the murd'rous thunder rolls –
And thins the fruit flies ranks.

Like tossed bananas in the skies,
The thin fruit flies like common yarrow;
Then's the time to time the time flies –
Like the time flies like an arrow.
Edison B. Schroeder 1966&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The verse is popular as a specimen of didactic humor trading on [[syntactic ambiguity]]. Like the poem ''[[The Chaos]]'',  by [[Gerard Nolst Trenité]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j17/caos.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050415131319/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j17/caos.php |archivedate=April 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its themes are popular among practitioners and students in fields such as [[natural language processing]] and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurafsky, Daniel &amp; Martin, James H. Speech and Language Processing. Pub. Pearson Prentice Hall 2008. {{ISBN|978-0131873216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other attributions===

The saying is sometimes attributed to [[Groucho Marx]], but the earliest attribution to him dates only to 1982,&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/net.jokes/z_X93iYiJLA/W5UDCyQMs4kJ&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no reason to believe he actually said it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Yale Book of Quotations]] |editor=Fred R. Shapiro |editor-link=Fred R. Shapiro |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2006 |page=498 |isbn= 978-0-300-10798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in linguistics==
The saying is used as a [[List of linguistic example sentences|linguistic example]] of [[antanaclasis]], the stylistic [[trope (linguistics)|trope]] of repeating a single word, but with a different meaning each time.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

It is also used as an example of [[pun]]ning.{{cn|date=September 2015}}  The wordplay is based on the distinct meanings of the two occurrences of the word ''flies'' (the verb "[[flight|travel through the air]]" and the noun for [[Drosophila melanogaster|certain insects]]), and of the word ''like'' (the [[preposition]] "similarly to" and the verb "enjoy").  For example, the second clause can be read as "fruit travels through the air similar to a banana" or as "certain insects enjoy a banana".

This is an example of a [[garden-path sentence]], a phrase that the reader or listener normally begins to [[parse]] according to one grammatical structure, and is then forced to back up and reparse when the sentence ends in an unexpected way.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

'''Trāṭaka''' ([[Sanskrit]] n. त्राटक ''trāṭaka'', ''tratak'', ''trataka'': "to look, or to gaze") is a method of [[meditation]] that involves staring at a single point such as a small object, black dot or candle flame. It is said to bring energy to the "third eye" (''[[ājňā]] [[chakra]]'') and promote various [[psychic]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, ''Dynamics of Meditation'', Bombay, India, 1972, pages 271-3 [http://www.osholeela.com/meditation/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Purpose==
By fixing the gaze the restless mind too comes to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurumaa.com/ajna-chakra-concentration-meditation.php Tratak - a divine gaze by] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223104456/http://www.gurumaa.com/ajna-chakra-concentration-meditation.php |date=2009-02-23 }} [[Anandmurti Gurumaa]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said also that control of the [[Ciliary body|ciliary]] (blink) reflex stimulates the [[pineal gland]],&lt;ref name=beso&gt;[http://besorongola.tripod.com/Silhouette/Creativity/TratakMeditation.doc Tratak Meditation]&lt;/ref&gt; which Kundalini Yoga identify with the third eye. Trāṭaka is said to enhance the ability to concentrate. It increases the power of memory and brings the mind to a state of awareness, attention and focus.&lt;ref name=soulcurry&gt;[http://soulcurrymagazine.com/sc/tratak.html Tratak article in ''Soul Curry'' magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818172919/http://soulcurrymagazine.com/sc/tratak.html |date=2010-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The practitioner may fix attention on a symbol or [[yantra]], such as the [[Om]] symbol, a black dot, the image of some deity or guru, a flame, a mirror or any point, and stare at it. A candle should be three to four feet (1 metre plus) away, the flame level with the eyes. Relax but keep the spine erect and remain wakeful and vigilant.&lt;ref name=soulcurry/&gt; The eyes begin to water. Some authorities recommend that the eyes should then be closed and the [[yogi]] concentrate on the [[after image]], while others persevere with staring for 30–40 minutes.

'''Yuanwu Keqin''' ({{zh|c=圓悟克勤|w=Yuan-wu K'e-ch'in|p=Yuánwù Kèqín}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: Engo Kokugon) (1063–1135) was a [[Han Chinese]] [[Chan Buddhism|Chan monk]] who compiled the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]''.{{sfn|Cleary|1994}}

==Biography==
Yuanwu Keqin was born into the Le family of [[Pengzhou]], [[Sichuan]], in 1063. His family was well educated in [[Confucianism]], a sign of acquaintance with the Chinese civil service.{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=73}} Nevertheless, Yuanwu Keqin choose a Buddhist career and entered Miaoji Monastery ({{zh|t=妙寂禪院|p=Miàojì Chányuàn}},a monastery in Pengzhou. He ended his formal studies under Wuzu Fayan (1047-1104) when he was in his forties.{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=73}} Yuanwu Keqin was closely involved in the literati circles.{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=74}}

==''Blue Cliff Record''==
{{Main|Blue Cliff Record}}

Yuanwu Keqin belonged to the [[Linji school]]. He was the teacher of [[Dahui Zonggao]], who introduced the [[Hua Tou]] practice.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}

Starting from the year 1112 on, Yuan-wu started to lecture on the ''One Hundred Old Cases and Verses [to the Cases]''{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=72}} compiled by Xuedou Zhongxian (980–1052). These lectures resulted in the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]''.{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=76}}{{sfn|Cleary|1994}}

The ''Blue Cliff Record'' gives clear instructions about the correct approach to [[kōan]]. Yuanwu went as far as to annotate the poems line by line{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=77}} to make clear the correct reading of Xuedou's appended verses,{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=76}} which are complex, because of the rich use of symbolism and the allusions to Chinese secular literature and to Chan history.{{sfn|Hsieh|1994|p=77}}

According to the Chán-tradition, the Blue Cliff Record gained such a popularity, that Dahui Zonggao burned all the copies he could lay hands on, and the wooden printing blocks.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}
