"'''Ahab the Arab'''" is a [[novelty song]] written and recorded by [[Ray Stevens]] in 1962. In the song, Arab is pronounced "Ay-rab" to rhyme with Ahab. The hero of the story is Clyde the camel and Stevens has made references to Clyde numerous times throughout his career.

It followed "[[Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills]]", becoming his second top 40 hit. It reached number five on Billboard's Hot 100 and number nine on the Billboard R&amp;B chart. It remains one of the best-selling records of Stevens' career. Stevens has recorded the song at least three times and there have also been edited versions.

== Lyrics ==

The song portrays a "[[shaikh|sheik]] of the burning sands" named Ahab. He is highly decorated with jewelry, and every night he hops on his camel named Clyde on his way to see Fatima, who is the best dancer in the [[Sultan]]'s [[harem]].  Fatima is described with a modified quote from the 1909 hit, "[[I've Got Rings On My Fingers]]": "with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes and a bone in her nose, ho ho". During the ride, Ahab "speaks" (actually, produces ululations that parody the [[Arabic language]]) to Clyde. (A later version adds the advertising catch phrase "[[American Tobacco Company#Advertising|Sold, American]]!" to the end of one chant. This is perhaps due to a [[Kinky Friedman]] (famous for the song and album ''Sold American'') cover version which also added those lines). The phrase was also well known to Americans from the commercials for radio's popular ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes. The program began and ended with two tobacco auctioneers rattling off prices in a rapid-fire similar to Stevens' delivery, ending with "Sold American!"

When Ahab finds Fatima in her tent, she is ironically engaged in stereotypically [[Western culture|Western behavior]]: "eating on a raisin, and a grape, and an apricot, and a pomegranate, a bowl of chittlins, two bananas, three Hershey bars, and 
sipping on an RC Cola, and eating a Moon Pie, listenin' to her [[transistor radio|transistor]], watchin' the [[Grand Ole Opry]], and readin' ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' while she sung, '[[Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)|Does your chewing gum lose
its flavor?]]'" Ahab woos Fatima with another mock Arabic chant, this time a quote from the song "[[Let's Twist Again]]" by [[Chubby Checker]]. Fatima (portrayed by Stevens in [[falsetto]]) responds to Ahab's advances with laughter and an (English) utterance that Ahab is "crazy".

Ahab loves Fatima, which apparently does not sit too well with the Sultan, whose appearance prompts an escape attempt, which does succeed, because Clyde was the fastest camel in the desert, and they "lived happily ever after" (the original single version was edited and does not mention the escape attempt at all, instead ending the song with Fatima saying, "Crazy, baby!").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themadmusicarchive.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=443 "Ahab the Arab"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203040420/http://www.themadmusicarchive.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=443 |date=February 3, 2010 }}, Mad Music Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Stevens' career ==

Along with "[[The Streak]]", it was one of Stevens' biggest hits and contributed greatly to his popularity. It reached number 5 on the Billboard top 40 during July 1962.

A later song by Stevens, a Christmas novelty number called "Santa Claus Is Watching You", features a "cameo" by Clyde. The intrepid camel is pressed into service in place of [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]] (in different recordings of the song, the famous reindeer's reason for being absent alternates between "He's at a stakeout at your house" or being "all stove up in the hospital" after injuring himself during "a [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest"). The song also repeats the "Ahab the Arab" schtick of reciting a random list of objects, in this case gifts for "all the good little girls and boys."

Stevens has said that Clyde the camel was named after rhythm-and-blues singer [[Clyde McPhatter]], formerly the lead singer of [[The Drifters]].  Clyde is arguably the most memorable character of the song, due to Stevens' exaggerated imitation of a camel's braying vocalization.  Clyde has become something of a mascot for Stevens, and for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s the artist released albums and video entertainment under the label Clyde Records (complete with camel-shaped logo). Clyde Records continues to be the outlet for a lot of contemporary material from Stevens.

Stevens' music publishing company was once named Ahab Music Inc. before he changed its name in 1977 to Ray Stevens Music. His publishing company is affiliated with BMI.

== Other versions ==
*A cover version of Stevens' song was released in July 1962 by disc jockey [[Jimmy Savile]], backed by the English pop group [[The Tremeloes]], featuring [[Brian Poole]].
* A parody version was released in 1962 as "Mori The Hori" by the [[Howard Morrison Quartet]]
*John Dunn under Hit Records recorded a cover in 1962 and was it released as a 7" 45rpm record.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/John-Dunn-4-Herbert-Hunter-Ahab-The-Arab-Dancin-Party/release/3036780 "John Dunn (4) – Ahab The Arab"], Discogs.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stevens himself re-recorded the song for his 1969 album ''[[Gitarzan (album)|Gitarzan]]'' and a third recording showed up in 1995 for the song's official music video release. 
*[[Kinky Friedman]] also recorded a version of the song on his 1977 album ''Lasso from El Paso''.
*[[Cledus T. Judd]] covered the song in his 2007 album ''[[Boogity, Boogity - A Tribute to the Comedic Genius of Ray Stevens|Boogity, Boogity – A Tribute to the Comedic Genius of Ray Stevens]]''.

==Early life and education==
Bassett was born on August 16, 1958 in New York City, the daughter of Betty Jane (née Gilbert; 1935–2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sptimes/obituary.aspx?pid=171499429 Betty Bassett Obituary Tampa Bay Times] accessed November 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and Daniel Benjamin Bassett (1924–1981),&lt;ref name='DBB-Grave'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/139572184 |title=Daniel Benjamin Bassett, Jr. |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Find A Grave |publisher= |access-date=August 4, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised in Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, Angela (2009), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=friends&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.faithfulreader.com/reviews/0373830580-excerpt.asp| title=Friends: A Love Story | first=Angela | last=Bassett |first2= Courtney B.|last2= Vance|first3= Hilary| last3= with Beard|publisher=Kimani Press (excerpt via) Faithful Reader.com| isbn=9780373830589| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624211656/http://faithfulreader.com/reviews/0373830580-excerpt.asp| archivedate=June 24, 2007|quote=...she met my daddy, Daniel Benjamin Bassett, who'd moved to New York from Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Bassett said the pregnancy "only made things harder." Bassett's parents "shipped" her to stay with her father's sister Golden. While her aunt did not have any children of her own, she "loved children, and she was good with them."&lt;ref name=Bassett12&gt;Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her parents' separation, she relocated from [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], where she and her sister D'nette were raised by their social worker/civil servant mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/9/Angela-Bassett.html |title=Angela Bassett Biography (1958–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDC1E3FF930A15755C0A965958260 |title=As Tina Turner, Wig to High Heels – |work=The New York Times |date=June 23, 1993 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassett did not see her father again for several years, until she attended her grandmother's funeral. There, Bassett met his daughter from his first marriage, Jean, who at twelve years old, was several years older than Bassett.&lt;ref name="Bassett18-19" /&gt; After graduating from Jordan Park Elementary School, she began being bused out of her neighborhood to attend Disston Middle School for seventh grade. The year she began attending was 1970, the first year busing was implemented to integrate public schools in St. Petersburg. After completing seventh grade, she was bused to Azalea Middle School for eighth and ninth grade. Bassett's mother became more involved in her daughter's grades and told her and her sister the pair were going to college.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her younger years, Bassett was "in love" with the [[Jackson 5]] and dreamed of marrying a member of the family group, stating it would probably be "whoever had the cutest, roundest Afro at the time. In my imagination we would have children and live in a real house."&lt;ref name="Bassett18-19"&gt;Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; As her interest in entertainment developed, Angela and her sister would often put on shows, reading poems or performing popular music for their family.&lt;ref name=Bassett29 /&gt;

[[File:Boca Ciega High School.JPG|thumb|right|[[Boca Ciega High School]], where Bassett as a teenager was a member of the debate team and student government among other endeavors.]]
At [[Boca Ciega High School]], Bassett was a cheerleader and a member of the [[Upward Bound]] college prep program, the debate team, student government, drama club and choir. A straight "A" and "B" student for the most part, Bassett got her first "C," in physical education, and tried to get her mother to not feel disappointment in the grade. Bassett called the grade the "average," leading her mother to say that she did not have "average kids." As Bassett described, a "sense of pride" developed in her and she did not get another "C" until college.&lt;ref name="Oprah.com" /&gt; During high school, Bassett became the first African-American from Boca Ciega to be admitted to the National Honor Society. She participated in Upward Bound, an academic and cultural enrichment program for underprivileged students. Bassett says she and the other participants did not see themselves as underprivileged.&lt;ref name=Bassett29&gt;Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassett attended [[Yale University]] and received her B.A. degree in [[African-American studies]] in 1980. In 1983, she earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree from the [[Yale School of Drama]], despite opposition from her father's sister who warned her to not "waste" her "Yale education on theater." She was the only member of Bassett's family to have gone to both college and graduate school.&lt;ref name="Oprah.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Angela-Bassetts-Aha-Moment|title=Angela Bassett's Aha! Moment|publisher=Oprah.com|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale, Bassett met her future husband [[Courtney B. Vance]], a 1986 graduate of the drama school. Bassett was also classmates with actor [[Charles S. Dutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15284&amp;Itemid=331|title=Celebrities, Community Activists Put Gun Violence in the Spotlight|date=January 23, 2014|work=South Florida Times|first=Erick|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Bassett worked as a receptionist for a beauty salon and as a photo researcher. Bassett soon looked for acting work in the New York theater. One of her first New York performances came in 1985 when she appeared in [[J. E. Franklin]]'s ''Black Girl'' at [[Second Stage Theatre]]. She appeared in two [[August Wilson]] plays at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] under the direction of her long-time instructor [[Lloyd Richards]]. The Wilson plays featuring Bassett were ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'' (1984) and ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]'' (1986). In 2006, she had the opportunity to work on the Wilson canon again, starring in ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' alongside longtime collaborator [[Laurence Fishburne]] at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in California.

In 2018, Basset was awarded an [[honorary doctoral degree]] in fine arts from her alma mater, Yale University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/angela-bassett-honorary-degree-yale|title=Angela Bassett Is Now Dr. Angela Bassett After Receiving Honorary Degree From Yale|work=Essence.com|access-date=May 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For her portrayal of [[Betty Shabazz]], she earned an [[NAACP Image Award|Image Award]]. Despite the award, the movie was not entirely given positive reception, being referred to by critics as failing to "capture" the rage of [[Autobiography of Malcolm X|Malcolm X's autobiography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-07-23/entertainment/9307210869_1_autobiography-of-malcolm-malcolm-x-born-malcolm|title='X' Fails To Capture Rage Of Autobiography|date=July 23, 1993|work=Orlando Sentinel|first=Jay|last=Boyar}}&lt;/ref&gt; During production of ''Malcolm X'', Spike Lee showed Bassett a tape of the exact moment when Malcolm X was shot during his assassination, since they would be filming the scene. Bassett called the recording "haunting", but noted that after listening, she was "able to grab hold of the pain and re-create the scene." Bassett felt it was important for her to get the assassination scene correct, and wondered how Betty "found the strength to keep going, to raise her family, to educate, to sustain them."&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, Angela, (2009), pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Malcolm X'' was released on November 18, 1992.

===1990s===
In 1992, Bassett played [[Katherine Jackson]] in ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]''. Bassett's agents tried to discourage her from playing the role, given the negative reception that [[Michael Jackson]] had. She admitted to not caring about the negative view of members of the Jackson family at the time, citing her childhood fondness of the group as an example of her passion for the project and believed her "instinct" about the role had been correct once learning of the positive reviews the miniseries received after airing.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, Angela (2009), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Bassett had previously idolized the group growing up and said the Jackson family were positive influences on the African-American community for their successes. Bassett had previously worried that after her role as Betty Shabazz in ''Malcolm X'', she would not find another role "as satisfying". Bassett at the time of the film's release expressed her belief that her career would never receive such high-profile roles again. "I think I have been incredibly blessed and it is probably just all downhill from here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-15/news/tv-621_1_katherine-jackson|title=Her 'American Dream': Angela Bassett Says Playing the Mother of the Jackson's Was Emotional and Uplifting|date=November 15, 1992|first=Susan|last=King|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first African-American to win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. Bassett obtained the role after beating [[Halle Berry]] and [[Robin Givens]], but only had a month to prepare before filming began. She met Tina Turner twice, and was given advice by the woman she would be portraying from wigs and outfits to dancing styles. Turner also did Bassett's make up, leading Bassett to call her "supportive" and her "biggest fan."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/movies/as-tina-turner-wig-to-high-heels.html|title=As Tina Turner, Wig to High Heels|date=June 23, 1993|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassett described to the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' going to one of Turner's concerts and crying profusely.

Bassett starred in three movies in 1995, which were released with varied reactions from critics: ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'', ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'', and ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'' (where she worked with author [[Terry McMillan]]). In ''Strange Days'', Bassett played Lornette "Mace" Mason, a chauffeur and bodyguard. In ''Vampire in Brooklyn'', she played Rita Veder, a tortured cop with a dark secret.

Bassett described the then-recently filmed party scene and her character in ''Waiting to Exhale'' to the ''Orlando Sentinel''.

===2000s===
In 2000, Bassett turned down the lead role in ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' because of the script's sexual content; the role earned [[Halle Berry]] the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. The first film Bassett appeared in that year was ''[[Supernova (2000 film)|Supernova]]'', where she played a medical officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/supernova/review/|title=Supernova Review|first=Kim|last=Newman|publisher=Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/011800/ent_plot.shtml|title=Talent of cast wasted on 'Supernova' plot|date=January 18, 2000|first=Chip|last=Chandler|publisher=Armarillo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other two films released in 2000 were ''[[Whispers: An Elephant's Tale]]'' and ''[[Boesman and Lena]]''.

== Roles ==
Bassett has been noted for portraying real life African-American women, as well as strong women. Bassett said in 2001 that she liked those roles and added: "That's the image that I like to put out there, and those are the parts I'm attracted to. But not iron-fist kind of strong, just self-assured. I'm nice too."&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2001 /&gt; She has turned down roles which she viewed as demeaning to her image. "This is a career about images. It's celluloid; they last for ever. I'm a black woman from America. My people were slaves in America, and even though we're free on paper and in law, I'm not going to allow you to enslave me on film, in celluloid, for all to see. And to cross the water, to countries where people will never meet people who look like me. So it becomes a bigger thing than me just becoming a movie star, and me just being on TV. So if you're going to show every black woman as 400lb or every black woman as the prostitute on the street ... But I have always maintained that [the roles] I cannot do because of the way I'm made up, or because of the way I think, I don't begrudge that there is someone else who has no issues with that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/12/question-time-angela-bassett|date=February 11, 2009|title=Question time: Angela Bassett on why she is drawn to playing strong women|work=The Guardian|first=Hannah|last=Pool|authorlink=Hannah Pool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Psalter of Oswald - Harley 2904 f3v Crucifixion.jpg|thumb|[[Ramsey Psalter]], tinted drawing of the Crucifixion, f.3v]] 
The '''Reliquary Cross''' is a late 10th century [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo Saxon]] ivory figure of Christ, set on an [[Ottonian Art|Ottonian]] cross to make a [[reliquary]] in the form of a [[crucifix]].  It is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London (Cat. 7943-1862, usually on display in room 8, case 16, in the "Medieval and Renaissance" gallery).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;  

The cross is made of [[cedar wood]] and covered with plates of gold [[filigree]] work.  The "corpus" or figure of Christ, was probably made in [[Winchester]], and is in [[walrus ivory]]; the [[Titulus (inscription)|titulus]] and medallions are in [[cloisonné|cloisonné enamel]], and apparently also English.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The body of the reliquary, because of a technical "trick" in the gold filigree, is thought to be German, around the same date, probably from the area of [[Aachen]] and [[Essen]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 194&lt;/ref&gt; 

The V&amp;A says "the cross is one of the rare surviving pieces which give substance to descriptions in contemporary documentary sources of the sumptuous church furnishings of pre-Conquest England. The enamels are unique in Anglo-Saxon art and may have been made by an English goldsmith familiar with German work.  The wood core of the cross was perhaps regarded as a [[relic]] of the [[True Cross]].  It is most unlikely because of its size and weight, that it was made to be worn as a [[pectoral cross]] and more probable that the suspension loop allowed it to hang above an altar or shrine."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Description ==
The body of the cross is of cedar wood, covered with sheets of gold, the back with repousse decoration now badly crumpled and flattened, the front decorated with filigree work, enamels and an ivory corpus of the figure of Christ. This is carved in walrus ivory. Haloed and crowned, the bearded Christ wears an elaborately pleated loin-cloth, knotted through the folded girdle. The head leans towards the right shoulder and the long hair falls in several plaits onto the shoulders. The figure is held in place by golden nails through the palms. The [[Titulus (inscription)|titulus]] above Christ and four medallions with emblems of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]]s are of cloisonné enamel. The back of the cross shows the [[Lamb of God|Holy Lamb]] and the emblems of the Evangelists in repoussé or beaten work.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The height of the cross is 18.5 cm, the width 13.7 cm, the depth 2.6 cm, the weight 0.22 kg. The height of the figure is 12.2 cm, the width 10.9 cm.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1926, during cleaning work, a human finger, perhaps female, was found in a cavity underneath the corpus. A fragmentary and not totally legible inscription around the edge of the cross seems to list the relics of saints once contained in the cavity beneath the ivory figure of Christ.
: 'IHS NAZARENUS' 
: RE(LIQVIE LIGNI) ....VLQ DE...O ET CAMIN....(IHS.XPS) AMD NIS//RV....EDA....DI....DI SIMEONIS ET MAR&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Despite Papal disapproval of the dismemberment of saints, a finger relic was by no means unusual in Anglo-Saxon England: King [[Athelstan]] bestowed one third of his extensive collection of relics to the [[Exeter monastery|monastery of St. Mary and St. Peter]] at [[Exeter]] in AD 932. The gift included a finger, purportedly that of [[Mary Magdalene]].

[[David M. Wilson|David Wilson]] points to the close similarity between the figure on the cross and that in a tinted drawing in the [[Ramsey Psalter]], dated 980-1000.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

Veneration of the True Cross in Jerusalem is referred to in the Catecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem, dating the earliest reported practice to ca. 340AD.Although relics of the cross proliferated after this date they lost none of their spiritual potency and were frequently used as gifts between royalty and the upper echelons of the clergy : Radegunda, Queen of the Franks obtained a relic of the True Cross from the Emperor Justin II, in 569 and Gregory the Great (540-604) sent a portion of the Cross to Theodolinda, Queen of the Lombards and another to Recared, the first Catholic King of Spain.
The Golden Legend which relates details of the Legend of the True Cross records a tradition that the cross was fashioned of four different woods: cypress, olive, the wood of the palm-tree and cedar. --&gt;

'''Asian-American theatre''' is [[theatre]] written, directed or acted by [[Asian Americans]]. From initial efforts by four theatre companies in the 1960s, Asian-American theatre has grown to around forty groups today. Early productions often had Asian themes or settings, but today it is becoming more common to see Asian-Americans in roles that defy the stereotypes.

== Background ==
Asian-American theatre emerged in the 1960s and the 1970s with the foundation of four theatre companies: [[East West Players]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Asian American Theatre Workshop]] (later renamed Asian American Theater Company) in [[San Francisco]], Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (later renamed Northwest Asian American Theatre) in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], and [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]] in [[New York City]].  The Northwest Asian American Theatre was one of the first in the Pacific Northwest. The four companies have provided the resources and opportunities to actors, writers, directors, designers, and producers to pursue and define ''Asian-American theatre'' for over five decades.  By the end of the 1990s, the number of Asian-American theatre companies and performance groups grew to about forty.  In addition, such companies helped integrate Asian-Americans into many popular theatre companies by normalizing Asian actors. Asian-American plays have appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatres]] and have received major awards both nationally and internationally. Asian-American actors have used Asian-American theatre companies as their artistic bases while pursuing careers in the mainstream theatre, film and television. Alternative forms of theatre and performance such as multimedia performance, [[One man show|solo performance]] and [[spoken word]] have also shaped Asian-American theatre. In the beginning, participants of Asian-American theatre were mostly of [[East Asia]]n descent, but in the 1990s and the 21st century, more artists of [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n and backgrounds have joined the community and have made Asian-American theatre one of the fastest growing and changing sectors in [[Theater in the United States|American theatre]].

== Asian-American theatre companies ==
[[East West Players]] (EWP) was founded in 1965 by a group of actors who wanted to fight racism in the entertainment industry by creating non-stereotypical roles for Asian Americans. Led by the [[Japanese Americans|Japanese-American]] actor [[Mako (actor)|Mako]], the actors at EWP first saw theatre as a venue to showcase their talent for television and film producers and directors, but by the early 1970s, the EWP began to actively sponsor original plays by Asian Americans. [[Frank Chin]], who founded the Asian American Theatre Workshop, argued that Asian-American actors needed Asian-American playwrights to create believable roles and to end dependence on the mainstream acting industry.  Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (TEA) began in 1974 on the campus of the [[University of Washington]], and after the founding students graduated, moved into a theatre in the International District, renaming them selves the Asian Exclusion Act. The theatre group moved around several locations before finding a home at the Theatre Off Jackson. It was late renamed again as the Northwest Asian American Theatre (NWAAT).  In addition to acting and playwriting, NWAAT emphasized community activism and became a cultural center for Asian Americans in Seattle; many of the plays they performed were directly targeted at expressing the painful history of discrimination Asian-Americans in America suffered after the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].  [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]] (Pan Asian Rep), on the other hand, emerged as part of [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre in 1978. Founded by [[Tisa Chang]], Pan Asian Rep became the representative Asian-American theatre company in New York City and introduced Asian-American plays to the East Coast audiences.  In the 1980s and 1990s, Asian-American theatre companies were founded with more diverse purposes and styles.  Companies such as [[Ma-Yi Theater Company]] (New York City) focus on producing new, original plays, as did the now-defunct [[Lodestone Theatre Ensemble]] (Los Angeles, 1999-2009). Others companies' agendas departed greatly from the original four: National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO) in New York City, for instance, stages canonized Western plays with all Asian cast and [[Mu Performing Arts]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] incorporates Asian theatrical styles to specifically cater to local audiences.

== Asian-American actors ==
American theatre in the 1950s was dominated by popular [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows that featured Asian characters and settings, and shows such as ''[[The King and I]]'' and ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' provided employment to a number of "[[Oriental people|Oriental]]" actors.  However, many roles were blatantly stereotypical and racist and many major roles were cast with white actors with facial makeup resembling an "Oriental".  The popularity of Asian themes in Broadway shows did not continue through the 1960s, and "Oriental" actors found themselves unemployed in large numbers.  While they were out of work, they observed white actors getting cast in Asian roles.  "Oriental" actors began to protest this practice by creating activist organizations and creating work for themselves.  The term "Asian-American actor" emerged in the late 1960s when the '''[[Asian American movement]]''' challenged the racist history of the label "Oriental."  By the 1970s, Asian-American actors were well organized in their fight for jobs and positive images for Asians.  In New York, an activist group called Oriental Actors of America regularly protested openings of shows with white actors playing Asians.  In Los Angeles, [[East West Players]] became the most visible venue for Asian-American actors to find acting employment and to participate in activism.  The company's proximity to [[Hollywood]] attracted many ambitious and talented Asian-American actors to Los Angeles.  By the mid-1990s, over 75% of all Asian-American actors had acted on the stage of EWP.

In the early 1990s, the controversy over the musical ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' surfaced when Asian-American actors protested the casting of the British actor [[Jonathan Pryce]] for the role of the half-[[Vietnam]]ese Engineer in the Broadway production of the musical.  The protest was led by many prominent Asian-American theatre artists, including actor [[BD Wong]], the artistic director of Pan Asian Rep, Tisa Chang, and the playwright [[David Henry Hwang]].  Asian-American actors initially lost their fight when the musical opened on Broadway with Pryce, but in the long run, the controversy generated many positive aftereffects for Asian-American actors.  The musical's ten-year run on Broadway employed an unprecedented number of Asian-American actors, and the role of the Engineer was subsequently cast with Asian-American actors.

Asian Americans have won the fight for employment, and while some roles for them stereotype those of Asian descent, Asian Americans are increasingly winning roles that respect and tolerate Asian Americans from the majority of producers who are realizing the reality of [[racial bigotry]] and ignorance that brings hostility and degradation to those oppressed.

== Asian-American playwrights ==
Before the 1960s, Asian-American plays were virtually non-existent, but various initiatives, including East West Players' playwriting contest, encouraged Asian-American writers to adapt their [[short story|short stories]] and [[novel]]s into plays and to write original plays.  The first wave of Asian-American playwrights included [[Wakako Yamauchi]], Momoko Iko, Edward Sakamoto, [[Hiroshi Kashiwagi]], and [[Frank Chin]].  Common themes in plays by first wave writers were Asian-American history, [[generation conflict|generational conflict]], [[cultural identity]], [[cultural nationalism]], and [[family history]].  In 1972, Frank Chin's ''[[The Chickencoop Chinaman]]'' became the first Asian-American play to be produced in New York City, and since then, Chin has become a major [[spokesperson]] for Asian-American playwriting.  He founded the [[Asian American Theatre Workshop]] in San Francisco to promote original playwriting by Asian Americans.  The most commercially successful Asian-American play was [[David Henry Hwang]]'s play ''[[M. Butterfly]]'', which became the first Asian-American play to be produced on Broadway and won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]] in 1988.  The success of ''M. Butterfly'' created a national interest in Asian-American plays, and regional theatre companies around the country began to produce plays by Hwang and other second wave Asian-American writers such as [[Philip Kan Gotanda]] and [[Velina Hasu Houston]].  Such interest also promoted the publication of first anthologies of Asian-American plays in the early 1990s.  The mainstreaming of Asian-American plays increased with works by third wave writers such as Diana Son, Sung Rno, [[Han Ong]], [[Chay Yew]], [[Rick Shiomi]], and [[Ralph Peña]].  These third wave writers felt that race and ethnicity were mere jumping off point in addressing multifaceted experiences of being an Asian American and wrote about any topic that interested them.  All three waves of Asian American playwrights continue to produce works that define not only Asian-American theatre, but also American theatre and global theatre.

== Alternative theatre and performance ==
One of the pioneers of Asian-American [[Experimental theatre|alternative theatre]] is [[Ping Chong]], a [[Chinese American]] [[multimedia artist]] who has created [[Experimental theatre|avant-garde theatre]] since the early 1970s.  He has used visual effects, sound control, dance, [[Mime artist|mime]], spectacle, and other methods based on the sensibilities of [[Cantonese opera]].  Another form of alternative theatre is [[One man show|solo performance]].  Often written, directed, and acted by one performer, solo performance has provided many Asian-American artists with the opportunity to voice their experiences.  Solo performers, such as [[Dan Kwong]], [[Denise Uyehara]], Jude Narita, and [[Lane Nishikawa]], have toured with their shows and have introduced Asian-American theatre to audiences in all parts of the country.  Group performances have also toured, especially to colleges and universities.  Often comedic, group performances, such as Slant Performance Group and the '''18 Mighty Mountain Warriors''', have been popular amongst college students, many of whom saw Asian-American performers onstage for the first time.  Recently, [[spoken word]] groups have become the newest form of Asian-American theatre and performance.

== Asian-American Theatre Conference and Festival ==
In June 2006, ''Next Big Bang:'' The First Asian-American Theatre Conference was held in Los Angeles, spearheaded by East West Players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/quill_naatf_review_2007.asp Festival a Milestone for Asian American Theater&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219132559/http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/quill_naatf_review_2007.asp |date=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in June 2007 with the first ever National Asian American Theatre Festival, held in New York City. The two-week festival was co-organized by Pan Asian Rep, Ma-Yi Theater and NAATCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/106432.html Playbill News: National Asian American Theater Festival Planned&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013215214/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/106432.html |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From June 11 – June 24, work from more than 35 emerging and established artists and groups from across the nation was presented in over 13 venues around New York City's boroughs.
''Shaping Our Voice &amp; Vision'': the 2nd National Asian American Theater Conference took place  June 5–7, 2008, in [[Minneapolis]], co-hosted by Mu Performing Arts and '''Pangea World Theater'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapress.com/artsnews.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1199410728&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=6&amp; Mu Receives Festival Grant on AA Press] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408223416/http://www.aapress.com/artsnews.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1199410728&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=6&amp; |date=April 8, 2008 }} December 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blue Bell''' is at 63–65 Northgate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376358|desc= Number 63 and 65 street the Blue Bell, Chester|access-date= 8 April 2012 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally it consisted of two [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] houses which were joined together in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  The pavement runs through the ground floor storey of the northern part of the building, leaving a separate cabin or chamber between the pavement and the road. 

==History==
The building dates from the mid- to late 15th&amp;nbsp;century,&lt;ref name=images/&gt; and is said to be the oldest surviving intact [[Middle Ages|medieval]] house in Chester.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morris| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = |  year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton|  page = 92| isbn = 0-7509-0255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally two houses, which were joined in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  It formed part of Lorimer's Row, a group of buildings with an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] at ground level, as distinct from the [[Chester Rows|Rows]] in the centre of the city whose walkways are at the first floor level.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  From an early date, the south part of the building has been an [[Public_house#Inns|inn]], its first [[licence]] possibly dating from 1494. The separate cabin or chamber has been used for a number of functions; these include being a ticket office for [[Stagecoach|stage coach]] operators in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century and in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century a [[soda fountain]] bar and a [[barber]]'s shop.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century the southern part of the building was an inn while the northern part housed a shop.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  The inn closed in the 1930s.  In 1948 the building was used as an [[antique]] shop but its condition deteriorated so much that it was threatened with demolition.  In the 1950s the Chester Civic Trust campaigned for its survival, it was restored, and has since been used as a clothes shop and, more recently, as a restaurant.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=36| title = Blue Bell Inn| accessdate = 15 August 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The building is [[timber-framed]] on a [[sandstone]] [[plinth]] with brickwork added later which has subsequently been [[Stucco|rendered]] and painted.  The roofs are of grey [[slate]]s.  The two buildings comprising the whole have separate frames each with roofs leading to [[gable]]s over the street.  At ground level the southern part of the building has an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] open to the street with a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] to the south and an octagonal [[column]] south of the centre.  The northern part has a separate cabin or chamber adjacent to the street with the walkway between its rear and the rest of the building. On the street side of the chamber is a three-pane [[Cant (architecture)|canted]] [[oriel window]] and a door.  On the upper floor each part of the building has a horizontal window with a small one-paned window between them.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''{{lang|it|Cantastoria}}''' ({{IPA-it|ˌkantaˈstɔːrja|pron}}; also spelled '''{{lang|it|cantastorie}}''' {{IPA-it|ˌkantaˈstɔːrje|}}, '''{{lang|it|canta storia}}''' or '''{{lang|it|canta historia}}''') comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] for "story-singer" and is known by many other names around the world. It is a [[theatrical]] form where a performer tells or sings a story while gesturing to a series of images. These images can be painted, printed or drawn on any sort of material.

==Picture stories in Asia==
[[File:Wayang Beber Opened.jpg|thumb|400px|right|{{lang|id|[[Wayang beber]]}}, a Javanese {{lang|it|cantastoria}} art thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in the 1960s.]]

In 6th-century [[India]], religious tales called {{lang|sa-Latn|saubhika}}s were performed by traveling storytellers who carried banners painted with images of gods from house to house. Another form called {{lang|sa-Latn|yamapapaka}} featured vertical cloth scrolls accompanied by sung stories of the afterlife. Nowadays, this Indian traditional art is still performed by [[Chitrakar]] women of [[West Bengal]]. In [[Tibet]] this was known as {{lang|bo-Latn|ma-ni-pa}} and in [[China]] this was known as {{lang|zh-Latn|pien}}. In [[Indonesia]] the scroll was made horizontal and became the ''{{lang|ms|[[wayang]] beber}}'' and employed four performers: a man who sings the story, two men who operate the rolling of the scroll, and a woman who holds a lamp to illuminate particular pictures featured in the story. Other Indonesian theater forms such as ''{{lang|id|[[wayang]] kulit}}'', a [[shadow play]], and ''{{lang|id|[[wayang]] golek}}'', rod [[puppet]]ry, developed around the same time and are still performed today.

In [[Japan]], {{lang|it|cantastoria}} appears as {{lang|ja-Latn|[[etoki]]}} ({{lang|ja|絵解}}) or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[emaki]]}} ({{lang|ja|絵巻}}) in the form of hanging scrolls divided into separate panels, foreshadowing the immensely popular [[manga]], or Japanese [[comics]]. {{lang|ja-Latn|Etoki}} sometimes took the shape of little booklets, or even displays of [[doll]]s posed on the roadside with backgrounds behind them. In the 20th century, Japanese candymen would bicycle around with serial shows called {{lang|ja-Latn|[[kamishibai]]}} ({{lang|ja|紙芝居}}) where the story was told to a series of changing pictures that slid in and out of an open-framed box. Some {{lang|ja-Latn|kamishibai}} shows had a [[peep show]] element to them, where a viewer could pay extra to peer through a hole and see a supposed [[cultural artifact|artifact]] from the story.

==Picture stories in Europe and the Middle East==
{{Redirect|Moritat|the comic creator|Moritat (comics)|the popular song|Mack the Knife}}
[[Image:Moritatenerzähler.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a Dutch ''{{lang|nl|liedjeszanger}}'' ("song-singer") and his ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' from the 17th or 18th century]]

In 16th-century [[Italy]], prayers would often be sung in the presence of illuminated scrolls while secular society produced the ''{{lang|it|cantambanco}}'' or "singing bench" where a person would stand on a bench point to pictures with a stick.

In [[Spain]] up to the 19th century there were blind men with a young "helper" who would make a living by going from town to town where they would display illustrations and the blind man would recite/sing the story, often about truculent crimes, while his helper pointed at the illustration relevant at that point. These were called "[[:es:Romances de ciego|romances de ciego]]" (blind man stories).

The singing bench migrated northward to Central and Northern Europe where it served as sensationalist quasi-news about murder, fires, death, affairs, sex scandals and the like. Performers of such controversial bench songs were seen as vagrants and troublemakers and were often arrested, exiled, or ostracised for their activities.

In [[Persia]], {{lang|fa-Latn|parda-dari}} (compare India's {{lang|hi-Latn|paradari}}) banner artists had the foresight to paint a handsome police officer in the corner as a fail-safe against the wrath of police harassment—the narrator would be relating the tale of a hero's exploits and when a cop would appear in the crowd the narrator would point to the cop on the banner and shower the character with flattery in the context of the story.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In [[Czechoslovakia]] banner shows were called ''{{lang|cs|kramářská píseň}}''. Most of them fell into an oblivion, with the notable exception of a parody song ''[[Cannoneer Jabůrek|Cannoneer {{lang|cs|Jabůrek|nocat=y}}]]''.

In [[Hungary]] the term is ''{{lang|hu|képmutogatás}}''.

In [[Germany]] [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] [[ballad]]eers performed ''{{lang|de|Moritat}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' (bench song) banner shows for four centuries until the [[Nazi]]s banned the practice in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The German ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' survives in {{lang|de|[[Bertolt Brecht]]}}'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' ({{lang-de|Die Dreigroschenoper}}) and in the performance work of {{lang|de|[[Peter Schumann]]}}.

==Picture stories elsewhere in the world==

In [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] [[Australia]] storytellers paint story sequences on tree bark and also on themselves for the purposes of performing the tale.

In the 19th century, giant scrolling [[moving panorama]] performances were performed throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]]. The 20th century has seen cantastoria employed by the radical art, theater and puppetry movements to tell stories from perspectives outside of the mainstream media, especially by the [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]. Elements of picture storytelling can also be seen in the portable [[mural]]-[[posters]] of the [[Beehive Collective]].

'''[[Chess]] [[aesthetics]]''' or beauty in chess is generally appreciated by both players and composers. This is evident, for example, in {{chessgloss|brilliancy prizes}}&lt;ref&gt;Damsky, I. (2002). Chess Brilliancy. Everyman Publishers, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avni, A. (1998). Creative Chess, Expanded Edition. Everyman Publishers, London, England. {{ISBN|978-1-85744-149-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, A. (1925). Красота в шахматной игре, Beauty at the Chess Game, (in Russian), Leningrad, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; awarded to some games in certain [[Chess tournament|tournaments]] and also in the world of [[chess composition]]. There are many books published featuring chess problems or puzzles that emphasize its aesthetic aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, J. and Friedgood D. (2008). Secrets of Spectacular Chess, 2nd Edition (Expanded), 1 May, Everyman Chess, London, England. {{ISBN|978-1-85744-551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, K. (1967). The Enjoyment of Chess Problems. Dover Publications, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, M., Matthews, R. C. O. and Rice, J. (1965).Chess Problems: Introduction to an Art, Citadel Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest is from the 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Adli, Book of Chess (in Arabic), as referenced in Nowakowski, R. J. (1998). Games of No Chance. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics in chess can be both a source of pleasure for humans and also instruction, as compositions or games featuring it typically illustrate original ideas or new instantiations of old ones. A good chess problem composer, however, is not necessarily a good player.

Factors about a game or move sequence (also referred to as a ''[[Combination (chess)|combination]]'') that might cause it to be regarded as 'brilliant' by most players include, among other things: expediency, disguise, sacrifice, correctness, preparation, paradox, unity and originality.

* ''Expediency'' refers to a move's effectiveness in achieving something tangible, like checkmate or a decisive {{chessgloss|material}} gain.
* ''Disguise'' occurs when a move played (usually the {{chessprobgloss|key}} move) does not expose the solution immediately.
* ''Sacrifice'' refers to the exchange of a more powerful piece for a weaker one, but can also mean the exchange of other less tangible advantages, like {{chessgloss|mobility}}.
* ''Correctness'' simply means the solution should work against any defense. (A plus but not always possible in real games.)
* ''Preparation'' means that the aesthetic perceived—say, in a particular tactical combination—was achieved in great part due to the strategic play preceding it.&lt;ref&gt;Sukhin, I. (2007). Chess Gems: 1000 Combinations You Should Know, Mongoose Press, Massachusetts, USA. {{ISBN|978-0-9791482-5-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Paradox'' refers to the range of things that violate 'good practice' in chess, for example, the deliberate exposure of one's king.
* ''Unity'' refers to the cooperation between pieces toward the attainment of a specific goal (e.g. [[checkmate]], winning material, controlling more {{chessgloss|space}}).
* ''Originality'' means something the observer has not seen before, and must therefore rely heavily on personal experience.

[[Chess_problem#Beauty_in_chess_problems|Composition conventions]] such as not having any [[Check (chess)|checks]] or {{chessgloss|captures}} in the first (i.e. key) move, and the use of variations to illustrate a particular theme (e.g. [[zugzwang]], [[Pin (chess)|pin]]), also play a role in the aesthetics of the game.

Conceptually, a 'common ground' of aesthetics between the domains of real (e.g. tournament) games and compositions can be established. These are beauty characteristics that apply approximately equally to both domains; examples include [[heuristic]] violations, economy and material sacrifice. This common ground is useful in computational models of aesthetics in the game because it helps in experiments comparing the beauty of compositions (on average, considered more beautiful) against the beauty of real games (on average, considered less beautiful).&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, M. A. M. (2008). A Discrete Computational Aesthetics Model for a Zero-Sum Perfect Information Game, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230855649_A_Discrete_Computational_Aesthetics_Model_for_A_Zero-Sum_Perfect_Information_Game PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Some factors that pertain solely to real games (e.g. pressure under [[Chess#Time_control|time control]]) or compositions (e.g. avoidance of [[castling]] moves) may be conflated with ''aesthetics'' in the game—and perhaps to some degree this is justifiable;&lt;ref&gt;Humble, P.N. (1995). The Aesthetics of Chess: A Reply to Ravilious. British Journal of Aesthetics, vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 390–94.&lt;/ref&gt; however, they would lie outside the common ground described above.

[[File:Hanging Church.jpg|thumb|[[Pulpit]] and section of [[iconostasis]] inside [[The Hanging Church]] in Cairo]]
[[File:StMarkCathAlex.jpg|thumb|right|St. Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria]]
'''Coptic architecture''' is the [[architecture]] of the [[Copt]]s, who form the majority of [[Christianity in Egypt|Christians]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/History/Coptic/080500000000000001.htm Egypt state info]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coptic churches range from great [[cathedral]]s such as [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] to the smallest churches in rural villages. Many ancient monasteries like [[Monastery of Saint Anthony]] also exist. Ancient churches like the [[Hanging Church]] in [[Coptic Cairo]] carry important historical value to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the Copts in general.

==Origin and influence==
[[File:Kairo Hanging Church BW 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Hanging Church is Cairo's most famous [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] church first built in the 3rd or 4th century]]
{{copts}} 
Some authorities trace the origins of Coptic architecture to [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]], seeing a similarity between the plan of ancient [[Egyptian temples]], progressing from an outer courtyard to a hidden inner [[sanctuary]] to that of Coptic churches, with an outer [[narthex]] or porch, and (in later buildings) a sanctuary hidden behind an [[iconostasis]]. Others see the earliest Coptic churches as progressing, like those of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] churches, from the Graeco-Roman [[basilica]]. The ruins of the [[cathedral]] at [[Hermopolis Magna]] (c.430–40) are the major survival of the single brief period when the Coptic Orthodox Church represented the official religion of the state in Egypt.

Thus, from its early beginnings Coptic architecture fused indigenous Egyptian building traditions and materials with Graeco-Roman and Christian Byzantine styles. The fertile styles of neighbouring Christian [[Syria]] had a greatly increased influence after the 6th century, including the use of stone [[tympanum (architecture)|tympani]].&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'', p. 120, Lund Humphries, London, 1985, {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period of two thousand years, Coptic architecture incorporated native [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Graeco-Roman]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and Western European styles.

After the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the influence of Coptic art and architecture on Egyptian Islamic architecture and the incorporation of some Coptic features in Islamic building in Egypt can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0018814.html Tiscali]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained by the fact that the early Muslim rulers of Egypt, much like the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and Byzantine rulers before them, recruited native [[Egyptians]] to undertake the building labor. In later centuries, Coptic art and architecture also incorporated motifs inspired by Islamic styles.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, very early examples of the pointed arch appear in Coptic churches from the 4th century onwards, and this became a notable feature of [[Islamic architecture]], and may have spread from there to European [[Gothic architecture]], though this whole area remains controversial among architectural historians, with many now seeing the origins among the [[Assyria]]ns, from whom it spread to [[Persia]], where it joined the Islamic style.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Arch (pointed)", in ''A Concise Dictionary of Architecture''; Frederic Hicks Jones; 1991; Thomson Crisp Learning, {{ISBN|1-56052-066-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] broke from the other [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es in 451 AD. After that date, the Copts, then a great majority of the Egyptian population, were shunned and often persecuted by their Byzantine rulers until the conquest of Egypt by Islam, after which the slowly declining Coptic population was in a rather precarious position. Coptic architecture therefore lacked the lavish patronage of rulers and the Court, which was directly responsible for most of the important buildings of Byzantine and medieval Catholic architecture. Most buildings are small, conservative in design, and remain closer to vernacular styles. They also have a tendency to massive construction, which is partly a surviving Egyptian taste from the Pharaonic period, partly reflects the need to semi-fortify buildings, partly is an inevitable result of [[mudbrick]] construction of large structures, and is also partly to keep them cool in the Egyptian climate.

Well before the break of 451, Egyptian Christianity had pioneered [[monasticism]], with many  communities being established in deliberately remote positions, especially in Southern Egypt. The relatively large number of buildings surviving from the early periods of monasticism, from about the 5th century onwards, are one of the most important groups of early Christian buildings to remain, and offer a useful corrective to the Court art of [[Ravenna]] or [[Constantinople]]. Many very early wall-paintings also survive. Even the ruins of monasteries in many places have survived in a good enough condition to impress the visitor and inform the art historian. Early Coptic architecture is therefore of great importance in the study of Early Christian architecture in general.
[[File:Assouan cathedrale copte.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in [[Aswan]]]]

Despite the break with the other churches, aspects of the development of the arrangement of Coptic churches have paralleled those in Orthodoxy, such as the emergence of a solid [[iconostasis]] to separate the [[sanctuary]], and the West, such as the movement over the centuries of the place of baptism from the [[narthex]] or outer porch into the rear of the nave. However the existence of three altars in the sanctuary, sometimes in separate [[apse]]s, is typically and distinctively Coptic. The altars themselves are always free-standing.

Especially between the Muslim conquest and the 19th century, the external facade of Coptic urban churches is usually plain and discreet, as is the roof-line. Equally the monasteries were often enclosed with high blank walls to defend them from desert raiders during the Middle Ages. However, internally the churches can be ornately decorated, although monumental sculpture of holy figures is avoided as in Orthodoxy.
 
Many Coptic monasteries and churches scattered throughout Egypt are built of [[mudbrick]] on the basilica plan inherited from Graeco-Roman architectural styles. They usually have heavy walls and columns, [[architrave]]s and barrel-vaulted roofs, and end in a tripartite [[apse]], but many variant plans exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/churchtypology.htm|title=Typology of Ancient Egyptian Christian Churches|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domes are small compared to Byzantine churches, and from the 10th-century naves are often roofed with domed [[cupola]]s. The dome raised on a circular supporting wall, which is so characteristic of later [[Byzantine architecture]], is rarely used. Massive timber is often used across the nave, sometimes to support a flat roof, and sometimes to give structural strength to the walls. Inside the churches are richly decorated with [[fresco]]ed murals and reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575254/Coptic_Art_and_Architecture.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRLzdm8?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575254/Coptic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconostasis==
[[File:17112007051.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Example of modern Coptic Iconostasis of at [[St Mary and St Mercurius Coptic Orthodox Church]] in [[Wales]]]]
The screen known as the [[iconostasis]] separating the sanctuary from the main body of the church is one of the main features of any Coptic church. The Coptic iconostasis is usually less completely composed of [[icon]]s than the Eastern Orthodox one, although there will always be several. It is very often an open-work screen, usually made of [[ebony]] and sometimes inlaid with ivory like that in [[Saint Mary Church (Harat Zewila)]].  These may be in geometrical patterns comparable to the secular screens which are a feature of traditional Egyptian houses.

The [[iconostasis]] of Saint Mary Church in Harat Zewila in [[Old Cairo]], rebuilt after 1321, shows the mixture of stylistic elements in Coptic architecture. The basic plan is that of the [[basilica]], and recycled ancient columns are used. The older woodwork is Islamic in style, as are the [[Muqarnas]] in the [[pendentive]]s, and a Gothic revival [[rood]] cross surmounts the iconostasis. This uses Islamic abstract motifs, which is also common. Some screens are pierced rather than solid.

There are many examples of Coptic iconostasis that predate the earliest surviving Eastern and Western counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUl6v71PXVoC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=coptic+iconostasis&amp;source=web&amp;ots=2XbjWhbwMx&amp;sig=cVpPHYsRvMH_iNx5xBGemEPPSw4|title=The Ancient Coptic Churches Of Egypt|last=Butler|first=Alfred J.|date=2004|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=9780766190078|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khurus or Choir==
Between the 7th and 12th centuries, many churches were built or modified with a distinctive Coptic feature, the ''khurus'', a space running across the whole width of the church separating the ''naos'' or [[nave]] from the sanctuary, rather as the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] does in [[Gothic architecture]].
[[File:Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, built in the Coptic style 2006-10-EGYPT-ASWAN.jpg|thumb|right|240x120px|Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Aswan]]

==Decorative carving==
Early Coptic buildings contain elaborate and vigorous decorative carving on the capitals of columns, or friezes, some of which include [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]], confronted animals, and other motifs.  These are also related to Coptic [[illuminated manuscript]]s and fabrics, and are often regarded as significant influences both on early Islamic art, like the [[Mshatta facade]] and on the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles (which appears to have been in contact with Coptic monasteries).&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Honour and John Fleming, A World History of Art, 1982, Macmillan, London, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; From Insular art these motifs developed into European [[Romanesque art]].&lt;ref&gt;Atroshenko and Collins, op cit, p. 120-139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The architecture of many Coptic buildings remains poorly documented, as they become more at risk for abandonment, vandalism, and destruction. Time sensitive architectural and cultural research projects are awaiting initiation.

Examples of significant Coptic architecture include:
*Cathedral ruins at [[Hermopolis Magna]], built c. 430—440, in the [[Minya Governorate]] ([[Lower Egypt]]).
*The [[White Monastery]] and [[Red Monastery]], near [[Souhag]] in the [[Sohag Governorate]] ([[Middle Egypt]]), with buildings from the 5th century and onwards.
*The "[[Coptic Cairo|Coptic Cairo District]]" of [[Old Cairo]] (Lower Egypt), with numerous churches from the 7th century and onwards, including "[[The Hanging Church]]" and [[Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum)|Saint Mary Church (''Haret Elroum'')]].
*The [[Deir el-Muharraq|Deir el-Muharraq monastery complex]] (the Burned Monastery), near [[El-Qusiya]] in the [[Asyut Governorate]] ([[Upper Egypt]]). Established in the 4th century, with a 6th-7th century fortress, and churches from the 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th centuries.

==Modern Coptic architecture==
[[File:Monastry3.jpg|thumb|250px|left| Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Aswan. Egypt.]]
[[File:Kroeffelbach Koptisches Kloster.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The Monastery of St. Anthony in [[Germany]].]]
European architectural styles began to influence Coptic churches in the eighteenth century. Examples of modern Coptic churches that have features of European churches are St. Mary (El Marashly) Church in [[Zamalek]], [[Cairo]] designed by famous Coptic architect [[Ramses Wissa Wassef]], other examples of modern Coptic architecture are the [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo]] consecrated in 1968 and [[Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral Aswan]] consecrated in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/eng_keraza/engkeraza31-03-2006.pdf Elkeraza English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305153931/http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/eng_keraza/engkeraza31-03-2006.pdf |date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coptic churches maintained the tradition of being built in the same shapes as older churches yet it is noticeable that modern Coptic churches are in general bigger than older ones.

The mark for the beginning of the revival of Coptic architecture was in the late eighteenth century by the building of the [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Azbakeya)|Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] in Azbakeya, Cairo, that became the seat of the Coptic Pope in 1800 A D.

Regulations preventing building new churches, which were put by the [[Ottomans]], were eased in the following years by the rulers of Egypt; allowing many churches to be rebuilt and new churches were also permitted after more than three hundred years of prevention.

Many of the rebuilt churches carried the old features of the Coptic architecture with the addition of modern features.

[[File:Hugo van der Goes Death of the Virgin.jpg|thumb|340px|''The Death of the Virgin'', c 1472–80. 147.8cm x 122.5cm. [[Groeningemuseum]], [[Bruges]].]]
'''''The Death of the Virgin''''' is an oil on oak panel by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Flemish]] painter [[Hugo van der Goes]]. Completed c 1472–80, it shows the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] on her deathbed surrounded by the [[Twelve Apostles]]. The scene is borrowed from [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s thirteenth-century "Legenda aurea"&lt;ref&gt;The Legenda aurea were translated to Dutch around that time as "Passionael" or "die gulden Legende"&lt;/ref&gt; which relates how the apostles were brought, at Mary's request, on clouds by angels to a house near [[Mount Zion]] to be with her in her final three days.&lt;ref name="C250"&gt;Campbell, 250&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day Jesus appeared above her bed in a halo of light surrounded by angels to accept her soul at the point when his name was finally mentioned.&lt;ref name="Rm"&gt;"[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/catalogue/sk-a-3467.html The death of the Virgin]". [[Rijksmuseum]]. Retrieved 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later he reappeared to accept her body.

==History and description==
''Death of the Virgin'' was almost certainly painted on commission and along with his ''[[:File:Hugo van der goes monforte altarpiece detail 01.jpg|Monforte]]'' and ''[[Portinari Altarpiece|Portinari]]'' altarpieces is one of van der Goes most important works. It is likely one of his last paintings finished before he died. According to art historian [[Till-Holger Borchert]], the panel "belongs to the most impressive and artistically mature achievements of [[Early Netherlandish painting]]".&lt;ref name="TH161"/&gt; According to [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]], the painting is van der Goes' "most idiosyncratic masterpiece".&lt;ref name="C252"&gt;Campbell, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary is shown lying in a blue robe with a white headdress on a timber bed with her head resting on a white pillow against a headboard. Her skin is thin and pallid, her hands clasped in prayer. She is surrounded by the twelve apostles who crowd around her bed. Peter is dressed in the white robes of a priest and holds a candle which in the then contemporary ritual will be handed to the dying woman. Above her Christ appears in a halo of light, holding his arms open to receive Mary's soul,&lt;ref&gt;In some earlier depictions her soul is represented as a small child&lt;/ref&gt; while his palms are open to display the [[Holy Wounds|wounds]] sustained at [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Calvary]]. With this gesture, Christ identifies himself as both [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redeemer]] and conqueror of death.&lt;ref name="TH161"&gt;Borcher, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Death'' marks a break in van der Goes style; line has become more important, setting is eliminated and the image lacks depth and is tightly contracted with only the bed, door and the body of the Virgin giving spatial indicators.&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;Koslow, Susan. "[http://profkoslow.com/publications/DeathoftheVirgin.html The Impact of the Modern Devotion on Hugo van der Goes's Death of the Virgin]". College of Art Association of America, Washington D.C., 1978. Retrieved 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is renowned for not showing the apostles either in the traditional idealised manner nor as conventional figure types, but instead representing each as a unique individual, displaying their grief through a range of expressions and gestures, from sorrow and despair, to empathy and compassion. Because the artist has not used traditional representation it is difficult to identify each apostle.&lt;ref&gt;Borcher, 161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Het sterfbed van Maria Rijksmuseum SK-A-3467.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|c 1500 copy of the Berlin work attributed to the [[Master of the Amsterdam Death of the Virgin]], a follower of van der Goes. [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam.]]
The work is the best known and famous of one of a number of paintings after the death of Mary attributed to van der Goes or followers. Some art historians, including Friedrich Winkler (1964), believe he painted at least three versions, although it is generally accepted that preparatory sketches made for the Bruges work were later copied reproduced as paintings by late 15th century followers. Two similar paintings in the [[Berlin State Museums]], the [[National Gallery]], London, are attributed as "after van der Goes". They are usually thought to be later versions of a pen on paper drawing in the [[Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum]], [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], probably a copy of an original preparatory sketch by van der Goes.&lt;ref name="C250"/&gt; These works are similar to the Bruges paintings, but show the image in reverse.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The London painting is likely in turn a copy again of the Berlin work. See Campbell, 250&lt;/ref&gt; Infra-red photography shows that the composition was planned a highly detailed manner before the underdrawing was applied. Art historian Lorne Campbell writes, "it is possible that the Brunswick drawing reflects one of his earliest ideas for the Bruges painting and that the Berlin, Prague and London pictures echo, however distantly, a later stage in his development of the Bruges composition.&lt;ref name="C251"&gt;Campbell, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin Schongauer The Death of the Virgin.jpg|210px|thumb|[[Martin Schongauer]], ''The Death of the Virgin'', engraving, early 1470s.]]
The painting has been the subject of intense debate as to its date and meaning. Van der Goes spent the final years of his life submerged in depression. A number of art historians, including [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max Friedländer]], view the work as painted c. 1480 when the artist first began to display signs of mental suffering and thus view it as an expression of his illness. The artist's late life—he died in either 1482 or 1483—susceptibility to depression and insanity was discovered in 1863 in a chronicle by his contemporary Gaspar Ofhuys, who recorded a night in 1480 when van der Goes began to excitedly talk about how he was a doomed, lost soul and attempted to commit suicide and had to be forcibly held down.

This account greatly added to the painting's value in the eyes of late-19th-century painters. [[Vincent van Gogh]] mentions van der Goes three times in his letters, first in 1873 to his brother Theo, and on two more occasions when he wrote that he identified with the portrait of van der Goes in [[Emile Wauters]]'s emotionally rendered 1872 painting ''Hugo van der Goes Undergoing Treatment at the Red Cloister''.&lt;ref name="SK"/&gt; Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] described van der Goes as "the first artist to live up to a concept unknown to the Middle Ages but cherished by the European mind ever after, the concept of a genius both blessed and cursed with his diversity from ordinary human beings." Panofsky goes on to describe how the work's flatness represents an "irrationality of space, light, colour, [the] expression of the artist's mental illness".&lt;ref name ="R124"&gt;Ridderbos, Bernhard. "Early Netherlandish paintings: rediscovery, reception and research". Los Angeles: Getty Publishing, 2005. 124. {{ISBN|0-89236-816-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other art historians, including Dirk de Vos and Susan Koslow, reject this thesis and argue that a wholly individualised conception of the scene would not have been acceptable to the painting's commissioners. In their view the pared down and contracted manner of the work is due to a desire to "stress the solemnity of the event and its miraculous nature, van der Goes may have decided that material richness would be distracting and indecorous."&lt;ref name ="R124"/&gt;

Van der Goes was a highly progressive and original artist, but at the same time heavily influenced by both contemporary and predecessor artists. Inspiration for this work can be detected in [[Petrus Christus]]' c 1457–67 ''Death of the Virgin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Petrus_Christus_Death_of_the_Virgin.jpg|title=English: Death of the Virgin|first=Petrus|last=Christus|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C252" /&gt; and by works attributed to the workshop of [[Rogier van der Weyden]].&lt;ref name="B162"&gt;Borcher, 162&lt;/ref&gt; The painting bears striking similarity to [[Martin Schongauer]]'s c 1470–75 engraving of the same name, especially in its overall tone and mood, the depiction of Mary and the representation of the apostles seated to Mary's left. Yet there are significant differences; the bed in Schongauer's engraving is canopied and the distribution of the apostles is very different in the two works. The Schongauer is dated to at latest 1475, and it is a matter of significant and at times harsh and divisive critical debate as to which work came first (see above).&lt;ref name="B162"/&gt;

'''''Decemviri Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala dei Decemviri'') is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed in 1495-1496, and housed in the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]] in [[Vatican City]].

The work was commissioned by the Decemviri ("Ten Men") of [[Perugia]] for the chapel in the [[Palazzo dei Priori]], and was executed 1495 to 1496. It was originally surmounted by a ''Pietà'' (87 x 90&amp;nbsp;cm), now at the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]].

==Description==
The work portrays the Virgin on a high throne, with decorations and reliefs. Behind her is a bright landscape with hills. She holds the child in a position identical to that in the ''[[Fano Altarpiece]]''. At her sides are Saint Lawrence, Louis of Toulouse, [[Herculanus of Perugia|Herculanus]] and [[Constantius of Perugia]].

The portico theme was typical of Perugino's late 15th century works, such as the ''[[Albani Torlonia Polyptych]]'' and the ''[[Pietà (Perugino)|Pietà]]''.

'''Desilo''' is a small valley in southern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], located near the [[Neretva]] river and the [[Croatia]]n border. Archaeological investigations in a small lake there in 2007 led to interesting finds of [[Illyria]]n boats. Desilo was in antiquity probably connected with the Neretva via Lake [[Hutovo Blato]]. References to the Neretva can be traced as far back as ancient times. In the era of ancient Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Neretva was known as ''[[Narenta]]'', ''[[Narona]]'' and ''Naro(n)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-m-narona.hr/index-en.html Archeological Museum of Narona]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vid.hr/prijevodi/narona-engleski.htm The Ancient City of Narona] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422212228/http://www.vid.hr/prijevodi/narona-engleski.htm |date=2009-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neven Kazazovic, Tajne Neretve&lt;/ref&gt; and was home to the ancient [[Illyrian tribe]]s of the [[Ardiaei]]&lt;ref&gt;John Wilkes, "The Illyrians"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Daorsi]]. The river Neretva provided them life, turning them into town builders, ship makers, seafarers and fishermen that were renowned in ancient times.

==Neretva's hidden treasure==
{{tone|date=June 2011}}

In the spring of 2007, ''Professor'' Snjezana Vasilj ''PhD'' of the [[University of Mostar]] excavated 2 Illyrian boats in Desilo, covered with stone-blocks and fragments of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[wine]] [[amphorae]]. After intense [[excavations]] in the area of [[Hutovo Blato]] in the autumn of 2008, [[archaeologists]] from  [[University of Oslo]], [[Norway]] together with Dr. Vasilj found the very first traces of an Illyrian [[trading post]] from at least the 2nd-1st centuries BC.&lt;ref name="apollon.uio.no"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/2008_4/artikler/illyrer_english |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304033439/http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/2008_4/artikler/illyrer_english |archivedate=2009-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The find is unique in a [[Europe]]an perspective and the [[archaeologists]] have concluded that Desilo was an important [[trading post]] of great significance for contact between the [[Illyrians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].
Surprisingly large finds have been made in a short period of time. The archaeologists have discovered the [[ruins]] of a [[Human settlement|settlement]], the [[:wikt:remains|remains]] of a [[harbour]] that probably functioned as a [[trading post]], as well as many sunken [[boats]], covered with fragments of [[wine]] [[pitchers]] – so-called '''''[[amphorae]]''''' – from the 1st century B.C.&lt;ref name="Bosnian archaeologists discover fabled ships"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosnian archaeologists discover fabled ships |url=http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=588&amp;art_id=nw20070320140758925C772088 |publisher=[http://www.int.iol.co.za iol.co.za] |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The archaeologist Adam Lindhagen, who has a PhD from the [[University of Lund]] and has specialised in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[wine]] ''[[amphorae]]'', says that this is '''''the most important find of all time''''' from the Illyrian areas.&lt;ref name="The world’s first Illyrian trading post found"&gt;{{cite web |title=The world’s first Illyrian trading post found |url=http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/2008_4/artikler/illyrer_english |publisher=[http://www.apollon.uio.no Apollon - University of Oslo] |accessdate=2009-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304033439/http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/2008_4/artikler/illyrer_english |archivedate=2009-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unique Archaeological Discovery In Balkan: World’s First Illyrian Trading Post Found"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unique Archaeological Discovery In Balkan: World’s First Illyrian Trading Post Found |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081208092151.htm |publisher=[http://www.sciencedaily.com Science Daily] |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pirate theory===
The boat finds had been speedily interpreted as proof that the [[Illyrians]] were [[pirates]] and that the [[ships]] had been sunk by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Although the pirate theory received considerable attention from the press in many parts of [[Europe]], archaeologists Marina Prusac and Adam Lindhagen did not completely agree with this interpretation.
Although there certainly were pirate activities along the Adriatic coast, they thought it rather odd that the pirates were so far inland and so near the important [[Roman colony]] of [[Narona]]. In their opinion Desilo might have been a trading centre.
Desilo is located 32 kilometres from the coast on an [[alluvial plain]] by the [[Neretva]] river. The river is the only traffic artery along the entire [[Croatia]]n coast that runs into the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] mountains. It is broad and free-flowing for the first 30 kilometres or so, after which its course becomes narrow.
Near Desilo there are also ancient traffic arteries on land in the direction of both [[Narona]], which was first a Greek trading post and then a [[Roman colony]], and the [[List of ancient cities in Illyria|Illyrian settlement]] of '''''“[[Daorson]]”''''' – the present-day Ošanići.
Desilo is situated at the innermost point of a quiet bay where it was natural to transfer goods to smaller boats, so the place is perfect for an inner trading [[harbour]]. The presumed harbour represents a rare example of a meeting point in this impenetrable [[landscape]].

===The harbour===
Over the past two thousand years the river has repeatedly changed its bed in the delta. The archaeologists found the remains of the Illyrian [[trading post]] under several metres of mud and ooze. It appears that parts of the wall that stuck up from the mud by the water’s edge may have functioned as one of the many quays at the trading post. The wall is 20 metres long and 60 centimetres wide, and is built as a polygonal structure.
The wall was solid and stable. The other side was not so well constructed and most likely functioned as a dam. There were a number of mooring holes placed at the same height on the wall, almost like a horizontal band.
And as if this was not enough, the archaeologists from the [[University of Oslo]] also discovered that there were at least twice as many [[boats]] as those that had already been registered. The boats, which the Romans called '''''Lembi''''', were well known for their fast manoeuvrability.
The many pieces of [[pottery]] found indicate that this was a '''major''' [[trading post]]. And last but not least: about a hundred metres from the harbour site they found an Illyrian settlement. Moreover, in collaboration with the land-owner and along with master's degree student Jo-Simon Frøshaug Stokke, the recently graduated archaeologists Lene Os Johannessen and Ole Christian Aslaksen discovered terrace formations in the mountainside.
This find can only be interpreted as indicating the presence of a settlement that presumably existed for several hundred years or even longer before the trade between the Illyrians and the Romans started.
Some graves – older than the other finds – were previously discovered close to the settlement. A number of individual finds have also been made in the area: anchor parts, lance tips and fibula, and metal buckles for fastening clothes.
Thanks to the clay and the fresh water the objects are surprisingly well preserved. Salt water would have destroyed the wood.

===Wine and amphorae===
On the lake bed, together with the boats, archaeologists from [[University of Mostar]] found hundreds of pieces of [[wine]] [[amphorae]] of type Lamboglia 2 and as many as 700 lids from these vessels.
As archaeologist Adam Lindhagen, who has a PhD from the [[University of Lund]] and has specialised in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] wine [[amphorae]] points out, imports from the Roman colony [[Narona]] must therefore have been far more extensive than we previously thought.
He has analyzed the [[pottery]] to find out where the [[amphorae]] came from. He can now say that they were exclusively produced along the [[Dalmatia]]n coast – from where wine was exported to the entire [[Roman Empire]].
In exchange for wine the Romans may have bought salt, metal, leather and slaves. The price could have been similar to that in Gaul. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]] (100-44 B.C.), the [[Gauls]] were happy to swap a slave for a 25-litre amphora of wine.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. 5. 26. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
While Professor Vasilj was of the view that all the boats were sunk at the same time in a Roman campaign against Illyrian pirates, amphorae which are later in date than those from the boatwrecks have also been found in the lake, something which might contradict such an assumption.&lt;ref name="apollon.uio.no"/&gt;

===Ritual or war===
One big question remains unsolved, and that is why none of the [[amphorae]] are whole. They are all in fragments.
The Norwegian archaeologists claim that it’s possible Illyrians made [[ritual]] offerings to the sea&lt;ref name="apollon.uio.no"/&gt; – a well-known phenomenon in [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Iron Age]], but this is really a loose theory because it would be the first example ever heard of from the Illyrian area or whole region of  eastern [[Adriatic]]. Indeed, archaeologists still don't know why the boats were sunk and the pitchers destroyed, but doctor Lindhagen from the [[University of Lund]] assume that it's absurd to think that the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] sank almost a one thousand [[amphorae]] containing their own [[wine]]. Their explanations is that the [[amphorae]] may have been dumped when they’d been emptied. 
However, piles of horse teeth and bones, Illyrian weaponry like axes and spear tips and [[pottery]] have also been found in the water along the boats and [[amphorae]], what gives ''Professor'' Snjezana Vasilj ''PhD'' and her colleagues from [[University of Mostar]] a strong arguments to stick to their ''Pirate theory'' and a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] war campaign against Illyrian pirates, after all, in the [[Illyrian Wars|Illyrian wars]] of 229 BC and 219 BC, Rome overran the [[List of Illyrian cities|Illyrian settlements]] in the [[Neretva]] river valley and suppressed the piracy that had made the Adriatic unsafe for commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, p. 120, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}.,Page 158,"... ' Illyrian success continued when command passed to Agron's widow Teuta, who granted individual ships a licence to universal plunder. In 231 ac the fleet and army attacked Ells and Messenia ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ardiaei or Narensii===
[[File:Desilo acheological underwater site at Hutovo Blato.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Desilo archaeological underwater site at ''[[Hutovo Blato]] Nature Park'', Bosnia and Herzegovina. (Photo: [[University of Mostar]])]]
The original homeland of the [[Ardiaei]] is said to have been around modern [[Neretva]] river, in present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. They were called by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] "Vardiaei".&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992,{{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}..page 216,"The Ardiaei, or Vardaei as they were known to the Romans, `once the ravagers of Italy' and now reduced to a mere ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
Once an inland tribe, the Ardiaei eventually settled on the Adriatic coast.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992,{{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}.,page 188,"probably the result of pressure from new Illyrian groups, including the Ardiaei and Delmatae, moving towards the Adriatic. ...""&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ancient geographer, [[Strabo]], lists the Ardiaei as one of the three strongest tribes - the other two being the [[Autariatae]] and the [[Dardani]]. The whole of the mountainous country that stretches alongside [[Pannonia]] from the recess of the [[Adriatic]] as far as the Rhizonic Gulf and the land of the [[Ardiaei]] is Illyrian, falling as it does between the sea and the Pannonian tribes ([[Strabon]], ''[[Geographika]]'', 7. 5. 3).

In ancient times this river was known as ''[[Narenta]]/Naro(n)/[[Narona]]'', and the connotation with the name of an [[Illyrian tribe]] [[Narensii]] seems obvious.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Daorsi===
{{main|Daorson}}
''Daors'' was the name of an Illyrian tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992,{{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}},From back matter,"... "`Surveys of ships on coins of the Daors tribe'"&lt;/ref&gt;  Another name of the tribe was '''''Daversi'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992,{{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}},page 216,"... to the Romans, `once the ravagers of Italy' and now reduced 
to a mere 20 decuriae, and the Daorsi or Daversi, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural identity===
Archaeological research on the Illyrians was used politically as the culture-historical glue of the various groups in the former Yugoslavia. Today the focus is more on the differences between the Illyrian peoples.
The neutral term "Illyrian" was applied to all ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia. The Illyrians have been described as [[warrior]]s, and little focus has been placed on peaceful connections between the Illyrians and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. So it's important to be able to reveal peaceful relations and to show that the Illyrians had come a long way in their cultural contact with other [[nations]], at the same time as there were great differences between the Illyrian tribes. Discovery is therefore important for understanding cultural identities in the [[Balkans]] in ancient times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10398">In [[West Virginia]] [[folklore]], the '''Flatwoods monster''', also known as the '''Braxton County Monster''' or '''Phantom of Flatwoods''', is an entity reported to have been sighted in the town of [[Flatwoods, West Virginia|Flatwoods]] in [[Braxton County, West Virginia]], United States, on September&amp;nbsp;12, 1952, following the appearance of a bright object crossing the night sky. Nearly fifty years later, investigators concluded that the light was a meteor and the creature was a [[barn owl]] perched in a tree, with shadows making it appear to be a large humanoid.

== History ==
{{Location map|West Virginia|label=|marksize=6|mark=Blue_pog.svg|lat_dir=N| lat_deg=38|lat_min=43 |lat_sec=17|lon_dir=W|lon_deg=80|lon_min=39|lon_sec=11| position=right| float=right|caption=Location of Flatwoods, West Virginia}}
At 7:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on September 12, 1952, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, and their friend Tommy Hyer said they saw a bright object cross the sky and land on the property of local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. The boys went to the home of Kathleen May, where they told their story. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley and Ronnie Shaver, and  [[West Virginia National Guard]]sman Eugene Lemon, went to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate whatever it was that the boys said they had seen. The group reached the top of a hill, where Nunley said they saw a pulsing red light. Lemon said he aimed a flashlight in that direction and momentarily saw a tall "man-like figure with a round, red face surrounded by a pointed, hood-like shape".&lt;ref name=nickell1 /&gt;

Descriptions varied. In an article for ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate Magazine]]'' based on his tape-recorded interviews, UFO writer [[Gray Barker]] described the figure as approximately {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=2|lk=on}} tall, with a round blood-red face, a large pointed "hood-like shape" around the face, eye-like shapes which emitted greenish-orange light, and a dark black or green body.&lt;ref name="Barker1953"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Barker |first=Gray |editor-last=Webster |editor-first=Robert N. |title=The Monster and the Saucer |magazine=[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]] |date=January 1953 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen May described the figure as having "small, claw-like hands", clothing-like folds,&lt;ref name=nickell1&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Nickell |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Nickell |title=The Flatwoods UFO Monster |date=2 November 2000 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/flatwoods_ufo_monster/ |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=15–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a head that resembled the [[ace of spades]]".&lt;ref name="Griffin2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Buddy |editor-last=Lilly |editor-first=John |title=The Legend of the Flatwoods Monster |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liLXAAAAMAAJ |date=Fall 2002 |journal=Goldenseal |publisher=State of West Virginia, Department of Commerce |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=56–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story, when the figure made a hissing sound and "glided toward the group", Lemon screamed and dropped his flashlight, causing the group to run away.&lt;ref name="BraxV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flatwoods Monster|url=http://braxtonwv.org/FlatwoodsMonsterInfo.aspx|website=Braxtonwv.org|publisher=Braxton County Convention and Visitor's Bureau|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flatwoods monster newspaper1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|September 14, 1952 news clip from the [[Charleston Daily Mail]].]]
The group said they had smelled a "pungent mist" and some later said they were nauseated. The local sheriff and a deputy had been investigating reports of a crashed aircraft in the area. They searched the site of the reported monster but "saw, heard and smelled nothing". According to Barker's account, the next day, A. Lee Stewart, Jr. of the ''Braxton Democrat'' claimed to discover "skid marks" in the field and an "odd, gummy deposit"&lt;ref name=nickell1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barker1953"/&gt; which were subsequently attributed by UFO enthusiast groups as evidence of a "saucer" landing.&lt;ref name=sci1&gt;{{cite journal | title = More On The "Green Monster" | journal = Civilian Saucer Investigation (Winter Edition) | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | publisher = Project 1947 (Republished by) | date = 1953 | url = http://www.project1947.com/shg/csi/csiv1-2.html | accessdate = 2006-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nickell1/&gt;

According to former news editor Holt Byrne, "newspaper stories were carried throughout the country, radio broadcasts were carried on large networks, and hundreds of phone calls were received from all parts of the country". The national press services rated the story "#11 for the year". A minister from [[Brooklyn]] came to question the May family. A [[Pittsburgh]] paper sent a special reporter. UFO and [[Fortean]] writers like Gray Barker and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] arrived to investigate.&lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Holt|title=1966.

== Conventional explanations ==
[[File:Barn-owl (Racheeo).jpg|right|thumb|upright|A barn owl, seen with "''claw-like hands''" and a face shaped "''like the [[ace of spades|Ace of Spades]]''"]]
After investigating the case in 2000, [[Joe Nickell]] of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) concluded that the bright light in the sky reported by the witnesses on September&amp;nbsp;12 was most likely a [[meteor]], that the pulsating red light was likely an aircraft navigation/hazard beacon, and that the creature described by witnesses closely resembled an [[owl]]. Nickell suggested that witnesses' perceptions were distorted by their heightened state of anxiety. Nickell's conclusions are shared by a number of other investigators, including those of the Air Force.&lt;ref name=nickell1/&gt;&lt;ref name=keyhoe1&gt;{{cite book | last = Keyhoe | first = Donald E | authorlink = Donald Keyhoe | title = Flying Saucers from Outer Space | publisher = Henry Holt | date = 1953 |asin=B0007DECOA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night of the September&amp;nbsp;12 sighting, a meteor had been observed across three states—Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. According to Nickell, three flashing red aircraft beacons were also visible from the area of the sightings, which could account for descriptions of a pulsating red light and red tint on the face of the supposed monster.&lt;ref name=nickell1/&gt;&lt;ref name=keyhoe1/&gt;

Nickell concluded that the shape, movement, and sounds reported by witnesses were also consistent with the silhouette, flight pattern, and call of a startled [[barn owl]] perched on a tree limb, leading researchers to conclude that foliage beneath the owl may have created the illusion of the lower portions of the creature (described as being a pleated green skirt). Researchers also concluded that the witnesses' inability to agree on whether the creature had arms, combined with Kathleen May's report of it having "''small, claw-like hands''" which "''extended in front of it''", also matched the description of a barn owl with its talons gripping a tree branch.&lt;ref name=nickell1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barker1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byrne" /&gt;

According to skeptic Ryan Haupt, even though local boy Max Lockard admitted he'd driven around the site "hoping to see something" in his Chevy truck, "paranormal investigators concluded that the tracks, oily residue, and bits of a rubbery substance must have been left by the creature and not the truck". Haupt explains nausea reported by some of the witnesses as symptoms "consistent with hysteria and over-exertion".&lt;ref name="Skeptoid"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haupt|first1=Ryan|title=The Braxton County Monster|url=https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4434|website=Skeptoid Podcast|publisher=Skeptoid Media, 30 Sep 2014|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local culture==
[[File:Flatwoods_Visitor_Chair.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Flatwoods monster chair welcomes visitors near the town hall]]
Local officials have erected a "Welcome to Flatwoods / Home of the Green Monster" sign on the route leading into the town.&lt;ref name=nickell1 /&gt;

In celebration of the legend, the Braxton County Convention and Visitor's Bureau built a series of five tall chairs in the shape of the monster to serve as landmarks and visitor attractions. The town of Flatwoods also houses a museum dedicated to the monster legend and offers promotional merchandise.&lt;ref name="BraxV" /&gt; The Bureau rewards visitors who photograph all five chairs with "Free Braxie" stickers as part of their ongoing promotion.&lt;ref name="BWV3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Braxxie|url=http://www.braxtonwv.org/braxxie|website=braxtonwv.org|publisher=Braxton County Convention and Visitor's Bureau|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monster legend is celebrated every year when the town of Flatwoods holds its annual festival called "Flatwoods Days". The three-day festival is a weekend of live music, and food and craft vendors.&lt;ref name="BVW2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yearly Events|url=http://www.braxtonwv.org/yearly-events.aspx#|website=braxtonwv.org|publisher=Braxton County Convention and Visitor's Bureau|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[photography]] and [[graphic arts]] a '''flopped image''' is a technical term for a static or moving image that is generated by a mirror-reversal of an original image across a vertical axis.  This is opposed to a ''[[flipped image]]'', which means an image reversed across a horizontal axis.  ''Flopping'' can be used to improve the subjective [[aesthetic]] appeal of the image in question.

== Use in advertising ==
There are two main uses in advertising, one practical, and one subjective.  On a practical level, images of cars are often flopped to ensure cars look appropriate for left-hand-drive or right-hand-drive markets. This allows the results of a single production shoot to be used across markets, allowing a cost saving. On a subjective level, the direction in which a person is looking or a car appears to be travelling may be regarded as important. When placing a picture on a page of text, it is usual for depictions of people to face into the text, rather than off the page; thus, when compositing a page, a picture may be flopped so it may be placed either side of a column of text.

== Use in art ==
Cultural considerations come into play&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a picture of a person eating with their left hand may be flopped for publication in a Muslim publication, due to the strong taboo against eating with the left hand in Muslim society. Similarly, [[Vincent van Gogh]] took the trouble to etch some of his originals in mirror-reversed form so that when printed, people in the image would appear, correctly, as right-handed.

An example of ''flopping'' is the use of [[Joseph Southall|Joseph Edward Southall's]] painting ''Fishermen and Boat'' as part of the art associated with [[Kate Bush]]'s album [[Aerial (album)|Aerial]].  The picture is flopped, and the name "AERIAL" added to the boat.

== Image flipping ==
[[Image:Billykid.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Billy the Kid. ''(Flopped [[tintype]] photo)'']]
A common movie [[blooper]] is a flopped image, usually and erroneously called "[[flipped image]]s". Flopped images are common because they can be used to correct continuity errors between shots and are hard to see without extensive examination, whereas flipped images are very obvious. Examples of these can be found on several movie blooper sites.

One of the most famous flopped images is this picture of [[Billy the Kid]] carrying a [[Winchester Rifle|Model 1873 Winchester]] rifle and a pistol belt with the pistol on his left. This led people to believe he was left-handed, but it was later revealed to be a flopped image due to the cartridge loading gate on the rifle being on the wrong side.&lt;ref&gt;The loading gate on a Model 1873 Winchester lever action rifle is on the right side of the receiver.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greg Budgett''' (b. c. 1952)&lt;ref name=WhosWho&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=BUDGETT%2c+GREGORY Budgett entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.'' Accessed Feb. 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]-based&lt;ref name=Sangiacomo /&gt; [[comic book]] artist known particularly for his work illustrating the comics of [[Harvey Pekar]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/arts/design/13pekar.html?_r=0 "Harvey Pekar, ‘American Splendor’ Creator, Dies at 70,"] ''New York Times'' (July 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sangiacomo&gt;Sangiacomo, Michael. [http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/10/cleveland_heights_cleveland_li.html "Cleveland Heights, Cleveland libraries honoring 'American Splendor' creator Harvey Pekar,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (October 10, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Budgett's work on Pekar's ''[[American Splendor]]'' and other comics has been in partnership with [[Gary Dumm]], who has [[Inker|inked]] most of Budgett's stories.

Budgett attended [[Ohio State University]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name=WhosWho /&gt; Pekar and Budgett began working together in 1974;&lt;ref name=Zabel&gt;Zabel Joe. "Stepping Out: ST's Joe Zabel Interviews Harvey Pekar," ''Harvey Pekar: Conversations'', edited by Michael G. Rhode (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; before ''American Splendor'', Budgett illustrated a couple of short Pekar stories (one of them in partnership with Dumm) in the [[underground comix]] anthologies ''[[Bizarre Sex]]''  and ''Flaming Baloney X''.

From [[1976 in comics|1976]] until 1988, Budgett illustrated stories in Pekar's autobiographical comics series, ''[[American Splendor]]''. Budgett was one of Pekar's most frequent early collaborators; most of his stories were inked by Dumm. Budgett drew a number of ''American Splendor'' covers as well, including issues #2, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 13. 

During the 1980s, Budgett and Dumm worked on stories in ''[[Fredric Wertham|Dr. Wirtham]]'s Comix &amp; Stories'', an [[Underground comix|underground]]/[[alternative comics]] series published by [[Clifford Neal]], as well as a number of other alternative and independent comic book series. In the early 1990s, Budgett and Dumm co-wrote and drew stories for [[Eternity Comics]]' ''Plan 9 From Outer Space: Thirty Years Later'' and their own [[Adult comics|erotic]] series ''Shooty Beagle'' and ''Woofers &amp; Hooters'' (both with [[Eros Comix]]).

By the early 1990s, Budgett had "de-emphasized cartooning"&lt;ref name=Zabel /&gt; and didn't work in the industry again until 2004, when (at the urging of Gary Dumm) he illustrated another Pekar story in the 2004 collection ''American Splendor: Our Movie Year''. He was a regular contributor to [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]]'s two ''American Splendor'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] in 2006–2008.

== Summary ==
''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'' has forty chapters, which are grouped into six parts.

=== Part I. The Problem: We Need to Make Decisions, But We Don't Know How (Chapters 1–6) ===

For ethical advice to be credible, the book says it cannot be perceived as arbitrary.  The book cites [[The Dice Man]] – a man who makes choices based on dice rolls – as an example of advice-following which is arbitrary and so cannot be regarded as ethical.

Chapter three argues intuitions about what we should do can be more useful, but are undermined because our multiple intuitions often lead to contradictory advice (e.g. ‘help a stranger’ or ‘put family first’?).  Philosophers have sought to eliminate these contradictions by locating right and wrong in a single part of the decision-making process: for example, in the actions we take (e.g. [[Kant]]), in our character (e.g. [[Aristotle]], [[virtue ethics]]) or in the consequences of our actions (e.g. [[Utilitarianism]]).

Chapter four explains how ‘do whatever is best’ (utilitarianism) still dominates modern philosophical and economic thinking.

Chapter five cites seven faults with utilitarianism.  These are that it can be self-defeating; that it considers only future events and ignores the past; that it places decision-making authority in questionable hands; that it doesn’t discriminate fairly between people; that it sacrifices individual concerns to the group interest; that it down-grades promises, fairness and truth-telling; and that it doesn’t offer any clear rules.&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"&gt;[https://iainbking.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/how-to-make-good-decisions-62-point-summary.pdf ''How to Make Good Decisions...'' a 62 point summary (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter also argues that the main argument for utilitarianism is invalid, and ‘empty’.&lt;ref&gt;http://leehopkins.com/counselling/2015/11/12/ethics-condundrum-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part II. The Proof: Finding the Basics of Right and Wrong (Chapters 7–14) ===

Part II starts with a secular revision of [[Pascal’s Wager]],&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; arguing “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.” Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

It says that “people ultimately derive their choices from what they want to do and what other people want to do” &lt;ref&gt;[http://petergreenwell.com/essays/did-angela-do-good-or-bad/ ''Did Angela do Good or Bad?'' Peter Greenwell, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

It then presents four different arguments for deriving a basic principle from which right and wrong can be developed.  These are an adaptation of utilitarianism; an adaptation of [[John Rawls|John Rawls']] theory;&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"/&gt; an argument from evolutionary theory;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosophynow.org/issues/100/Moral_Laws_of_the_Jungle ''Moral Laws of the Jungle'', Philosophy Now magazine, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a '[[Sherlock Holmes]]' approach.

All four arguments converge on [[empathy]], [[duty|obligation]] and the ‘Help Principle’, which the book argues are kernels of a viable ethical system.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; According to [[Audrey Tang]], King's philosophy advocates: "If spending one unit of your effort could help another person by two units, he detailed in his book, you should help."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-enlightenment-2015-part-1-audrey-tang ''Open Source Enlightenment'', Audrey Tang, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part III. The Principle: Refining the Help Principle (Chapters 15–22) ===

Part III defines the Help Principle more carefully, with a section on [[autonomy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijbioethics.ir/fa/ManuscriptDetail?mid=5331 International Journal of Bio-Ethics, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a critique of the [[Golden Rule#Cannot be a sole guide to action|golden rule]].

It results in an approach to ethics which combines deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics.  This has been described as quasi-utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;D’Souza, J. F. and Adams, C. K. (2016). "On Measuring the Moral Value of Action". ''Frontiers of Philosophy in China''. 11(1), pp. 122–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part IV. The Program: Extending the Principles to Other Problems (Chapters 23–31) ===

Part IV attempts to distinguish white lies from bad lies.&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schokking"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gendels-ross-research-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Contradicting [[Aristotle]], who believed no general rule on lying was possible, 'For he who advocates lying can never be believed or trusted,' and [[St Augustine]], who believed all lies were sinful, the book presents a definition of good lies, and argues why it is credible and superior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/02/05/imp06.asp Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka), February 5th, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiomedia.com/15store/4259  ''The Conundrum of Illicit Financial Flows'', Teshome Abebe, November 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 28 and 29 reconcile individual human rights with group interests.  Both individual justice and social justice feature.

=== Part V. Practical Advice: For Real People in the Modern World (Chapters 32–38) ===

Part V deals with situations when information is not certain, and other real world problems which are absent from much academic philosophy.  These problems make [[effective altruism]] impractical and rare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ispitphilo.wordpress.com/ ''Food for the Mind'', by Blake Hall, May 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 34 argues that the notion of [[integrity]] can only make sense in ethics if it is applied to the consequences people allow to happen rather than to people themselves.

=== Part VI. The Prognosis: How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time (Chapters 39–40) ===

Part VI claims a hybrid system can be internally-consistent and address several problems of the main schools of ethics.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

Chapter 40 concludes it is impossible to make good decisions all the time because we can never know enough about the world, and the consequences of our actions.  Hence, ethics can never emulate the scientific revolution by offering a simple set of rules for every situation, similar to those derived by Newton.  This is because Newton’s own rules can never be applied perfectly, because we can never know how the world really is.

== About the book ==
It was published on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;  It became a bestseller within the category of philosophy books in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/bloomsburyacademic/docs/philosophy2013 Philosophy Books, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae''''' is an 1813 publication by the [[botanical illustrator]] [[Ferdinand Bauer]].

Bauer was scientific illustrator on board {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}} during [[Matthew Flinders]]' exploration of Australia, and as such he worked closely with the expedition's naturalist, [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]. When these men returned to England in 1805, they brought with them thousands of specimens and hundreds of sketches. Initially, they planned to publish a large-scale work, to be entitled ''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae'', but this venture failed, and Brown decided to publish his scientific descriptions separately, in ''[[Transactions of the Linnean Society of London]]'', and later his own ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]''. Bauer then undertook to publish a lesser work himself, with Brown providing text limited to a brief preface and some captioning.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher=CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually, Bauer not only did all the illustrations, but also engraved the printing plates and hand-coloured the illustrations. It was exceedingly unusual for a single artist to perform all three roles; it is said that Bauer did the engraving himself because he could not find a good engraver, and previous works of his were disappointing because of incompetent engraving.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"/&gt;

Three issues of ''Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae'' were published, all in 1813. These three issues totalled fifteen plates, and a sixteenth was bound into some copies. Publication then ceased, probably because the venture was a financial failure.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"/&gt; It is estimated that less than fifty copies of the work were sold, and some of these were uncoloured. It is therefore now an extremely rare book. In 1997, a copy was sold at [[Christie's]] for $57,000.&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bauer, Ferdinand | url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/creator/450 | accessdate = 14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imparja Television''' (IMP) is an Australian television station servicing remote eastern and central Australia, that began broadcasting on 2 January 1988. It is based in [[Alice Springs]], where it has a studio and satellite uplink facility. Notably, it is controlled by [[Australian Aboriginals]] through ownership by [[Imparja Television Pty Ltd]], and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. Most viewers receive Imparja via [[free to view]] satellite transmission, whilst a smaller proportion receive it via analogue terrestrial transmission.

''Imparja'' is an [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]] word meaning [[footprints]]. The word is used to represent that Imparja Television aims to service Arrente people wherever they may live, from [[Mutitjulu]] to [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|King's Canyon]] to [[Alice Springs]] to [[Tennant Creek]] and beyond. They describe their range as a footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Imparja Television was identified on-air and in print as '''Nine Imparja''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = New Current Affairs Program
  | publisher = Imparja Television
  | date = 27 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following its dropping of Network Ten affiliation. In 2009, the station again identifies as simply "Imparja" and "IMP", although the Nine Network's nine dots seen in the logo still remain.

==History==

===Origins===
The then [[Australian Broadcasting Authority|Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] was asked by the Federal Minister for Communications in October 1984 to inquire into the allocation of commercial television licences for a number of remote areas. Licences were granted in 1985 to the [[Golden West Network]], which broadcast to Western Australia, and [[Southern Cross Central|QSTV]] in north-eastern Australia.&lt;ref name="company"&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=28 August 2007 
 |df=dmy-all 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 hearings for the allocation of the licence began, and the [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association]] (CAAMA), which began providing Central Australian radio programs in local languages in 1980, formed [[Imparja Television Pty Ltd]] as a company.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Soon after, the [[Government of the Northern Territory]] announced support to underpin the viability of the Central Zone Remote Television Service (RCTS) by offering to purchase an estimated $2&amp;nbsp;million package of services from the successful applicant. The [[Government of South Australia]] undertook a similar promise, offering loans of $1&amp;nbsp;million to Imparja if they were successful.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; An extraordinary saga of political, legal and commercial intrigue then ensued during the protracted [[Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] (ABT) hearing process, pitching Federal, State and Territory Governments against one another with loan promises being substantially watered down or withdrawn as it became apparent the CAAMA application may prevail. Windfall funding from the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Aboriginal Development Commission ultimately underpinned the feasibility of the CAAMA bid and they were successfully allocated the licence. However subsequent Federal Administrative Tribunal court proceedings brought about by the unsuccessful applicant, Darwin based Territory Television Ltd., attempting to overturn the ABT's decision delayed construction commencement of the new service until May 1987.&lt;ref name="Bell 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Wendy|title=A Remote Possibility: The Battle for Imparja Television|date=May 2008|publisher=IAD Press|location=Alice Springs|isbn=978-1-86465-097-6|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1987 the new station had begun to build rebroadcast sites and new studios and a main transmitter based in [[Alice Springs]] were completed.&lt;ref name="Bell 2008"/&gt; Imparja's first test program, ''[[Test Cricket|Australia versus Sri Lanka Test Cricket]]'', was telecast on 2 January 1988 in [[Alice Springs]].&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Two weeks later, on 15 January 1988, the station was officially inaugurated at Imparja Television's head office in Alice Springs by Minister for Communications [[Ralph Willis]] and [[Warren Snowdon]], the Australian federal [[member of parliament#Australia|member of parliament]] for the [[Division of Lingiari]] in [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imparja became the first Aboriginal member of the [[FreeTV Australia|Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations]] and the now-defunct Regional Television Association, both dominant organisations at the time.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt;

Imparja was chaired by [[Freda Glynn]] for its first 10 years and, for a time, she was the only female chair of a television network in the world. Freda was one of the first three founders of [[CAAMA]] – the others being [[John Macumba]] and [[Philip Batty]].

Imparja had an initial population reach of 62,000 people, which by 1993 had grown to 125,000.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Imparja was available through retransmission sites at [[Ceduna]], [[Coober Pedy]], [[Leigh Creek]] and [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] in South Australia, and [[Alice Springs]], [[Tennant Creek]], [[Katherine]] and [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] in the [[Northern Territory]], as well as on the [[Optus Aurora]] [[satellite television|satellite]] platform.

Imparja initially carried programming from all three major Australian commercial television networks, but following aggregation of market area with [[Southern Cross Central|QSTV]], it affiliated with the [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]]. Imparja also screened some [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]] and [[SBS Television]] indigenous programs, all in addition to original programs commissioned by the station.

===1990s===
In 1990, ''Imparja Local News'' was launched as a fifteen-minute insert of local news into the national bulletin. The station also covered the [[Northern Territory general election, 1990|Northern Territory general election]] live from its Alice Springs studios. This followed the lead taken in 1989 when the station began to produce weather reports for parts of the [[Northern Territory]], South Australia and [[New South Wales]], presented by [[Lavinia Hampton]].&lt;ref name="company" /&gt;

By 1993, Imparja's viewing audience had doubled to approximately 125,000 Australians. This in turn led to the increased allocation of government funding in 1994 to produce ''Yamba's Playtime'', which was the station's first in-house televisual production. [[Yamba's Playtime]] features the station's official mascot, "Yamba". Also in 1994, the Imparja board of directors established the Imparja Business Development Sub Committee, to monitor and provide strategic recommendations for areas of growth for the company.

In 1995, Imparja received the [[Telstra]] Indigenous Business Award for Business of the Year.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Also in 1995, Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the [[Optus fleet of satellites#A-Class|Aussat A-Class satellites]] to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus B1|Optus B1]] satellite, and the station's licence was renewed.

Two new in-house productions were launched in 1996. The first being the ''BRACS Program'', which was almost fully produced by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] communities, and ''Corroboree Rock'', an Aboriginal music program.

Imparja's parent company, [[Imparja Pty Ltd]], converted to a [[proprietary company]] in 1997, whilst in the late 1990s, Imparja moved to digital satellite technology on the [[Optus Aurora]] platform. This meant that Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus B1|Optus B1]] satellite to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus C1|Optus C1]] satellite.

===2000s===
By 2001 the station's coverage area had grown to include over 430,000 people.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Around this time 'Imparja Info Channel' ('Channel 31') was launched, providing additional programming, news, and community information to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as [[Indigenous Community Television]] (ICTV). In 2007, the whole channel was replaced by [[National Indigenous Television]] (NITV).

Imparja faced criticism by a number of community groups in 2004, following the station's decision to introduce advertising for alcohol for the first time. The network pledged to donate 30% of the total income received from [[alcohol advertising]] towards alcohol and substance abuse programs in communities.

In 2005, ''Imparja National News'', which primarily covered the news in [[Alice Springs]] in addition to other national and international news stories, was axed. The move was taken in anticipation of the Remote Eastern &amp; Central Australia TV1 licence area being merged with that of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Regulations imposed by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] relating to minimum levels of local news coverage led to 2006 reinstatement of ''Imparja National News''. The news service began broadcasting again from the middle of February 2006, with [[Ryan Liddle]] as presenter.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{cite web

}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, it was widely expected that the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] would merge the "[[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]" and "Remote Eastern and Central Australia" commercial television licence areas. This would have most likely seen Imparja Television become a [[Network Ten]] affiliate in Darwin. However, this did not eventuate. Instead [[PBL Media]] and [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]], the two existing Darwin Commercial licence holders were invited to bid individually or together. Their successful joint bid used a company called [[Darwin Digital Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = New digital commercial television service for Darwin
  | publisher = [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]]
  | date = 18 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2008, Imparja Television updated its logo removing the emblem, which had been present on the logo for two decades. The logo change coincided with Imparja dropping [[Network Ten]] affiliation, becoming a sole [[Nine Network]] affiliate, in addition to axing ''Imparja National News'', and also adding Nine Network's dots to its new logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="affiliation" /&gt;

===2010s===
On 19 May 2010, the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) approved a licence for a new remote area digital-only TV channel, a joint venture by Imparja Pty Ltd and Southern Cross Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_312142 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019212642/http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc%3DPC_312142 |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched on 30 June 2010 as "[[Central Digital Television|Ten Central (CDT)]]". It had two feeds, Ten Central North (QLD/NT) and Ten Central South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas).

In December 2010, Imparja Television began broadcasting on terrestrial digital TV and the new [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] satellite service. This expansion included the establishment of two feeds for these platforms, Imparja North (Qld/NT) and Imparja South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas). As of 2010, their programming is exactly the same.

Imparja Pty Ltd also began to launch digital channels [[9Go!|GO!]] and [[9Gem|GEM]].

As of the moment, Imparja continues to stream the HD feed of [[9Gem]], which was rebranded as a standard definition channel in Nine Network-only on 26 November 2015 in its metropolitan and Darwin stations, along with [[9Life]] and the relaunch of [[9HD]]. There are currently no plans at this stage for Imparja to launch an HD simulcast or introduce 9Life to its viewers. It will continue with its existing lineup of three broadcast channels.

Imparja Television is a sole [[Nine Network]] affiliate. The station previously broadcast both Nine and Ten programming, however it stopped broadcasting [[Network Ten]] programming on 3 February 2008.&lt;ref name="affiliation"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imparja Television has also aired  original programs produced by local Aboriginal community members, such as [[Bush Mechanics]] and the children's program ''[[Yamba's Playtime]]''. Imparja also airs programming relating to local [[Australian rules football]] and community sports, as well as news updates and religious ''thought for the day'' programs. Imparja Television also regularly broadcasts films created by the [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association]], which is a shareholder of its parent company.

Imparja's programming schedule is currently based on the Nine Network schedule for Brisbane (based on [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|Eastern Standard Time]]). Prior to February 2008, scheduling was generally based on [[Australian Central Standard Time|Central Standard Time]], reflecting its Alice Springs-based heritage. As a result, programs are now broadcast half an hour earlier than they previously would have been under the previous arrangement.

===News and current affairs===
Imparja does not currently produce its own evening regional news bulletin. In 2008, Imparja replaced ''[[Imparja National News]]'' – a 30-minute, weeknightly program combining local and national/international news – with local news updates, plus a 30-minute local news magazine program, ''Footprints'' (which later ceased production in 2009). The news updates were presented by Emma Groves from 2014 until July 2016. This brings Imparja's daily news service roughly into line with its competitor in the Remote Eastern and Central Australia licence area, [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central (QQQ)]].

The 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm ([[Australian Eastern Standard Time|AEST]]) time slot is filled by a simulcast of ''[[Nine News Queensland]]''. Imparja cites its geographic distribution, with a majority of the remote licence area's viewers now located in Queensland, as a "key factor" in selecting the Queensland bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Imparja began airing the Darwin edition of [[Nine News#Darwin|Nine News]] live at 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm (AEST) on weekdays, immediately following the Brisbane edition, in place of ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' – thereby restoring a [[Northern Territory]]-based bulletin to the station.

===Sport===
Imparja airs most sports coverage from the Nine Network, including [[rugby league]], [[cricket]], golf and tennis. The station also broadcast [[motorsport]] and [[Australian rules football]] coverage until 2008.

==Availability==
Imparja Television broadcasts throughout most of the Northern Territory, and also to some remote parts of [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Norfolk Island]]. It is generally available by satellite on the [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] or [[Optus Aurora]] platforms, though in some locations it is broadcast terrestrially. Imparja Television has the largest geographic range of any commercial television network in Australia. Imparja is also received on the [[TT-Line (Australia)|Spirit of Tasmania]] Bass Strait Ferries.

Imparja Television was previously available in [[New Zealand]] until March 2008 when the New Zealand government pressured the Australian government to remove the service from the satellite footprint that includes New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The total population serviced by Imparja Television is over 700,000 people, boasting the largest footprint in the southern hemisphere.

Imparja is also available in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea through the HiTRON subscription television service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitron.com.pg/mmds_2006.html HiTRON Limited – Papua New Guinea :: MMDS TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615202949/http://www.hitron.com.pg/mmds_2006.html |date=15 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos==
Imparja Television's first logo was developed from a painting produced by an [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] artist and traditional owner. The logo symbolised the [[MacDonnell Ranges]], the [[Todd River]] and the [[Yeperenye caterpillar]].&lt;ref name="aboutlogo"&gt;{{cite web

'''''Jeanne Eagels''''' (also titled '''''The Jeanne Eagels Story''''') is a 1957 American [[biographical film]] loosely based on the life of stage star [[Jeanne Eagels]]. Distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film was produced and directed by [[George Sidney]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[John Fante]], [[Daniel Fuchs]] and [[Sonya Levien]], based on a story by Fuchs.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; July 24, 1957, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; July 20, 1957, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars [[Kim Novak]] in the title role. [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], [[Larry Gates]], [[Virginia Grey]], [[Gene Lockhart]] and [[Murray Hamilton]] co-star.

Many aspects of Eagels' real life were omitted or largely fictionalized. Eagels' family later sued Columbia Pictures over the way Eagels was depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/97099/Jeanne-Eagels/overview|title=Jeanne Eagels (1957)|last=Erickson|first=Hal|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Jeanne Eagels is a Kansas City waitress. After losing a carnival's beauty contest, she asks carny owner Sal Satori for a job. Her dancing in a skimpy costume is accused of being obscene. Sal decides to join his brother in New York and invites Jeanne to join them in an amusement park at [[Coney Island]].

Taking acting lessons instead, the ambitious Jeanne becomes the understudy in a Broadway show and a star when she gets a chance to play the part. A once successful actress named Elsie Desmond wants to make a comeback in a new play, but Jeanne betrays her and takes the play for herself, willing to do anything to get ahead. Elsie denounces her in the theater before the first performance, then commits suicide. Sal is disgusted by Jeanne's behavior as well. She accepts a proposal from a ne'er-do-well named John Donahue, but both descend into alcoholism. Jeanne misses performances and causes fellow actors to lose out on paychecks.

Her situation deteriorates further when she's required to pay alimony to John after a divorce. A new play fails because Jeanne, drunk and on pills, collapses on stage. The actors' guild suspends her for 18 months. Unable to work, she returns to Sal's amusement park and is offered a job dancing. Another performer sexually assaults her in a dressing room. Jeanne, her life in ruins, continues to spiral downward and hallucinate. While trying to make it to a stage one night, she collapses on the staircase and dies.

'''Joannes Molanus''' (1533–1585), often cited simply as '''Molanus''', is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] name of Jan Vermeulen or Van der Meulen,&lt;ref&gt;R. Van Uytven, "Molanus, Johannes", ''[[Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek]]'', vol. 2 (Brussels, 1966), 580-582.&lt;/ref&gt; an influential [[Counter Reformation]] Catholic theologian of [[Old University of Leuven|Louvain University]], where he was Professor of Theology, and Rector from 1578. Born at [[Lille]] (a city in the [[County of Flanders]], then under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]]), he was a priest and [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[St. Peter's Church, Leuven]], where he died.

He wrote numerous books, several only published posthumously. He is best known for his ''De Picturis et Imaginibus Sacris, pro vero earum usu contra abusus'' ("Treatise on Sacred Images"). This was published in 1570, four years after the [[Beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Fury]] had swept through the [[Low Countries]], and it defended the production and use of devotional images, but enforcing the restrictions of the  [[Council of Trent]], as he interpreted them, in a brutally polemical fashion, which was very influential.&lt;ref name="Mâle, online"/&gt;  Five further, enlarged, editions of this appeared between 1594 and 1771,&lt;ref name="freedberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Freedberg/Johannes-Molanus.pdf|first=David|last=Freedburg|title=Johannes Molanus on Provocative paintings|page=1, note 2|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a modern French translation was published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Molanus, ''Traité des saintes images'', ed. and trans. François Boespflug, Olivier Christin and Benoît Tassel (2 vols., Paris, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also lead editor of an edition of the works of [[Saint Augustine]] (Antwerp, [[Plantin Press]], 1566–1577),&lt;ref name="freedberg"/&gt; and wrote a manuscript history of Louvain that was printed in two volumes in 1861, edited by [[P. F. X. de Ram]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Molanus, ''Les quatorze livres sur l'histoire de la ville de Louvain'', ed. P. F. X. de Ram (2 vols., Brussels, 1861).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Molanus was born in [[Lille]], in [[Walloon Flanders]], in 1533, the son of Hendrik Vermeulen and Anna Peters. His father was from Holland and his mother from Brabant.

He matriculated at Louvain University on 27 February 1554, graduating in the Liberal Arts in 1558 and as Doctor of Theology in 1570. He became a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of St. Peter's Church, Leuven, and a professor of Theology, serving both as dean of the [[Faculty of Theology, Old University of Leuven|Faculty of Theology]] and as rector of the university. In 1579 he was appointed president of [[King's College, Leuven|King's College]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alphonse Wauters]], "Molanus, Joannes", ''[[Biographie Nationale de Belgique]]'', [http://www.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/FichierPDFBiographieNationaleTome2057.pdf vol. 15] (Brussels, 1899), 48-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molanus died in Louvain on 18 September 1585, having made bequests in favour of the college over which he had presided.

==Molanus and art==
Molanus is today mainly remembered by art historians for being one of the first authorities to turn the [[Council of Trent]]'s short and inexplicit [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on sacred images]] (1563) into minutely detailed instructions for artists, which were then widely enforced in Catholic countries mostly.  His views on the older, originally [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]], depiction of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]] are typical:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Virgin is shown pale with pains, the midwives prepare a small (narcotic) drought for the childbirth. Why this? Is it because the Virgin Mary would have held back from any pain of childbirth, when in fact she brought forth her divine son without pain? And what pertains to the midwives who are mentioned in the apocryphal Book of the Infancy? Jerome says: There was no midwife! No obtrusiveness of women intervened! She, the Virgin, was both mother and midwife! I saw in not a few places the picture of the blessed Virgin lying on a bed, depicting childbirth, and she was suffering pains from this birth, but that is not true. How stupid! Those artists ought to be laughed at who paint Mary in the very act of childbirth pains, accompanied with pain, midwife, bed, little knives (to cut the umbilical cord), with hot compresses, and many other appurtenances. . . . Rather, those pictures should be promoted which show the birth of Christ in which the Blessed Virgin Mary with arms folded and on bended knee before her little son, as though he was just now brought forth into the light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~jneyrey1/MaryM&amp;M.htm Mary: Mediterranean Maid and Mother in Art and Literature], Jerome H. Neyrey, University of Notre Dame, Abstract, Biblical Theology Bulletin 20 (1990) 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He objected on similar grounds to the ''[[Death of the Virgin]]'', her [[Swoon of the Virgin|swooning at the foot of the Cross]], and her being shown supplicating Christ for mankind in ''[[Last Judgement]]'' scenes. She would, he said, in fact be sitting alongside Christ in stern judgement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many painters show Mary and John the Baptist kneeling beside Our lord at the Last Judgment...But we may not think that at that day the Virgin Mary will kneel for us before the Judge, baring her breast to intercede for sinners. Nor may we think that John the Baptist will fall upon his knees to beg mercy for mankind in the way the painters show. Rather, the blessed Virgin and St. John shall sit beside the supreme Judge as assessors. The mercy which is extended now will have no place then. There will only be strict justice at that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paintedchurch.org/ickdoom.htm Online, with example of the depiction condemned] De Historia SS. Imaginum et Picturarum, 1594, Book iv. cap. 24. translated in A. Caiger-Smith, English Medieval Wall Paintings [Bibliography Page], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also condemned were [[Saint Christopher]] as a giant carrying Christ (and as the protector of travellers), [[Saint George and the Dragon]], the [[Holy Kinship]], the unicorn hunt in the [[Hortus Conclusus]] and many other depictions not verifiable from reliable sources&amp;nbsp;– the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' was, he said, in fact of "lead".&lt;ref name="Mâle, online"&gt;Mâle, online&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudity, even of the infant Jesus, was to be avoided as much as possible, and drapes must cover the genitals where it could not be.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1985, pp. 114, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst condemning older depictions without a scriptural basis, he was not hesitant in creating new ones based on his own interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1985, p. 127; Mâle&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Joseph]] should not be shown as the old, semi-comical figure of the Middle Ages, but as young, vigorous and firmly in control of the [[Holy Family]]. [[Mary Magdalene]] should not be shown as an over-dressed prostitute, and generally dress should be simple.&lt;ref name="Mâle, online"/&gt; He opposed showing the [[Swooning Virgin Mary]] in scenes of ''[[Christ carrying the Cross]]'' or the Crucifixion itself.&lt;ref&gt;Penny 2004, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|Australian politician|David MacGibbon (Australian politician)}}
'''David MacGibbon''' (2 April 1831 – 20 February 1902) and '''Thomas Ross''' (10 November 1839 – 4 December 1930) were Scottish architects. Their practice, '''MacGibbon and Ross''' was established in 1872 and continued until 1914. They are best known today for their comprehensive published surveys of Scotland's architectural heritage.

David MacGibbon should not be confused with architect William Forsyth McGibbon (1856-1923).&lt;ref name="WFMcG"&gt;[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201154 Dictionary of Scottish Architects: William Forsyth McGibbon]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}

'''David MacGibbon''' LLD was born in [[Edinburgh]], into a family of builders, and was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|Royal High School]]. He attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1846–49, but did not graduate. In 1851 he joined the London office of architect [[William Burn]], and made study tours to Europe during the 1850s. From 1856 he went into practice with his father Charles, drawing details for houses.

By 1858 he had opened his own office in Edinburgh, later becoming architect to the [[Merchant Company of Edinburgh]], involving work to the city's schools. He was the principal architect to the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] from 1861 (succeeding [[David Rhind]]), designing bank branches for [[Dunfermline]], [[Kilmarnock]], [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], and many others. From 1862 he employed Thomas Ross as his assistant, making him a partner and establishing MacGibbon and Ross ten years later. 

In 1865 MacGibbon married Jessie Vannan Rintoul, and acquired the estate of Laggan, [[Ballantrae]], from his father. After 1867 they built a new house on the estate (Gurphur, since demolished), and also purchased a house in the [[Dean Village]] area of Edinburgh. Later, a larger house was built at Ashfield in [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Loan]]. These properties had to be sold in the early 1880s following the crash of the [[City of Glasgow Bank]], to avoid the bankruptcy of MacGibbon's cousins. 

In 1880 he was elected president of the Edinburgh Architectural Association, and gave lectures on the architecture of Scottish castles and country houses. He had been making field visits and sketching for some years, building up a first-hand knowledge of the topic. It was these surveys and papers which formed the basis for the publication of ''The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland''.

While on holiday in July 1884, MacGibbon's son William was killed and his daughter Rachel permanently injured when a sandbank collapsed on them. Rachel's lungs were affected and the family were forced to move to the [[French Riviera]] to aid her recovery. he continued sketching, publishing ''The Architecture of the Riviera'' in 1888. Returning to Scotland, he continued his surveys for the continuing publication of ''The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland'' and ''The ecclesiastical architecture of Scotland''. He began a parallel project on the continent with his son Alfred in the 1890s, although this never reached fruition. His workload brought on a heart condition which worsened over the next years. Although he published ''The Five Great Churches of Galloway'' in 1899, by that year he was too ill to attend the [[University of St Andrews]] to accept an honorary degree. 

In later life he was living with his family at 23 Learmonth Terrace, whilst his office (with Ross) was at 65 Frederick Street in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1900-1901&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1902, survived by his wife and son, and three daughters. He is buried in the north-west section of the northern (19th century) extension to [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]]. His grave is both very small and somewhat damaged. It has been moved back to rest against the much larger grave of his wife Jessie.

'''Thomas Ross''' was the son of a farmer, also Thomas Ross, and Ann Murray. He was born at Wardheads, [[Errol, Perth and Kinross|Errol]], and attended local schools before going to Glasgow around 1855 to work as an assistant to architect Alexander Kirkland. He soon moved to the office of [[Charles Wilson (Scottish architect)|Charles Wilson]], winning a measured drawing competition during his time there. He spent the proceeds on a study trip to Yorkshire, visiting [[Fountains Abbey]] among other sites.

In 1862 he began as an assistant to David MacGibbon in Edinburgh, and was made a partner in the firm of MacGibbon and Ross in 1872. Soon after this he married Mary MacLaren. Ross began sketching the architecture of Scotland along with his senior partner, contributing to the latter's public lectures, and culminating in the pair's major publications. After MacGibbon's removal to the continent, Ross managed the practice alone, and also continued to make sketching trips for their ongoing publications. The books brought in many commissions for restoration work, but many schemes were never realised, and business declined generally.

After MacGibbon's death in 1902, his place was taken by his son Alfred. Ross himself was appointed as a founder commissioner of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] in 1908, and was awarded an honorary degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1910. He gave the [[Rhind lectures]] in 1899, on Scottish architecture. Fred MacGibbon was later appointed architect to the RCAHMS, but was diagnosed as [[diabetes|diabetic]] and resigned in 1914, dissolving the practice. He died the following year.

Ross continued alone until 1916, when he retired to his home in Saxe-Coburg Place, Edinburgh, occasionally undertaking small commissions. He was arrested in 1915 for sketching in a prohibited area, while studying [[Rossend Castle]] in Fife, and fined five shillings. In 1918 he was elected to the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] as Professor of Antiquities. 

He died three years after his wife, at the age of 91, and was survived by his son James MacLaren Ross, also an architect, and two daughters. He is buried in [[Comely Bank]] Cemetery in north [[Edinburgh]].

'''Magical feminism''' is a subgenre of the [[magical realism]] literary genre. The term was first used in 1987 by Patricia Hart to describe the works of [[Isabel Allende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackwell|first1=Frieda H.|title=Narrative Magic in the Fiction of Isabel Allende by Patricia Hart|journal=Letras Femeninas|volume=17|issue=1/2|pages=140–143|jstor=23022035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volkova, Ekaterina [https://www.academia.edu/4424017/Female_Voices_of_Magical_Realism "Female voices of magical realism"], Retrieved on 07 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent critical works on the subject feature such scholars as Ricci-James Adams or Kimberley Ann Wells. The term ''magical feminism'' refers to magical realism in a [[feminism|feminist]] discourse. Magical realism's basic assumption is the coexistence and effective merging of contradictory [[worldviews]], the scientific and rational with the spiritual and magical. It grants equal [[Ontology|ontological status]] to real figures and spirits, everyday occurrences and supernatural events. In its nature then is the subversion of monolithic cultural, social and political structures. It is a mode perfect for the writers who are ''in between'', especially the [[Post-colonialism|postcolonial]] ones.

Seen from the post-colonial perspective the magic and supernatural elements serve to disrupt reality giving voice to the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], the oppressed groups. In the case of magical feminism the role of The Other is assumed by the marginalized women.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ricci-James. [http://www.doubledialogues.com/archive/issue_six/adams.html "Magical Feminism: The Paradoxical Pain in Fefu and her Friends by Maria Irene Fornes and The Eisteddfod by Lally Katz",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019000019/http://www.doubledialogues.com/archive/issue_six/adams.html |date=2014-10-19 }} ''Anatomy and Poetics''.

Retrieved on 06 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The strategies of defamiliarization, supernaturalization, grotesque, intertextuality, are used to undermine the fossilized schemata and oppressive mechanisms of patriarchal domination and to create a space in which an independent version of identity and history can be manifested.

Magical feminism is popular among representatives of [[American literature#Minority literatures|ethnic literature of the United States]] who operate in a hybrid culture and a hybrid language. They are for example [[Ana Castillo]],&lt;ref&gt;"Ana Castillo." Poetry Foundation.

[[Kimberley Ann Wells]] claims that the most important feature of this genre is the presence of a female magic user, most commonly a witch or a shamaness, metaphorically representing the female protest against the male-dominated world order and an act of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Kimberley Ann (2002).

'''Master Mateo''' (c. 1150 - c. 1200 or c. 1217) was a sculptor and architect who worked in medieval Christian kingdoms of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the second half of the twelfth century.  He is best known now for the [[Glory's Portico|Pórtico de la Gloria]] of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]].  He was also responsible for the stone choir of the cathedral in 1200, later torn down in 1603. &lt;!-- by order of the archbishop and replaced by a wooden one--&gt;

The earliest information about Maestro Mateo is from an 1168 document in the archives of the cathedral of Santiago, which says that the Master was already working on the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]], for which he received a large sum of money from King [[Ferdinand II of León]].

Very little information remains about his early training, but everything seems to imply that he already had a long career behind him all along the [[Way of Santiago]], especially in the French sections.

[[File:Max Jakob Friedländer.jpg|thumb|Max Jakob Friedländer]]
'''Max Jakob Friedländer''' (5 July 1867 in [[Berlin]] – 11 October 1958 in [[Amsterdam]]) was a German curator and [[art historian]]. He was a specialist in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and the [[Northern Renaissance]], who volunteered at the ''Kupferstichkabinett'' or prints collection of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] in 1891 under [[Friedrich Lippmann]]. On Lippmann's recommendation, [[Wilhelm von Bode]] took him on as his assistant in 1896 for the paintings division. He was appointed deputy director under Bode in 1904 and became director himself from 1924 to 1932, working on his history ''From Van Eyck to Bruegel'' and the 14-volume (printed in 16, with supplements) survey ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]''. He also donated several works to the collection and worked in the art trade as an advisor, to [[Hermann Göring]] among others.  He moved to Amsterdam in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/friedlanderm.htm ''Dictionary of Art historians'': "Friedländer, Max J&amp;#91;acob&amp;#93;"]&lt;/ref&gt; He attained the rank and title of [[geheimrat]] (privy councillor) under the German Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Friedlander |first= Max J. |title= Reminiscences and Reflections |editor= Rudolf M. Heilbrunn |others= Translated from German by Ruth S. Magurn |location= London |publisher=Evelyn, Adams &amp; Mackay |year= 1969 |isbn= 0-238-78921-7 |pages= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedländer's approach to art history was essentially that of a [[connoisseur]]. He gave priority to a critical reading based on sensitivity rather than on grand artistic and or aesthetic theories. He described it as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;If the determination of the authorship of an individual work of art most certainly is not the ultimate and highest task of artistic erudition; even if it were no path to the goal: nevertheless, without a doubt, it is a school for the eye, since there is no formulation of a question which forces us to penetrate so deeply the essence of an individual work as that concerning the identity of the author. The individual work, rightly understood, teaches us what a comprehensive knowledge universal artistic activity is incapable of teaching us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedländer|first=Max Jakob|title=On art and connoisseurship|url=https://archive.org/stream/onartandconnoiss009325mbp/onartandconnoiss009325mbp_djvu.txt|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Photo archive==
During his lifetime he took high quality photographs of artwork wherever he travelled. His personal archive with approximately 15,000 photos and reproductions of 15th- and 16th-century paintings from the North and South Netherlands are often accompanied with notes including such things as the provenance, attribution, relative condition, and location of the paintings. The majority of his work has been transcribed and digitised in the RKDimages database of the Dutch National Institute of Art History ([[RKD]]) and forms an important open access archive for art historians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://website.rkd.nl/Projecten/Friedlnder-project/default_Friedlnder-project Max J.

'''''My Dog Skip''''' is a memoir by [[Willie Morris]] published by [[Random House]] in 1995.

[[File:My Dog Skip.jpeg|thumb|Cover of movie novelization]]
''My Dog Skip'' is the story  about nine-year-old Willie Morris growing up in [[Yazoo City, Mississippi]], a tale of a boy and his dog in a small, sleepy Southern town that teaches us about family, friendship, love, devotion, trust and bravery. Willie and Skip's relationship goes beyond that of owner and dog, but is a relationship recognized and celebrated by the entire town.

In 2000, the book was made into [[My Dog Skip (film)|a film of the same name]]. Although Skip was a [[Fox Terrier]], a number of [[Jack Russell terrier]]s were used in filming, two of which were [[Moose (dog actor)|Moose]], and Moose's son [[Enzo (dog actor)|Enzo]] who both portrayed Eddie on NBC's sitcom ''[[Frasier]]''.

The original dog in the book, Skip, was actually a Smooth Haired Fox Terrier, and not a Jack Russell portrayed in the movie.

'''Nancy Lee Gossels''' is a Jewish artist, editor and poet known for her sculpture and liturgical works. Gossels was named a Copley Artist in 1996 by the prestigious [[Copley Society of Art]]. She is also co-editor of the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book, ''[[Vetaher Libenu]]'', published in 1980.

==Personal life==
Born in [[Norwich, Connecticut]], Gossels was raised in [[Putnam, Connecticut]] by her parents, Benjamin and Sadie Tuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valedictorian Selected at Putnam School|newspaper=Putnam Patriot|date=ca. May 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a Bachelor of Arts degree (magna cum laude) from [[Pembroke College (Brown University)]]&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Nancy Tuber to Be Wed June 29|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 2, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was elected into the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Society.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;  In 1958, she married [[C. Peter R. Gossels]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gossels|first=C. Peter R.|title=Who's Who|year=2001|publisher=Marquis|pages=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have three children: Lisa R. Gossels, who was honored by the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2001 which awarded her an Emmy for her film, ''The Children of Chabannes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Children of Chabannes|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt020831|accessdate=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy D. Gossels, a casting director, film producer and teacher; and Daniel J. Gossels, an investment banker.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

==Artistic career==
Gossels worked at ''The Atlantic Monthly'' from 1956 to 1958.&lt;ref name="Harvard Alumni Report"&gt;{{cite book|title=Harvard Class of 1952: 10th Anniversary Report|year=1962|publisher=Harvard University|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gossels subsequently served as associate editor of ''Child Life Magazine'' from 1958 to 1960&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; and as a reporter and columnist for the ''Cochituate/Wayland/Weston Town Crier'' from 1962 to 1964.

Gossels began her artistic career as a painter, but over time found that her painting was becoming more and more sculptural. In 1986, Gossels and Brenda Zaltas exchanged ideas about designing outdoor sculptures from found metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Myrna Chandler|title=The Art of Menorot|newspaper=Home for the Holidays|date=November 12, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that the metal shapes reminded them of menorahs and embarked on a new career. Although they worked separately, they shared a vision and often showed their work together in art exhibits and galleries.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adair|first=Jeff|title=Artist's work getting national exposure|newspaper=The Sudbury Town Crier|date=February 21, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1980s, Gossels has received national attention for her unique "found metal" sculptures, both religious and non-religious, which "have been shown in museums, galleries and selected juried exhibitions" across the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier"/&gt; including the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]], [[Yeshiva University Museum]], the [[National Museum of American Jewish History]] in Philadelphia, Mizel Museum in Denver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlock|first=Marty|title=Hardware wears well with artwork of Gossels|newspaper=The Wayland-Weston Town Crier|date=December 22, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Flagler Museum]] in Palm Beach.&lt;ref name="Wayland Town Crier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Susan L.|title=Bringing Menorahs to Life|newspaper=The Wayland Town Crier|date=December 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the In the Spirit Studio / Gallery in [[New York City]] featured her aluminum and brass [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] titled, ''Brave New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the Spirit of Chanukah|newspaper=Newsday|date=November 20, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCalls featured Gossels' ''Reflections'', a [[Chanukah]] lamp with bronze mirror back, in its December 1990 article, "The Art of the Menorah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schiller|first=Phyllis|title=The Art of the Menorah|newspaper=McCalls|date=December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the General Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations, [[Combined Jewish Philanthropies]] included a gift shop that displayed "unique Jewish artworks from throughout the world," including Gossels' menorah works created from industrial metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivin|first=Marcia|title=Federation Meeting in Boston a Memorable Experience|newspaper=Jewish Reporter Metrowest|date=December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Gossels was named a "Copley Artist" by the [[Copley Society of Art]], the oldest art association in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copley Society of Art|url=http://www.copleysociety.org/about/artists/4775/610/nancy_lee_gossels_ca.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305065915/http://www.copleysociety.org/about/artists/4775/610/nancy_lee_gossels_ca.html|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to qualify for this honor, an artist must meet the demanding standards for membership in the society and must have his or her work accepted into five different juried shows produced by the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gossels selected as Copley Artist|newspaper=Wayland/Weston Town Crier|date=February 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossels received her art training at the DeCordova Museum School in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]]. She also took classes with Boston area artists Glenda Tall and George Dergalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adair|first=Jeff|title=Artist creates unique menorahs|newspaper=Wayland/Weston Town Crier|date=January 24, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her works are also represented in a growing number of private collections.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier" /&gt;

==Liturgical work==
In addition to her sculpture, Gossels is a poet. According to an interview in the ''Wayland Town Crier'', designing sculptural pieces made her realize "the connection between the written word and the visual piece."&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier" /&gt;

While serving as a member of the National Commission on Worship of the Jewish reform movement between 1976 and 1980 and as Vice President of [http://www.bethelsudbury.org Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley] in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]], Gossels composed and edited (with Joan S. Kaye and her husband, C. Peter R. Gossels) the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book for the Sabbath and Festivals, ''[[Vetaher Libenu]]'', which was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vetaher Libenu|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many innovations contained in ''Vetaher Libenu'', Nancy Lee Gossels and Joan S. Kaye revised the traditional Hebrew translation of "Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha’olam," or "Praised are You, Adonai our God, Ruler to the Universe," to "Holy One of Blessing, Your Presence Fills Creation." This invocation is now used by many Reform congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Lawrence A.|title=Blessings and Their Translations {{!}} Current Jewish Liturgies|journal=60 Worship 134| date=March 1986 |pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Sidney|title=Finding a Spiritual Home: How a New Generation of Jews Can Transform the American Synagogue|year=2000|publisher=Jossey-Bass|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This siddur, which has sold more than 10,000 copies worldwide, contains many liturgical poems written by Gossels (including her well-known poem, "Somewhere Out of Time"), which have been widely republished, translated into German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gebete von und für Frauen aus Geschichte und Gegenwart|year=2008|publisher=Catholic Archbishop of Munich, Germany|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; anthologized and included in the ''Singing the Living Tradition,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993|publisher=Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; hymnal of the [[Unitarian Universalism]] Association.

Gossels' poetry has also been included in the anthologies, ''Sarah's Daughters Sing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wenkart|first=Henriette|title=Sarah's Daughters Sing: A Sampler of Poems by Jewish Women|year=1990|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Esther erhebt ihre Stimme'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=Pnina Neve|title=Esther erhebt ihre Stimme|year=1993|publisher=Random House GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kol HaNeshamah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kol HaNeshamah|year=1994|publisher=The Reconstructionist Press|pages=781}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Celebrating the New Moon'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berrin|first=Susan|title=Celebrating the New Moon|year=1996|publisher=Jason Aronson, Inc.|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Torah: A Woman's Commentary,'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskenazi and Weiss|title=The Torah: A Woman's Commentary|year=2008|publisher=URJ Press|pages=1086}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Covenant of the Generations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Covenant of the Generations|year=2013|publisher=Women of Reform Judaism|pages=29, 34, 35 and 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', and ''Gates of Shabbat: A Guide for Observing Shabbat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=Gates of Shabbat: A Guide for Observing Shabbat|year=2016|publisher=CCAR Press|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossels served as the editor of ''Chadesh Yamenu'' (Renew Our Days), an egalitarian machzor for Rosh HaShanah, published in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=Chadesh Yamenu|year=1997|publisher=Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley|pages=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kanfay HaShachar'' (Wings of Dawn), a siddur for weekly morning worship published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kanfay Hashachar (Wings of Dawn)|publisher=Congregation Beth El, Sudbury River Valley|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Gossels co-edited ''Veha'er Eyneynu'' (Enlighten Our Eyes) with Michael Mirman, Harry Abadi and Sheila R. Deitchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Temple Shir Tikva|location=Wayland, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==
From 1976 to 1977, Gossels served as committee chair of the building committee for Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley. In this capacity, she oversaw the enlargement of the temple building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congregation Beth El of Sudbury Celebrates Completion of New Building|newspaper=Jewish Reporter|date=June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Gossels was honored by the Massachusetts Association of School Committees for her commitment to public education and her generosity of time, energy and support to enhance the educational opportunities of students at Wayland High School by creating and endowing the Gossels Fund for Academic Excellence and the Gossels Fund for Human Dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doyon|first=Elizabeth|title=Gossels Family Gives Back|url=http://waylandstudentpress.com/2009/06/15/gossels-family-gives-back/|newspaper=Wayland Student Press Network|date=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Midland Goods sign.jpg|thumb]]
The '''National Conservation Centre''', formerly the '''Midland Railway Goods Warehouse''', is located in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England.  It stands in a block surrounded by Victoria Street, Crosshall Street, Whitechapel, and Peter Street.  After it closed as a warehouse it was converted into a conservation centre for [[National Museums Liverpool]] in the 1990s.  Initially its exhibition area was open to the public, but this closed in 2010.  The centre is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].

==History==

The warehouse was built as a depot for the storage of railway freight in 1872 for the [[Midland Railway]].  It was designed by the local architect [[Culshaw and Sumners#Henry Sumners|Henry Sumners]] of [[Culshaw and Sumners]].&lt;ref name=sharp&gt;{{Citation| last = Sharples| first = Joseph| author-link = | contribution = William Culshaw (1807–74) and Henry Sumners (1825–95): rebuilding Victorian Liverpool | editor-last = Webster | editor-first = Christopher | title = The Practice of Architecture: eight architects, 1830–1930 | series = Spire Studies in Architectural History | volume = 2 | page =  67| publisher = Spire Books | place = Reading | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-904965-35-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was extended along Peter Street in 1878 in a similar architectural style.&lt;ref name=pev&gt;{{Citation | last = Sharples | first = Joseph| author-link = | last2 = Pollard| first2 = Richard| author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2004| title = Liverpool| edition = | volume = | series = Pevsner Architectural Guides| publication-place = New Haven and London| place = | publisher = Yale University Press| pages = | page = 190| format = | id = | isbn = 0-300-10258-5| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1995 and 1996 it was converted by another local architect, Ken Martin, into the Conservation Centre for National Museums Liverpool.&lt;ref name=pye&gt;{{Citation | last = Pye| first = Ken| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2011| title = Discover Liverpool|  publication-place = Liverpool| publisher = Trinity Mirror Media| pages = | page = 89|  isbn = 978-1-906802-90-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to its conservation work, the centre had an exhibition area open to the public to demonstrate the techniques of conservation, which attracted 60,000&amp;nbsp;visitors a year.  In September 2005 the centre closed for refurbishment, and re-opened in June 2006 as the National Conservation Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226:news-desk&amp;catid=1:news-desk&amp;Itemid=15| title = National Conservation Centre| accessdate = 13 September 2012| publisher = [[Institute of Conservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of government cuts in funding, the visitor centre closed in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mediacentre/displayrelease.aspx?id=917| | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017033104/http://liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mediacentre/displayrelease.aspx?id=917| archivedate = 17 October 2012 |title = Public access to Conservation Centre to close| accessdate = 29 August 2013 | publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but conservation work continues in the building.&lt;ref name=pye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = 10 December 2010| date = | year = | title = Liverpool conservation centre to close| edition = | volume = | series = |  publisher = [[BBC]]| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-11969862| accessdate =13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The centre is constructed in red brick on a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] stone [[plinth]], with stone dressings and bands, and some decoration in blue brick.  The exterior of the building is expressed as three or four storeys, and around the top of the building is a [[cornice]] with [[Glossary of architecture#modillion|modillions]].  The [[hip roof|hipped roof]] is in [[slate]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  On each of the four sides are arched openings large enough to admit freight.&lt;ref name=pev/&gt;  The front on Crosshall Street is concave; it is in eight [[bay (architecture)|bays]], each bay consisting of a tall blind arch containing windows, two of which also have arched entrances.&lt;ref name=sharp/&gt;&lt;ref name=pev/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  On the Victoria Street front are carved [[spandrel]]s containing shields and the names of stations of the Midland Railway.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  In 1921 Charles Reilly, Professor of Architecture at the [[University of Liverpool]], was of the opinion that at the time it was "one of the best buildings in the town".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Reilly | first = Charles | author-link = Charles Herbert Reilly|  publication-date = | date = | year = 1921| title = Some Liverpool Streets and Buildings in 1921| publisher = [[Liverpool Daily Post|Liverpool Daily Post and Mercury]] |  page = 28| oclc = 504795181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 14&amp;nbsp;March 1975, it was designated as a Grade&amp;nbsp;II listed building.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1062567|desc= Midland Railway Goods offices|accessdate=13 September 2012|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Officer and Laughing Girl''''', also known as '''''Officer and a Laughing Girl''''', '''''Officer With a Laughing Girl''''' or '''''De Soldaat en het Lachende Meisje''''', was painted by the Dutch artist [[Johannes Vermeer]] between 1655 and 1660. It was painted in [[oil on canvas]], typical of most Dutch artists of the time, and is 50.5 by 46&amp;nbsp;cm. It now resides in [[The Frick Collection]] in [[New York City|New York]].

''Officer and Laughing Girl'' includes many of the characteristics of Vermeer's style. The main subject is a woman in a yellow dress, light is coming from the left-hand side of the painting from an open window, and there is a large map on the wall. Each of these elements occur in some of his other paintings, although this painting differs slightly with the man also sitting at the table. Art historians, who have suggested conflicting interpretations of the work, believe that a painting by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] inspired the composition and that Vermeer used a [[camera obscura]] to create the perspective in this painting.

==Subject and interpretation==

The main subject is the woman, and soft, direct light falls on her face. She resembles Vermeer's wife, Catharina Bolnes, who is believed to have posed for many of his paintings. With x-ray photographs, art historians can see that Vermeer had planned to paint the woman with a large white collar which would have hidden much of her yellow dress.&lt;ref&gt;Essential Vermeer Website&lt;/ref&gt; Also, her cap was later extended to cover all of her hair, in order to draw attention to her face and expression. This yellow bodice with braiding has appeared in many of Vermeer's other portraits. It is called a schort and was usually worn as an everyday, common dress. The woman is also wearing a blue apron over her dress, but it is hidden in the shadows caused by the table. Blue aprons were common attire at that time because they hid stains well. Art historians have interpreted this to mean that the soldier surprised the girl with an impromptu visit during her morning chores.&lt;ref&gt;Essential Vermeer Website&lt;/ref&gt; The woman is holding a wine glass, usually used for white wine. Because at that time, wine cost more than beer, it illustrates her wealth.

The man in the painting is a cavalier wearing a red coat and an expensive hat, showing his wealth and rank. His hat is wide- brimmed and made of beaver pelt, which was weather resistant and good for snowy and rainy conditions. The pelts for these hats were imported from the New World. This hat was probably from [[New Netherlands]], which was then under the [[Dutch West India Company]]'s control.&lt;ref&gt;The Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer&lt;/ref&gt; The red in his uniform is associated with power and passion, bringing a passionate and emotional mood to the painting. His rank as an officer is identified by the black sash he wears. However, his presence in the immediate foreground is what the viewers notice first. His striking presence adds drama and mystery to the mood of the composition. This artistic device—in which an object is placed in the foreground to increase the depth of field of the overall painting—is called [[repoussoir]]. [[Caravaggio]] often used this technique and Vermeer probably learned it from a Caravaggist's painting.

The meaning of the interaction between the woman and the soldier is unknown. Many art historians believe that it only portrays a woman being innocently and honorably courted by this soldier. However, some have argued that her open hand and smile could be asking for payment before coitus.

"The Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer of Delft (1632-1675) holds a position of great honor among map historians. Several of his painting illustrate maps hanging on walls or globes standing on tables or cabinets. Vermeer painted these cartographical documents with such detail that it is often possible to identify the actual maps. Evidently, Vermeer was particularly attached to a [[Willem Blaeu]] - [[Balthasar Florisz van Berckenrode]] map of [[Holland]] and [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], as he represented it as a wall decoration in three of his paintings... Though no longer extant, the map's existence is known from archival sources and second edition published by Willem Blaeu in 1621, titled "Nova et Accurata Totius Hollandiae Westfriesiaeq. Topographia, Descriptore Balthazaro Florentio a Berke[n]rode Batavo". Vermeer must have had a copy at his disposal (or the earlier one published by Van Berckenrode). Around 1658 he showed it as a wall decoration in his painting "Officer and Laughing Girl", which depicts a soldier in a large hat sitting with his back to viewer, talking with a smiling girl who holds a glass in her hand. Bright sunlight bathes the girl and the large map on the wall. Vermeer's gift for realism is evidenced by the fact that the wall map, mounted on linen and wooden rods, is identifiable as Blaeu's 1621 map of Holland and West Friesland. He captures all of its characteristic design, decoration, and geographic content."&lt;ref&gt;van der Krogt, Peter. 1998. "Vermeer's Blaeu Period." ''Mercator's World''. Volume 3 (5) September/October 1998. Page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Window==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right
 | headerimage=[[File:Johannes Vermeer 023 detail 01.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rulvut1s9M Johannes Vermeer, ''Officer and Laughing Girl''], [[Frick Collection]],&lt;br&gt;1 min. 48 sec.&lt;ref name="frick"&gt;{{cite web | title =Johannes Vermeer, Officer and Laughing Girl | work = | publisher =[[Frick Collection]] | date = | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rulvut1s9M | accessdate =April 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The window and lighting is characteristic of Vermeer's interior paintings, most likely because it is modeled after the room he painted in. This window is extremely similar to the window in the ''Girl Reading a Letter'' and ''Open Window and the Milkmaid''. The glass in the window has many variations of color, showing Vermeer's precision in the details of this painting. Only bright light comes in from the window and no outside scene can be observed, as Vermeer never allows the viewer to see the outside world.

==Camera obscura==
Art historians believe that Vermeer used a device called a [[camera obscura]] to help him create the perspective in his painting.&lt;ref&gt;The World of Vermeer: 1632- 1675&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using a mathematical formula or a [[vanishing point]], Vermeer probably used this mechanical device to show him what the relative size of the people should be. A camera obscura is similar to a camera as it projects an image seen through the aperture into a dark chamber. There is no historical evidence that Vermeer used such a device but the way he portrays perspective in many of his paintings, including ''Officer and Laughing Girl'', suggests that he did.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3365">{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodern theatre''' is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[philosophy]] that originated in Europe in the middle of the twentieth century. Postmodern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most postmodern productions are centered on highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, postmodern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.

==Postmodern techniques==
A postmodern theatrical production might make use of some or all of the following techniques:

# The accepted norms of seeing and representing the world are challenged and disregarded, while experimental theatrical perceptions and representations are created.
# A [[pastiche]] of different textualities and [[Media (arts)|media]] forms are used, including the simultaneous use of multiple [[art]] or media forms, and there is the 'theft' of a heterogeneous group of artistic forms.
# The narrative needs not be complete but can be broken, [[paradox]]ical and imagistic. There is a movement away from linearity to multiplicity (to inter-related webs of stories), where acts and scenes give way to a series of peripatetic dramatic moments.
# Characters are fragmented, forming a collection of contrasting and parallel shards stemming from a central idea, theme or traditional character.
# Each new performance of a theatrical pieces is a new [[wiktionary:Gestalt|Gestalt]], a unique spectacle, with no intent on methodically repeating a play.
# The audience is integral to the shared [[meaning-making]] of the performance process and its members are included in the dialogue of the play.
# There is a rejection of the notions of "High" and "Low" art. The production exists only in the viewer's mind as what the viewer interprets - nothing more and nothing less.
# The rehearsal process in a theatrical production is driven more by shared meaning-making and improvisation, rather than the scripted text.
# The play steps back from reality to create its own self-conscious atmosphere. This is sometimes referred to as [[metatheatre]].

While these techniques are often found in postmodern productions they are never part of a centralised movement or style.  Rather, they are tools for authentic introspection, questioning and representation of human experience.

The '''Prince of Wales Theatre''' is a West End theatre in [[Coventry Street]], near [[Leicester Square]] in London. It was established in 1884 and rebuilt in 1937, and extensively refurbished in 2004 by Sir [[Cameron Mackintosh]], its current owner. The theatre should not be confused with the former [[Scala Theatre]] in London that was known as the ''Prince of Wales Royal Theatre'' or ''Prince of Wales's Theatre'' from 1865 until its demolition in 1903.

==History==

===Phipps' theatre===
The first theatre on the site opened in January 1884 when [[Charles J. Phipps|C.J. Phipps]] built the '''Prince's Theatre''' for actor-manager Edgar Bruce.  It was a traditional three-tier theatre, seating just over 1,000 people.  The theatre was renamed the "Prince of Wales Theatre" in 1886 after the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]].  Located between [[Piccadilly Circus]] and [[Leicester Square]], the theatre was favourably situated to attract theatregoers.

[[Image:Robert Baddeley as Moses in Sheridan's 'The School for Scandal' c1781, by Johann Zoffany.jpg|left|thumb|upright 1.0|''[[The School for Scandal]]'']]The first production in the theatre was an 1884 revival of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' starring [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], preceded by a one-act comedy, ''In Honour Bound''.  This was soon followed by a free adaptation of [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'', called ''Breaking a Butterfly''.  In 1885, [[Lillie Langtry]], reputedly the first "society" lady to become an actress, played in ''Princess George'' and ''[[The School for Scandal]]''.  The first hit production at the theatre was the record-breaking [[comic opera]], ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'', starring [[Marie Tempest]], which was so successful that its authors used the profits to build the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], where it moved in 1888.  The wordless mime play ''L'Enfant Prodigue'' premiered in 1891 which, together with ''A Pierrot's Life'' in 1897, brought respectability to mime troupes in Britain.

[[George Edwardes]]' musical play, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'', often considered the first English [[musical theatre|musical comedy]], was presented at the theatre in 1892 and was followed by Edwardes' even more successful ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' in 1893.  In 1895, [[Basil Hood]]'s ''[[Gentleman Joe]], the Hansom Cabby'' began a long run starring the low comedian, [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]], in the title role.  The theatre then began to present straight plays with [[Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (play)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1898, with [[Pelléas et Mélisande (Fauré)|incidental music by Fauré]]) and Wills's adaptation of [[Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' as ''The Only Way'' (1899, also starring Harvey).  [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]] starred in the successful ''A Message from Mars'' (1901).  In 1900–01, Marie Tempest played the title roles in the play ''English Nell'' (based on Simon Dale's novel about [[Nell Gwynn]]), ''Peg Woffington'', a dramatisation of [[Charles Reade]]'s novel, as well as Becky Sharp in a dramatisation of [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'s ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]''.

[[Image:Cover of the Vocal Score of Sidney Jones' King of Cadonia.jpg|thumb|upright 1.0]]
The theatre played more musical comedies beginning in 1903, including the [[Frank Curzon]] and [[Isabel Jay]] hits ''[[Miss Hook of Holland]]'' (1907, its matinee version, ''Little Miss Hook of Holland'' was performed by children for children), ''[[King of Cadonia]]'' (1908), and ''[[The Balkan Princess]]'' (1910), and later the [[World War I]] hits, ''Broadway Jones'' (1914), ''Carminetta'' (1917), and ''[[Yes, Uncle!]]'' (1917).

The theatre then hosted plays such as [[Avery Hopwood]]'s farce ''Fair and Warmer'' (1918) and [[Ivor Novello]]'s ''The Rat'' (1924, Novello's first play, in which he also starred), and [[revue]]s including ''A to Z'' (1921), ''Co-Optimists'' (1923), and ''Charlot's Revue'' (1924).  They starred [[Gertrude Lawrence]], [[Jack Buchanan]], [[Beatrice Lillie]], [[Stanley Holloway]], and [[Jessie Matthews]]. Ms Matthews also starred, along with Richard Hearne, in "Wild Rose", featuring the memorable Jerome Kern song "[[Look for the Silver Lining]]". These were followed by ''The Blue Train'' (1927), ''Alibi'' (1928, directed by [[Gerald du Maurier]] with [[Charles Laughton]] as [[Hercule Poirot]]), ''By Candlelight'' (1928), and ''Journey's End'' (1929).  In 1930, [[Edith Evans]] became the manager at the theatre, presenting and starring in ''Delilah'', which was not a success.  Beginning in 1932, the theatre presented a series of risqué "Folies"-style revues, including ''Voila! Les Dames'' (1935) and its last production, ''Encore les Dames'' (1937).  These shows were so successful that they funded the rapid rebuilding of the theatre in 1937.

===Cromie's theatre===
[[Image:GracieFieldsStageDoorCanteen.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Gracie Fields]]]]
After 50 years, the theatre's 800 seats were deemed insufficient for productions of the day, and it was demolished.  On 17 June 1937, [[Gracie Fields]] sang to the workmen as she laid the foundation stone of the new [[Art Deco]]-decorated theatre, designed by Robert Cromie, and the theatre opened on 27 October that year.  The new theatre's seating capacity was about 1,100, and it had a larger stage and improved facilities for both the artists and the public, including a large, stylish stalls bar (the bar itself was 14 metres long), complete with dance floor.  The first productions at the new theatre were ''Les Folies de Paris et Londres'', starring [[George Robey]], followed by ''Folies De Can-Can'' in 1938, a continuation of the old theatre's series of successful risqué revues, which ran continuously until 2&amp;nbsp;am every night.  The musical comedy, ''Present Arms'', was offered in 1940, and in 1941 the theatre screened the UK premiere of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Great Dictator]]''. The film had been banned in many parts of Europe, and the theatre's owner, Alfred Esdaile, was fined for showing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Prince of Wales Theatre|title= Theatre Programme, Mama Mia!|place = London (2007)|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, ''Strike a New Note'' was notable for [[Sid Field]]'s London debut, and he returned to the theatre in ''Strike it Again'' (1944), and yet again in ''Piccadilly Hayride'' (1946, a revue that ran for 778 performances).&lt;ref&gt;Many sketches and reviews from these shows appeared in the first British TechniColour film, ''London Town'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', [[Mary Coyle Chase]]'s comedy about an imaginary rabbit, was a success, as was ''Diamond Lil'' in 1948 starring [[Mae West]].  In the 1950s, the theatre hosted variety and revues, starring such famous performers as [[Norman Wisdom]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Benny Hill]], [[Hughie Green]], [[Frankie Howerd]], and [[Morecambe and Wise]].  In 1959, [[Paul Osborn]]'s ''The World of Susie Wong'' became the theatre's longest-running play to date with 832 performances. On 4 November 1963, [[The Beatles]] performed [[From Me to You]], [[She Loves You]], [[Till There Was You]], and [[Twist and Shout]] at the Prince of Wales Theatre, during the [[Royal Variety Show]] in the presence of [[The Queen Mother]].

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Aspects of love logo.png|right]]  --&gt;[[Neil Simon]]'s play, ''[[Come Blow Your Horn]]'', starring [[Michael Crawford]], played in 1962, followed by a season of [[Martha Graham]]'s dance company, including the world première of her ballet ''Circe''.  Next was a string of Broadway musicals, including ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'' in 1966 with [[Barbra Streisand]], ''[[Sweet Charity]]'' (1967), and ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'' (1969).  ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was revived in 1972.  In 1976, [[Bernard Slade]]'s ''[[Same Time, Next Year (play)|Same Time, Next Year]]'' was a hit, as was ''[[I Love My Wife]]'' (1977), and ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1978).  In 1982, ''Underneath the Arches'' was a long-running hit.  [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Aspects of Love]]'' (1989) smashed all previous box-office records at the theatre, running for 1,325 performances.  More recent productions are listed below.

Refurbishment was carried out in 2004 to increase the [[seating capacity]] slightly to 1,160 seats and to modernise the theatre's facilities.  New bars were added, the auditorium completely rebuilt, the backstage areas refurbished and the theatre's famous tower and exterior completely gutted and refurbished with new LED lighting and a crisp modern finish.

The theatre re-opened with [[ABBA]]'s musical ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' on 16 April 2004.  On 18 August 2007, ''Mamma Mia!'' became the longest-running show ever at the Prince of Wales, overtaking the previous record held by ''Aspects of Love'' with 1,326 performances at the venue and counting.  The production marked another landmark on Thursday 23 August 2007, celebrating its 3,500th performance since its 1999 world premiere at the [[Prince Edward Theatre]] in Old Compton Street, London.  The production left the theatre on 1 September 2012 and transferred to the Novello Theatre on 6 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://westend.broadwayworld.com/article/West-End-MAMMA-MIA-Will-Move-to-the-Novello-Theatre-20111013 West End's MAMMA MIA! Will Move to the Novello Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was [[listed building|grade II listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=473926 English Heritage listing details]. Retrieved 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shirley Armitage''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Played by Lisa Lewis, the character appeared for a period of six years between 1983 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourne|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Bourne (writer)|title=Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-7898-0|pages=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYaryaqLfd4C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=%22Shirley+Armitage%22+%2B%22Coronation+Street%22+-%22wiki%22+-%22wikipedia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t-bBTq_SAan50gHGnPTXBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shirley%20Armitage%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shirley became the programme's first regular black character.

Shirley Armitage was a machinist at Baldwin's Casuals. From 1988 to 1989, she lived with [[Curly Watts]] in the shop flat but left the area when they split up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frey-Vor|first=Gerlinde|title=Coronation Street: infinite drama and British reality: an analysis of soap opera as narrative and dramatic continuum|year=1991|publisher=Wissenschaftlicher Verlag Trier,|location=Trier, Germany|isbn=3-922031-59-5|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=t-bBTq_SAan50gHGnPTXBA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=1iwbAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Shirley+Armitage%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Shirley Armitage started work at denim factory Baldwin's Casuals in September 1983. Shirley came from a big family, with nine living in the same house. At the factory, Shirley was one of the youngest machinists and usually stayed quiet while the louder personalities, chiefly [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]) and [[Ida Clough]] ([[Helene Palmer]]), led the gossip. She occasionally spoke up to back the girls against [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]), for example when she favoured a strike when Mike announced that some of the staffs' jobs would be at risk because of a new computer system at the factory in July 1984.

In 1985, Shirley chatted to [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]) at a dance at the Community Centre and let him walk her home afterwards. Curly was shy about asking her out but they hit it off and Curly later chatted her up at [[Kevin Webster|Kevin]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) and [[Sally Webster]]'s ([[Sally Dynevor]]) flatwarming party in August 1987. They started seeing each other on a casual basis after that. By 1986, Shirley was getting sick of living in such a crowded home and decided to ask [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) if she could rent the shop flat as the Websters had moved into No.13. Alf asked for a reference but in the time it took her to get one from [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]), Curly also made enquiries about the flat and Alf agreed he could move in. When Shirley and Curly compared notes, they were puzzled as Curly hadn't been asked for a reference. Thinking Alf racist, Curly decided to refuse the flat but Shirley suggested they move in together. Curly agreed and Alf backed down when Emily threatened to tell people about his racism. The unexpected move marked a big change in Shirley's and Curly's lives, as well as their relationship, with Shirley becoming the first woman Curly had ever slept with. Their next obstacle was winning over each other's families, no easy task as despite the race issue, Shirley's parents disapproved of her living in sin. Eventually, Mrs Armitage was convinced that Curly loved Shirley but his parents never accepted Shirley. Mrs Armitage was accepting enough to let Shirley's younger sister, Lucy, stay with the couple for a few weeks in August.

Later that year, Curly enrolled in a business studies course at college. Shirley wasn't convinced it would be a good move as that would make Shirley the sole earner while he studied but she admired his ability and caused a stir at work by showing them Curly's essay on Mike making the machinists work in terrible Victorian conditions. Mike insisted Curly give it to him, threatening to sack Shirley otherwise. Curly's new career was to split the couple up. In April 1989, Shirley threw a surprise party to celebrate their first anniversary but Curly promptly threw everyone out as he had an important exam the next day. Shirley realised that Curly was too serious for her and decided to move back in with her parents. Desperate to stop Shirley leaving, Curly broke down and proposed marriage, promising to change, but Shirley knew that the relationship had run its course and left.

Shirley left Baldwin's Casuals, a week after splitting up with Curly and moved to Gorton.

The '''Teatro Comunale Ponchielli''', as it has been known since 1986,&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;Lynn, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[opera house]] located in [[Cremona]], [[Italy]]. For more than 250 years it has been that city's primary venue for opera and other theatrical presentations. 

The original theatre, built in 1747, was named the '''Teatro Nazari''', but it was renamed as    the '''Teatro della Società''' in 1785. It was sometimes referred to as the '''Nobile Associazione'''. After the original theatre burned down in 1806, construction began on the present theatre soon after. The current theatre was designed by [[Luigi Canonica]] and it opened in 1808 under the name the '''Teatro della Concordia'''. Its name was changed again to the '''Teatro Ponchielli''' in 1907 after the famous native of Cremona, [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]. 

In 1986 the theatre was purchased by the city of Cremona&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt; which renamed it once again as it is known today. The opening performance took place on 4 October and featured performances on the city-owned [[Stradivarius]] "Il Cremonese" and [[Guarneri]] "del Gesu" violins of 1715 and 1734 respectively.&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt;

With its original horseshoe-shaped auditorium, the theatre was remodeled in 1989 to create three box tiers and two galleries with a total of 1,249 seats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5544">In the [[visual arts]], '''texture''' is the perceived surface quality of a [[work of art]]. It is an element of [[two-dimensional]] and [[three-dimensional]] designs and is distinguished by its perceived visual and physical properties. Use of ''texture'', along with other elements of design, can convey a variety of messages and emotions.

==Three varieties of texture==
==Physical texture==
[[File:Surfaces bumpy walkway between sidewalk and street closeup view.JPG|thumb|The bumpy texture of [[tactile paving]].]]

The physical texture (also known as ''actual texture'' or ''tactile texture'') are the patterns of variations upon a solid surface. This can include -but is not limited to- [[fur]], wood grain, [[sand]], smooth surface of canvas or metal, glass, and [[leather]]. 

Physical texture differentiates itself from visual texture by having a ''physical quality'' that can be felt by touching the surface of the texture. Specific use of a texture can affect the smoothness that an artwork conveys. For instance, use of ''rough surfaces'' can be visually active, whilst ''smooth surfaces'' can be visually restful. The use of both can give a sense of personality to a design, or utilized to create emphasis, rhythm, contrast, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring Visual Design: The Elements and Principles| author = Gatto | pages = 122–123}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Light is an important factor for identifying the physical texture because it can affect how a surface is being viewed. Strong lights on a smooth surface can obscure the readability of a drawing or [[photograph]], whilst they can create strong contrasts in a highly textural surface such as river rocks, sand, etc.

==Visual texture==
Visual texture or implied texture is the illusion of having physical texture. Every material and every support surface has its own visual texture and needs to be taken into consideration before creating a composition. As such, materials such as canvas and watercolour paper are considerably rougher than, for example, photo-quality computer paper and may not be best suited to creating a flat, smooth texture. Photography, drawings and paintings use visual texture both to portray their own subject matter realistically and with interpretation. Texture in these media is generally created by the repetition of the shape and line.

=== Decorative texture ===
Decorative texture "decorates a surface". Texture is added to embellish the surface either that usually contains some uniformity. 

=== Spontaneous texture ===
This focuses more on the process of the visual creation; the marks of texture made also creates the shapes. These are often "accidental" forms that create texture.

=== Mechanical texture ===
Texture created by special mechanical means. An example of this would be photography; the grains and/or screen pattern that is often found in printing creates texture on the surface.  This is also exemplified by designs in typography and computer graphics. 

==Hypertexture==
Hypertexture can be defined as both the "realistic simulated surface texture produced by adding small distortions across the surface of an object"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/HYPERTEXTURE |title=What does HYPERTEXTURE mean? |publisher=Definitions.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as pioneered by [[Ken Perlin]]) and as an avenue for describing the fluid morphic nature of texture in the realm of cyber graphics and the tranversally responsive works created in the field of visual arts therein (as described by [[Lee Klein]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tribes.org/web/tag/hypertexture/ |title=Hypertexture &amp;#124; A Gathering of the Tribes |publisher=Tribes.org |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the film's depiction of working women to be genuine but overall did not think highly of the film:
{{cquote |''The 24-Hour Woman,'' in which a woman with a high-powered job tries to cope with the high-powered hassles of balancing career and family. But somebody on the other side of the camera has clearly been here and done this, and boy, does it show on screen... It would be nice to report that Ms. Savoca, whose ''True Love'' belongs high on any list of films rich in womanly wisdom and whose ''Household Saints'' and ''Dogfight'' were no less fearless, had made the most of such a golden opportunity to hit a nerve. But ''The 24-Hour Woman'' is an unexpectedly strained farce, and not often a very credible one at that. With the notable exception of a long, classic comedy-of-errors sequence about a working mother racing to her child's first birthday party, the film is otherwise a homey compendium of feminist talking points laced with awkward satire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9D00E4D81E39F93AA15752C0A96F958260 New York Times review - requires subscription]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

However, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' enjoyed the film and rated it 3 stars out of his 4 star rating system and overall thought it was a pleasant experience:
{{cquote |''The 24 Hour Woman'' is a message picture wrapped inside a screwball comedy, with a touch of satire aimed at TV talk shows. It doesn't all work, but it happens so fast we don't get stuck in the awkward parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990219/REVIEWS/902190301/1023 |title=The 24 Hour Woman :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 19 February 1999|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The Jaywalks''' (formerly known as 'Who's Ya Daddy') were an [[Indie music|indie]] [[Rock music|rock]] Australian band. In 2004, they were recognized by [[Guinness World Records]] for being the youngest group of musicians banned from commercial radio airplay for their song "I Like Fat Chicks". It was banned on 23 December 2004 by [[ZZZ FM]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenday, C. [Ed.] (2007) Guinness World Records 2007, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann, M.
