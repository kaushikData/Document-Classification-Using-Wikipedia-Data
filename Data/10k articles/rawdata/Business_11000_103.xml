'''461 Fifth Avenue''' at 40th street is a 28-story [[skyscraper]] located in the [[Grand Central Terminal]] area of the [[Midtown Manhattan]] section of [[New York City]]. The building was constructed in 1988 by the [[Mitsui Fudosan]] development group and designed by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]].&lt;ref name='SSM'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=51412 |title=461 Fifth Avenue |accessdate=2009-06-20 |year=2009 |work=skyscraperpage.com |publisher=Skyscraper Source Media Inc | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090629074143/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=51412| archivedate= 29 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The 461 Fifth Avenue building is noted for its use of modern materials, creating a stone-finish look, as well as its base-setback that is the same height as older buildings in the neighborhood. The building is also noted [[architecturally]] for its combination of a 10-story 19th-century base, which mirrors nearby older buildings, and an 18-story [[post-modern architecture|post-modern]] tower.&lt;ref name='NYA'/&gt;&lt;ref name='SL'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slgreen.com/properties/view/461-fifth-avenue |title=461 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NY |accessdate=2009-06-20 |year=2009 |publisher=SL Green Realty Corp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628163751/http://slgreen.com/properties/view/461-fifth-avenue |archivedate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior uses a [[pre-cast concrete]] finish to mimic the appearance of limestone and has a copper [[mansard]] roof similar to other buildings in the area.&lt;ref name='MB'/&gt;&lt;ref name='W'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://461fifthavenue.info/main.cfm?sid=introduction&amp;pid=about |title=About 461 Fifth Avenue |accessdate=2009-06-20 |year=2009 |publisher=Red Hand, L.L.C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628165133/http://461fifthavenue.info/main.cfm?sid=introduction&amp;pid=about |archivedate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''57th Street''' is a [[metro station|station]] on the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]] of the [[New York City Subway]]. Located at the intersection of [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas) in [[Manhattan]], it is temporarily closed for renovations until December 2018. Under normal service patterns, it is served by the '''[[F (New York City Subway service)|F]]''' train at all times. North of the station, the line turns east and becomes the [[IND 63rd Street Line]].

First announced in 1962, the 57th Street station was opened on July 1, 1968, at the cost of $13.2 million. The station was a terminal station until 1989, after which all service was extended to [[21st Street–Queensbridge (IND 63rd Street Line)|21st Street–Queensbridge]]. The station was temporarily served by [[S (New York City Subway service)|shuttle trains]] in the 1990s during the [[63rd Street Lines|63rd Street Line's]] reconstruction. In July 2018, the station was closed for an extensive five-month renovation.

The station was built as part of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]], which expanded train capacity on the Sixth Avenue Line. The Sixth Avenue extension to the new terminal at 57th Street was announced in 1962.&lt;ref name="Raskin-RoutesNotTaken-2013"&gt;{{Cite Routes Not Taken}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the contract to construct the IND Sixth Avenue Line between 52nd and 58th Streets, including the 57th Street station, was awarded to Slattery Construction Company for $7.5 million ({{Inflation|index=US|value=7500000|start_year=1962|r=-5|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/12/27/archives/ind-contract-awarded.html|title=IND Contract Awarded|date=December 27, 1963|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 18, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the spur ultimately cost $13.2 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/27/archives/luncheon-in-subway-opens-station.html|title=Luncheon in Subway Opens Station|date=June 27, 1968|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 18, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once all construction work was completed on the 63rd Street Connector to the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] in December 2001, the tower was permanently abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=http://www.subwaynut.com/ind/57f/57f13.jpg|title=At one end of the platform is an unused tower|date=May 20, 2010|last=Cox|first=Jeremiah|type=image|language=|via=The Subway Nut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aart Koopmans''' (12 October 1946 – 15 January 2007) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] business man, president of the Dutch winter [[speed skating]] marathon organisation and founder of the [[Elfstedentocht|Alternative Elfstedentocht]]. His father, [[Bram Koopmans]] was the organiser for the [[Amstel Gold Race]] in [[road bicycle racing]] for many years.

Koopmans, born in [[Amsterdam]], organised his first Alternative Elfstedentocht in 1975 in [[Finland]] due to the winters in the Netherlands being too warm to skate 200&amp;nbsp;km in open air on ice. In later years, the Alternative Elfstedentochten were organised in various countries like [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Japan]]. In 2007 the first Alternative Elfstedentocht in [[Mongolia]] will be held.

The Austrian editions became the most popular through the years as thousands of Dutch people travel to the [[Weissensee (Carinthia)|Weissensee]] each year to compete each other in several speed skating marathons in various distances, with the 200&amp;nbsp;km Open Dutch National Championships being the main and most prestigious event. Until 2006 this gave the local authorities a profit of 36 million [[euro]]s. As a result, Koopmans and co-organiser [[Leo van Hees]] (who died in 2002) were awarded with the Austrian Cross of Honour.

Since 2006 he resided in [[Portugal]]. He was scheduled to retire from his position as Alternative Elfstedentocht organiser in 2011, but was taken to a [[Coimbra]] hospital in November 2006. He suffered from bacterial infections and [[pneumonia]], which resulted in his death on 15 January 2007.

The already scheduled Alternative Elfstedentocht of 2007 and the other scheduled races in the same period will go through, but in memorial of Aart Koopmans.

'''Dale Allison Graham''' (born October 6, 1951&lt;ref name="parlg"&gt;''Canadian Parliamentary Guide, 1997'', Kathryn O'Handley {{ISBN|1-896413-43-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a former [[politician]] in [[New Brunswick]], Canada.  He served as an [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|MLA]] from 1993 to 2014, as Speaker of the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] from 2010 to 2014, and as a member of the [[Executive Council of New Brunswick|provincial cabinet]] from 1999 to 2006.

Born in [[Woodstock, New Brunswick|Woodstock]], [[New Brunswick]], the son of Robert Graham and Letha Delong,&lt;ref name="parlg"/&gt; Graham attended school in [[Centreville, New Brunswick|Centreville]]. He became a small business owner and was involved in local politics at the [[school board]] level. He married Shelley McDougall in 1972.&lt;ref name="parlg"/&gt; In the [[New Brunswick general election, 1991|1991 provincial election]], Graham was defeated by [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal]] incumbent [[Fred Harvey (politician)|Fred Harvey]], however Harvey's victory was later declared void when Harvey was convicted of violating election spending laws.  Graham was successful in a [[by-election]] in 1993 winning the [[Carleton North]] seat.  Graham went on to be re-elected in the new [[electoral district]] of [[Carleton (1995-2014 New Brunswick provincial electoral district)|Carleton]] in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1995|1995]], [[New Brunswick general election, 1999|1999]], [[New Brunswick general election, 2003|2003]], [[New Brunswick general election, 2006|2006]] and [[New Brunswick general election, 2010|2010]] [[List of New Brunswick general elections (post-Confederation)|elections]].

Graham's 1993 victory was a key test for his [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick]].  His party had been defeated provincially in [[New Brunswick general election, 1987|1987]] going from having led the government for 17 years to being shut out of the legislature.  Though the party regained 3 seats in the 58 seat legislature in 1991, the upstart [[Confederation of Regions Party of New Brunswick]] (CoR) had won 8 seats and claimed [[official opposition]].  Graham's victory was seen as a sign that CoR would not necessarily displace the Progressive Conservatives as the voice of [[conservatism]] in [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] New Brunswick.

In 1999, Graham's party was returned to government. Graham, who co-chaired the election campaign, was named [[deputy premier]] and [[Department of Supply and Services (New Brunswick)|Minister of Supply and Services]]. On July 21, 2005, Graham added the responsibilities of [[Department of Environment and Local Government (New Brunswick)|Minister of Environment &amp; Local Government]] on an acting basis when his cabinet colleague [[Brenda Fowlie]] was forced to resign from the cabinet.  He retained the portfolio until November 21, 2005.

In a [[cabinet shuffle]] on February 14, 2006, Graham was shuffled to the post of minister responsible for the [[Office of Human Resources (New Brunswick)|Office of Human Resources]] and for [[Service New Brunswick]]. He retained his honorary post of deputy premier.

His party failed to win a plurality of seats in the 2006 election so Graham left cabinet and returned to opposition.  He was re-elected in 2010 and his party returned to government, and he became [[Father of the House|dean of the legislature]]; he was excluded from cabinet but was elected to serve as speaker of the legislature.  He did not seek re-election in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">'''Earnings''' are the net benefits of a [[corporation]]'s operation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Eccles, Robert H. Herz, E. Mary Keegan, David M. H. Phillips: The Value Reporting Revolution: Moving Beyond the Earnings Game; Price-Waterhouse-Coopers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earnings is also the amount on which corporate [[tax]] is due.  For an analysis of specific aspects of corporate operations several more specific terms are used as [[Earnings before interest and taxes|EBIT]] -- earnings before interest and taxes, [[EBITDA]]  - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

Many alternative terms for earnings are in common use, such as [[income]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. These terms in turn have a variety of definitions, depending on their context and the objectives of the authors. For instance, the [[IRS]] uses the term profit to describe earnings, whereas for the corporation the profit it [[form 10-K|report]]s is the amount left after [[tax]]es are taken out.  Many economic discussions use principles derived from [[Karl Marx]] &lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: Das Kapital, Kritik der Politischen Oekonmie; 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith: The Wealth of Nations; 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the rise of the importance of [[intellectual capital]] &lt;ref&gt;Gordon Smith and Russell Parr: Intellectual Property, 4th edition; Wiley 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; affects such analyses.

==Routine earnings==
Routine earnings or [[commodity]]-based earnings are those that can be achieved by application of assets that are those that can be achieved by any business that employs sufficient [[capital (economics)|capital]] and manpower. These conditions are commonly assumed in economic analyses of [[profit (economics)]]

==Non-routine earnings==
The use of [[intellectual property]] generates non-routine profits. Those are often an order-of-magnitude greater than routine earnings.&lt;ref&gt;John Hand and Baruch Lev (editors): Intangible Assets, Values, Measures. and Risks; Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-routine profits are essential to warrant the high [[investment]]s needed for [[high-technology]] industries.

== Earnings manipulation ==
Some statistical models (e.g. based on [[Benford's law]] or [[Beneish M-Score]]) are used in order to detect possible earnings manipulations (fraud).

'''Electronics  technicians''' help design, develop, test, manufacture, install, and repair electrical and [[electronic equipment]] such as communication equipment, medical monitoring devices, navigational equipment, and [[computers]]. They may be employed in product evaluation and testing, using measuring and diagnostic devices to adjust, test, and repair equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/standards/IORs/gs0800/0856.htm |title=Electronics Technical Series |publisher=Opm.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronics technicians may also work as sales workers or field representatives for manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers giving advice on the installation, operation, and maintenance of complex equipment and may write specifications and technical manuals.  Electronics technicians represent over 33% of all engineering technicians in the U.S. In 2009, there were over 160,000 electronics technicians employed in the U.S.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos112.htm |title=Architecture and Engineering Occupations : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronics technicians are accredited by organizations such as the [[Electronics Technicians Association]] (ETA), or International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET).

==Education and training==
Most employers prefer to hire electronics technicians with an associate degree or other post-secondary training in [[engineering technology]]. Training is available at [[technical institute]]s, at [[community colleges]], at extension divisions of colleges and [[universities]], at public and private vocational-technical schools, and in the [[Armed Forces]].   Naval electronics technicians are the largest group of engineering technicians in the military (see [[Electronics Technician (US Navy)]]). Many 2-year associate degree programs accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) include at least college algebra and trigonometry and one or two basic science courses. Depending on the specialty, more math or science may be required. About 200 ABET-accredited programs are offered in engineering technology specialities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; ABET-accredited electronics technician programs usually require at least two mathematics courses and two physics courses in addition to the core competencies.

Electronics technician curriculum generally consists of courses in basic electricity and electronics, including [[Ohm's Law]], Parallel and Series Circuits, [[Magnetism]], AC/DC Circuits, [[Capacitance]], [[Inductance]], [[Transformer]]s, [[Resonance]], [[Filter (signal processing)|Filters]], [[Semiconductors]], [[Transistors]], [[Amplifiers]], [[Integrated Circuits]] and [[Digital electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED396157&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED396157 |title=Raising the Standard. Electronics Technician Skills for Today and Tomorrow |publisher=Eric.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to vocational learning outcomes associated with the study of electronics and control systems, graduates of electronics technician programs are also expected to have essential employability skills and meet certain general education learning outcomes. Individual schools largely determine the specific program structure, delivery methods, and other curriculum components to be used to assist students in achieving the required program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185126/http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/college/progstan/techno/55203e.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant component of course material includes laboratory experimentation. These lab courses and projects often represent up to 50% of the course material and are used to reinforce theoretical concepts associated with the study of electronics. Schools offering electronics technician programs will have electronics laboratories to support the delivery of course curriculum. Historically, these laboratories have been traditional "hands on" learning environments, although in recent years the trend is moving towards [[electronics simulation]] software such as [[Multisim]] and [[CircuitLogix]].  Electronics software simulation is also used in conjunction with traditional labs to provide greater opportunities for students to complete laboratory projects as part of their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courseweb.xu.edu.ph/courses/files/Electronics%20Workbench%20News%20No_%208.htm |title=Electronics Workbench News No. 8 |publisher=Courseweb.xu.edu.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career prospects==
The demand for jobs in the electronics engineering and service fields is the result of a recent proliferation of both consumer and industrial electronics products.  The design, installation, servicing and maintenance of this equipment has created significant employment opportunities in the electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/eng/ojf/pdf/2242_e.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119155558/http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/eng/ojf/pdf/2242_e.pdf |date=January 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Typical job-related activities may involve:

* assembly
* installation
* [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]
* testing
* [[troubleshooting]]
* repair
* upgrading of associated electronic equipment and systems.


Job opportunities for electrical and electronics technologists and technicians are increasing because many industries use electronic products and systems. Key sectors are [[telecommunications]], audio/video, computers, [[robotics]], [[energy conversion]] and efficiency, [[power generation]], transmission and distribution, and electrical equipment manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.settlement.org/alternativejobs/career.aspx?j=21 |title=Alternative Jobs |publisher=Settlement.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Employment opportunities for electronics technicians vary and are largely based on their areas of expertise.  For example, employment growth for Electronics technicians in areas such as robotics, energy conversion, and power generation is expected to grow by 5%/yr from 2010 through 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos184.htm#outlook |title=Electrical and Electronics Installers and Repairers : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Firestone Natural Rubber Company, LLC''' is a subsidiary of the [[Bridgestone| Bridgestone Americas, Inc]]. Headquartered in [[Nashville, TN]], the company operates the largest contiguous rubber plantation in the world in [[Liberia]], which first opened in 1926.

==History==

===Creation and early history===
During the 1920s, the United States access to [[rubber]] was restricted by the European colonial powers (Britain and the Netherlands), which held a monopoly in rubber production.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"&gt;Robert Anthony Waters Jr, ''Historical Dictionary of United States-Africa Relations'', Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9780810862913}}, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Hoover]], then Secretary of Commerce, considered rubber a vital resource due to its usage for car tires and began working with American rubber companies in order to find a rubber source that was controlled by US interests.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; Part of a Department of Commerce-subsidised worldwide search for a place for rubber plantations, rubber magnate [[Harvey Samuel Firestone]] sent experts to Liberia in December 1923 to do a soil survey.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt;

In 1926, the Liberian government granted Firestone a 99-year lease for a million acres (to be chosen by the company wherever in Liberia) at a price of 6 cents per acre,&lt;ref name="dubois"&gt;W. E. Burghardt Du Bois, "[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/69368/w-e-burghardt-du-bois/liberia-the-league-and-the-united-states Liberia, the League and the United States]", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', July 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Firestone then set about establishing rubber tree plantations of the non-native South American rubber tree, [[Hevea brasiliensis]] in the country, eventually creating the world's largest rubber plantation.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; Firestone also provided a $5 million loan at a 7% interest rate&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; to the government to pay the foreign debts it had &lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; and to build a harbour needed by Firestone.&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; The loan was given in exchange for complete authority over the government's revenues until the loan was paid.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenau, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The loan took a larger and larger portion of the Liberian government's incomes: it grew from 20% of the total revenue of Liberia in 1929, to 32% in 1930, to 54.9% in 1931 and nearly the whole revenue in 1932.&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; An estimation made by a member of the American Legation in Liberia said that Liberia really paid a 17% interest rate for the loan.&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], as rubber price fell,&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; Firestone stopped its development of the plantation (using just 50,000 acres and cutting wages in half), and, depriving the Liberian government of tax incomes, the government missed a payment to the loans to the company. Firestone asked the US government to send a warship to [[Monrovia]] to enforce the debt payment, but President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] rejected the "gunboat diplomacy".&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; The loans to the company were finally paid in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenau, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the civil wars===
As rubber demand went down during the 1980s, Firestone dismissed a number of 5000 workers, leading to the local antipathy to the company.&lt;ref name="Rosenau20"&gt;Rosenau, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1990, during the [[First Liberian Civil War]], the resistance group [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] took over the Firestone plantation and evacuated US personnel.&lt;ref name="Rosenau20"/&gt; The exact nature of Firestone's activities in the plantation between 1990 and 1997 is unclear, the government's official stance was that they were able to take it back within a few months,&lt;ref name="Rosenau20"/&gt; while media reports say that it was not operational until late 1994.&lt;ref name="Rosenau21"&gt;Rosenau, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, after the violence was over, the company restarted the operations, at first at a third of capacity, with 3000 workers.&lt;ref name="Rosenau21"/&gt; The company soon faced a number of violent protests, as its employees wanted better working conditions, better pay and resettlement benefits.&lt;ref name="Rosenau21"/&gt; By October 2008, it was operating at half the capacity, withholding further investments until the government finally agreed to give the company a lenient tax status.&lt;ref name="Rosenau22"&gt;Rosenau, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current operations===

In 2005, the Firestone Company and the Liberian government signed a new 37-year deal raising the lease to 50 cents per acre.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt;

==Labor controversy==
The workers accuse the company of serious labor abuses, including exploitative [[child labor]], which they claim amount to modern-day [[slavery]].&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt;  Workers specifically claim that Firestone's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children, subjecting them to grueling and dangerous work conditions.  In response to the claims, the president of Firestone Natural Rubber told a [[CNN]] interviewer that "each tapper will tap about 650 trees a day, where they spend perhaps a couple of minutes at each tree." As the network pointed out, this would add up to more than 21 hours of work per day.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web
| title =Is Bridgestone/Firestone Exploiting Liberian Workers? | publisher=CNN| url =http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0511/12/i_if.01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) released a report detailing the state of [[human rights]] on Liberia's rubber plantations.&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt; According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor.  UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education.&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt;

===Alien Tort Claims Act===
In November 2005, the [[International Labor Rights Fund]], representing "tappers" (workers who extract [[latex]] from [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber trees]]) on the Liberian plantation, filed an [[Alien Tort Statute|Alien Tort Claims Act]] (ATCA) case in US District Court in California against [[Bridgestone]] (parent company owning Firestone), alleging "forced labor, the modern equivalent of slavery", on the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Plantation in [[Harbel]], [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Claim against Firestone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Firestone Claim|work=socialfunds.com|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1897.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit stated: {{cquote|The Plantation workers allege, among other things, that they remain trapped by poverty and coercion on a frozen-in-time Plantation operated by Firestone in a manner identical to how the Plantation was operated when it was first opened by Firestone in 1926.}}

Firestone rejected these allegations, stating that the corporation has provided employment and pensions to thousands of Liberians as well as healthcare. The company also provides education and training opportunities to employees and their children.&lt;ref name = "Firestone Briefing"&gt;{{cite web|title =Firestone Briefing|work =lantos.house.org|url =http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/HRC+Hidden+Content/12-09-05+Liberia+and+Firestone+Briefing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply to the charge of exploitative [[child labor]], Management of the plantation claims that workers are bringing their own children to work to assist them and that this is not endorsed by the plantation management.

Workers claim that management's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children as their only means of meeting quotas.

Even though Liberia does have child labor laws and Firestone has banned children from tapping trees, workers say the ban is not enforced. The workers say the only way they can complete their daily quota is to bring their children along.

Firestone management says if children are found helping their parents, the employees are cancelled, and if necessary, disciplined. "We have very strict policies about our child labor. We do not hire anybody under 18 years of age, and we discourage parents from bringing their children to the fields with them."&lt;ref name = "CNNtranscript"&gt;{{cite web
| title =Liberian Controversy
| work =cnn.com
| url =http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0511/12/i_if.01.html
| accessdate=2006-07-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firestone requested to transfer the case to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], from California and this request was granted in April 2006.

===UN report===
In May 2006, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) released a report: "Human Rights in Liberia’s Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future".&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Liberia's Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future|publisher=United Nations Mission in Liberia (2006)|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/473dade10.html|accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor. UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education. The report also noted that workers' housing provided by Firestone has not been renovated since the houses were constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt;

In response to the accusations of [[child labor]] and poor housing in the UN report, Dan Adomitis, President of Firestone Natural Rubber Company Liberia, stated: 
{{cquote| Well, in addition to the devastation that 15 years of civil war has caused, I think you need to understand another point—during the 2003 fighting, we had thousands of refugees come to Harbel for the safety that it provided. When those people came, they occupied any open area of land that was available. They put up temporary housing made out of mud, out of bamboo, out of thatch, out of tarpaulin, out of corrugated steel. Anything that they could do to get shelter. And those conditions still exist. They are not Firestone housing, but they are on our property.&lt;ref name = "CNN"/&gt;...

We have very strict policies about child labor. We do not hire anybody under 18 years of age, and we discourage parents from bringing their children to the fields with them. We have a program with the Ministry of Labor in Liberia to - and also the union that represents our employees—to educate parents about why they should not bring children with them into the field. And if we see incidents of this, we will cancel those employees, and if necessary, ultimately discipline them over such issue.&lt;ref name="CNNtranscript"/&gt;}}

[[Image:Francesco cirio.jpg|thumb|Francesco Cirio.]]
'''Francesco Cirio''' (24 December 1836 – 9 January 1900) was an Italian businessman, and is credited with being one of the first in the world with developing the appertization technique in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francesco Cirio 1856-1867|url=http://www.cirio1856.us/1856.htm|publisher=Cirio|quote=Francesco Cirio was amongst the first in the world to be credited with developing the appertization technique (the inventor was Frenchman Nicolas Appert).|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727205717/http://www.cirio1856.us/1856.htm|archivedate=27 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appertization is the method of processing vegetables that leads to them being canned. The term comes from [[Nicolas Appert]], who invented the first process for using heat to sterilize food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolas Appert (c1750 - 1841)|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/MBG/MBG4/Appert.html|publisher=City University of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cirio was born in [[Nizza Monferrato]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], to a poor and illiterate family. When he was 14 years old he came to the capital of the kingdom, Turin. In 1856, Cirio started preserving [[tomato]]es in [[tin]] cans in order for them to be exported. He created his own company (later named Cirio), and when he was 20 years old, he started his first factory in Turin. In 1861, he added further plantations and production facilities in Southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cirio, A Brief History|url=http://randvimports.com/v2/cirio/|publisher=R and V Imports|quote=He heard that Italian expatriates longed to buy vegetables from home and so developed the concept of putting vegetables in cans and this was the birth of the can food industry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Bateman|title=Food and Drink: Canny Cooking|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/food--drink-canny-cooking-1046288.html|publisher=''The Independent''|date=January 10, 1999|quote=It is Italy's major food company, founded by Francesco Cirio, father of the canning industry in Turin in the 1860s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, Cirio exhibited his products in [[Paris]] at the [[International Exposition (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where he received prestigious awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cirio since 1856|url=https://ciaogusto.com/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=25&amp;Itemid=585|publisher=Ciao Gusto|quote=In 1867 Francesco presented his first products in Paris at the Exposition Universelle, where he received prestigious awards.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018073629/https://ciaogusto.com/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=25&amp;Itemid=585|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was transformed in 1885 into Societa Anonima di Esportazione Agricola Francesco Cirio in Turin. This company very soon opened subsidiaries in [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Belgrade]], Berlin, [[Brussels]], London, Paris, and [[Vienna]]. Cirio also worked to help the agricultural development of Southern Italy.

'''Friendship Fountain''' is a large [[fountain]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. It is in '''St. Johns River Park''' (also known as '''Friendship Fountain Park''') at the west end of [[Downtown Jacksonville]]'s [[Jacksonville Riverwalk|Southbank Riverwalk]] attraction. The world's largest and tallest fountain when it opened, it has been one of Jacksonville's most recognizable and popular attractions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/050606/ner_21783751.shtml Florida Times-Union: May 6, 2006-Fountain feedback]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scanlan, Dan: [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/032801/ner_5741309.shtml "Fountain goes dry for repairs"] Florida Times-Union, March 28, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fountain and park were designed by Jacksonville architect [[Taylor Hardwick]] in 1963 and opened in 1965. The fountain's three pumps could push {{convert|17,000|USgal|L}} of water per minute up to {{convert|100|feet|meters}} in height. Friendship Fountain remained one of Jacksonville's signature attractions through the 20th century, but severe corrosion and deterioration to the equipment resulted in periodic closures in the 2000s. In 2011 the city completed a $3.2 million renovation to the fountain and the surrounding park.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2009}}
[[Image:FriendshipFountainParkPC.JPG|left|thumb|250px|The original Friendship Fountain &amp; Park]]
The fountain and Friendship Park was designed by [[Taylor Hardwick]], the Jacksonville architect who also designed the [[Haydon Burns Library]]. An area of {{convert|14|acre|m2}} of land were donated for the project by the Southside Business Men's Club, an organization dedicated to the improvement of the Southside that was established in 1932.&lt;ref name="taylorhardwick.com"&gt;[http://www.taylorhardwick.com/ Taylor Hardwick, AIA]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southside Business Men's Club|url=http://www.southsidebusinessmensclub.com/|publisher=Southside Business Men's Club|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Begun in 1963 and completed at a cost of $1.7 million,&lt;ref name=TU/&gt; the park opened in March 1965. The "world’s largest and tallest" fountain at the time, it became a popular tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=227 "Friendship Fountain"] City of Jacksonville website, Recreation &amp; Community Service&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three pumps had a combined {{convert|750|hp}} and could push {{convert|17,000|USgal|L}} per minute; some streams as tall as a 10-story building. The enclosure for the pumps and controls was so large that the architect had to include it as an element of design.&lt;ref name="taylorhardwick.com"/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2009}}

The Fountain was originally called the "Fountain of Friendship in Dallas Thomas Park"; ''friendship'' at the suggestion of a [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] member and ''Dallas Thomas'' after the city's parks and finance commissioner. However, when Thomas was later involved in a scandal and indicted, the park was renamed in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxfountain.com/Original/history.htm Friends of the Friendship Fountain website: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harbormasters and River City Brewing Company===
The [[Acosta Bridge]] was rebuilt beginning in 1990, and the Diamond Head Lobster House was in its path and had to be demolished. The city agreed to use a big portion of Friendship park for the new restaurant and parking lot, cutting the park by more than half.&lt;ref name="taylorhardwick.com"/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2009}}&lt;ref name=HIST&gt;{{cite web|title=Friendship Fountain History|url=http://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=227|publisher=City of Jacksonville|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Essentially, all the design structures in the park were removed-—with the exception of the fountain itself—-for what became a [[Boondoggle (project)|boondoggle]].
The new facility was named Harbormasters, and the city guaranteed a $2.9 million federal building loan on the city's land. Initial success was followed by lawsuits, a new owner, missed rent payments, foreclosure, loan default and finally closure in 1992.&lt;ref name=DEAL&gt;{{cite news|last=Littlepage|first=Ron|title=After 3 failures, will Jacksonville spurn more restaurant deals?|url=http://members.jacksonville.com/opinion/premium/401979/ron-littlepage/2013-01-20/ron-littlepage-after-3-failures-will-jacksonville|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
When the venture failed, the city had to pay off the nearly $3 million loan. The River City Brewing Company, which replaced Harbormasters in November 1993, has been successful, but because the city owns the land, the restaurant pays no property taxes.&lt;ref name=FAILS&gt;{{cite news|last=Saunders|first=Jim|title=Development plan fails|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/071197/HARBORMA.html|accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=July 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long service===
Friendship Fountain functioned for over 20 years and was refurbished in December 1985, before resuming operation for another 15 years. Finally, wear and corrosion forced its closure at the end of the century. A five-month, $1.3 million rehabilitation began when the fountain was drained in March 2001. A new feature was added: six light towers with computer-controlled color-changing floodlights. Unanticipated damage to stainless steel pipes was uncovered, requiring a $97,000 increase in cost and two-month delay, but the fountain re-opened in December 2001.&lt;ref name=TU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scanlan, Dan:
[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/083001/met_7149653.html "Friendship Fountain high 'n' dry Landmark to spout in early October"] Florida Times-Union, August 30, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  It operated for seven months until a power outage/[[voltage spike]] damaged the computer controller and blew out 40 lights and lenses on April 29, 2002. That was repaired, and the fountain was fully functional for nearly 3 years. It was a major attraction at [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in February 2005, but two months later, two of the three original (40-year-old) pumps failed and parts were no longer available. The replacement cost for the pumps was estimated at $400,000, but the city budget was tight and money was not available. Afterward the fountain was run on one pump with a greatly reduced flow.&lt;ref name=TU&gt;Scanlan, Dan: [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/061505/ner_18989533.shtml "Friendship Fountain's water jets falter due to bad pumps"] Florida Times-Union, June 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It was repaired in 2011 and is functional.

==Features==
*The fountain’s basin is {{convert|200|ft|m}} in diameter holding {{convert|500,000|USgal|L}} of water which is treated according to [[swimming pool sanitation]] standards.
*The spray component consists of three rings.
*The outer ring contains 36 nozzles, equally spaced around the perimeter, projecting a stream of water inward at a 45° angle, rising {{convert|35|ft|m}}, driven by a {{convert|250|hp}} motor with a pump capacity of 6,750 [[Gallons per minute|GPM]]
*The middle ring is {{convert|120|ft|m}} in diameter and consists of 18 nozzles directed vertically, rising to a height of {{convert|40|ft|m}}, driven by a {{convert|150|hp}} motor with a pump capacity of 4,500 GPM.
*The center ring is {{convert|15|ft|m}} in diameter and contains nine nozzles operating vertically, rising to a height of {{convert|120|ft|m}}, driven by a {{convert|350|hp}} motor with a pump capacity of 5,500 GPM.
* The fountain has an [[anemometer]] that controls the height of the center nozzles.  If the force of the wind is from 5 to {{convert|15|mi|km}} an hour, the height of the center nozzles will not exceed {{convert|70|ft|m}}. For wind speed in excess of {{convert|15|mi|km}} an hour, the height of the center nozzles is limited to {{convert|50|ft|m}}. This was done to control the blow-off of water into the park and onto persons around the fountain.
*Each nozzle has a cluster of four lights: dark red, light red, turquoise and amber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrojacksonville.com/content/view/200/5/ Metro Jacksonville website: Sep 11, 2006-Friendship Fountain: The Truth Beneath the Lies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of the Jacksonville landmark was in doubt for a number of years. A number of proposals were made, including moving [[Kids Kampus]] from [[Metropolitan Park]] and eliminating the fountain, rebuilding a smaller fountain or renovating the existing fountain. As of May 2008, there was $15 million in the city's capital projects budget to improve the Southbank Riverwalk, which includes the area around Friendship Fountain; but Mayor [[John Peyton (U.S. politician)|John Peyton]] felt the amount was not enough.&lt;ref&gt;Littlepage, Ron: [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/053008/opl_284245489.shtml "Let's upgrade riverwalk in time for 25th anniversary"] Florida Times-Union, May 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jacksonville City Council approved final plans for a $3.2 million renovation and repair to the surrounding park and Friendship Fountain on February 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Tia: [http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-02-09/story/jacksonville_council_oks_downtown_projects "Jacksonville council OKs downtown projects"] Florida Times-Union, February 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2010 [http://JaxFountain.com], The Friends of Friendship Fountain Website, reported communications from the Jacksonville Economic Development Commission that AC General Inc was named contractor for the project.&lt;ref name="ldiline.com"&gt;[http://www.ldiline.com/home.cfm?id=16451 Friendship Fountain Park Renovations]&lt;/ref&gt; An official groundbreaking was held on September 1, 2010 marking the start of the renovation of Friendship Fountain and Park.&lt;ref&gt;http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-09-01/story/friendship-fountain-fly-high-again-after-renovation-ground-breaking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionnewsjax.com/content/actionlocal/story/Friendship-Fountain-restoration/IJ7w5R5_lU-kIQOkydwanQ.cspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news4jax.com/news/24841680/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain was closed for eight months for construction, and reopened again on June 18, 2011 amid a celebration.&lt;ref name="ldiline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jacksonville.com/opinion/blog/403251/gary-mills/2011-06-18/flash-mob-celebrates-friendship-fountains-reopening&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GAC Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Co., Ltd.''' is an automobile manufacturing company headquartered in [[Changsha]], [[China]] and a 50:50 [[joint-venture]] between [[GAC Group]] and [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].

==History==
Fiat and GAC signed a joint venture agreement in Rome on 6 July 2009, in the presence of Chinese President Hu Jintao and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.&lt;ref name=bloom7709/&gt; Construction of GAC Fiat facilities in Changsha began on 26 November 2009, with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by the Italian ambassador to China, the provincial leaders of Hunan and Guangdong, and city leaders of Changsha and Guangzhou.&lt;ref name=chidaily1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bw/2009-11/30/content_9074421.htm|title=GAC-Fiat ceremony heralds joint venture|accessdate=13 April 2012|publisher=China Daily|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAC Fiat Automobiles Co., Ltd. was incorporated on 9 March 2010.&lt;ref name=companyprof/&gt;

The Changsha assembly plant was officially opened on 28 June 2012, in a ceremony attended by Fiat chief executive [[Sergio Marchionne]] and representatives of Hunan and Guandong provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Motoring/Story/STIStory_816528.html|title=Fiat opens new Chinese plant to produce Viaggio|accessdate=2 July 2012|publisher=Straits Times|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 it was announced that GAC Fiat would be expanded to also include Chrysler, and that GAC Fiat would construct a new assembly plant in Guangzhou for the production of [[Jeep]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130116/AUTO04/301160335/1148/auto01/Fiat-Chrysler-Guangzhou-ink-Jeep-deal |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215211655/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130116/AUTO04/301160335/1148/auto01/Fiat-Chrysler-Guangzhou-ink-Jeep-deal |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 February 2013 |title=Fiat-Chrysler, Guangzhou ink Jeep deal |accessdate=27 January 2013 |publisher=The Detroit News |date=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/01/13/us-fiat-chrysler-idINBRE90C06F20130113|title=Fiat, Chrysler to produce Jeep in China: paper|accessdate=27 January 2013|publisher=Reuters|date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant is planned to have an initial production capacity of 100,000 units per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2013/01/gac-fiat-to-build-jeeps-in-guangzhou-next-gen-liberty-likely-to-be-the-first-model-to-roll-off-line/|title=GAC-Fiat to Build Jeeps in Guangzhou, Next-gen Liberty Likely to Be the First Model to Roll Off Line|accessdate=27 January 2013|publisher=China Auto Web|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander George Downer''' (28 January 1839 &amp;ndash; 17 August 1916), usually known as George, or A. G. Downer, was a prominent South Australian businessman and a partner with his brother Sir [[John Downer]] in the legal firm G &amp; J Downer.&lt;ref name=splendid&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article87312225 |title=A Splendid Citizen |newspaper=[[The Chronicle (Adelaide)|The Chronicle]] |location=Adelaide |date=19 August 1916 |accessdate=13 November 2012 |page=37 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
George Downer was born in [[Adelaide]], the eldest of four sons of [[Downer family|Henry Downer]], the others being Henry Edward Downer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article162437526 |title=Death of Mr. H. E. Downer |newspaper=[[The Adelaide Observer]] |volume=LXII, |issue=3,332 |location=South Australia |date=12 August 1905 |accessdate=7 May 2018 |page=28 |via=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (22 March 1836 – 4 August 1905), John William Downer (1843–1915), &lt;!--Frederick Field Downer (1846–1847)--&gt; and Harold Field Downer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46096004 |title=Death of Mr. Harold F. Downer |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=LII, |issue=12,644 |location=South Australia |date=24 May 1887 |accessdate=7 May 2018 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1847 – 23 May 1887). He was educated at [[Francis Haire]]'s Academy and while quite young was articled to the firm of Bartley, Bakewell &amp; Stow, whose principals included [[Randolph Isham Stow]]. He combined study of law, for which he had a ready talent, with journalism, and was for a time editor of the (Adelaide) ''Telegraph''. He was admitted to the bar in 1868. His brother John had only recently qualified and the two entered into partnership. The firm G &amp; J Downer prospered and was eventually taken over by Frank H. and J. Fred Downer, sons of his brothers Henry Edward and John respectively.

His only attempt at a position in Parliament was in 1870 when he contested the seat of Gumeracha against [[Ebenezer Ward]] and [[Arthur Blyth]]. He was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60325086 |title=A Versatile Personality |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=9 October 1917 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1880 he was appointed by the government to a Pastoral Commission and was in a large part responsible for lengthening the tenure of leases of Crown lands.

Pastoralist [[Francis John Whitby]], a fellow student at Haire's Academy was a lifelong friend.
Downer never married. After his death at his (c. 170) South Terrace residence, his Adelaide Hills property "Monalta" (previously known as "Hope Lodge")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57510354 |title=Missionary Students Migrating |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=7 May 1907 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[Belair railway station]], was subdivided. The mansion eventually became [[Blackwood District Community Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48932986 |title=Out Among the People. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=18 November 1953 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John, his brother, had predeceased him on 2 August 1915 and his sister Amelia Rivaz had died on 21 July 1916.

==Business activities==
He was much in demand for his business acumen as well as his knowledge of mercantile law. For around twenty years he was a
*director of China Traders Company
*trustee of [[Harrold Brothers]]
*director, Norwich Union Assurance Company
*director, [[Elder, Smith, &amp; Co.]] from 1892&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48174231 |title=Elder,Smith &amp; Co., Limited |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=1 September 1936 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |page=32 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*director [[Bank of Adelaide]] from around 1894 and Chairman for most of that time
He relinquished these positions in May 1914 as his health deteriorated.
*He invested in a northern pastoral property which was resumed by the Government, then in 1888 a share of Minburra station and an adjoining property, making Melton Station, about 40&amp;nbsp;km from [[Yunta, South Australia|Yunta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3581">The '''Gulfstream Polo Club''' was a [[polo]] club in [[Lake Worth, Florida]]. Since 1923, Gulfstream Polo Club was one of the most prominent polo clubs in North America, particularly during the Florida season (December-April). Gulfstream was managed by Marla Connor for 18 years until it closed in May 2016 at the end of the polo season. Throughout its long history it offered a wide array of tournaments, with 4, 6, and 10 Goal Leagues as well as Ladies Tournaments.

==Location==
It was located at 4550 Polo Road, Lake Worth, Florida, 33467, not far from the [[Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was started by the [[Phipps family]] North of [[Delray Beach, Florida]] in 1923, making it the oldest polo club in Florida.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"&gt;[http://www.gulfstreampolo.com/history.htm Gulfstream Polo Club: Our History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history98"&gt;Horace A. Laffaye, ''Polo in the United States: A History'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, 2011, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bill"&gt;Bill DiPaolo, [http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/local/polo-club-barn-catches-fire-in-wellington-putting-/nWmy3/ Seven horses die in barn fire at Gulfstream Polo Club; electrical overload in makeshift kitchen blamed], ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', March 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It became affiliated with the [[United States Polo Association]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="history98"/&gt;

In 1941, [[John H. H. Phipps]], [[Michael Grace Phipps]] (1910–1973), [[Charles Skiddy von Stade]] and [[Alan L. Corey, Jr.]], all players in residence at the Gulfstream Polo Club, won the [[U.S. Open Polo Championship]] at the [[Meadow Brook Polo Club]].&lt;ref name="history98"/&gt; However, during the [[Second World War]], the club was closed and the stables were used by US troops in case of an invasion.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;

In the 1960s, the Phipps family sold the land in Delray Beach.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; [[Philip L. B. Iglehart]] (1913-1993) together with [[Jim Kraml, Sr.]], [[Norberto Azqueta Sr.]], [[Robert Uihlein, Jr.]] (1916-1976), William Taylor, [[William Stamps Farish III]] (born 1939), [[James H. Binger]] (1916-2004), [[George C. Sherman, Jr.]] and [[Paul Butler (polo)|Paul Butler]] (1892-1981) purchased land in Lake Worth and re-established the polo club there.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; There were five fields, including the Bostwick Field, named after [[Pete Bostwick]] (1909-1982), who was a club member.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; [[Summerfield Johnston, Jr.]] served as a long-time club president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polomuseum.com/hof_inductees/johnston_skey.htm Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame: S.K. (Skey) Johnston, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been home to the USPA Delegate's Cup (8-Goal) since the mid-1970s, the USPA Bronze Cup (12-Goal) since the early 1980s, and the Heritage Cup (16-Goal) since 1987.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;

The club closed permanently on May 20, 2016, following acquisition by Pulte Homes, a real estate development firm.&lt;ref name="sunowershomesbuys"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owers|first1=Paul|title=Pulte Homes buys Wellington polo club, horse farms|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/realestate/fl-pulte-wellington-20160504-story.html|accessdate=July 7, 2016|work=Sun Sentinel|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His eldest grandson, Henry Ford II, became president on Sept. 21, 1945. Even as Henry Ford II drove the industry's first postwar car off the assembly line, he was making plans to reorganize and decentralize the company to resume its prewar position as a major force in a fiercely competitive auto industry. Henry Ford II provided strong leadership for Ford Motor Company from the postwar era into the 1980s. He was president from 1945 until 1960 and chief executive officer from 1945 until 1979. He was chairman of the board of directors from 1960 until 1980, and remained as chairman of the finance committee from 1980 until his death in 1987. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213105146/http://www.ford.com/en/heritage/fordFamily/default.htm |archivedate=2007-02-13 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chairman for several months thereafter. Notably, under the leadership of Henry Ford II, Ford Motor Company became a publicly traded corporation in 1956. From 1943 to 1950, he also served as president of the [[Ford Foundation]].

==Early life==
Henry Ford II was born in [[Detroit]], Michigan, to [[Eleanor Clay Ford]] and [[Edsel Ford]] on September 4, 1917. He, brothers Benson and William, and sister Josephine, grew up amid affluence. He graduated from [[The Hotchkiss School]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=AlumniAchievements&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/Accomplishments.aspx |title=Alumni Award: PREVIOUS RECIPIENTS |publisher=The Hotchkiss School |date=2004 |accessdate=March 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310133421/http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/Accomplishments.aspx |archivedate=March 10, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended [[Yale University]], where he served on the business staff of ''[[The Yale Record]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Cecil A.

==Career==
When his father [[Edsel Ford|Edsel]], president of Ford, died of cancer in May 1943 (during [[World War II]]), Henry Ford II was serving in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and unable to take over the presidency of the family-owned business. The elderly and ailing [[Henry Ford]], company founder, re-assumed the presidency. By this point in his life, the elder Ford was mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and no longer fit for the job; most of the directors did not want to see him as president. But for the previous 20 years, although he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had de facto control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him, and he served until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the company began to decline, losing over $10 million a month. The administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] considered a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production, but the idea never progressed to execution.

Henry Ford II left the Navy in July 1943 and joined the company's management a few weeks later. After two years, he assumed presidency of the business on September 21, 1945. Since it had been assumed that Edsel Ford would continue in his capacity as president of the company for much longer than turned out to be the case, Henry Ford II had received little grooming for the position, and he took over the company during a chaotic period; its European factories had suffered a great deal of damage during the war, and domestic sales were also in decline.

Henry Ford II immediately adopted an aggressive management style. One of his first acts as company president was to place [[John Bugas]] in charge of taking control of the company from its entrenched management and firing [[Harry Bennett]], head of the Ford Service Department, whom his grandfather initially hired to stifle attempts at [[unionization]]. Next, acknowledging his inexperience, he hired several seasoned executives to support him. He hired former [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] executives [[Ernest Breech]] and Lewis Crusoe away from the [[Bendix Corporation]]. Breech was to serve in the coming years as HF2's business mentor, and the Breech–Crusoe team would form the core of Ford's business expertise, offering much-needed experience.

Additionally, Henry Ford II hired ten young up-and-comers, known as the "[[Whiz Kids (Ford)|Whiz Kids]]". These ten, gleaned from an [[Army Air Forces]] statistical team, Henry Ford II envisioned as giving the company the ability to innovate and stay current. Two of them, Arjay Miller and [[Robert McNamara]], went on to serve as presidents of Ford themselves. A third member, [[J. Edward Lundy]], served in key financial roles for several decades and helped to establish Ford Finance's reputation as one of the best Finance organizations in the world.  As a team, the "whiz kids" are probably best remembered as the design team for the [[1949 Ford]], which they took from concept to production in nineteen months, and which re-established Ford as a formidable automotive company. It was reported that 100,000 orders for this car were taken the day it was introduced to the market.

Henry Ford II was president of [[Ford Motor Company]] from 1945 to 1960. In 1956, under his leadership, the company became a publicly traded corporation and dedicated its new [[Ford World Headquarters|world headquarters building]]. When he resigned the presidency, he became CEO of the company. During his term as CEO of Ford, he resided in [[Grosse Pointe]], [[Michigan]]. On July 13, 1960, he was additionally elected Chairman; he resigned as CEO on October 1, 1979, and as Chairman in 1980. His nephew, [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]] would later assume these positions after 20 years of non-Ford family management of the company. During the interim, the family interests were represented on the board by Henry's younger brother [[William Clay Ford, Sr.]], as well as Henry's son [[Edsel Ford II]] and his nephew William Clay Ford, Jr.

During the early 1960s Henry Ford II engaged in lengthy negotiations with [[Enzo Ferrari]] to buy [[Ferrari]], with a view to expanding Ford's presence in motorsport in general and at the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]] in particular. However negotiations collapsed due to disputes over control over Ferrari's [[Scuderia Ferrari|racing division]]. The collapse of the deal led him to inaugurate the [[Ford GT40]] project, intended to end Ferrari's dominance at Le Mans (the Italian marque won the race six consecutive times from 1960 to 1965). After two difficult years in 1964 and 1965, in 1966 GT40s locked out the podium at both the [[Daytona 24 Hours]] and the [[1966 12 Hours of Sebring|Sebring 12 Hours]] before taking the first of four consecutive wins at [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redbull.com/uk/en/motorsports/stories/1331777719573/ford-gt40-heroes-of-motorsport |title=Legends: Ford GT40 |last1=Stuart |first1=Greg |date=19 February 2016 |website=[[Red Bull]]|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 and 1974, as it became clear that the American car market would begin to favor smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, [[Ford]]'s then-President [[Lee Iacocca]] was highly interested in buying [[powertrain]]s from [[Honda Motor Company]] as a way to minimize the cost of developing a small Ford car for the North American market, such as a modified version of [[Ford of Europe]]'s [[Ford Fiesta]]. The plan was rejected by Henry Ford II, who stated: "No car with my name on the hood is going to have a Jap engine inside." Although, strictly speaking, it was too late for that, as the Ford Motor Company had been selling a Mazda compact pickup truck as the Ford Courier since late 1971, Henry Ford II did not like the idea of flagship North American passenger car models moving in that direction. Ford Motor Company did go on to adapt to the era in which Japanese, German, and American participation in a globalized automobile industry became tightly integrated. For example, Ford's relationship with [[Mazda]] was well developed even before the end of HF2's period of influence. However, in Iacocca's view, it lagged several years behind GM and Chrysler, due to Henry Ford II's unappealable influence, before others led it forward despite his resistance.

HF2's management style caused the company's fortunes to fluctuate in more ways than one. For example, he allowed the offering of [[public stock]] in 1956, which raised $650 million for the company, but the "experimental car" program instituted during his tenure, the [[Edsel]], cost the company almost half that. Likewise, HF2 hired the creative [[Lee Iacocca]], who was fundamental to the success of the [[Ford Mustang]], in 1964, but fired Iacocca due to personal disputes in 1978 (about the break in their relationship, Iacocca quoted Ford as saying, "Sometimes you just don't like somebody"). He formally retired from all positions at Ford Motor Company on October 1, 1982, upon reaching the company's mandatory retirement age of 65, but remained the ultimate source of authority at Ford until his death in 1987.

'''Henry Phipps Jr.''' (September 27, 1839 &amp;ndash; September 22, 1930) was an [[United States|American]] [[entrepreneur]] known for his business relationship with [[Andrew Carnegie]] and involvement with the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. He was also a successful [[real estate]] investor. After selling his stock in Carnegie Steel, he devoted a great deal of his time and money to [[philanthropist|philanthropic]] works.

==Early life==
Henry Phipps Jr. was born on September 27, 1839 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  He was the son of English born Hannah Frank&lt;ref name="JohnTrain"/&gt; and Henry Phipps, an [[England|English]] [[shoemaker]] who migrated to Philadelphia in the early part of the 19th century before settling in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phipps|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/146221940/|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=July 24, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at public schools in [[Allegheny City, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt; He had one sister, Amelia Phipps Walker (Mrs. John Walker; 1846-1887), and two brothers: William Henry Phipps (1825-1902), and John Phipps (1833-1860), who was also friends with Carnegie and who died young.&lt;ref name="BridgeJH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bridge|first1=James Howard|title=The Inside History of the Carnegie Steel Company: A Romance of Millions|date=August 21, 2014|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|isbn=9780822990574|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jeNnRRSqFEMC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=carnegie+steel+henry+phipps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw7s7NxPbOAhXFkx4KHVBIA2gQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=henry%20phipps&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Phipps began working as a young man as an office boy and later a bookkeeper with Dillworth &amp; Bidwell. In 1861, he became a partner in Bidwell &amp; Phipps, which was an agent for the [[DuPont|du Pont Powder Company]], and a partner in Kloman &amp; Phipps, a small [[iron mill]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

===Involvement with Carnegie===
In 1865, he became a partner in childhood friend and neighbor's [[Andrew Carnegie|Andrew]] (1835–1919) and [[Thomas M. Carnegie|Thomas Carnegie]]'s (1843–1886) [[Thomas M. Carnegie#Union Iron Mills|Union Iron Mills]],&lt;ref name="JohnTrain"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Train|first1=John|title=REJUVENATING OLD MONEY|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1986/06/08/066886.html?pageNumber=629|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=The New York Times|date=June 8, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was created from a merger between Phipps' Kloman &amp; Phipps and Cyclops Iron Company, an iron company which the Carnegies had acquired an interest in.&lt;ref name="PhippsNYTMillions"&gt;{{cite news|author=Griffiths, William|title=Henry Phipps--The Man and His Millions|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/04/02/119116891.html?pageNumber=40|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=The New York Times|date=April 2, 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kloman and Phipps at first refused, but Thomas made an offer of all the shares in Cyclops plus an additional payment of $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="Bridge23"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, on May 1, 1865, the new Union Iron Mills Company was formed.&lt;ref name="Bridge23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb79"&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next year, Phipps and Carnegie went to Europe on tour, and when they returned in 1866, went to work. Phipps toiled for the next 20 years and proved a capable financier, becoming Carnegie's business partner in [[Carnegie Steel Company]], founded in 1892, which would make him a very wealthy man as the company's second largest shareholder. In 1901, Carnegie Steel Company was sold to the [[United States Steel Corporation]]; a newly formed organisation, set up by [[Pierpont Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, D., 2006, p.580-588&lt;/ref&gt; It sold for $400&amp;nbsp;million (approx. $13.3&amp;nbsp;billion today), of which $226&amp;nbsp;million went to Carnegie himself,&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, D., 2006, p.687&lt;/ref&gt; and $48&amp;nbsp;million went to Phipps.&lt;ref name="JohnTrain"/&gt;

In 1907, Henry Phipps established [[Bessemer Trust|Bessemer Trust Company]] to manage his substantial assets that would be shared by his offspring following his death.

===Real estate===
In 1909, Phipps expanded his Cape Cod holdings to the entire 800 acre Great Island on [[Cape Cod]], purchasing the remaining 50 acres from [[Charles B. Cory]] (1857–1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PHIPPS OWNS GREAT ISLAND.

In 1912, Phipps divided $3,000,000 ({{Inflation|US|3000000|1912|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) worth of real estate in Chicago, Illinois realty among his three sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PHIPPS GIVES SONS $3,000,000 Transfers Chicago Real Estate to Them — Tired of Managing It.|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/02/25/100353090.html?pageNumber=1|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 25, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, he also gave his sons $10,000,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000000|1912|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) worth of property in Pittsbugh.&lt;ref name="PalmBeach&amp;10M"&gt;{{cite news|title=PHIPPS BUYS AT PALM BEACH, New Yorker Will Build Three Villas There for His Family.|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/03/28/104847211.html?pageNumber=11|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 28, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, he purchased property in [[Great Neck, Long Island]] in the [[Lake Success, New York|Village of Lake Success]] and in 1917, began construction on a thirty-nine-room Georgian mansion summer home, which was completed in 1919. He named the home, Bonnie Blink, which is Scottish for Pretty View. After his death, the mansion and property were donated to the school district and have since become [[William A. Shine Great Neck South High School]].&lt;ref name=Lucky7&gt;"Lucky 7", (''Match, Richard'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ThisisGreatNeck&gt;"This is Great Neck", (''The League of Women Voters of Great Neck'').&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, he bought Island Beach, which was sold by his heirs in 1953 to the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]]. Now known as [[Island Beach State Park]], it is the last remaining stretch of undeveloped barrier island on the central New Jersey coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BEACHLAND IN NEW JERSEY ASKED AS NATIONAL PARK|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/07/17/91108498.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=23|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 17, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phipps was one of the pioneer investors in [[Florida]] real estate.&lt;ref name="PalmBeach&amp;10M"/&gt; At one time, he and his family owned one-third of the town of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], 28 miles (approximately 45 kilometers) of oceanfront between Palm Beach and [[Fort Lauderdale]], prime bay front property in downtown [[Miami]], and 29,653 acres (approximately 12,000 hectares) of land in [[Martin County, Florida|Martin County]]. The Phipps family donated to the town of Palm Beach one of the most significant gifts in county history: an ocean-to-lake frontage property that is now known as [[Elinor Klapp-Phipps Park|Phipps Park]].

===Philanthropy===
[[File:Phipps Houses d jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Phipps Houses, Queens, NYC]]
Phipps believed that those who have achieved great wealth should give back for the public good and create institutions dedicated to that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;The Philanthropy Hall of Fame, [http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/hall_of_fame/henry_phipps_jr Henry Phipps Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt; As such he was involved with a number of philanthropic causes, the best known of which is the [[Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens]] in [[Schenley Park]], an 1893 gift to the city of Pittsburgh. Among his many benevolent works, he also funded the [[Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HENRY PHIPPS INSTITUTE Will Be Established for Treatment of Tuberculosis.

Phipps was also an advocate of decent housing for the poor and in 1905 Phipps funded the non-profit Phipps Houses to build affordable housing in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PHIPPS HOUSES CHARTERED.

Retrieved December 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayer attended two prestigious, non-denominational secondary schools: [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston]], in the northwest area of the [[Bronx]] borough of New York City; and—as an exchange student in 1972-1973—[[Bedales]], a boarding school in the village of [[Steep, Hampshire]], England. A 1977 ''magna cum laude'' graduate of [[Yale University]], she was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] and served as senior editor of the ''Yale Daily News Magazine'' and as campus [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

Mayer began her journalistic career in [[Vermont]] writing for two small weekly papers, ''The Weathersfield Weekly'' and ''The Black River Tribune'', before moving to the daily ''[[Rutland Herald]]''. She worked as a metropolitan reporter for the now-defunct ''[[Washington Star]]'', and in 1982 joined ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', where she worked for 12 years. She was the first woman at the WSJ to be named [[White House]] [[White House press corps|correspondent]], and subsequently, senior writer and front page editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasbookfestival.org/Author_Page.php?aid=397|title=2017 Author Page - Texas Book Festival|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served as a [[war correspondent]] and [[foreign correspondent]] for the ''Journal'', where she reported on the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|bombing of the American barracks]] in [[Beirut]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and the last days of [[Communism]] in the former [[Soviet Union]].  Mayer also contributes to the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the ''[[American Prospect]].''

She has co-authored two books: ''Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;''Strange Justice'' was excerpted in ''The Wall Street Journal'', was the subject of an hour-long edition of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Turning Point'', and subsequent appearances on [[Ted Koppel]]'s ''Nightline'' and [[Larry King]] Live.[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/strange-justice-by-jane-mayer-and-jill-abramson/]&lt;/ref&gt; (co-authored with [[Jill Abramson]]), a study of the nomination and appointment of [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]; and ''Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984–1988'' (1989; co-authored with [[Doyle McManus]]), an account of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s second term in the [[White House]].

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said of ''Strange Justice'': "Its portrait of Thomas as an id suffering in the role of a Republican [[superego]] is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lacayo|first=Richard|title=The Unheard Witnesses|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=November 14, 1994|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981809,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of ''Landslide'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' Washington correspondent [[Steven V.

===''The Dark Side''===
Mayer's third nonfiction book, ''[[The Dark Side (book)|The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals]]'' (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the [[CIA]] and [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]]. The roles of [[Dick Cheney]] and attorneys [[David Addington]] and [[John Yoo]] in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. The book was a finalist for the [[National Book Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Book Foundation]], [http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2008_nf_mayer.html 2008 National Book Award Finalist, Nonfiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review of ''The Dark Side'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that the book is "the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jennifer|first=Schuessler|title=A History of Abuse in the War on Terror|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 22, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/books/22schuessler.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' subsequently named ''The Dark Side'' one of its [[New York Times Book Review|ten most notable books of the year]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/books/review/100Notable-t.html?pagewanted=all "100 Notable Books of 2008"], ''The New York Times'', November 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military and diplomatic historian, Colonel [[Andrew J. Bacevich]], reviewing the book in ''The Washington Post'', wrote: "[Mayer's] achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew J. Bacevich]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/10/AR2008071002373.html?tid=informbox Collateral Damage], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 10, 2008; accessed July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Post'' reporter [[Joby Warrick]] reported that Mayer's book revealed that a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) analyst warned the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] that "up to a third of the detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay]] may have been imprisoned by mistake." The administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were [[enemy combatants]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/11/AR2008071102954.html?hpid=moreheadlines Joby Warrick, "A Blind Eye to Guantanamo?"],  ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 11, 2008; accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a story appearing the same day in ''[[The New York Times]]'', reporter [[Scott Shane]] revealed that Mayer's book disclosed that [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007, that "the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Shane, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/washington/11detain.html Book Cites Secret Red Cross Report of C.I.A. Torture of Qaeda Captives], ''The New York Times'' (July 11, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayer said of her book: "I see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/27289 "Writer Talks Torture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130093009/http://yaledailynews.com/articles/view/27289 |date=2009-01-30 }}, ''The Yale Daily News'', January 27, 2009; accessed August 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties===
Mayer covered the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) official [[Thomas Andrews Drake|Thomas Drake]]. Despite Obama's campaign promises of transparency, Mayer wrote, his administration "has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/23/110523fa_fact_mayer Jane Mayer, "The Secret Sharer"], "The New Yorker", May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She won the [[Polk Award]] for the article, and the judges said her article helped expose "prosecutorial excess" and "helped lead to all major charges against Drake being dropped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/nyregion/anthony-shadid-times-correspondent-posthumously-honored.html?_r=3 James Barron, "Posthumous Polk Award for Times Correspondent"], ''The New York Times'', February 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drones===
In 2009, Mayer covered the Obama administration's use of drones. "The number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President", she wrote. Her article described errors, ethical concerns, and potential unintended consequences in the increased use of drone strikes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/26/091026fa_fact_mayer#ixzz2NWZuvk2y Jane Mayer, "The Predator War"], "The New Yorker", October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Money in politics===
For more than a decade, Mayer has written about money in politics, covering and criticizing both liberals and conservatives. In 1997, she wrote an article about "dubious [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] fundraising tactics leading to the 1996 election." The article described how the Clinton campaign "marketed the prestige and glamour of the Presidency as never before."&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mayer.[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1997/02/03/1997_02_03_032_TNY_CARDS_000377145 "Inside the Money Machine"], "The New Yorker", February 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, she wrote an article on [[George Soros]] and other activist billionaires who sought "to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election." The article described Soros's "extreme measures" and how his "outsized financial role in the election" had "stirred alarm".&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mayer.

In 2010, Mayer published an article about the [[political activities of the Koch brothers]], describing their "war against Obama" and funding of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and nonprofit organizations that sought to block liberal policy proposals and defeat Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all Jane Mayer, "Covert Operations"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The article was a finalist for the 2011 [[National Magazine Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Magazine Awards]], [http://www.magazine.org/asme/about-asme/pressroom/asme-press-releases/national-magazine-awards-2011-finalists-announced]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Mayer reported on retail sales millionaire [[Art Pope]]'s dominant spending in [[North Carolina]] politics. It documented his extraordinarily successful efforts as a [[Koch brothers]] ally, who held seats on the boards of their [[Americans for Prosperity]] and [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] organizations, to target both Democrats and moderate Republican state legislators and it predicted the redistricting-generated loss of Democratic congressional delegation seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_mayer Jane Mayer, "State for Sale"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', October 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her article won a Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, and the judges called it "the kind of journalism that strengthens democracy and shows the value of a free press."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newhouse.syr.edu/Newsroom/read_news.cfm?id=733|title=Newsroom - Newhouse School - Syracuse University|website=Newhouse School|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Bauerlein]], writing in the ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', was critical of the piece, saying the article was "a tendentious, poorly-researched, and weakly argued bit of journalism" and that "Pope never gets a fair shake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/jame-mayers-poor-journalism/40106|author=[[Mark Bauerlein]]|title=Jane Mayer's Poor Journalism|publisher=''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]''|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, Mayer supplemented her article with a blog entry pointing out that, despite Pope's claims that he was "not an heir", his "political career was launched" by more than $300,000 from his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/10/art-pope-heir.html|author=Jane Mayer|title=Art Pope and Individualism|publisher=The New Yorker|date=October 10, 2011|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mayer wrote an article about President Obama's efforts to raise money from liberal billionaires, and the decision of his campaign to flip-flop and encourage fundraising from [[super PAC]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Maye, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/27/120827fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all Schmooze or Lose], ''New Yorker'', August 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2016 election cycle, Mayer covered in the New Yorker, the exertion of considerable influence of former Democratic strategist and pollster [[Patrick Caddell]], in his capacity as advisor to reclusive contributor [[Robert Mercer (businessman)|Robert Mercer]]. Hedge fund director Mercer, joined in his efforts by his daughter [[Rebekah Mercer (donor)|Rebekah]], has been an increasingly important source of substantial funding for right wing campaigns, including the successful candidacy of [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency The Reclusive hedge-fund tycoon behind the Trump presidency], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Jane Mayer, March 27, 2017.

She responded by publicly airing those tactics of intimidation, effectively debunking the smear campaign.&lt;ref name="MotherJones_2016"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/koch-brothers-jane-mayer-dark-money |title=How the Kochtopus Went After a Reporter |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |last=David |first=Corn |date=21 January 2016 |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nyti.ms/23s8yR5 | title=What Happened to Jane Mayer When She Wrote About the Koch Brothers | website=The New York Times | date=26 January 2016 | accessdate=30 January 2016 | author=Dwyer, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Money won the 2017 Helen Bernstein Award, and was a finalist for the PEN Jean Stein Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the J.

The elevation to the U.S. Senate is a nice start to the year, but the sex change is a bit disappointing, since if I have to be male, I was hoping for a younger, more fit body, and a better head of hair.

'''Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner''' or, in Icelandic, Jón (born 29 August 1967 in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]) is an Icelandic [[programmer]] and businessman. Industry pioneer and browser visionary, he is the co-founder and CEO of [[Vivaldi Technologies]]. Before starting the Vivaldi Web browser, he launched a [[Virtual community|community site]] called Vivaldi.net. Tetzchner is also a co-founder and the former CEO of [[Opera Software]].

== Early life ==
Jon Stephenson von [[Tetzchner]] is the son of the Icelander Elsa Jónsdóttir and the Norwegian Stephen von Tetzchner, a professor of psychology. Tetzchner grew up around Skólabraut in the [[Reykjavík]] suburb of [[Seltjarnarnes]] with his grandparents, the doctor Jón Gunnlaugsson and Selma Kaldalóns, the daughter of the doctor and composer Sigvaldi Kaldalóns. Tetzchner went to secondary school at the [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]] before continuing his studies in Norway, where he made his career.&lt;ref&gt;Jón G. Hauksson, ''Björgólfur Thor og Jón Tetzchner: Íslendingar eiga tvo leiðtoga í 237 manna hópi „Ungra leiðtoga" sem taka þátt í verkefninu Forum of Young Global Leaders'', ''Frjáls verslun'', 67.1 (2005), 16--22 (p. 17); {{ISSN|1017-3544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetzchner holds a master's degree in computer science from the [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/company/executive/|title=About Opera, Executive team|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Opera Software|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214142807/http://www.opera.com/company/executive/|archivedate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opera Software ==
Tetzchner worked at the [[Norway|Norwegian]] state phone company (now known as [[Telenor]]) from 1991 to 1995.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; There, he and [[Geir Ivarsøy]] developed browsing software called MultiTorg Opera. The project was abandoned by Telenor, but Ivarsøy and von Tetzchner obtained the rights to the software, formed a company named Opera Software in 1995 and continued working on the [[Opera (web browser)|Opera browser]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

On 21 April 2005, Tetzchner proclaimed at an internal meeting of Opera Software that if the download numbers of the browser's new version Opera 8 reached one million within four days, he would swim across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from Norway to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/desktop/the-one-million-download-challenge-of-opera-8-opera-s-ceo-will-swim-from-norway-to-the-usa|title=The one million download challenge of Opera 8: Opera's CEO will swim from Norway to the USA|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=21 April 2005|publisher=Opera Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, on the 23rd, the downloads reached 1,050,000 and Tetzchner had to fulfill his challenge.&lt;ref name="geek"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.geek.com/news/opera-ceo-fulfills-download-challenge-sort-of-559773/|title = Opera CEO fulfills Download Challenge … sort of|accessdate = 25 July 2014|date = 27 April 2005|publisher = Geek.com|last = Osborne|first = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Opera site covered the swim and his quick failure.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

Under his leadership, Jon took Opera into a global company with more than 750 employees in 13 countries. Opera was an early pioneer in mobile web browser and more than 350 million people use Opera to enjoy the web on their own terms.

In January 2010, Tetzchner stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of Opera Software, but he continued to serve Opera as a strategic adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/general/opera-appoints-lars-boilesen-new-chief-executive-officer|title=Opera appoints Lars Boilesen new Chief Executive Officer|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=5 January 2010|publisher=Opera Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Tetzchner announced that he was leaving Opera Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/general/jon-s.-von-tetzchner-is-leaving-opera-software|title=Jon S. von Tetzchner is leaving Opera Software|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Opera Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vivaldi Technologies ==
In December 2013, Tetzchner founded the company [[Vivaldi Technologies]] and launched the [[online community]] site vivaldi.net, which includes a forum, blogs, chat, photo sharing and a free email service named Vivaldi Mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/23/operas-former-ceo-launches-vivaldi-a-new-community-site-and-email-service/|title=Opera’s Former CEO Launches Vivaldi, A New Community Site And Email Service|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=23 January 2014|publisher=Techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 2015, Vivaldi Technologies announced the release of its new web browser [[Vivaldi (web browser)|Vivaldi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-internet-vivaldi-idUSKBN0LA1JH20150206 | title=Vivaldi browser hits 500,000 downloads in first 10 days | work=[[Reuters]] | date=February 6, 2015 | last=Dagenborg | first=Joachim|accessdate=May 2, 2015|location=Oslo, Norway|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208202934/https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-internet-vivaldi-idUSKBN0LA1JH20150206|archivedate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 1.0 version came out in April 2016. Jon von Tetzchner and his team are making a personal and a feature-rich browser that takes into consideration the needs of every user. Vivaldi is self-funded and aims to be this way where the employees hold equity.

'''Jovenel Moïse''' (born 26 June 1968) is a Haitian politician serving as the [[List of heads of state of Haiti|42nd]] and current [[President of Haiti]] since February 2017. Previously, final official results had shown him as the winner of the [[Haitian presidential election, November 2016|November 2016 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=cep_haiti |number=803456135873363968 |date=28 November 2016 |title=Résultats préliminaires des élections présidentielles du 20 Novembre 2016 pic.twitter.com/i9GsrkkU8p }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-haiti-elecion-idUKKBN13O08L |title=Businessman Moise wins Haiti election in first round - provisional results |publisher=Reuters |date=29 November 2016 |access-date=16 November 2017 |location=Port-au-Prince |first=Makini |last=Brice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Jovenel Moïse was born to a middle-class family in [[Trou-du-Nord]], [[Nord-Est (department)|Nord-Est]]. He is the son of Etienne Moïse, a merchant, and Lucia Bruno, a seamstress.

In July 1974, his family moved to [[Port-au-Prince]], where he attended the Don Durélin National School, the Lycée Toussaint Louverture, and the Cultural Center of the [[Collège Canado-Haïtien]]. He studied [[political science]] at [[Université Quisqueya]] and married Martine Marie Etienne Joseph, a classmate, in 1996. That year, he left the capital and moved to [[Port-de-Paix]] with the goal of developing [[rural area]]s.

==Business career==
With little investment capital, Moïse created his first business in Port-de-Paix: JOMAR Auto Parts, still in operation today.

Shortly after, he began a project to provide clean water to rural areas. In 2001, he partnered with Culligan, a company based in Port-au-Prince. With loans from financial institutions and individuals, he opened a water plant serving the departments of [[Nord-Ouest (department)|Nord-Ouest]] and Nord-Est.

In 2004, Moïse became a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Northwest (CCINO). Soon after, he was elected president of CCINO. He later became secretary general of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti (CCIH), where he helped increase the representation of the regional Chambers of Commerce within the national organization.

In 2008, he helped found the Haitian Energy Company SA, which aims to bring [[Solar power|solar]] and [[wind power]] to 10 communes in Nord-Ouest.

In 2012, in Trou-du-Nord, he founded Agritrans SA and helped create Haiti's first agricultural [[free trade zone]], a banana plantation spread out on nearly 1,000 hectares of land in [[Nord-Est (department)|Nord-Est]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haiti Libre Staff|title=Haïti - Portrait : Qui est Jovenel Moïse ?|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/article-15872-haiti-portrait-qui-est-jovenel-moise.html|website=Haiti Libre|accessdate=30 November 2016|language=French|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to more than a dozen agricultural projects that created almost 3,000 direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

==Political career==
In 2015, President [[Michel Martelly]] designated Moïse as the presidential candidate of the political party Martelly founded, the [[Haitian Tèt Kale Party]] (PHTK).

In his campaign, Moïse promoted [[Biodynamic agriculture|bio-ecological agriculture]] as an economic engine for Haiti, whose population is over 50% rural. He also expressed support for policies pursued by Martelly: [[Universal access to education|universal education]] and [[Universal health care|health care]], energy reform, [[rule of law]], the creation of sustainable jobs, environmental protection, and development of Haiti as a destination for [[ecotourism]] and [[agritourism]].

Moïse received 32.8% of votes in the first round of the 2015 elections held on 15 October 2015, qualifying for a [[Two-round system|runoff]] with the second-place finisher, [[Jude Célestin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.S. Presses for Haiti Runoff Vote Amid Fears of Violence and Fraud|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/americas/us-presses-for-haiti-runoff-vote-amid-fears-of-violence-and-fraud.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 21 January 2016|access-date = 7 February 2016|issn = 0362-4331|first = Frances|last = Robles}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an exit poll conducted by the ''Haiti Sentinel'' showed Moïse receiving only 6% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Only 6% voted for Jovenel Moïse according to Exit Poll|url = http://sentinel.ht/2015/11/19/exit-poll-says-jovenel-moise/|website = Haiti Sentinel|access-date = 7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many observers called the results fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Haitian observers: ‘Massive fraud’ in vote|url = http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article41860518.html|website = Miami Herald|access-date = 7 February 2016|last = Charles|first = Jacqueline|date = 29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people took to the streets in violent protest, forcing the postponement of the runoff election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Haiti Postpones Presidential Runoff as Violence Rises|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/world/americas/haiti-postpones-presidential-runoff-vote.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 22 January 2016|access-date = 7 February 2016|issn = 0362-4331|first = Frances|last = Robles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2016, election officials said Moïse had won the 2016 election in the first round based on preliminary results, with an estimated voter turnout of 21%.&lt;ref name="MH"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jacqueline Charles|title=Banana farmer wins Haiti presidency, according to preliminary results|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article117626878.html|website=Miami Herald|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judith Hoback Miller''' (born May 10, 1937)&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KLPJ-144 Judy Hoback public record] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt; was an investigative source in the [[Watergate scandal]] in 1972 during the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]]. She served as the [[accountant|bookkeeper]] for the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19920615&amp;id=ZnJiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G3cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1259,4994037 Bookkeeper was Watergate Source] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Miller was born in [[Pennsylvania]], the daughter of Lois ([[née]] Litchfield; 1899-1955) and Charles Luther Graham (1895-1951). Her father was an athletic coach at [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania|West Chester University]] with its swimming pool named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcupagoldenrams.com/mobile/hof.aspx?hof=7 Charles Graham at West Chester] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt; He had served in World War I and is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] with her mother. She has two brothers, Ross Graham and David Graham (d. 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pottsmerc/obituary.aspx?pid=163986161 David Graham Obituary] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller was married and had a daughter Kelly with her first husband James Hoback (1938-1970), who died of a heart attack. In 1984 she married Grover Miller, owner of the firm "H &amp; M Marketing" for which she worked as the accountant. Miller is retired and lives in Florida with her second husband. Her daughter is a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18452609 The Women of Watergate] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gnln2y7sTOkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=judy%20hoback%20watergate Secrets of the FBI] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watergate==
Miller (then Hoback) was working as the bookkeeper for [[Richard Nixon]]'s re-election campaign in 1972 when [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] contacted her for information. Woodward has stated that she was just as important as [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] for unveiling the Watergate Scandal, because she had knowledge about where money was going and who it was coming from.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/06/woodward-and-bernstein-downplay-deep-throat-125950.html Woodward downplays Deepthroat] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobeck was one of the few people who would talk freely with Woodward and Bernstein, allowing them to come to her home, although she has stated she was "pretty nervous and scared" and was also "frustrated that the truth wasn't coming out". She had already notified the [[FBI]] and felt they were not handling the investigation properly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2012/06/30/156049593/watergate-all-the-presidents-men-but-women-too Judy Hoback Miller interview] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt; She revealed to Woodward and Bernstein that evidence of financial misconduct had been destroyed, and some of the committee members including [[G. Gordon Liddy]] and [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]] were receiving payouts from a secret fund. This information advanced the investigation that lead to [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation from the office of President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=judy_hoback_1 History of Watergate] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6u0pjYfoFGUC&amp;pg=PT295&amp;lpg=PT295#v=onepage&amp;q=judy%20hoback%20watergate Watergate, The Scandal] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal in media==
In the 1976 film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', actress [[Jane Alexander]] portrayed Judy Hoback, who is referred to as "The Bookkeeper" in the screenplay. Alexander met with Hoback to prepare for the role, and the production rented Hoback's  former home for her character's scenes. Some historians{{who|date=May 2018}} have criticized the film for downplaying the importance of Hoback's role in the scandal. Jane Alexander was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/watergate-revisited-20-years-after-the-break-in-the-story-continues-to-unfold/2012/06/04/gJQAKaAqIV_story.html Watergate revisited] accessed 8-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

General '''Kim Kyong-hui''' ({{korean|hangul=김경희|hanja=金敬姬}}; born 30 May 1946) is the aunt of current [[North Korea]]n leader, [[Kim Jong-un]].  She is the daughter of the founding North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] and the sister of the late leader [[Kim Jong-il]]. She currently serves as Secretary for Organization of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]. An important member of Kim Jong-il's inner circle of trusted friends and advisors,&lt;ref name="Mansourov"&gt;Mansourov (2004), p. IV-17&lt;/ref&gt; she was director of the WPK Light Industry Department from 1988 to 2012.&lt;ref name="baird"&gt;Baird (2003), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was [[Jang Sung-taek]], who was executed in December 2013 in [[Pyongyang]], after being charged with treason and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25359939|title=North Korean leader's uncle 'executed over corruption'|date=12 December 2013|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[File:Fahey DSCF3023 (6074798813).jpg|thumb|An idealized portrait of Kim Kyong-hui with her mother [[Kim Jong-suk]], father [[Kim Il-sung]] and brother [[Kim Jong-il]]]]
Kim Kyong-hui was born in [[Pyongyang]] on 30 May 1946, the youngest child of [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-suk]]. Her birth mother died when she was four. After her father remarried, she was raised by various surrogates away from the family.&lt;ref&gt;Koike, Yuriko. (2010) [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=5&amp;article_id=119330#axzz0zwdV6uYa "A ruthless sister risks becoming North Korea's next ruler"]. ''The Daily Star''; retrieved 19 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief period spent in [[Jilin Province]], [[China]] due to the [[Korean War]], she returned to Pyongyang with her brother, [[Kim Jong-il]]. She entered [[Kim Il-sung University]] in 1963, studying [[political economy]], where she met [[Jang Sung-taek|her future husband]]. The couple continued dating {{clarify|date=December 2011}} after he relocated to [[Wonsan]], allegedly because the Kim family opposed their relationship.&lt;ref name="NKLW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/kim-kyong-hui|title=Kim Kyong Hui|publisher=North Korea Leadership Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two eventually married in 1972. She attended the Kim Il-sung Higher Party School in 1966, and went to study at [[Moscow State University]] in 1968. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Personal life==
Kim and Jang had a daughter, Jang Kum-song (1977–2006), who lived overseas in Paris as an international student; she refused an order to return to Pyongyang and then reportedly committed suicide in September 2006 due to her parents' opposition to her relationship with her boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.joins.com/article/2450717.html?ctg=1000|title=파리의 김정일 조카 장금송 비운의 러브스토리 (Unlucky love story of Kim Jong-il's niece in Paris)|language=Korean|publisher=JoongAng Ilbo|date=18 September 2006|accessdate=30 May 2007|last=Yi|first=Yeong-jong|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233252/http://www.joins.com/article/2450717.html?ctg=1000 |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kim Kyong-hui's political career began in 1971 with a position in the [[Korean Democratic Women's Union]], and in 1975 she was transferred to the post of vice-director of the International Liaison Department of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]], promoted to first vice-director in 1976. It was the period when North Korea was establishing diplomatic relations with a number of capitalist countries, like [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], as well as the United Nations. She oversaw the placement of qualified diplomatic personnel during her tenure as International Department vice-director.&lt;ref name="NKLW"/&gt;

In 1988, she was promoted to [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Central Committee]] member and director of the Light Industry Department. In 1990, she was elected deputy to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] for the first time. Her role was particularly significant as she led the Economic Policy Inspection Department, then again the Light Industry Department during the "[[Arduous March]]" period after [[Death of Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung's death]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Kim Kyong-hui disappeared from the limelight in 2003, in the same period when Jang Sung-taek was apparently purged as well.&lt;ref name="NKLW"/&gt; However, while her husband resurfaced with a high-level position in 2007, she did not appear in public until 2009, playing a more and more prominent role, accompanying Kim Jong-il to several inspection tours and attending official events. On 27 September 2010, it was announced that she was made a general in the [[Korean People's Army]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/world/asia/28korea.html|title=Kim's Son Elevated Before Meeting|last=McDonald|first=Mark|date=27 September 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first woman in North Korea to achieve this military rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11297747|title=North Korea's secretive 'first family'|date=2013-12-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This coincided with her nephew [[Kim Jong-un]]'s promotion to the same rank. A day later, the 3rd Conference of the Workers’ Party elected her as a member of the Political Bureau, which is the central organization of the party. Kim Kyong-hui later continued to pose as a prominent member of the North Korean leadership under Kim Jong-un. She was elected member of the WPK Secretariat and a leading figure of the [[Organization and Guidance Department of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Organization and Guidance Department]] (the foremost party department led by her uncle [[Kim Yong-ju]] until 1974, and by Kim Jong-il himself from 1974 till [[Death of Kim Jong-il|his death]]) at the 4th Party Conference in April 2012. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

According to [[South Korea]]n sources, she also worked as Kim Jong-il's personal aide.&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;''Chosun Ilbo'', dated 11 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Her influential position in North Korean echelons (also confirmed by [[Kenji Fujimoto]]) allowed her to maintain close relations with president [[Kim Yong-nam]] of the [[Supreme People's Assembly|SPA Presidium]], WPK Secretaries [[Choe Thae-bok]] and [[Kim Ki Nam]], and Director [[Kim Yang-gon]] of the WPK United Front Department.&lt;ref name="NKLW"/&gt; Her post as head of the Light Industry Department gave her a prominent role in shaping North Korean economic policy as it was shifting its focus on developing light industry.&lt;ref name="Editorials"&gt;2010, 2011 New Year editorials by ''Rodong Sinmun'', ''Joson Inmingun'', and ''Chongnyon Jonwi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Kim Kyong-hui opened the first hamburger restaurant in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/burger-10152010151052.html|title=Happy Meals in Pyongyang?|publisher=Radio Free Asia|date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution of Jang Sung-taek==

On 8 December 2013, her husband, [[Jang Sung-taek]] was publicly expelled from the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]]. Jang was accused of factionalism, corruption, and a range of misbehaviour that included affairs with other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nknews.org/2013/12/jang-song-thaek-purge-confirmed-amid-rumors-of-his-execution|title=Jang Song Thaek purge confirmed amid rumors of his execution|work=NK News|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|location=South Korea|url=http://renewal.dailynk.com/english/read_photo.php?num=11248&amp;cataId=nk03100|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213001111/http://renewal.dailynk.com/english/read_photo.php?num=11248&amp;cataId=nk03100|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 December 2013|title=Jang Arrested on State Television|work=Daily NK|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December, it was reported that he had been executed for treason.&lt;ref name="Means"&gt;Alexandre Mansourov, [http://38north.org/2013/12/amansourov121313 "North Korea: What Jang's Execution Means for the Future"], 38north.org; 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Gale, [https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/12/13/what-north-korea-said-about-jang-song-thaek "What North Korea Said About Jang Song Thaek"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] released a roster of six top officials appointed to a national committee in charge of organizing a [[state funeral]] for [[Kim Kuk-tae]], a former Workers' Party official. The roster included the name of Kim Kyong-hui, indicating she had survived the purge and remained in favour.&lt;ref name="Choe"&gt;Choe Sang-hun, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/world/asia/kim-jong-uns-aunt-appears-to-survive-husbands-purge.html "Kim Jong-un's Aunt Appears to Survive Husband's Purge"], ''The New York Times'', 15 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/kim-jong-un-aunt-position-influence-husband "Kim Jong-un's aunt retains position of influence after husband's downfall"], 15 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25391160 | work=BBC News | title=North Korean execution 'will not alter trade goals' | date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/15/us-korea-north-idUSBRE9BE01T20131215 | work=Reuters | title=North Korean leader's influential aunt remains in power after uncle Jang's execution | date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of Kim Kyong-hui's relationship with Jang had been a subject of frequent speculation. Analysts believe that Jang and Kim Kyong-hui had been estranged.&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt; Yoon Sang-hyun, a [[National Assembly of South Korea]] deputy floor leader of the governing [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]], said that Kim had been "separated" from Jang and did not oppose his purge.&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt;

In recent years, Kim Kyong-hui has been rumored to be either dead or very ill.&lt;ref name="tele_KimJ"/&gt; According to a report by the ''[[Daily NK]]'' in August 2012, she has suffered from ill health due to [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Alcohol A Threat To Kim Guardianship Role", ''[[Daily NK]]'', 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Fischer, who wrote "A Kim-Jong-Il Production", she has suffered from this disease every so often since at least the late 1970's. This has prompted at least one rehab trip into China for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;A Kim Jong-Il Production, Paul Fischer, pg 214&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, it has been suggested that she has had a fatal stroke or a heart attack.&lt;ref name="edit_Kimo"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Kim ordered aunt poisoned: N.

==Biography==

Ott was born in the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Mount Hermon, Louisiana|Mount Hermon]] in [[Washington Parish, Louisiana|Washington Parish]] in southeastern Louisiana, one of the [[Florida Parishes]]. He was the sixth of ten children (one died on the day of birth), born to Elbert Weston Ott (1855-1924) of Mount Hermon, Louisiana, who was of [[Germany|German]] and [[France|French]] descent, and the former Martha Estelle Leggett (1860-1955, a native of [[Mississippi]]. His father was engaged in the mercantile and planting businesses and instituted the [[United States Postal Service|post office]] in Mount Hermon. Young Ott worked in his father's store and office and became self-educating in the field of accounting. The senior Ott was known for his strong support for [[prohibition]] of [[alcohol|alcoholic beverages]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-YxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1058&amp;lpg=PA1058&amp;dq=Lionel+Gordon+Ott+of+New+Orleans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R68X-S6TWg&amp;sig=zyauwNgHvPCUPfdPfwGyi7AJfZM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JXzVKipKcKsyATQmYCoDQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Lionel%20Gordon%20Ott%20of%20New%20Orleans&amp;f=false|title=History of New Orleans, Vol. 3|author=John Smith Kendall|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|location=[[Chicago]] and [[New York City]]|date=1922|pages=1058–1059|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Ott moved to New Orleans to enter the accounting firm of Smith and Skinner. In 1921, he formed his own company, Ott and Prados.&lt;ref name=lgott/&gt; He was active in the [[Masonic lodge]] and the Young Men's Business Club.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

In 1940, Ott was elected to one of the eight state Senate slots from [[Orleans Parish, Louisiana|Orleans Parish]]. He served during the administrations of [[governor of Louisiana|Governors]] [[Sam H. Jones]] and [[Jimmie Davis]]. He resigned in 1945 early in his second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.la.gov/Documents/Membership/1880membership.pdf|title=Membership in the Louisiana State Senate since 1880|publisher=senate.la.gov|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he was elected commissioner of finance on the New Orleans City Council under the [[city commission government]]. He was reelected as finance commissioner in 1950.&lt;ref name=lgott&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/inv/council/ott.htm|title=Commissioner Lionel G. Ott|publisher=nutrias.org|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mayor of New Orleans|mayor]] at the time of Ott's two council terms was [[deLesseps Story Morrison]], a subsequent three-time candidate for governor.

In 1952, Ott joined the [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]] of gubernatorial candidate [[James M. McLemore]]  a [[cattle]]man from [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] in [[Central Louisiana]], in an unsuccessful bid for [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governor]]. Much of the campaigning was conducted in the last few months of 1951.&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Herald'', January 3, 1952, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[New Orleans Public Library]] (nutrias.org) erroneously states that Lionel Ott was the running-mate of [[Robert F. Kennon]] in 1952, instead of [[James M. McLemore]]. Elmer David Conner (1905-1965) of [[Jennings, Louisiana|Jennings]] in [[Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Davis Parish]] in southwestern Louisiana, was Kennon's running-mate and later his director of the Louisiana Department of Commerce and Industry.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Robert F. Kennon]] won the governorship, [[C. E. "Cap" Barham]] of [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]], the choice of gubernatorial candidate [[Hale Boggs]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] from [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]],&lt;ref&gt;"Boggs '52 ticket listed", ''Minden Herald'', October 19, 1951, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; was placed into a [[runoff election]] with the later Governor [[John McKeithen]] for the second position. Barham prevailed and served one term until his own defeat in 1956 by the educator [[Lether Frazar]].

Ott was twice married; his wives were the former Helen Merritt and Carolyn McCormick (1912-2007). He had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jliptrap.us/gen/devecmon.htm|title=332. Elbert Weston Ott|publisher=jliptrap.us|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is interred beside his second wife at [[Metairie Cemetery]] in New Orleans.&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

Ott's papers are housed at the [[New Orleans Public Library]].&lt;ref name=lgott/&gt;

== AEK Athens involvement ==
[[File:Nik8.jpg|thumb|130px|Notias at OACA]]
With AEK struggling terribly in corruption and the prospect of relegation to the fourth division looming, [[Demis Nikolaidis]] (ex club charismatic player) supported by the majority of AEK fans, established a [[consortium]] of businessmen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capital.gr/news.asp?Details=554393 |script-title=el:ΠΑΕ με "άρωμα θάλασσας" |publisher=Capital |date=2008-08-11 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Polys V. Hajioannou]], [[Petros Pappas]] and [[Takis Kanellopoulos (businessman)|Takis Kanellopoulos]], who convinced Nikos Notias to participate in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;artid=190905&amp;ct=5&amp;dt=07/09/2008 |script-title=el:Νίκος Νοτιάς |publisher=To Bhma Online |date=2008-09-07 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was made by Ghikas Goumas, grandson of the late Nikos Goumas (former President of the Club). At the first contact, which was held in [[New York City]], Nikos Notias was convinced that the operators had pure purposes, and a great vision for the clubs regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport24.yooblog.gr/2008/09/05/441/ |script-title=el:Γλυκός Νοτιάς |publisher=SPORT 24 |date=2008-09-05 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714114336/http://sport24.yooblog.gr/2008/09/05/441/ |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small doubts initially led Notias to take a small percentage of shares (about 8%) but he changed his mind quickly, when he realized that the fans totally backed-up the effort and gradually, over a period of three and a half years, he became the major holder of the shares, reaching 35%. His financial assistance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=37287 |script-title=el:Μόνο ο Νοτιάς βάζει λεφτά! |publisher=Ελευθεροτυπία Online |date=2009-04-22 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the club amounts to 18 million [[euros]] but the largest and most expected [[project]] of Nikos Notias, remains the clubs Sports Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;ct=5&amp;artid=85211 |script-title=el:"Απογειώνεται" από τα Σπάτα |publisher=TA NEA Online |date=2008-09-04 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will cost over 25 million [[euros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aek365.gr/article.php?id=56339 |script-title=el:Χλιδή το προπονητικό |publisher=Aek365.gr |date=2010-04-21 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the biggest project in the modern history of the club and Notias's intention is to name it "Harry Notias" in honour of his father. Among the tremendous economic crisis in Greece and due to the clubs financial problems, AEK Athens in June 2013 declared bankruptcy and was self-relegated to the amateur third division. The Athletic Center of Spata nowadays includes state of the art facilities, three fields (one of them with synthetic turf) for soccer, a fitness and health center with weight-training and fitness rooms, a cryotherapy center and more. Unfortunately, the rest of the project (the clubs Museum, Hotel, Aquatic Center and two more soccer fields) could not be delivered and remained unfinished.

'''''Other People's Money''''' is a 1991 American [[comedy-drama film|comedy-drama]] film starring [[Danny DeVito]], [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Penelope Ann Miller]]. It was based on the [[Play (theatre)|play]] of the same name by [[Jerry Sterner]]. The film adaptation was directed by award winner [[Norman Jewison]], and written by [[Alvin Sargent]].

==Plot==
Lawrence "Larry the Liquidator" Garfield ([[Danny DeVito]]) is a successful [[corporate raid]]er who has become rich buying up companies and selling off their assets. With the help of a computerized stock analyzing program called "Carmen", Garfield has identified New England Wire &amp; Cable Company as his next target. The struggling company is run by the benevolent and folksy Andrew "Jorgy" Jorgenson ([[Gregory Peck]]) and is the primary employer in its small [[Rhode Island]] town in [[New England]]. The company is doing okay and stock is rising.

Garfield decides to take over the company. After Jorgy learns that he has filed a [[Schedule 13D]] report, and after stubbornly insisting that no outsider can seize control of a business his father began, Jorgy is finally persuaded to hire his stepdaughter Kate ([[Penelope Ann Miller]]), a big-city lawyer, to defend against a hostile takeover. Garfield is instantly smitten with the beautiful Kate, although he is on to her tactics and does not waver from his goal of becoming the majority stockholder of New England Wire &amp; Cable. Garfield tactlessly and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Despite their antagonism, Kate finds herself attracted to Garfield's bold nature.

The takeover attempt begins to fracture the New England Wire &amp; Cable Company family. Kate's mother Bea ([[Piper Laurie]]) secretly travels to Garfield's offices to offer one million dollars in [[greenmail]] to Garfield if he'll go away, but he refuses, stating, "I don't take money from widows or orphans." Trusted company president Bill Coles ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), fearful that the takeover will leave him with nothing, offers to let Garfield vote his shares in the company in exchange for a million-dollar payout. Garfield agrees, but specifies that Coles will get only half as much if his shares fail to make up the [[margin of victory]].

Garfield concedes to Jorgy's offer to let the matter be settled at the annual shareholder's meeting. Relying on the support of longtime friends and investors, Jorgy makes an impassioned plea to save the company, appealing to the traditions of manufacturing as opposed to the new breed of capitalism which Larry the Liquidator represents, in which buyers of companies create no products or jobs and are interested only in money. The shareholders seem swayed by Jorgy's speech and boo Garfield when he gets up to give a rebuttal.

In his rebuttal, Garfield compares New England Wire &amp; Cable to the last [[buggy whip]] manufacturer, arguing that even though the company's product may be high quality, changing technology has rendered it obsolete. Rather than running a failing business into the ground, he contends that the shareholders should follow his lead and get what value they can from the stock before the company's inevitable demise. At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket.

When the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company. The margin of victory is greater than Coles' shares and thus he does not receive the full amount he betrayed Jorgy to get.

Back at home in Manhattan, Garfield finds himself uncharacteristically despondent after his victory, having realized he has lost his chance for a romance with Kate. Just then, Kate calls. She's been having discussions with a [[Japan]]ese automaker that wants to hire New England Wire &amp; Cable to manufacture stainless steel wire cloth for making automobile [[airbag]]s, something which will make the company profitable again on a new expanding industrial product. An excited Garfield invites her to dinner to discuss it.

{{Unreferenced|section|date=February 2015}}
Some of the scenes that take place inside the factory were shot in the now defunct "Seymour Specialty and Wire" in [[Seymour, Connecticut|Seymour]], [[Connecticut]].

==Reception==
The film received mixed to negative reviews, with a 31% rating on review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 16 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/other_peoples_money/|title=Other People's Money|date=18 October 1991|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, but said 'I didn’t like the very last scene of “Other People’s Money.” It felt tacked on, manufactured, concocted out of a Hollywood studio’s knee-jerk need to provide a smileyface ending that was not in the spirit of the film'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/other-peoples-money-1991|title=Other People's Money|author=Roger Ebert|date=18 October 1991|publisher=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said of Sargent's adaptation, 'culminates in a speechy but effective debate about the merits of old-fashioned business versus the corporate takeover,' but still felt that the film was 'too genial to be hard-hitting.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Janet Maslin|author=Maslin, Janet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE0D91431F93BA25753C1A967958260|title=Review/Film; DeVito as a Corporate Raider With Cuddly Charm|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OverOps''' is a [[software analytics]] company based in San Francisco, CA and Tel Aviv, Israel. The company develops a [[Static program analysis|static]] and [[Dynamic program analysis|dynamic]] code analysis technology to analyze code events in real time. The technology's focus is large-scale [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://weblogs.java.net/blog/editor/archive/2013/11/20/takipi-analyzes-most-popular-code-libraries-java-developers-use-today-also-ruby-and-javascript-de Takipi Analyzes the Most Popular Code Libraries Java Developers]. java.net&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://typesafe.com/blog/Introducing-Takipi-God-Mode-in-Production-Scala-Code Introduction to Takipi]. typesafe.com&lt;/ref&gt; code bases.

== History ==
OverOps was founded as '''Takipi''' in December 2011. Prior to Takipi, Tal Weiss (CTO) and Iris Shoor (VP Product)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geektime.co.il/geek-on-one-iris-shoor/ Geek on one: Iris Shoor, founder Takipi]. geektime.co.il&lt;/ref&gt; co-founded VisualTao (acquired by [[Autodesk Inc]] in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/17/autodesk-acquires-sequoia-backed-software-design-startup-planplatform/ Audodesk acquires sequoia backed software design]. techcrunch.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Takipi received seed investment of $700K by private investors. In 2013 Takipi received $4.5 million in venture capital from [[Menlo Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000899427 Server debugging co Takipi raises $4.5M]. globes.co.il&lt;/ref&gt; 

On April 20, 2016, it was announced that Takipi raised $15 million in a funding round led by [[Lightspeed Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2016/04/20/term-sheet-wednesday-april-20/]. forbes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Takipi was renamed OverOps on August 25, 2016 to reflect a greater emphasis on services that support [[DevOps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.takipi.com/overops-rebrand/ |title=Takipi is Now OverOps |date=August 25, 2016 |first=Tal |last=Weiss |work=OverOps Blog |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2017, it was announced that OverOps raised $30 million in series C round led by [[Lightspeed Ventures]], with participation from [[Menlo Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/overops-scores-30-million-led-by-lightspeed-ventures/ OverOps scores $30 million led by Lightspeed Ventures] TechCrunch.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year OverOps was named a 2017 Cool Vendor in Performance Analysis By [[Gartner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OverOps Named a 2017 Cool Vendor in Performance Analysis By Gartner|url=https://blog.takipi.com/overops-named-a-2017-cool-vendor-in-performance-analysis-by-gartner/|website=OverOps Blog|accessdate=1 June 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the company announced the hiring of Rod Squires as CEO and move of founder Tal Weiss into the role of Chief Technology Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Analytics Company OverOps Hires Rod Squires as CEO|url=https://www.readitquik.com/news/business-support-solutionsservices/software-analytics-company-overops-hires-rod-squires-as-ceo/|website=ReadITQuik|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
OverOps uses a Java agent to perform code analysis and track code changes in real time. Using graph analysis, OverOps maps an application's [[codebase]] and the different connections between variables, methods and classes. When a runtime exception, log error or a performance issue&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2013/06/03/amazon-web-services-speeds-can-vary-by-up-to-200x-depending-on-region/ Amazon Web Services Speeds Can Vary By Up To 200x Depending On Region]. venturebeat.com&lt;/ref&gt; are reported, the code maps are used to record data of variable values, methods, threads and JVMs which led to the errors.  OverOps is delivered in a [[software as a service]] (SaaS) model, where the majority of the analysis is performed in the "[[Cloud computing|cloud]]".  The software can also be deployed in a hybrid model (where collector and agent are on-prem with analytics in the cloud) or fully on-prem for all components.

The '''Rail Delivery Group''' ('''RDG''') is the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|United Kingdom rail industry]] membership body that brings together passenger and freight rail companies, [[Network Rail]] and [[High Speed 2]].

==History==
From 24 October 2017, RDG replaced:
* The '''Association of Train Operating Companies''' ('''ATOC'''), comprising the passenger train operating companies. ATOC was set up by the train operators to ensure nationwide services – such as ticket acceptance and railcards – continued after the privatisation of the railways under the [[Railways Act 1993]].
* The former Rail Delivery Group, formed in 2011 to formulate policy and undertake communications on behalf of the entire rail industry. At first the group's members were the major passenger and freight train operator groups, together with [[Network Rail]]; membership was widened to all mainline passenger and freight operators in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/about-us.html|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=Rail Delivery Group|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new RDG is owned by its members, which are:
* Network Rail, the nationalised owner of the rail infrastructure
*[[High Speed 2|HS2]]
*The [[train operating company|train operating companies]] that provide passenger services
*The [[freight operating company|freight operating companies]]
*The [[Rail Supply Group]] (RSG) 

The new RDG owns both the [[National Rail]] and 'Britain Runs on Rail' brands.

The company's legal name continues to be ATOC Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03069033|title=ATOC Limited|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies House|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main operations==
* Revenue allocation and settlement through [[ORCATS]] systems
* [[National Rail Enquiries]] 
* [[Railcard]] marketing 
* Staff travel arrangements for current and retired train company staff 
* International products, such as Britrail and [[Interrail]]
* The relationship with [[Transport for London]] 
* The licensing of third party ticket sellers, such as [[Travel agency|travel agents]] and online sellers such as [[The Trainline]] and Red Spotted Hanky
* Sponsorship of the [[Plusbus]] and Cycle-Rail schemes
* Railway policy formulation
* Industry communications with the public
It also produces the definitive [[National Routeing Guide]], defining the validity of tickets, and has some input in the content of the ''[[National Fares Manual]]'', which is distributed by the National Rail website. It works with RSG to coordinate shared objectives.

==European equivalents==
As rail franchising also takes place in other countries, most European countries have one or more equivalent organisation.

In Germany, the ''[[:de:Tarifverband_der_Bundeseigenen_und_Nichtbundeseigenen_Eisenbahnen_in_Deutschland|Tarifverband der Bundeseigenen und Nichtbundeseigenen Eisenbahnen in Deutschland]]'' (Tariff Association of Federal and Non-Federal Railways in Germany; TBNE) is responsible for railway ticket revenue distribution. Political representation of TOCs is carried out by ''[[mofair e.V.]]''

In Sweden, the equivalent organisation is the ''[[Branschföreningen Tågoperatörerna]]'' (Association of Swedish Train Operating Companies).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20167">'''Raoul Weil''' (born 13 November 1959) is a [[Swiss banker]]. Weil is best known as being the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking at [[UBS AG]]. Weil eventually became a member of UBS's Group Executive Board.

During Weil’s tenure at UBS, the Bank became embroiled in the [[UBS tax evasion controversy|2008-09 U.S. tax evasion controversy]], which led to Weil’s voluntary departure from the Bank after he was indicted by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] for allegedly offering help to thousands of UBS’s U.S. clients who failed to pay their federal income taxes. Arrested in October 2013 during a trip to Italy, Weil has been extradited to the United States.&lt;ref name="Swiss banker in eye"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jucca|first=Lisa and Valentina Accardo|title=Swiss banker in eye of U.S. tax evasion storm to face court|url=https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-banker-eye-u-tax-evasion-storm-face-133139948--sector.html|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On  December 16, 2013, Weil was released on $10.5 million bail by the federal district court in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Florida judge grants bail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fagenson|first=Zachary|title=Florida judge grants $10.5 million bail for ex-UBS banker|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/16/us-banker-extradition-tax-bail-idUSBRE9BF16Q20131216|accessdate=17 December 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014 and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014.

==Early life==
Weil was born in Switzerland.  Weil graduated from the University of Basel with a degree in economics.&lt;ref name="Weil Arrested in Italy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinuzzi|first=Elisa|title=Fugitive Ex-UBS Wealth Management Chief Weil Arrested in Italy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-21/fugitive-ex-ubs-wealth-management-chief-weil-arrested-in-italy.html|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned a masters in economics with a specialization in national economics and business administration.

== Charitable Activities==
Raoul Weil is a member of the Optimus Foundation, a charitable foundation administered by UBS which helps with disease prevention and education across the world.  In 2008, Weil was elected chairman of the Optimus Foundation’s board, pledging the foundation to the goal of becoming the largest charitable organization in Switzerland in the next decade.&lt;ref name="Weil Elected Chairman of Optimus"&gt;{{cite journal|title=With vigor into the future|url=http://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth_management/optimusfoundation/downloads/_jcr_content/par/table_2728.186018188.file/dGFibGVUZXh0PS9jb250ZW50L2RhbS91YnMvZ2xvYmFsL3dlYWx0aF9tYW5hZ2VtZW50L29wdGltdXNmb3VuZGF0aW9uLzEzMzU0N19VQlNfT3B0aW11c19lLnBkZg==/133547_UBS_Optimus_e.pdf|publisher=UBS Optimus World|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Weil led the Global UBS Philanthropy Forum, which brought together philanthropists, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, and representatives from civil society from around the world to consider the theme of “Building Change Communities.”&lt;ref name="UBS Philanthropy Forum brought to Asia for first time"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global UBS Philanthropy Forum brought to Asia for the first time|url=http://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/about_us/news/news.html/en/2008/09/12/2008_09_12.html|publisher=UBS|date=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking career==
After he finished active duty in the Swiss military in 1984, Weil was hired by the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC), and worked in SBC's private banking division in [[Basel]], [[Zurich]], [[Monaco]], [[New York City]], and [[Hong Kong]] from 1984 until 1998. When SBC and UBS merged in 1998, Weil joined UBS as part of its private banking division for Asia and Europe, becoming head of UBS's Wealth Management International unit in 2002. In July 2007, Weil became CEO of WM&amp;BB.&lt;ref name="Weil Declared Fugitive"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolker|first=Carlyn|title=Ex-UBS Executive Raoul Weil Declared a Fugitive by U.S. Judge|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aSEvhPR7Ok6A|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2008, Weil voluntarily relinquished his duties with UBS to focus on his defense after being indicted in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS's US cross-border business by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Statement on Indictment of UBS Executive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/media/global/releases/news_display_media_global.html/en/2008/11/12/2008_11_12.html|title=Statement On Indictment Of UBS Executive|publisher=UBS|date=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States issued an international arrest warrant for Weil in 2008.

On May 23, 2008, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (EBK, the predecessor to FINMA) opened an investigation into UBS’s role in facilitating tax evasion by its US clients.  The EBK concluded, among other things, that UBS’s “top management” was not aware of the Bank’s US clients’ fraudulent conduct, and were not “accessories or accomplices” to UBS’s violations.&lt;ref name="EBK investigation of UBS business with US private clients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finma.ch/d/aktuell/Documents/kurzbericht-ubs-x-border-20090218-e.pdf|title=EBK investigation of the cross-border business of UBS AG with its private clients in the USA|publisher=FINMA|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBK also found that the US cross-border business’s managers at the time – Martin Liechti and Michel Guignard&lt;ref name="US Senate Staff Report on Tax Haven Banks"&gt;{{cite web|url=TAX HAVEN BANKS AND U. S. TAX COMPLIANCE: Staff Report|title=|publisher=US Senate|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; – were the principal architects of UBS’s wrongdoing and had actively concealed their misconduct from Weil.&lt;ref name="EBK investigation of UBS business with US private clients"/&gt;

After leaving UBS, Weil was hired as a consultant in 2010 by Reuss Private Group ([[Pfäffikon, Schwyz]], Switzerland), eventually becoming a managing partner.&lt;ref name="Italian police arrest fugitive"&gt;{{cite news|title=Italian police arrest ‘fugitive’ Swiss banker|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/Italian_police_arrest_fugitive_Swiss_banker_.html?cid=37154608|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=International Service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of 2013, he succeeded [[Adriano B. Lucatelli]] as chief executive officer of Reuss Private Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to the arrest of Raoul Weil|url=http://www.frank-cs.org/cms/pdfs/CH/RPG/RPG_Weil_PressRelease_21.10.13.pdf|publisher=Reuss Private Group|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, FINMA granted Reuss a license to deal in securities and certified that Reuss management, including Weil, was engaged in “proper business conduct” (Gewähr für eine einwandfreie Geschäftstätigkeit).  As part of the application process, Weil confirmed in writing that he had not concealed anything with respect to the US-UBS tax dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verhafteter Banker hatte Persilschein der Finma|url=http://bazonline.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Verhafteter-Banker-hatte-Persilschein-der-Finma/story/25021011|publisher=Tages Anzeiger|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2013, Weil was replaced by Felix Brem as CEO of Reuss Private Group.&lt;ref name="Felix Brem new CEO of Reuss Private Group"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felix Brem new CEO of Reuss Private Group|url=http://reussprivategroup.com/uploads/media/RPG_CEO_131202_eng.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=Reuss Private Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Tax Evasion Controversy==
{{main article|UBS tax evasion controversy}}
In 2008, the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] began probing a multimillion-dollar [[UBS tax evasion controversy|tax evasion]] case involving UBS due to disclosures made by [[Brad Birkenfeld]], a former UBS banker in Switzerland, who was arrested entering the United States and cooperated with the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the US [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], and the US [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jTfwAG7pDZAUUS8_feZQgnnHAeaQ |title=AFP: FBI 'to probe Swiss bank UBS' in tax dodging case |publisher=[[Google News]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=June 22, 2008 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107001519/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jTfwAG7pDZAUUS8_feZQgnnHAeaQ |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1036|title=National Whistleblowers Center – Bradley Birkenfeld Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Whistleblowers]].org|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concurrently, a [[United States Senate]] subcommittee accused Swiss banks, including UBS, of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through [[offshore account]]s, which it estimated cost of the U.S. excess of US$100&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="UBS Says It Won’t Turn Over More Names in IRS Suit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Voreacos, Donmoyer|first=David, Ryan|title=UBS Says It Won’t Turn Over More Names in IRS Suit|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aWDQWshGiCig|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4348822.ece|title=US Senate claims UBS 'colluded' behind Swiss bank secrecy laws|work=The Times|accessdate=February 20, 2009|place=London|first1=Miles|last1=Costello|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121624391105859731?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Offshore Tax Evasion Costs U.S. $100&amp;nbsp;billion, Senate Probe of UBS and LGT indicates|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 17, 2008|accessdate=February 20, 2009|first=Evan|last=Perez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, UBS announced that it would cease providing cross-border private banking services to US-domiciled clients through its non-US regulated units as of July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20081112006425&amp;newsLang=en|title=Statement on Indictment of UBS Executive|publisher=[[BusinessWire]]|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its investigation into the conduct of UBS’s US cross-border business, DOJ demanded client banking records from UBS.  Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, UBS was prohibited from turning over such documents.  The Swiss government interceded and began negotiating with DOJ in an effort to persuade DOJ to stop trying to force UBS to violate Swiss law. On November 6, 2008, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Raoul Weil in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3aa635bc-b124-11dd-8915-0000779fd18c,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F3aa635bc-b124-11dd-8915-0000779fd18c.html%3Fnclick_check%3D1&amp;_i_referer=&amp;nclick_check=1|title=UBS suffers offshore blow as US indicts wealth management head|work=Financial Times|accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOJ obtained an order from the court there placing the indictment under seal. On November 10, 2008, Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz and Head of the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulsen asking that DOJ go through the information-sharing provisions of the US-Switzerland Double Taxation Treaty if it wanted to obtain information regarding UBS’s clients.  Weil’s indictment was unsealed two days later, on November 12, 2008.  According to one high-level Swiss source, “[t]hat was a clear message . . . One can imagine that without the letter they would have at least delayed the indictment of Weil.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE63823U20100409?pageNumber=4&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=How the U.S. cracked open secret vaults at UBS|publisher=Reuters|date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil soon thereafter left the Bank to focus on the criminal case. On February 18, 2009, UBS agreed to pay a fine of US$780&amp;nbsp;million to the U.S. government and entered into a [[deferred prosecution agreement]] on charges of conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding the [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a_TaQP5WVZuA&amp;refer=home|title=UBS Will Pay $780&amp;nbsp;million to Settle U.S. Tax Claims, Bloomberg.com website (18 Feb 2009)|publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 30, 2005|accessdate=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-tax-136.html|title=UBS Enters into Deferred Prosecution Agreement|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/business/worldbusiness/19ubs.html?hp|title=A Swiss Bank Is Set to Open Its Secret Files|date=February 19, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 19, 2009|first=Lynnley|last=Browning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20905.htm |title=U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 20905 / February 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103115944/http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20905.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2013 }} Retrieved on July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Weil’s charges were not dismissed as part of UBS’s deal, and he continued to face charges even after UBS had settled its criminal case and a subsequent dispute with the US government and IRS in the Fall of 2009, which resulted in UBS’s agreeing to turn over thousands of US customer files to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/business/worldbusiness/19ubs.html?hp&amp;_r=0|title=A Swiss Bank Is Set to Open Its Secret Files|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/business/global/18irs.html|title=14,700 Disclosed Offshore Accounts|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2014, the National Whistleblowers Center claimed that Weil "will make a sweetheart deal with the DOJ" because he has "information that would be extremely embarrassing to wealthy and powerful people" in the United States and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowersblog.org/2014/01/articles/tax-whistleblowers/federal-court-hearing-scheduled-for-ubs-tax-fraud-kingpin-raoul-weil/|title=Federal Court Hearing Scheduled for UBS Tax Fraud Kingpin Raoul Weil| publisher=Whistleblowers Protection Blog|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding this claim, no such deal has apparently been reached.  Weil is preparing for trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/07/ex-ubs-executive-weil-faces-eight-month-wait-as-u-s-trial-delayed/|title=Ex-UBS Executive Weil Faces Eight-Month Wait as U.S. Trial Delayed| publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date= February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Issues==

Weil was declared a fugitive by Judge James Cohn on January 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aSEvhPR7Ok6A&amp;refer=home "Ex-UBS Executive Raoul Weil Named Fugitive by U.S. Judge" Bloomberg News, 14 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Weil has maintained his innocence of the charges against him. Weil, who remained in Switzerland, his home country and place of residence, after being indicted, maintains that he did not run from the United States.&lt;ref name="Florida judge grants bail"/&gt;

===Extradition to U.S.===

On October 19, 2013, Weil was arrested in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]] while on a trip from Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-manager svizzero Ubs accusato 
di frode fiscale arrestato a Bologna", Oct. 9, 2013, la Repubblica, at [http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/10/20/news/manager_svizzero_accusato_di_frode_fiscale_arrestato_a_bologna-69001372/?ref=HREC1-10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Martinuzzi &amp; Elena Logutenkova, "Fugitive Ex-UBS Wealth Management Chief Weil Arrested in Italy," Oct. 21, 2013, Bloomberg News, at [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-21/fugitive-ex-ubs-wealth-management-chief-weil-arrested-in-italy.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Weil's request for house arrest was turned down by Italian authorities,&lt;ref name="Judge rejects house arrest bid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jucca|first=Lisa|title=Judge rejects house arrest bid by jailed ex-UBS banker: source|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/17/us-banker-arrest-ubs-idUSBRE9AG04U20131117|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Weil decided not to contest extradition to the United States.&lt;ref name="Swiss banker in eye" /&gt; Weil's willingness to return to the U.S. raised the suspicion that he may have been offered a "sweetheart deal" by the U.S. Department of Justice, which treated another UBS conspirator, [[Martin Liechti]], extremely leniently, according to Bradley Birkenfeld's lawyer, [[Stephen M. Kohn]] of the [[National Whistleblower Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whistleblower Fears UBS Banker Raoul Weil Will Get Sweetheart Deal|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1448&amp;Itemid=71|publisher=National Whistleblower Center|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birkenfeld worked several levels below Weil at UBS, and apparently did not know him. According to Kohn, Weil "knows where all the skeletons are buried. Kohn claims that, "Weil can clearly bargain inside information he has that could be embarrassing to American officials or institutions for leniency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-UBS bank executive to enter plea in tax fraud case|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/07/uk-ubs-tax-banker-idUKBREA0606620140107|publisher=Reuters UK|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil has said in filings with the court that the wrongdoing was committed by people below him, who concealed their own misconduct from Weil.  He has also contended that the EBK investigation and decision exonerating Weil confirm that version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US-Recht in der Schweiz|url=http://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2014-26/us-recht-in-der-schweiz-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-262014.html|publisher=Die Weltwoche|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arraignment and Trial===

Charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS in his appearance before the federal district court in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] on 16, December 2013, Weil was released on bail under house arrest with friends in New Jersey by US Magistrate Judge Patrick Hunt.&lt;ref name="Florida judge grants bail"/&gt; At his January 7, 2014 arraignment, Weil pleaded not-guilty to helping U.S. taxpayers evade taxes on $20 billion in offshore assets.

The trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014 and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014.&lt;ref name="Ex-UBS Executive Weil Acquitte"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nesmith|first1=Susanah and David Voreacos|title=Ex-UBS Executive Weil Acquitted of U.S. Tax Conspiracy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-03/ex-ubs-executive-weil-acquitted-of-u-s-tax-conspiracy.html|website=BloombergBusiness.com|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurors deliberated just over an hour before returning a not guilty verdict. The acquittal is final as prosecution cannot appeal in this case.

'''Regina Margareten''' (1863–1959) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] entrepreneur, who became known as the "[[Matzoh]] Queen" of [[New York City]]. She immigrated to the United States in 1883, where the family set up a business which grew into [[Kosher food]] manufacturers Horowitz Brothers and Margareten Company. She was profiled several times by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and continued to attend the business until two weeks prior to her death.

==Career==
Regina Margareten was born in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], on either December 20 or 25, 1863, to Jacob Horowitz and his wife Miral Chayah Horowitz (née Brunner), who went by the name of Mary. At birth, Margareten was known as both Rebush and Hannah Rivka. While pregnant, she emigrated with her husband Ignatz Margareten and her parents in 1883 to the United States, where they settled in [[New York City]]. They opened a grocery store on the [[Lower East Side]], as they wanted to continue following [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The made their own [[matzoh]] for their first [[Passover]] while in the United States, and this grew over the following years to become the sole object of the family's business in New York, which was known as Horowitz Brothers and Margareten Company.{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}}

The business grew from using a rented bakery in their first year, to having a turnover of more than a million [[US dollars|dollars]] in 1931. Margareten would make checks on the matzoh routinely throughout each day, and proposed the use of [[wheat]] from three different American states to improve the quality of the matzoh, and expand the business into other [[Kosher]] products.{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}} When her husband died in 1923, she became Treasurer of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rossner|first1=Toby|title=Jewish Women Entrepreneurs|url=http://www.jvhri.org/stories/jewish-women-entrepreneurs,2815?|accessdate=November 2, 2017|work=Jewish Voice|date=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 50's, she would speak on the local radio just prior to Passover in both [[Yiddish]] and English. When the city took over the original business location in 1945, Margareten oversaw the opening of a larger facility in [[Long Island]].{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}} Margareten was profiled on several occasions in later life by ''[[The New York Times]]'', on her 80th birthday in 1942, on her 91st in 1953 and finally on December 24, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New York Times profiles Kosher food matriarch Regina Margareten at age 95|url=https://jwa.org/thisweek/dec/24/1957/regina-margareten|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to visit the plant daily until two weeks prior to her death at the age of 96 on January 15, 1959.{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}} In her obituary, ''The New York Times'' described her as the "Matzoh Queen".{{sfn |Hyman|Dash Moore| 1998| p=890}}

'''Richard Henry Lee Chichester''' (April 18, 1870 – February 2, 1930) was an American judge from [[Virginia]].

Chichester was born in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]]. His father was for many years a judge of the county courts of Fairfax and Alexandria, and his grandfather was Judge [[Richard C. L. Moncure]], a judge and president of the [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia]]. Chichester received his early education in private schools in Fairfax County and at [[St. John's Military Academy]] in Alexandria. His higher and legal education was received at the [[University of Virginia]]. At twenty-one, he was admitted to the bar and began practice in [[Stafford County, Virginia]] where he was shortly elected Commonwealth’s Attorney. He was elected judge of Stafford and King George Counties in 1898, serving until 1904 when the county courts were abolished. Resuming practice at that time, he entered a law partnership with his brother in Fredericksburg until his appointment, in 1910, as judge of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit. In 1924, he was appointed a judge of the Special Court of Appeals where he served until June 1, 1925. Upon the death of Judge [[Joseph L. Kelly]] in June 1925, he was elected to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. He remained on the court until his death.

====Philippine Olympic Committee====
{{see also|2016 and 2018 Philippine Olympic Committee elections}}
[[File:POC elections feb 2018 winners b.jpg|thumb|Vargas' election as POC President in February 2018.]]
Ricky Vargas first attempted to run for the position of Philippine Olympic Committee President in 2016, challenging then incumbent President, Jose "Peping" Cojuangco Jr. However his candidacy, along with Abraham Tolentino's who was vying for chairmanship, for the November 2016 elections were rejected after the sport's body commission on election which was led by [[Francisco Elizalde]] ruled them ineligible for being not being "active member". Vargas, who only attended in one general assembly of the POC, argued that being an active member does not equate to physical presence in the POC's general assembly. He attempted to have the November 2016 elections postponed by the Pasig Regional Trial Court to allow for dialogue between his camp and Cojuangco's but failed. Cojuangco secured a fourth term unopposed in the 2016 elections.

The Pasig court later ruled the results of the 2016 elections for the post of president and chairman null and void, said that the commission on elections cannot restrict or qualify the eligibility criteria of being an "active member", and ordered and election with Vargas and Tolentino as candidates to be held in February 23, 2018. An extraordinary meeting was held in February where the general assembly agreed to hold elections and a commissions on elections was formed which was also led by Francisco Elizalde. Given the latter fact, Vargas and Tolentino anticipated that they will be disqualified again though Elizalde allowed the two to run to avoid being cited in contempt by court despite the election head's view that the two are ineligible.

Vargas secured a 24–15 victory over Cojuangco for the post of POC President ending the latter's long tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/285547/ricky-vargas-beats-peping-cojuangco-poc-presidency|title=Ricky Vargas beats Peping Cojuangco for POC presidency|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|last=Reyes|first=Marc Anthony|date=February 23, 2018|accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas officially began his term&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pedralvez|first1=Bong|title=Oath-taking rites for POC leaders set|url=http://www.malaya.com.ph/business-news/sports/oath-taking-rites-poc-leaders-set|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=Malaya Business Insights|date=2 March 2018|quote=The source said Vargas preferred a separate occasion for the oath-taking “before he officially assumes his duties as the new POC president.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 5, 2018 when he took his oath before Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] in the [[Malacañang Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Virgil|title=New POC execs Vargas, Tolentino take oath before Duterte|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/645528/new-poc-execs-vargas-tolentino-take-oath-before-duterte/story/|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=GMA News|date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first board meeting under Vargas' tenure was held the day after where his predecessor turned over the POC flag to Vargas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Gerry|title=Ricky Vargas reaches out to predecessor Peping Cojuangco as POC leadership officially turned over|url=https://www.spin.ph/psc-poc/news/ricky-vargas-reaches-out-to-predecessor-peping-cojuangco-as-poc-leadership-officially-turned-over|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=Sports Interactive Network Philippines|date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5742">'''Rotary wheel blow molding systems''' are used for the high-output production of a wide variety of plastic extrusion [[blow molding|blow molded]] articles.

Multiple [[parison]] machines, with high numbers of molds are capable of producing over one million bottles per day in some configurations.

== Description ==
Rotary blow molding "wheels" are targeted to the high output production of containers.  They are used to produce containers from one to seven layers.  View stripe and In Mold Labeling (IML) options are available in some configurations.  Rotary wheels, which may contain from six to thirty molds, feature continuously extruded parisons.  Revolving sets of blow molds capture the parison or parisons as they pass over the extrusion head.  The revolving sets of molds are located on clamp "stations".

Rotary wheels come in different variations, including both continuous motion and indexing wheels, and vertical or horizontal variations. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheel machines are favored for their processing ease, due to having only single (or in some cases, two) parisons, and mechanical repeatability.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rotary Wheel Blow Molder.png|450px|thumb|left|Rotary wheel blow molding machine operation]] --&gt;

In some machinery configurations, the molds take on the shape of a "pie" sector.  Thus, if two or more parisons are used, each blow molded "log" has a unique length, requiring special downstream handling and trimming requirements.  In other machine configurations, the molds utilize "book style" opening mechanisms, allowing multiple parisons of equal length.  However, machines of this style typically have lower clamp force, limiting the available applications.

The mold close and open actuation is typically carried out through a [[linkage (mechanical)|toggle mechanism]] linkage that is activated during the rotational process by stationary cams. This mechanical repeatability is considered an advantage by most processors.

The method of wheel rotation is typically conducted through an electric motor with a "pinion" gear or small gear to or in mesh with a rotating "bull" gear or large gear. All utilities for blowing containers and for mold cooling are carried through the main shaft or the axle from which the wheel rotates about. These utilities include compressed air and water. Sequencing functions necessary to inflate the parison, hold the container prior to discharge and discharge are completed by mechanical actuation to [[pneumatic]] valves – resulting in a high degree of repeatability.

==Advantages &amp; disadvantages==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Captured Parison.png|160px|thumb|right|Schematic showing captured parisons in a dual parison rotary wheel mold]] --&gt;

Very tight weight and dimensional tolerances can be obtained on wheel equipment, as the parison is captured on both ends.  It is pinched in the preceding mold on the leading end, and positioned by the stationary flowhead die on the other end.  In [[shuttle machinery]] and [[reciprocating screw machinery]] multiple parisons are extruded and are free hanging.  Because there is always some variation in the parison length on these machines, bottle weight and tolerance consistencies are not as tight as on rotary wheel machinery.

Other advantages of wheel equipment include:
* Continuous extrusion
* Multi-layer coextrusion, with one to seven layers of plastic in the finished part
* In some applications, In Mold Labeling (IML) can be integrated with little or no cycle time penalty
* Parison programming capability, for optimization of wall thickness
* Reduced cycle time on light weight containers, compared to shuttle machinery.  Conversely, wheel equipment may suffer cycle time penalties on thick containers
* Easily implemented view stripe capability
* Ability to achieve very high outputs from a single machine - lowest "cost per bottle" when compared to other blow molding equipment
* Higher production efficiencies than most other extrusion blow molding equipment types

Disadvantages:
* Inability to produce bottles with calibrated neck finishes
* Downstream trimming required
* Machines typically dedicated to a narrow range of sizes.  Product change can be difficult, especially when downstream trimming changeovers are required.
* High initial capital investment

== Applications ==

The growth of wheel machinery in the United States was spurred by the conversion of [[motor oil]] containers from [[paperboard]] cans to plastic [[bottle]]s, and the conversion of [[laundry detergent]] from powder to liquid form.  Additional high volume applications have included single-serve [[juice]]s and drinkable [[yogurt]], [[condiment]]s, and household cleaning supplies.

'''Slavoljub Eduard Penkala''' ({{IPA-sh|slâʋɔʎuːb ɛ̂duard pɛŋkǎːla|hr}}) (20 April 1871 - 5 February 1922) was a [[Croatia]]n engineer and [[inventor]] of [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-[[Poles|Polish]]-[[Jews|Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=|first=|title=Google obilježio 141. godišnjicu rođenja Slavoljuba Penkale|pages= |publisher=[[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]] |date=2012-04-20|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/tech/google-obiljezio-141-godisnjicu-rodzenja-slavoljuba-penkale.html|accessdate=2012-04-20|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[HINA]] |title=Google se sjetio Penkale |pages= |publisher=[[Business.hr]] |date=2012-04-20 |url=http://www.business.hr/business-class/google-se-sjetio-penkale |accessdate=2012-04-20 |language=hr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420134705/http://www.business.hr/business-class/google-se-sjetio-penkale |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Penkala-Moster tvornica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"Penkala-Moster" pen and pencil company in Zagreb]]
Eduard Penkala was born in [[Liptovský Mikuláš|Liptószentmiklós]] (now Liptovský Mikuláš), then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], to Franciszek Pękała, who was of Polish heritage, and Maria Pękała (née Hannel), who was of Dutch descent. He attended the [[University of Vienna]] and [[TU Dresden|Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute]], graduating from the latter on March 25, 1898, and going on to earn a [[doctorate]] in [[organic chemistry]]. During his studies, he attended violin lessons where he met his future wife, pianist Emily Stoffregen. He then moved with his wife to [[Zagreb]] (which was then in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]). To mark his loyalty to his new homeland, he took on the Croatian name Slavoljub (the equivalent of slavophile), becoming a naturalized [[Croats|Croat]].

He became renowned for further development of the [[mechanical pencil]] (1906)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penkala.com.hr/en/penkala_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006053423/http://www.penkala.com.hr/en/penkala_en.htm |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; - then called an "automatic pencil" - and the first solid-ink [[fountain pen]] (1907).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croatia.hr/English/Penkala/Inovacije.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406220807/http://www.croatia.hr/English/Penkala/Inovacije.aspx |archivedate=2007-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborating with an entrepreneur by the name of [[Edmund Moster]], he started the Penkala-Moster Company and built a pen-and-pencil factory that was one of the biggest in the world at the time. The company, now called [[TOZ Penkala]], still exists today.

He also constructed the first Croatian aircraft to fly in the country, the [[Penkala 1910 Biplane]], flown by [[Dragutin Novak]], who was also the first Croatian pilot. He constructed and invented many other products and devices, and held a total of 80 [[patent]]s.

Among his patented inventions were:

* a [[hot water bottle]] - his first patented invention, the "Termofor"
* a type of bluing [[detergent]]
* a rail-car [[brake]]
* an [[battery (vacuum tube)#B battery|anode battery]]

He also founded another company called the Elevator Chemical Manufacturing Company, which produced various chemicals such as detergents, sealing wax, and "Radium Vinovica", a [[Patent medicine|patent-medicine]] – like product that was billed as curing [[rheumatism]].

He had four children with his wife, Emily.

Penkala died in Zagreb at the age of 50, after catching [[pneumonia]] on a business trip. He was buried at the [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, Mirogoj RKT-78-I-117&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Srđan Radovanović''' (born 1959) is a [[Serbia]]n lawyer and business executive. He was employed at the Secretariat for Internal Affairs in [[Belgrade]] and he also worked as an [[Lawyer|attorney]]. He was part of the management teams at "Grand kafa" and "Droga Kolinska", a member of the board of directors of "Soko Štark" and the board president of "Palanački kiseljak".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=5&amp;status=jedna&amp;vest=148566&amp;title_add=Sr%C4%91an%20Radovanovi%C4%87%20na%20%C4%8Delu%20%22Jat%20ervejza%22&amp;kword_add=jat%20ervejz,%20srdjan%20radovanovic Srđan Radovanović na čelu "Jat ervejza, ''Večernje novosti'', June 17, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2009, he became the [[chief executive officer]] (generalni direktor) of [[Jat Airways]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/drustvo.php?id=100028 Srđan Radovanović novi direktor "Jat ervejza", ''Blic'', July 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; the Serbian state-owned [[flag carrier]]. He had been appointed to the post by the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS). This appointment marked a break with the unwritten tradition that Jat CEOs should come from within the company and should have [[transport engineering]] backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/ekonomija.php?id=97739 Advokat na čelu „Jata”, ''Blic'', June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first press interview after his appointment, Radovanović stated that Jat's loss during the calendar year 2008 was [[euro|€]]80 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/ekonomija.php?id=101310 Očerupani avioni, ''Blic'', July 12, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715064533/http://www.blic.rs/ekonomija.php?id=101310 |date=July 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a brief interview in September, 2009, Radovanović said that in 2010, Jat Airways was expected to increase revenues to 150 million euros, and that there would be a further reduction in the company's losses. It was necessary to make large savings and this would be done by reducing the number of employees and introducing financial discipline in the company. Radovanovic also announced the renewal of a contract with the European aircraft manufacturer [[Airbus]] to renew the fleet and the acquisition of new aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/tema.php?id=141&amp;start=0&amp;nav_id=382273 Jat očekuje 150 mil. € prihoda u 2010, "B92", September 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Barely weeks into the job at Jat, Radovanović got embroiled in controversy when Serbian print media claimed that he had enabled his brother Radovan Radovanović, news editor of ''[[24 sata (Serbia)|24 sata]]'' newspaper, to travel on a special flight from [[Hurghada]] to [[Luxor]] in [[Egypt]]. The flight was carrying the grieving family members of Serbian tourists who had been killed in a bus accident on July 16, 2009 and was sponsored by the government. The flight took off from Belgrade to Hurghada on July 20, 2009 so that the families could claim the bodies of their loved ones who had been involved in the accident.  Radovan Radovanović had been sent by his newspaper to report from the accident site. The media claimed that, despite explicit orders from the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian Government]] that no one except family members should be on the flight, Radovanović had obtained a free ticket for his brother, thereby bypassing the added security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressonline.rs/page/stories/sr.html?view=story&amp;id=73632&amp;sectionId=37 Bruka i sramota: Direktor ‘Jata' ni mrtve ne poštuje!, ''Press'', July 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobias Lear''' (c. 1762 – October 11, 1816) is best known as the personal secretary to [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]]. Lear served Washington from 1784 until the former-President's death in 1799. Through Lear's journal, we receive the account of Washington's final moments and his last words: '' 'Tis well.''

Tobias Lear also served as third President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s envoy to Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti), and as peace envoy in the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa during the [[First Barbary War]] (1801–1805) and the [[Second Barbary War]] (1815). He was responsible for negotiating a peace treaty with the [[Bey of Tripoli]] that ended the first Barbary War.

==Early life==
[[File:PhiladelphiaPresidentsHouse.jpg|thumb|right|[[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Lear lived and worked in Washington's presidential mansion, 1790-93. His son was born there, and his first wife died there.]]

Lear was born on Hunking Street&lt;ref name="seacoast"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brighton1985"&gt;{{Harv|Brighton|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the seaport town of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], on September 19, 1762,&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt; a fifth-generation American and the fifth generation of his family named Tobias.&lt;ref name="zacks2005"&gt;{{Harv|Zacks,_Richard2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Tobias Lear (born August 1, 1737)&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt; (cousin of [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]]) and Mary Stillson Lear (born May 25, 1739).&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt; His parents were married on December 29, 1757.&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt; The family home on Hunking Street, which still stands today, had been built in 1742 by the Stillson family.&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt; Lear had an older sister named Mary (Polly).&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt;

Before going to college, Lear attended Dummer Charity School (now known as [[The Governor's Academy]])&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt; where Samuel Moody helped prepare Lear for college.&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt; Instead of joining the [[Continental Army]], as many of his contemporaries did, Lear attended [[Harvard College]], beginning in 1779,&lt;ref name="Brighton1985" /&gt; during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He graduated with 30 classmates in 1783.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

==Career==
He began his career by being an apprentice until his uncle, [[Benjamin Lincoln]], recommended him for the job of tutoring Martha Washington's grandchildren and to the post of George Washington's personal secretary, both to which he was hired in 1784. He was integrated into Washington's house and his post quickly evolved beyond clerk to being Washington's right-hand man, doing whatever Washington needed, such as tutoring, filling out expense reports, and writing letters. He performed all his duties well.

Lear moved with Washington to [[New York City]] in 1789, when Washington became president, and they often dined alone together during his presidency. Lear was responsible for filling out Washington's expense reports as president, which Washington had wisely chosen instead of a $25,000 salary, as they turned out to be much more.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

In 1793, at the start of Washington's second term, Lear decided to leave Washington and start out on his own (albeit with help from Washington). He started a company, T. Lear &amp; Company, which focused on two things: working with Washington's [[Potomac Company]] to promote river traffic to the soon-to-be nation's capitol and participating in [[land speculation]] there. Lear traveled to Europe to sell parcels of land in [[Washington, DC]], but was unsuccessful. His engineering work related to the Potomac Company also failed to enable navigation around two waterfalls on the [[Potomac River]]. He lost money in this failed venture despite his wealthy partners.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;
[[File:Tobias Lear John Taylor Gilman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Letter from Lear to [[John Taylor Gilman]] of [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], 1789]]

==Family life==
Lear married Mary (Polly) Long, his childhood sweetheart,&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt; in 1790.  Together they had a son, Benjamin Lincoln Lear (b. 1791), but Polly died in the [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House in Philadelphia]] during the 1793 [[Yellow fever]] epidemic that claimed around 5,000 people.&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt;  In 1795, he married Frances Bassett Washington, recent widow of the President's nephew, George Augustine Washington, but Fanny died in 1796 of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt; Tobias married again, this time to the young Frances Dandridge Henley. His new wife was also nicknamed Fanny and was the niece of [[Martha Washington]].&lt;ref name="SeacoastNH"&gt;{{citation

==Controversy==
In the late 1790s, Lear's finances became more distraught.  During this period, he continued to run unpaid errands for Washington.  On one of these errands, Lear collected rent from one of Washington's tenants, but pocketed the funds.  Washington found out when he questioned his tenant as to why they had not paid.  Washington was furious for at least two days but Lear apologized and was quickly forgiven.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

The next year,{{when|date=April 2015}} Lear was given the rank of colonel as chief aide to Washington, who had been reappointed by Congress to command the troops during a period when a French attack was feared.  He preferred to be addressed as Colonel Lear for the rest of his life despite the fact that the French never attacked by land and he never faced active duty.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

Lear collected funds for the sale of a business partner's real estate and kept the funds.  He feigned illness for several months before meeting the man and apologizing, confessing and agreeing to reimburse him.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

==Washington's death==
In 1799, Washington unexpectedly died while Lear was visiting him at [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]], leading to Lear's famous diary entry:

{{quote |About ten o'clk, Saturday December 14, 1799, Washington made several attempts to speak to me before he could effect it, at length he said,—"I am just going. Have me decently buried; and do not let my body be put into the Vault in less than two days after I am dead." I bowed assent. He then looked at me again and said, "Do you understand me?" I replied "Yes." "'Tis well" said he.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;}}

Lear oversaw the funeral arrangements, even to the detail of measuring the corpse at 6 feet 3.5&amp;nbsp;inches long and 1 foot 9&amp;nbsp;inches from shoulder to shoulder.  Lear inherited a lifetime interest in [[Walnut Tree Farm]].&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

==Missing Washington papers==
Lear's only biographer, [[Ray Brighton]], was convinced that Lear destroyed many of Washington's letters and diary entries, which he had possession of for about a year after Washington's death. Lear was to work on a Washington biography with [[Bushrod Washington]], a Washington nephew, who had contacted Lear about collecting Washington's papers and collaborating on a Washington biography.  Swaths of Washington's diary (especially sections during the presidency and the [[American Revolutionary War]]) and a few key letters were discovered missing about a year after their transfer to Supreme Court Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], who had instead volunteered to write the biography. Lear denied destroying any papers in a long letter to Marshall; however, Lear's own correspondence casts this into doubt.  Lear wrote [[Alexander Hamilton]] offering to suppress Washington documents: "There are as you well know among the several letters and papers many which every public and private consideration should withhold from further inspection."  Lear explicitly asked Hamilton in that letter if he desired any military papers removed.  Suspiciously, almost all the presidential diary entries are gone except for those that covered Washington's 1789 visit to Lear's family home in Portsmouth.  Six key Washington letters are also missing.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

==Jefferson as ally==
Many biographers believe that Thomas Jefferson and Washington had a big falling out over a letter Jefferson sent to [[Philip Mazzei]] in Italy, which called Washington's administration Anglican, monarchical and aristocratic, and claimed that Washington had appointed as military officers "all timid men that prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty."  The letter was eventually published overseas and then re-translated back into English by [[Noah Webster]] and published in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~tjpapers/mazzei/index.html "Jefferson's Letter to Philip Mazzei", ''The Papers of Thomas Jefferson''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422222301/http://www.princeton.edu/~tjpapers/mazzei/index.html |date=2010-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its publication is thought to have sparked a nasty correspondence of three rounds of letters between Jefferson and Washington.  In conversation with friends over wine, Lear admitted the existence of the letters but subsequently denied having said such.  Albin&lt;!-- Spelling? --&gt; Rollins, a Mount Vernon overseer, stated to a nephew of Washington that he had seen the letters and that the second round was so strong that it made the hair on his head rise and that a duel must surely follow.  The missing letters' loss brought great benefit to [[Thomas Jefferson]], as they would have been fuel for Jefferson's political enemies.  Brighton believes (without direct evidence) that Jefferson requested Lear to destroy the letters and that Jefferson rewarded Lear for their destruction for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

==Appointments==
[[File:"Wellington," Malcolm Matheson house, Fox Hunt Road, Alexandria, Virginia.

Built in the 18th century for Colonel Tobias Lear; from his death in 1818, owned by descendents of George Washington]]

Jefferson appointed the financially struggling Lear to the potentially lucrative assignment of American [[commercial agent]] in [[Saint-Domingue]] at the start of his term of president. During this job, Lear appointed Rollins to oversee Walnut Tree Farm. Unfortunately, Lear arrived right before [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was about to clamp down on the slave rebellion there. In a January 17, 1802, in a long letter of gratitude to Jefferson, Lear predicted the long anticipated French response was still six months out. One week later, a French armada arrived at [[Cape Francois]] and captured the main port there from [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]]. Lear attempted to help the Americans during the ensuing French embargo. However, with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] looming large for Jefferson, Lear was asked not to irritate the French commanders, and after a suggestion from [[James Madison]], retreated back to Virginia.&lt;ref name="zacks2005" /&gt;

A year after returning to the U.S., in 1803, Jefferson appointed Lear, now 41, to be [[Consul General]] to the [[Barbary Coast|North African coast]] with the privilege of simultaneously conducting private business.  Before preparing to depart on the ''[[USS Philadelphia (1799)|Philadelphia]]'' to [[Algeria]], Lear was married for the third time to Frances Dandridge Henley). In a last-minute change, the Lears were reassigned to the ''[[USS Constitution]]'', and the ''Philadelphia'' ended up being captured in the Mediterranean. Lear became the primary negotiator for the crew's release in 1805 with the [[Treaty with Tripoli (1805)|Treaty of Tripoli]] that ended the [[First Barbary War]] in which he was alleged to have mishandled the resolution. The Lears stayed on in Algiers until 1812 when Lear fell out of favor with the ''[[Dey]]''.&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt;

Upon their return, the U.S. was in the throes of the [[War of 1812]].  Consequently, they had to follow a circuitous route back to Portsmouth from their entry in Virginia.  Under James Madison, he was then appointed as a secretary to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and moved to a location a few blocks from the [[White House]].  While serving in this post, the [[United Kingdom|British]] attacked and [[Burning of Washington|burned the city]].&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt;

In 1814, Lear was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].

==Death==
On October 11, 1816, Lear apparently committed suicide by shooting himself with a pistol. Although it was known that he suffered severe headaches and stints of depression, as well as being vilified by the media, the specific reasons for his suicide are unknown. It is curious that this "scrupulous record keeper" left behind neither suicide note nor will.&lt;ref name="seacoast" /&gt; He is buried in the Congressional Cemetery, Washington, D.C.

'''"Too Much Finance?"''' is the title of a highly cited paper by [[Jean-Louis Arcand]], [[Enrico Berkes]], and [[Ugo Panizza]]. The paper was originally described in a 2011  [[VoxEU]] column,&lt;ref name="VoxEU Too Much Finance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/has-finance-gone-too-far|title=Too Much Finance|publisher=VoxEU|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 it was issued as [[IMF]] working paper,&lt;ref name="IMF Too Much Finance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12161.pdf|title=Too Much Finance|publisher=IMF Working Paper|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 was published by the [[Journal of Economic Growth]].&lt;ref name="JEG Too Much Finance"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10887-015-9115-2|title=Too Much Finance|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|accessdate=27 May 2015|doi=10.1007/s10887-015-9115-2|volume=20|pages=105–148 | last1 = Arcand | first1 = Jean Louis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Google Scholar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=too+much+finance|title=Too Much Finance - Google Scholar|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
The paper provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis that there is a point after which a growing financial sector starts having a negative impact on economic growth.

== Popular Media ==
On September 4, 2012, Time Magazine featured the article 'Bankers: Who Needs Them?',&lt;ref name="Bankers: Who Needs Them?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/09/04/bankers-who-needs-them/|title=Bankers: Who Needs Them?|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the working paper. The article features the same quote by [[James Tobin]] as the working paper:

{{quote|text="We are throwing more and more of our resources, including the cream of our youth, into financial activities remote from the production of goods and services, into activities that generate high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity."}}

It further cites one of the authors, [[Ugo Panizza]] who summarizes the working paper as:

{{quote|"Our findings show that there can be "too much" finance. While opponents of regulation like Alan Greenspan argued that less credit may hurt our future standard of living, our results indicate that, in countries with very large financial sectors, regulatory policies that reduce the size of the financial sector may have a positive effect on economic growth."}}

On 26 September 2012 the BBC World Service programme Business Daily interviewed one of the authors - [[Ugo Panizza]] - on the issue of too much finance for a broadcast on the rise of digital currencies.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00y7fwb|title=Digital currencies|publisher=BBC World Service|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2015, the [[Financial Times]] published a widely read column by Martin Wolf&lt;ref name="Why finance is too much of a good thing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/64c2f03a-03a0-11e5-a70f-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=published_links%2Frss%2Fcomment_columnists_martin-wolf%2Ffeed%2F%2Fproduct#axzz3bKWUI5Ys|title=Why finance is too much of a good thing|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that discusses the original findings of the "Too much finance?" paper, as well as more recent research by the [[Bank of International Settlements]] and [[IMF]] which supports these findings. The [[Financial Times]] article labels the authors of "Too Much Finance?" as [[IMF]] researchers. However, only Berkes was at the IMF when the paper was originally written, Arcand and Panizza are professors of Economics at the [[Graduate Institute]] in [[Geneva]].
