'''Alastair Galpin''' (born 1974, [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[South Africa]]) 
is the 2nd biggest Guinness World Records breaker of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s decade]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness Book of World Records]] (2010), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; breaking 38 World Records, behind [[Ashrita Furman]]. He immigrated to New Zealand in 2002, and says that his career in Record Breaking was inspired when he met champion rally driver, Simon Evans, in Kenya in 1998.

==World records==

Alastair Galpin has broken over 85 world records for feats including having the most [[snail]]s on the face (eight in 10 seconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/35632|title=Snails ooze into record book|work=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the most [[rubber-band]]s stretched over the face (62 in one minute). He also holds the most [[Postage stamp|stamp]]s licked (57 in one minute),&lt;ref name=NZH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10542402|title=A life less ordinary|last=Bridgeman|first=Shelley|date=2008-11-08|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; loudest clap, and the fastest time to peel and eat three kiwifruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1859037,00.html |title=A Brief History Of Guinness World Records |last=Altman |first=Alex |date=2008-11-14 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=21 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919112129/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0%2C8599%2C1859037%2C00.html |archivedate=19 September 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/1229997 |title=Record breaker hugs the limelight |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=21 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613221822/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/1229997 |archivedate=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galpin is also the holder of the Guinness World Record for the most hugs in one hour in Civic Square, [[Wellington, New Zealand]] on 13 July 2007 (624 hugs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0707/S00147.htm|title=No Need For Drugs When You Have 624 Hugs|last=Smith|first=Kelly|date=2007-07-13|work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved three new Guinness World Records at the [[Guinness World Records]] Day 2009 for Champagne-cork spitting, coin blowing, and Malteser (malt ball) spitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Guinness-World-Records-Day-2009/video/842873/7691.html|title=Guinness World Records Day 2009|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[New Zealander]] Don Purdon, Galpin commenced an attempt at the longest hand-shake at 8pm EST on Friday 14 January 2011 in [[Times Square|New York Times Square]]. After 33 hours, three minutes, they had smashed the [[Handshake#Records|existing record]] by more than 17 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/society/longest_Handshake_Team_New_Zealand_and_Team_Nepal_set_world_record_112070.html |title=Longest Handshake: Team New Zealand and Team Nepal set world record |publisher=Worldrecordsacademy.org |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrecordchase.com/achieved-records.html |title=World records accredited to Alastair Galpin (the second most successful world record breaker) |publisher=Worldrecordchase.com |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TVNZ_4000587"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz//national-news/kiwis-break-world-record-handshake-4000587 |title=Kiwis break world record for a handshake |date=17 January 2011 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TVNZ_4002624"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/close-up/record-handshake-holder-4002624/video |title=World record handshake holders |date=19 January 2011 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shared the record with [[Nepal]]ese brothers Rohit and Santosh Timilsina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90031342?%20Nepali%20brothers%20share%20world%20record%20for%20longest%20handshake&lt;/ref&gt;

Galpin's drive to assist non-profits lies in his awareness of escalating environmental and social degradation around the world. This awareness of his has been supported by Professor Noam Chomsky.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldrecordchase.com/opinionpiece.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable awareness raising==

Galpin seeks to raise awareness - and sometimes raise funds - for social and environmental causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/service/displayKickPlace.kickAction?u=1597368&amp;as=7691&amp;b= |title=Alastair - Guinness World Records Member - Home of the Longest, Shortest, Fastest, Tallest facts and feats |publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses various methods to spread knowledge of environmental issues, including referring to issues of global concern in his website’s stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrecordchase.com/records-stories/most-aa-batteries-held-in-hand2011.html |title=Achieving the Guinness World Record™ for the Most AA batteries held in the hand: 44 &amp;#124; Alastair Galpin |publisher=Worldrecordchase.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during his motivational storytelling in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldrecordchase.com/storytelling.html |title=Storytelling - world record breaker Alastair Galpin |publisher=Worldrecordchase.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His opinion piece, titled 'Human Application of Consciousness' - while not directly related to world record-breaking, explains Galpin's drive to contribute to the struggle for a truly sustainable future for mankind and other life on earth. He does so by collaborating with non-profits and organisations on projects of varying degrees of social and environmental importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldrecordchase.com/opinionpiece.html Retrieved 7 October 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his more noteworthy charitable efforts are the greatest height to drop gambling machines as a statement against gambling harm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldrecordchase.com/records-stories/greatest-height-drop-gambling-machine2007.html Retrieved 19 May 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; the largest bowl of soup (shared) to show healthy eating in disadvantaged communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldrecordchase.com/records-stories/largest-bowl-of-soup2008.html Retrieved 19 May 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the most radio interviews in a suspended cage to bring media attention to the issue of problem gambling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldrecordchase.com/records-stories/most-suspended-radio-interviews2009.html Retrieved 19 May 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unusual feats==

His activities were played down by some US websites covering "most ridiculous" and "least impressive" world records&lt;ref name=NZH/&gt; and he has also attracted US television coverage for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=2641636&amp;page=1|title=Kiss, Cook, and Dance for World Record's Day|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other print media, [[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]] has featured his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/lifestyle-features?oid=252418&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=146849&amp;For-the-record |title=The Citizen Online &amp;#124; For the record - Lifestyle |publisher=Citizen.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123110258/http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/lifestyle-features?oid=252418&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=146849&amp;For-the-record |archivedate=2012-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">'''Dahl's law''' is a sound rule in some of the [[Northeast Bantu languages]], a case of voicing [[dissimilation]]. In the history of these languages, a [[voiceless stop]], such as {{IPA|/p t k/}}, became [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] ({{IPA|/b d ɡ/}}) when immediately followed by a syllable with another voiceless stop. For example, [[Nyamwezi language|Nyamwezi]] has ''-datu'' "three" where [[Swahili language|Swahili]], a Bantu language that did not undergo Dahl's law, has ''-tatu'', and [[Shambala language|Shambala]] has ''mgate'' "bread" where Swahili has ''mkate''. Dahl's law is the reason for the name [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]] when the language prefix normally found in that language is ''ki-'' .

The law was named in 1903 by [[Carl Meinhof]] after the missionary [[Edmund Dahl]], who had discovered it. It is productive in Sukuma, in the Nyanyembe dialect of Nyamwezi, most E50 languages (such as Kikuyu, Embu, Meru/Chuka), some J languages (such as Rwanda, Gusii, Kuria). In other languages the law is no longer productive, but there are indications that it once was (such as in Taita, Kamba/Daisũ, Taveta, Luhya/Logoli). In some neighboring languages (and in other dialects of Nyamwezi) words reflecting Dahl's law are found, but they appear to be transfers from languages in which the law is productive.&lt;ref&gt;BFYP Masele &amp; Derek Nurse (2003) "Stratigraphy and prehistory: Bantu Zone F". In Henning Andersen (ed.) ''Language Contacts in Prehistory: Studies in Stratigraphy''. John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl's law is often portrayed as the African equivalent of [[Grassmann's law]] in [[Indo-European languages]]. However, an analogue of Grassmann's law (which is [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], not voicing, dissimilation) has taken place in the Bantu language [[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]], where it is called ''Katupha's law.''

This is a list of the '''extreme points of [[Eurasia]]''', the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location on the [[continent]]. Some of these locations are open to debate, owing to the diverse definitions of Europe and Asia.

Mainland Eurasia is entirely located within the northern hemisphere and mostly within the eastern hemisphere, yet it touches the western hemisphere on both extremes. Thus, both the easternmost and westernmost points of Eurasia are in the western hemisphere. Mainland Eurasia crosses 200° of [[longitude]] and 76° of [[latitude]] north to south.

==Extremes of Eurasia, including islands==

* '''Northernmost Point''' &amp;mdash; [[Cape Fligeli]], [[Rudolf Island]], [[Franz Josef Land]], [[Russia]] (81°50'N, 59°14'E)

The culturally European island nation of [[Iceland]] is also on the boundary of the plates; its westernmost point is [[Bjargtangar]] (24° 32′ 03″ W).
* '''Easternmost point''' &amp;mdash; [[Big Diomede]], [[Russia]] (65°46'N, 169°03'W). The [[International Date Line]] runs between the Russian Big Diomede and the neighbouring U.S.-governed [[Little Diomede]].

A ''group de chasse'' may include one to four ''[[escadrille]]s'', each of which comprises 10–12 aircraft. The commanding officer of a ''GC'' is usually a ''[[Commandant]]'', ''[[Lieutenant-colonel]]'' or ''[[Colonel]]''.

==Units==
Specific units known by the name ''groupe de chasse'' include:

;''[[Groupe de Chasse (Belgium)]]'' :a Belgian unit of World War I

;''[[Groupe de Chasse Polonaise I/145]]'': a Polish unit fighting alongside France in 1940

'''Happy Television''' ({{lang-sr|Хепи ТВ/Hepi TV|italic=yes}}, also known as '''Happy TV''' or just '''Happy''') is a popular, privately owned, national [[TV network]] in [[Serbia]]. Happy TV has gained a strong reputation for its entertainment programming. The station offers a compilation of international/domestic movies, American [[sitcoms]], [[drama]]s, Indian [[soap opera]]s and Latin [[telenovela]]s, as well as locally produced talk/variety shows, and lately domestic sitcoms and reality shows.

Happy TV's parent company is the Belgrade-based Invej Company, which also owns many of business entities that often serves as sponsors of the program, which is owned by Predrag Ranković.

==History==
Happy TV was created after the merger of Happy TV and [[TV Košava]], the latter once owned by Marija Milosevic, daughter of [[Slobodan Milosevic]], Serbia's authoritarian president in power during the 1990s. Marija Milosevic sold her ownership in Kosava TV to lawyer Borivoj Pajovic, who was at the time President of the Board of Directors in the daily newspaper [[Blic]].

After a couple of ownership changes, in 2006 the Regulatory Authority for Electronic Media issued TV Košava with a license with national coverage, which was shared with kids channel Happy TV – while Happy TV aired exclusively kids programming in the morning, Košava broadcast informative and current affairs programs in the evening. At that time, REM's (then RRA) decision was disputed since neither TV stations had the capacity for national broadcasting, unlike, for example, RTL which competed for a license but was not issued one.

In 2007, Predrag Rankovic, known to the public for involvement in shady business deals, bought part of Kosava, although his name was never mentioned in formal ownership documents. In 2010, Kosava merged with Happy and the television changed its name to Happy TV and started to broadcast as one program.&lt;ref&gt;https://serbia.mom-rsf.org/en/media/detail/outlet/happy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Happy TV started getting a high viewership because of its TV series and movies airing, most because of Turkish drama series and Latin American telenovelas. Since it's beginning, Happy TV has been made several reality TV shows, with [[Parovi]] as most popular of them. Reality show ''Parovi'' got Happy TV huge success and big viewership, but also a big criticism.

'''International Christian Academy''' (ICA) was an American [[boarding school]] in [[Bouaké]], [[Ivory Coast]]. It was established in 1962 as '''Ivory Coast Academy''' by the Conservative Baptist Foreign Mission Society (now [[WorldVenture]]) and its main purpose was to provide a standard American education to the children of [[missionaries]] in [[West Africa]]. In 2002, it had some 160+ students from 13 nations in grades 1–12.

In September 2002, during the [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]], children were trapped at the school for a week by fighting between government soldiers and rebels opposed to President [[Laurent Gbagbo]]. Eventually they were evacuated unharmed by French troops to government held Yamoussoukro. Some of the students and staff then relocated to [[Dakar Academy]] in Senegal in order to complete the school year. The ICA campus in eastern Bouaké was then used as a French military base in rebel-held Côte d'Ivoire.

ICA was accredited by the [[Association of Christian Schools International]] and the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].

In February 2005, the ICA School Board formally closed the school with no prospects of reopening.

The ICA campus is presently known as Village Baptiste.  The campus is administered by The Association of Evangelical Baptist Churches of Côte d'Ivoire (AEBECI).  A portion of the campus has been rented to the medical branch of the local university.  Journey Corps, a branch of Mission Baptiste has its base on the campus.  There is also a church meeting in what was previously the ICA chapel.  A Bible study for medical students and other resident occurs weekly. The houses and dormitories are full and much activity occurs daily.

==Marriage and career==
In the 1920s, Kimura also worked as a government communications worker in [[Korea under Japanese rule]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; Upon returning from Korea, he married his neighbor, Yae Kimura (1904–1978).&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; Since his wife's family lacked a male heir, he changed his name to Jiroemon Kimura, becoming the ninth member of the family to bear that name.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; He retired in 1962 at the age of 65, having worked in post offices for 45 years.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; After retiring he turned to farming until the age of 90.&lt;ref name="telegraph/8451161"/&gt;

In October 2012, Kimura was presented with a certificate from ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' Editor-in-Chief Craig Glenday, relating to Kimura's appearance in the 2013 edition of ''Guinness World Records'' book; this was the second year in a row Kimura was recognized as the oldest living man in the world, as he also appeared in the book the year before.

'''Kongsvoll Alpine Garden''' (''Kongsvoll fjellhage'') is a small botanical garden for alpine plants situated at [[Kongsvoll|Kongsvold Fjeldstue]], 890 [[Metres above sea level|masl]] at [[Dovrefjell]] in [[Central Norway]]. Most of the plants are local to Dovrefjell and adjacent mountain ranges in [[Trøndelag]] and [[Møre og Romsdal]]. The garden is administered by the [[NTNU University Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/museum/kongsvoll-alpine-garden|title=Kongsvoll Alpine Garden|first=Christian|last=Fossen|website=www.ntnu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The garden is the only alpine botanical in [[Scandinavia]]&lt;ref name="Kalseth"&gt;Kalseth, Randi G.: Den frodigste fjellhagen&lt;/ref&gt;. Apart from local flora, the garden also display the most common [[vascular plant]]s from mountain ranges in central- and southern Norway. The garden contains a total of approx. 300 species of vascular plants, and in addition a number of [[mosses]] and [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fremstad, Eli: Kongsvoll fjellhage (NTNU, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden was created in 1992 by Simen Bretten, manager of the Kongsvoll Biolocial Station. It replaces an older garden established in 1924 by the botanist [[Thekla Resvoll]] at the then [[Kongsvoll Station]]. The older garden was originally administered by [[University of Oslo]] until 1975, and later by NTNU.

| March, a 22-year-old mailman in [[Palma de Mallorca]], has occasionally been mentioned (sometimes erroneously as "Granados" or "Grandos") as the person sentenced to the longest prison term ever. He failed to deliver 42,784 letters, opening 35,718 of them and stealing their contents for value of 50,000 [[euro]] (2010 value). In consequence, March was charged with thousands of counts of fraud, wrongful appropriation of documents (one per undelivered letter) and theft, resulting in an unprecedented request of 384,912 years in prison and a 19 million euro (2010 value) fine by the prosecutor. However, the actual sentence imposed was 14 years and 2 months in prison and a fine of 9,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (1972 value).&lt;ref&gt;http://recuerdosdepandora.com/historia/cuando-no-entregar-unas-cartas-te-puede-costar-una-eternidad-encarcelado/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/whats-the-point-of-sentencing-anyone-to-141000-years-in-prison&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Guinea campaign''' of the [[Pacific War]] lasted from January 1942 until the end of the war in August 1945. During the initial phase in early 1942, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded the [[Australia]]n-administered territories of the [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea Mandate]] (23 January) and [[Territory of Papua|Papua]] (8 March) and overran [[Dutch New Guinea|western New Guinea]] (beginning 29/30 March), which was a part of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. During the second phase, lasting from late 1942 until the Japanese surrender, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]—consisting primarily of Australian and US forces—cleared the Japanese first from Papua, then the Mandate and finally from the Dutch colony.

The campaign resulted in a crushing defeat and very heavy losses for the Empire of Japan. As in most Pacific War campaigns, disease and starvation claimed more Japanese lives than enemy action. Most Japanese troops never even came into contact with Allied forces, and were instead simply cut off and subjected to an effective blockade by the US Navy. Garrisons were effectively besieged and denied shipments of food and medical supplies, and as a result, some claim that 97% of Japanese deaths in this campaign were from non-combat causes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j34/stevens.asp#23 Stevens, ''The Naval Campaigns for New Guinea'' paragraph 30] Retrieved 10 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Laffin]], the campaign "was arguably the most arduous fought by any Allied troops during World War II".&lt;ref&gt;Laffin 1986, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==1942==
===Strategic situation===
[[File:Eastern New Guinea and New Britain 1944.jpg|thumb|480px|Papua New Guinea, the Bismarcks and the Northern Solomons]]
The struggle for New Guinea began with the [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|capture by the Japanese]] of the city of [[Rabaul]] at the northeastern tip of [[New Britain Island]] in January 1942 (the Allies responded with multiple [[Bombing of Rabaul (1942)|bombing raids]], of which the [[Action off Bougainville]] was one). Rabaul overlooks [[Simpson Harbor]], a considerable natural anchorage, and was ideal for the construction of airfields. Over the next year, the Japanese built up the area into a major air and naval base.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Japanese [[Japanese Eighth Area Army|8th Area Army]] (equivalent to a Euroamerican army), under General [[Hitoshi Imamura]] at Rabaul, was responsible for both the New Guinea and [[Solomon Islands campaign]]s. The [[Japanese Eighteenth Army|Japanese 18th Army]] (equivalent to a Euroamerican corps), under Lieutenant General [[Hatazō Adachi]], was responsible for Japanese operations on mainland New Guinea.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The colonial capital of [[Port Moresby]] on the south coast of Papua was the strategic key for the Japanese in this area of operations. Capturing it would both neutralize the Allies' principal forward base and serve as a springboard for a [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|possible invasion of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1949, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reasons, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Supreme Commander Allied Forces [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] was determined to hold it. MacArthur was further determined to conquer all of New Guinea in his progress toward the eventual recapture of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; General Headquarters [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] Operational Instruction No.7 of 25 May 1942, issued by Commander-Allied-Forces, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], placed all Australian and US Army, Air Force and Navy Forces in the Port Moresby Area under the control of [[New Guinea Force]].{{sfn|GHQ SWPA|}}

===Japanese seizure of Lae and Salamaua===
{{Main|Invasion of Lae-Salamaua}}
Due north of Port Moresby, on the northeast coast of Papua, are [[Huon Gulf]] and the [[Huon Peninsula]]. The Japanese entered [[Invasion of Lae-Salamaua|Lae and Salamaua]], two locations on Huon Gulf, unopposed in early March 1942.&lt;ref name="Morison 1950, p. 31"&gt;Morison 1950, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur would have liked to deny this area to the Japanese, but he had neither sufficient air nor naval forces to undertake a counterlanding. The Japanese at Rabaul and other bases on New Britain would have easily overwhelmed any such effort (by mid-September, MacArthur's entire naval force under Vice Admiral [[Arthur S. Carpender]] consisted entirely of 5 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 20 submarines 7 small craft).&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The only Allied response was a bombing raid of [[Invasion of Lae-Salamaua|Lae and Salamaua]] by aircraft flying over the [[Owen Stanley Range]] from the carriers {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}}, leading the Japanese to reinforce these sites.&lt;ref name="Morison 1950, p. 31"/&gt;

===Japanese attempt on Port Moresby===
[[Operation Mo]] was the designation given by the Japanese to their initial plan to take possession of Port Moresby. Their operation plan decreed a five-pronged attack: one task force to establish a seaplane base at Tulagi in the lower Solomons, one to establish a seaplane base in the [[Louisiade Archipelago]] off the eastern tip of New Guinea, one of transports to land troops near Port Moresby, one with a [[Light aircraft carrier|light carrier]] to cover the landing, and one with two [[fleet carrier]]s to sink the Allied forces sent in response.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1949, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting 4–8 May 1942 [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], the Allies suffered higher losses in ships, but achieved a crucial strategic victory by turning the Japanese landing force back, thereby removing the threat to Port Moresby, at least for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1949, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

After this failure, the Japanese decided on a longer term, two-pronged assault for their next attempt on Port Moresby. Forward positions would first be established at [[Milne Bay]], located in the forked eastern end of the Papuan peninsula, and at [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]], a village on the northeast coast of Papua about halfway between [[Huon Gulf]] and Milne Bay. Simultaneous operations from these two locations, one amphibious and one overland, would converge on the target city.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Buna was easily taken as the Allies had no military presence there (MacArthur wisely chose not to attempt an occupation by paratroopers since any such force would have been easily wiped out by the Japanese). The Japanese [[Invasion of Buna-Gona|occupied the village]] with an initial force of 1,500 on 21 July and by 22 August had 11,430 men under arms at Buna. Then began the grueling [[Kokoda Track campaign]], a brutal experience for both the Japanese and Australian troops involved. On 17 September, the Japanese had reached the village of Ioribaiwa, just {{convert|30|km|-1}} from the Allied airdrome at Port Moresby. The Australians held firm and began their counterdrive on 26 September. "...the Japanese retreat down the Kokoda Trail had turned into a rout. Thousands perished from starvation and disease; the commanding general, [[Tomitarō Horii|Horii]], was drowned."&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Thus was the overland threat to Port Moresby permanently removed.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air operations===
Since Port Moresby was the only port supporting operations in Papua, its defence was critical to the campaign. The air defences consisted of [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] fighters. RAAF [[radar]] could not provide sufficient warning of Japanese attacks, so reliance was placed on [[coastwatchers]] and spotters in the hills until an American radar unit arrived in September with better equipment.&lt;ref name= "Craven477"&gt;Craven &amp; Cate 1948, pp. 476–477.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese bombers were often escorted by fighters which came in at {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}—too high to be intercepted by the P-39s and P-40s—giving the Japanese an altitude advantage in air combat.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to the Allied fighters was high. By June, 20–25 P-39s had been lost in air combat, while three more had been destroyed on the ground and eight had been destroyed in landings by accident. The Australian and American anti-aircraft gunners of the Composite Anti-Aircraft Defences played a crucial part. The gunners got a lot of practice; Port Moresby suffered its 78th raid on 17 August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; A gradual improvement in their numbers and skill forced the Japanese bombers up to higher altitude, where they were less accurate, and then, in August, to raiding by night.&lt;ref name="Craven477"/&gt;

Although RAAF [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]]s and [[Lockheed Hudson]]s were based at Port Moresby, because of the Japanese air attacks, long-range bombers like [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]], [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]]s, and [[Martin B-26 Marauder|B-26]]s could not be safely based there and were instead staged through from bases in Australia. This resulted in considerable fatigue for the air crews. Due to USAAF doctrine and a lack of long-range escorts, long-range bomber raids on targets like Rabaul went in unescorted and suffered heavy losses, prompting severe criticism of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George Brett (general)|George Brett]] by war correspondents for misusing his forces.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; But fighters did provide cover for the transports, and for bombers when their targets were within range.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft based at Port Moresby and Milne Bay fought to prevent the Japanese from basing aircraft at Buna, and attempted to prevent the Japanese reinforcement of the Buna area.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese ground forces pressed toward Port Moresby, the Allied Air Forces struck supply points along the Kokoda Track. Japanese makeshift bridges were attacked by P-40s with {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allied capture of Milne Bay===

| source = – Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 38
}}

While it was beyond MacArthur's capabilities to deny Buna to the Japanese, the same could not be said of [[Milne Bay]], which was easily accessible by Allied naval forces. In early June, US Army engineers, Australian infantry and an anti-aircraft battery were landed near the [[Lever Brothers]] coconut plantation at [[Gili Gili]], and work was begun on an airfield. By 22 August, about 8,500 Australians and 1,300 Americans were on site.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese arrived and the 25 August – 7 September [[Battle of Milne Bay]] was underway. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison summed up the results this way:

{{quote|''...the enemy had shot his bolt; he never showed up again in these waters. The Battle for Milne Bay was a small one as World War II engagements went, but very important. Except for the initial assault on Wake Island, this was the first time that a Japanese amphibious operation had been thrown for a loss ... Furthermore, the Milne Bay affair demonstrated once again that an amphibious assault without air protection, and with an assault force inferior to that of the defenders, could not succeed.''&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[D'Entrecasteaux Islands]] lie directly off the northeast coast of the lower portion of the Papuan peninsula. The westernmost island of this group, [[Goodenough Island|Goodenough]], had been occupied in August 1942 by 353 stranded troops from bombed Japanese landing craft. The destroyer ''Yayoi'', sent to recover these men, was itself bombed and sunk on 11 September. A force of 800 Australian troops [[Battle of Goodenough Island|landed on 22 October]] on either side of the Japanese position. Beleaguered, the survivors of the Japanese garrison were evacuated by submarine on the night of 26 October. The Allies proceeded to turn the island into an air base.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese drive to conquer all of New Guinea had been decisively stopped. MacArthur was now determined to liberate the island as a stepping-stone to the reconquest of the Philippines. MacArthur's rollback began with the 16 November 1942 – 22 January 1943 [[Battle of Buna-Gona]]. The experience of the green [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|US 32nd Infantry Division]], just out of training camp and utterly unschooled in jungle warfare, was nearly disastrous. Instances were noted of officers completely out of their depth, of men eating meals when they should have been on the firing line, even of cowardice. MacArthur relieved the division commander and on 30 November instructed Lieutenant General [[Robert L. Eichelberger]], commander of the [[US I Corps]], to go to the front personally with the charge "to remove all officers who won't fight ... if necessary, put sergeants in charge of battalions ... I want you to take Buna, or not come back alive."&lt;ref&gt;Vader, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 7th Division]] under the command of Major General [[George Alan Vasey]], along with the revitalized US 32nd Division, restarted the Allied offensive. Gona fell to the Australians on 9 December 1942, Buna to the US 32nd on 2 January 1943, and [[Sanananda]], located between the two larger villages, fell to the Australians on 22 January.&lt;ref&gt;Vader, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Lilliput]] (18 December 1942 – June 1943) was an ongoing resupply operation ferrying troops and supplies from [[Milne Bay]], at the tip of the [[Papua New Guinea|Papuan Peninsula]], to [[Oro Bay]], a little more than halfway between Milne Bay and the [[Buna-Gona campaign|Buna-Gona]] area.

==1943==
===Holding Wau===
{{Main|Battle of Wau}}
[[File:Deadjapanese.jpg|thumb|Two dead Japanese soldiers in a water filled shell hole somewhere in New Guinea]]
[[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]] is a village in the interior of the Papuan peninsula, approximately {{convert|50|km|-1}} southwest of [[Salamaua]]. An airfield had been built there during an area gold rush in the 1920s and 1930s. This airfield was of great value to the Australians during the fighting for northeast Papua.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Japanese had decided to give up on [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]], the capture of Port Moresby loomed even larger in their strategic thinking. Taking the airfield at Wau was a crucial step in this process, and to this end, the [[Japanese 51st Division|51st Division]] was transferred from Indochina and placed under General [[Hitoshi Imamura]]'s [[Japanese Eighth Area Army|Eighth Area Army]] at Rabaul; one regiment arrived at Lae in early January 1943. In addition, about 5,400 survivors of the Japanese defeat at [[Battle of Buna-Gona|Buna-Gona]] were moved into the Lae-Salamaua area. Opposing these forces were the Australian [[2/5th Battalion (Australia)|2/5th]], [[2/6th Battalion (Australia)|2/6th]] and [[2/7th Battalion (Australia)|2/7th Battalions]] along with Lieutenant Colonel Norman Fleay's [[Kanga Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Vader, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australians decisively turned back the Japanese assault in the ensuing 29–31 January 1943 [[Battle of Wau]]. "Within a few days, the enemy was retreating from the Wau Valley, where he had suffered a serious defeat, harassed all the way back to Mubo..."&lt;ref&gt;Vader, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; About one week later, the Japanese completed their [[Guadalcanal Campaign#Ke evacuation|evacuation of Guadalcanal]].

===Final Japanese drive on Wau===
{{Main|Battle of the Bismarck Sea}}
General Imamura and his naval counterpart at [[Rabaul]], Admiral [[Jinichi Kusaka]], commander [[Southeast Area Fleet]], resolved to reinforce their ground forces at [[Lae]] for one final all-out attempt against Wau. If the transports succeeded in staying behind a weather front and were protected the whole way by fighters from the various airfields surrounding the [[Bismarck Sea]], they might make it to Lae with an acceptable level of loss, i.e., at worst half the task force would be sunk en route.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; It is indicative of the extent to which Japanese ambitions had fallen at this point in the war that a 50% loss of ground troops aboard ship was considered acceptable.

[[File:A20BismarckSea.jpg|thumb|An Allied A-20 bomber attacks Japanese shipping during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, March, 1943]]

Three factors conspired to create disaster for the Japanese. First, they had woefully underestimated the strength of the Allied air forces. Second, the Allies had become convinced that the Japanese were preparing a major seaborne reinforcement and so had stepped up their air searches. Most important of all, the bombers of MacArthur's air forces, under the command of Lieutenant General [[George Kenney|George C. Kenney]], had been modified to enable new offensive tactics. Their noses had been refitted with eight 50-caliber machine guns for strafing slow-moving ships on the high seas. In addition, their bomb bays were filled with 500-pound bombs to be used in the newly devised practice of [[skip bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

About 6,900 troops aboard eight transports, escorted by eight destroyers, departed Rabaul at midnight 28 February under the command of Rear Admiral [[Masatomi Kimura]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Through the afternoon of 1 March, the overcast weather held at which point everything began to go wrong for the Japanese. The weather changed direction and Kimura's slow-moving task force was spotted by an Allied scout plane. By the time the Allied bombers and PT boats finished their work on 3 March, Kimura had lost all eight transports and four of his eight destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 58–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining destroyers with about 2,700 surviving troops limped back to Rabaul. "The enemy never again risked a transport larger than a small coaster or barge in waters shadowed by American planes. His contemplated offensive against Wau died a-borning."&lt;ref name="Morison 1950, p. 62"&gt;Morison 1950, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleet Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] promised [[Hirohito|the emperor]] that he would pay back the Allies for the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea|disaster at the Bismarck Sea]] with a series of massive air strikes. For this, he ordered the air arm of Vice Admiral [[Jisaburo Ozawa|Jisaburo Ozawa's]] [[Third Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Third Fleet]] carriers to reinforce the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service#Eleventh Air Fleet and land-based air fleets|Eleventh Air Fleet]] at Rabaul. To demonstrate the seriousness of the effort to the [[Supreme War Council]], multiple shifts of high-ranking personnel were also effected: Both Yamamoto and Ozawa moved their headquarters to Rabaul; and [[IJN 8th Fleet|Eighth Fleet]] commander Vice Admiral [[Gunichi Mikawa]] as well as General Imamura's chief of staff were sent to Tokyo with advice and explanations for the respective General Staffs (Admiral [[Tomoshige Samejima]] replaced Mikawa as Eight Fleet commander).&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

I-Go was to be carried out in two phases, one against the lower Solomons and one against Papua.

}}
The first strike, on 7 April, was against Allied shipping in the [[Ironbottom Sound|waters between Guadalcanal and Tulagi]]. At 177 planes, this was the largest Japanese air attack since [[Pearl Harbor Attack|Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 120–123&lt;/ref&gt; Yamamoto then turned his attention to New Guinea: 94 planes struck [[Oro Bay]] on 11 April; 174 planes hit [[Port Moresby]] on 12 April; and in the largest raid of all, 188 aircraft struck [[Milne Bay]] on 14 April.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

I-Go demonstrated that the Japanese command was not learning the lessons of air power that the Allies were. The Allied [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|reduction of Rabaul]] was only made possible by relentless air strikes that took place day after day, but Yamamoto thought the damage inflicted by a few attacks of large formations would derail Allied plans long enough for Japan to prepare a defense in depth. Also, Yamamoto accepted at face value his fliers' over-optimistic reports of damage: they reported a score of one cruiser, two destroyers and 25 transports, as well as 175 Allied planes, a figure that should certainly have aroused some skepticism. Actual Allied losses amounted to one destroyer, one oiler, one corvette, two cargo ships and approximately 25 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt; These meager results were not commensurate with either the resources expended or the expectations that had been promoted.

===Allied strategy toward Rabaul===
{{Main|Operation Cartwheel}}
The umbrella term for the series of strategic actions taken by the Allies to reduce and capture the vast Japanese naval and air facilities at [[Rabaul]] was [[Operation Cartwheel]]. Two major moves were planned for the end of June:
* Turner's III 'Phib undertook [[Operation Toenails]], the invasion of the [[New Georgia Islands]] halfway up the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] chain (30 June – 7 October 1943).
* Barbey's VII 'Phib carried out two almost simultaneous undertakings. [[Operation Chronicle]], the capture of the [[Trobriand Islands]] between Papua and the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] (22 – 30 June 1943), and the landing of a combined American/Australian force at [[Landing at Nassau Bay|Nassau Bay]] on the Papuan coast just south of [[Huon Gulf]] (30 June – 6 July 1943).&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] realized that a landing and siege of "Fortress Rabaul" would be far too costly, and that the Allies' ultimate strategic purposes could be achieved by simply neutralizing and bypassing it. At the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943, the leaders of the Allied nations agreed to this change in strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1455">'''Ratagnon''' (also transliterated '''Datagnon''' or '''Latagnon''') is one of the eight indigenous groups of [[Mangyan]] in the southernmost tip of [[Occidental Mindoro]] and the [[Mindoro|Mindoro Islands]] along the [[Sulu Sea]]. The Ratagnon live in the southernmost part of the municipality of Magsaysay in Occidental Mindoro. Their language is similar to the Visayan Cuyunon language, spoken by the inhabitants of Cuyo Island in Northern Palawan.

The Ratagnon women wear a wrap-around cotton cloth from the waistline to the knees and some of the males still wear the traditional g-string. The women's breast covering is made of woven nito (vine). They also wear accessories made of beads and copper wire. The males wear a jacket with simple embroidery during gala festivities and carry flint, tinder, and other paraphernalia for making fire. Both sexes wear coils of red-dyed rattan at the waistline. Like other Mangyan tribes, they also carry betel chew and its ingredients in bamboo containers.. Today only around 2 to 5 people speak the [[Ratagnon language]], which is nearly [[extinct language|extinct]], out of an ethnic population of 2,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/btn|title=Ratagnon|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition''' is a global partnership of public, private and non-governmental organizations. Its aim is to ensure that all people in low- and middle-income countries can choose, obtain and use the supplies and appropriate services they need to safeguard their [[reproductive health]]. Since 2004, the Coalition has been part of international efforts to secure reproductive health supplies by increasing resources, strengthening systems, and building effective partnerships .

== History ==
Since the 1970s, the international community has worked on providing access to the supplies and equipment needed to deliver quality reproductive health services in the developing world. In the early years, that engagement was largely financial and technical, focused in particular on effective supply chain management. By the late 1990s waning interest within the international donor community coupled with weak commitment by countries prompted many to see sustained access to reproductive health supplies as depending as much on effective advocacy as on purely technical support. Alarmed at the prospect of significant funding shortfalls, stakeholders from around the world met in 2001 in Istanbul at a conference entitled "Meeting the Challenge".&lt;ref&gt;Contraceptive Projections and the Donor Gap (April 2001). Interim Working Group on Reproductive Health Commodity Security. {{ISBN|1-889735-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This conference was the starting point for a coordinated global reproductive health supplies movement. In 2003 the Supply Initiative was established as a coordinating mechanism. In 2004 12 organizations, mostly donors from the public and non-governmental sectors, established the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition. Their aim was to foster better coordination and collaboration in such areas as global advocacy, resource mobilization, and supply chain strengthening. By the end of 2011 the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition included 155 member organizations, among them developing country governments, international and national non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, technical agencies, bilateral donors, multilateral organizations, private foundations, regional bodies, and manufacturers. In 2011, 360 participants from 56 countries gathered in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]&lt;ref&gt;globalpost "Contraceptives boost for poor countries" by Tristan McConnell, June 24, 2011 http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/africa-emerges/contraceptives-boost-poor-countries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation "Conference Examines Family Planning Benefits For Health" June 24, 2011 http://globalhealth.kff.org/Daily-Reports/2011/June/24/GH-062411-Reproductive-Health-Conference.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; to mark the 10th anniversary of Meeting the Challenge and raise the international profile of reproductive health commodity security.&lt;ref&gt;Reprodictive Health Supplies Coalition "Reproductive Health Commodity Security: Leading from behind to forge a global movement" by Julie Solo (2011) http://www.rhsupplies.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Access/JulieSolo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ERTA News "Ethiopia endeavoring to improve RH services" 22 June 2011 http://www.ertagov.com/erta/erta-news-archive/38-erta-tv-hot-news-addis-ababa-ethiopia/743-moh-ethiopia-endeavoring-to-improve-rh-services-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproductive health supplies ==
Reproductive health supplies refer to any material or consumable needed to provide reproductive health (RH) services. This includes contraceptives for family planning, drugs to treat sexually transmitted infections, and equipment such as that used for safe delivery.

More specialized definitions of RH supplies have also been formulated. One of these is [[WHO]]'s Interagency List of Essential Medicines for Reproductive Health (2006),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO) "The interagency list of essential medicines for reproductive health" (2006) by Department of Reproductive Health and Research and Department of Medicines Policy and Standards http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/general/RHR_2006_1/en/&lt;/ref&gt; which reflects the current international consensus on essential medicines for the provision of quality RH services. Because the list prioritizes medicines believed to address the most pressing public health problems, it is by definition, selective. Nonetheless, it does include a broad range of contraceptives, drugs to prevent and treat [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and medicines to ensure healthy [[pregnancy]] and delivery. The Interagency List is a subset of the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO) "Model Lists of Essential Medicines"; 17th WHO Essential Medicines List and the 3rd WHO Essential Medicines List for Children updated in March 2011 http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en&lt;/ref&gt; updated every two years since 1977. The 17th edition of the Essentials Medicines List (EML) was last published in 2011. To assist countries who formulate their own lists of essential RH supplies, based on local needs, the Coalition partners [[WHO]], [[UNFPA]] and [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health|PATH]] published the Essential Medicines for Reproductive Health: Guiding Principles for their inclusion on National Medicines Lists (2006) [http://www.path.org/publications/detail.php?i=1283].

== Threats to reproductive health commodity security ==
Worldwide, the availability of reproductive health (RH) supplies, including contraceptives, medicines for prevention and treatment of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and medicines to ensure healthy [[pregnancy]] and delivery, falls short of current demands.&lt;ref&gt;IPS "Another Push for Reproductive Rights" by Pam Johnson, June 17, 2011 http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=56134&lt;/ref&gt; No single set of factors can fully explain this reality, but the three factors are of particular significance:  &lt;br /&gt;
- Limited resources: The demand for reproductive health supplies is greater than ever and with the share of development assistance dropping, ensuring adequate donor resources has become critical to meeting the supply challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalissues.org/news/2011/06/17/10142&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
- Inadequate systems: With more responsibilities brought by a shift towards greater country ownership of the development process, it is more and more difficult to find a way through an environment that is more and more complex.&lt;br /&gt;
- Lack of coordination: Coordination and harmonization of tools at the global level are necessary to combat against resource shortfalls and failing to make the most of existing resources. Global political will and advocacy are critical to give priority to reproductive health.

== Our Strategic Pillars ==
Achieving The Coalition's vision will not occur without certain conditions being met: that supplies actually reach those who need them most; that the supplies are affordable and within the reach of all; that supplies and products are of trusted quality; and that there is a sufficient choice of supplies to meet users’ needs. These four broad preconditions—availability, equity, quality, and choice—stand as the Pillars of our Strategy.&lt;br /&gt;
- '''Availability''': The ability of women and men to obtain safe, affordable supplies that meet their reproductive health needs. Supply availability exists when products feed into the supply chain and successfully make their way to the point-of-distribution, where users can obtain them.&lt;br /&gt;
- '''Quality''': The ability of women and men to have supplies they can trust are both safe and effective. Good sexual and reproductive health depends on ensuring the quality of all reproductive health supplies.&lt;br /&gt;
- '''Equity''': The ability of all people to have equitable access to reproductive health supplies. Age, economic well-being, gender, and civil status all have profound implications for the kinds of supplies potential users seek and the ability of users to afford them. The barriers impeding universal access to sexual and reproductive health must be overcome.&lt;br /&gt;
- '''Choice''': The ability of all who seek family planning services to have a broad range of options from which to choose. An individual’s need for contraception evolves throughout his or her life cycle. Accessing the “right” contraceptive increases the likelihood reproductive health needs will be met; a mismatch, research shows, is more likely to lead to dissatisfaction, lower continuation rates, and often method failure.

== Working Groups and other mechanisms for collaboration ==
Three Working Groups are the principal vehicles through which Coalition members collaborate.&lt;br /&gt;
The Market Development Approaches (MDA) Working Group contributes to the goal of reproductive health supply security through a greater focus on the "total market", which includes the private and commercial sectors.&lt;br /&gt;
The Advocacy and Accountability (A&amp;A WG) Working Group (formerly known as Resource Mobilization and Awareness Working Group RMA WG) contributes to the health and well-being of all individuals by ensuring they have access to RH commodities they want when they need them.&lt;br /&gt;
The Systems Strengthening Working Group aims to strengthen the global, regional, and country systems needed to ensure a reliable and predictable supply of RH commodities, primarily in the public sector.

In addition to the Working Groups the Coalition includes fora and caucuses dedicated to youth, maternal health supplies, generic manufacturers, and new and underused reproductive health technologies as well as regional fora for [[Latin America]] Foro Latinoamericano y del Caribe para el Aseguramiento de insumos de SR or LAC Forum and [[Francophone Africa]] Sécurité Contraceptive en Afrique Francophone SECONAF.

== Services ==
'''Innovation Fund''' [http://www.rhsupplies.org/resources-tools/innovation-fund.html], made possible by a grant from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] makes available over US$2 million to enable member organizations to undertake activities in line with their Working Group’s objectives, which would be otherwise unfunded.

'''AccessRH'''
In 2010, [[UNFPA]]’s Procurement Services Branch launched AccessrH,&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO), Reproductive Health Essential Medicines "Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition supports AccessRH" http://www.who.int/rhem/didyouknow/rhsc/accessrh/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Official homepage of AccessRH http://www.myaccessrh.org/&lt;/ref&gt; a procurement mechanism aimed at improving customer access to affordable, high-quality contraceptives with favorable delivery terms. In December 2010, AccessrH placed its first order for 23.8 million condoms.

'''RHInterchange'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/rhem/didyouknow/rhsc/rhinterchange/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a free, web-based tool that provides accurate information on past, present, and future supply orders for over 144 countries.

'''Supplies Information Database (SID)''' [http://www.rhsupplies.org/resources-tools/supplies-information-database-sid.html] is an online reference library with over 6,000 records on the status of reproductive health supplies at country-level. The library includes studies, assessments and other publications dating back to 1986, many of which are no longer available even in their country of origin.

'''Coordinated Assistance for RH Supplies (CARhs)'''
CARhs [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/74169013/Countries-At-Risk-Progress-and-Remaining-Challenges] brings together the world’s commodity suppliers to address short-term supply crises. Through electronic data-sharing members identify existing or potential supply shortages and develop solutions. Between October 2009 and September 2010 CARhs addressed 184 separate supply crises and in the instances in which stock levels had dropped below minimal requirements, CARhs averted a [[stockout]], either by issuing new shipments or providing policy advice. In 2010, such remedial efforts drove the procurement of more than $8.7 million in reproductive health commodities.

'''MarketBookshelf.com''' [http://marketbookshelf.com] is a large and open-access collection of health market literature, offering immediate access to documents and related resources needed to understand, develop and intervene in different global health markets. It covers a broad range of health areas, including malaria, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, contraception, neonatal and child health, maternal health, tuberculosis &amp; other communicable diseases, immunization and non-communicable disease.

== Funding ==
The Coalition is funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[DFID]], [[UNFPA]], [[USAID]]&lt;ref&gt;Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition "Annual report 2010" http://www.rhsupplies.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Annual_Report/ARFinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and other members' contributions.

== HANDtoHAND Campaign ==
More than 215 million women who wish to protect themselves from unintended and potentially unsafe pregnancy do not have access to modern contraception. In 2010, the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition established the HANDtoHAND Campaign&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA "On 100th International Women’s Day, UNFPA Promotes Campaign to Put Contraceptive Choices in 100 Million Women’s Hands" 08 March 2011  http://www.unfpa.org/public/cache/offonce/home/news/pid/7361;jsessionid=059FAF7532AE014FB206B84586886B0C&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of reaching 100 million additional users of modern contraception by 2015. Reaching this goal will meet the family planning needs of 80 percent of women in low- and middle-income countries. It will mean 96 million fewer unintended pregnancies, 54 million fewer [[abortions]], 110,000 fewer mothers dying in pregnancy and childbirth, and 1.4 million fewer infant deaths. The Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition is leading the effort by urging stakeholders in both the public and private sectors to commit resources and support to reach this goal. At the September United Nations Summit on the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in New York, [[AusAID]], the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Dfid]] and [[USAID]] adopted the 100 million metric as a cornerstone of their International Alliance for Reproductive, Maternal and Newborn Health.&lt;ref&gt;USAID "International Alliance For Reproductive, Maternal, and Newborn Health" September 22, 2010  http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/alliance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1567">'''South Asian English''' is the English of [[South Asia]].

English was introduced to South Asia in the early 17th century and reinforced by the long rule of the [[British Empire]].

Today it is spoken as a [[second language]] by about 33 million people, 3% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgardner, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is fairly homogeneous across the region, sharing "linguistic features and tendencies at virtually all linguistic levels", there are also differences based on various factors.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Schilk, Tobias Bernaisch, Joybrato Mukherjee, "Mapping unity and diversity in South Asian English lexicogrammar: Verb-complementational preferences across varieties", in Marianne Hundt, Ulrike Gut, ''Mapping Unity and Diversity World-Wide: Corpus-Based Studies of New Englishes'', 2012, {{ISBN|9027274940}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1U2aH1RJgC&amp;pg=PA140 p. 140''f'']&lt;/ref&gt;

South Asian English is sometimes called "Indian English", as [[British India]] included most of the region, but today, the varieties of English are usually divided according to the modern states:
*[[Bangladeshi English]]
*[[Indian English]]
*[[Nepali English]]
*[[Pakistani English]]
*[[Sri Lankan English]]

'''''The Case Against Free Trade: [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and the Globalization of Corporate Power''''' ({{ISBN|1-55643-169-4}}) is a book edited by [[Ralph Nader]] which was first published in 1993. Besides Nader himself, the chapters are authored by many well known writers, activists and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Free-Trade-Globalization/dp/1556431694|title=The Case Against Free Trade: GATT, NAFTA and the Globalization of Corporate Power An Earth Island Press Book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|last2=Brown|first2=Jerry|date=1993-09-22|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556431692|edition=First Edition, First Printing edition|location=San Francisco, Calif|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volume is claims critical of the [[free trade]] system, claiming that [[corporations]] are using free trade as a cloak or smokescreen under which they intend to circumvent the democratic process to harm the health and safety of the general public. According to an excerpt from the introduction, "operating under the deceptive banner of "free" trade, multinational corporations are working hard to expand their control over the international economy and to undo vital health, safety, and economic protections won by citizen movements across the globe in recent decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historymuse.net/readings/NaderFREETRADE&amp;DEMOCRACY.htm|title=Ralph Nader, "Free Trade and the Decline of Democracy" (1993)|website=www.historymuse.net|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Corporations and Mercantile Union''' (UCMU) is a [[Sri Lanka]]n  [[trade union]] which brings together workers in the public sector.

The UCMU was founded in 1968. Dr [[N.M. Perera]] became its President and [[Anil Moonesinghe]] became its General Secretary. Moonesinghe travelled the country from factory to factory building up a union of several tens of thousands of members. One of his lieutenants in this task was [[Vasudeva Nanayakkara]], who became an MP in 1970. At the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1970|1970 general election]], the UCMU also sponsored the candidature of the Chairman of its Vidyodaya University branch, [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] who was later to become [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] and then [[President of Sri Lanka]].

In 1970, when Anil Moonesinghe went to the [[Ceylon Transport Board]] as Chairman, he was succeeded as General Secretary by [[Percy Wickremasekera]]. After the death of Dr N.M. Perera in 1979, Anil Moonesinghe became President.

The year 2005 was named the '''World Year of Physics''', also known as '''Einstein Year''', in recognition of the 100th anniversary of [[Albert Einstein]]'s "[[Annus Mirabilis Papers|Miracle Year]]", in which he published four landmark papers, and the subsequent advances in the field of [[physics]].

==History==

Physics has been the basis for understanding the physical world and nature as a whole. The applications of physics are the basis for much of today's technology. In order to both raise worldwide awareness of physics and celebrate the major advances made in the field, the World Congress of Physical Societies proposed&lt;ref name=fusion&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.euro-fusion.org/newsletter/2005-unesco-world-year-of-physics/ |title=2005 – UNESCO World Year of Physics |publisher=Eurofusion |date=December 1, 2004 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[IUPAP|International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] resolved that 2005 should be commemorated as the World Year of Physics. This was subsequently endorsed by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=fusion/&gt;
