      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21870">The '''air traffic control radar beacon system''' ('''ATCRBS''') is a system used in [[air traffic control]] (ATC) to enhance surveillance [[radar]] monitoring and separation of air traffic.  It consists of a rotating ground antenna and [[transponder]]s in aircraft.  The ground antenna sweeps a narrow vertical beam of [[microwave]]s around the airspace.  When the beam strikes an aircraft, the transponder transmits a return signal back giving information such as the [[flight number]] designation and altitude of the aircraft.  ATCRBS assists [[air traffic control]] (ATC) surveillance radars by  acquiring information about the [[aircraft]] being monitored, and providing this information to the radar controllers. The controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft (known as ''targets'') and to distinguish those returns from [[Clutter (radar)|ground clutter]].

==Parts of the system==
The system consists of [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]]s, installed in aircraft, and [[secondary surveillance radar]]s (SSRs), installed at air traffic control facilities. The SSR is sometimes co-located with the '''primary surveillance radar''', or PSR. These two radar systems work in conjunction to produce a synchronized surveillance picture. The SSR transmits interrogations and listens for any replies. Transponders that receive an interrogation decode it, decide whether to reply, and then respond with the requested information when appropriate. Note that in common informal usage, the term "SSR" is sometimes used to refer to the entire ATCRBS system, however this term (as found in technical publications) properly refers only to the ground radar itself.

[[Image:ASR-9 Radar Antenna.jpg|frame|right|The [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] system of a typical air traffic control radar, the ASR-9.  The curved reflector antenna on the bottom is the [[primary surveillance radar]] (PSR), and the flat antenna on top of it is the [[secondary surveillance radar]] (SSR).  In operation the antenna rotates about a vertical axis, sweeping a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the local airspace to locate and track aircraft. ]]

===Ground Interrogation Equipment===
An ATC ground station consists of two radar systems and their associated support components. The most prominent component is the PSR. It is also  referred to as ''skin paint radar'' because it shows not synthetic or alpha-numeric target symbols, but bright (or colored) blips or areas on the radar screen produced by the RF energy reflections from the target's "skin." This is a non-cooperative process, no additional avionic devices are needed. The radar detects and displays reflective objects within the radar's operating range. [[Weather radar]] data is displayed in skin paint mode. The primary surveillance radar is subject to the [[Radar#Radar equation|radar equation]] that says signal strength drops off as the fourth power of distance to the target. Objects detected using the PSR are known as '''primary targets.'''

The second system is the '''secondary surveillance radar''', or SSR, which depends on a cooperating [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] installed on the aircraft being tracked. The transponder emits a signal when it is interrogated by the secondary radar. In a transponder based system signals drop off as the inverse square of the distance to the target, instead of the fourth power in primary radars. As a result, effective range is greatly increased for a given power level. The transponder can also send encoded information about the aircraft, such as identity and altitude.

The SSR is equipped with a main [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], and an [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] "Omni" antenna at many older sites. Newer antennas (as in the adjacent picture), are grouped as a left and right antenna, and each side connects to a hybrid device which combines the signals into sum and difference channels. Still other sites have both the sum and difference antenna, and an Omni antenna.  Surveillance aircraft, e.g. AWACS, have only the sum and difference antennas, but can also be space stabilized by phase shifting the beam down or up when pitched or rolled. The SSR antenna is typically fitted to the PSR antenna, so they point in the same direction as the antennas rotate. The omnidirectional antenna is mounted near and high, usually on top of the radome if equipped. Mode-S interrogators require the sum and difference channels to provide the [[Monopulse radar|monopulse]] capability to measure the off-boresight angle of the transponder reply.

The SSR repetitively transmits interrogations as the rotating radar antenna scans the sky. The interrogation specifies what type of information a replying transponder should send by using a system of modes. There have been a number of modes used historically, but four are in common use today: mode 1, mode 2, mode 3/A, and mode C.  '''Mode 1''' is used to sort military targets during phases of a mission. '''Mode 2''' is used to identify military aircraft missions. '''Mode 3/A''' is used to identify each aircraft in the radar's coverage area. '''Mode C''' is used to request/report an aircraft's altitude.

Two other modes, mode 4 and mode S, are not considered part of the ATCRBS system, but they use the same transmit and receive hardware. '''Mode 4''' is used by military aircraft for the [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) system.  '''Mode S''' is a discrete selective interrogation, rather than a general broadcast, that facilitates [[TCAS]] for civilian aircraft. Mode S transponders ignore interrogations not addressed with their unique identity code, reducing channel congestion. At a typical SSR radar installation, ATCRBS, IFF, and mode S interrogations will all be transmitted in an interlaced fashion. Some military facilities and/or aircraft will also utilize Mode S.

Returns from both radars at the ground station are transmitted to the ATC facility using a [[microwave]] link, a [[coaxial cable|coaxial]] link, or (with newer radars) a [[digitizer]] and a [[modem]]. Once received at the ATC facility, a computer system known as a '''radar data processor''' associates the reply information with the proper primary target and displays it next to the target on the radar scope.

===Airborne Transponder Equipment===
The equipment installed in the aircraft is considerably simpler, consisting of the transponder itself, usually mounted in the instrument panel or [[avionics]] rack, and a small [[L band]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] antenna, mounted on the bottom of the [[fuselage]]. Many commercial aircraft also have an antenna on the top of the fuselage, and either or both antennas can be selected by the flight crew.

Typical installations also include an altitude [[encoder]], which is a small device connected to both the transponder and the aircraft's static system. It provides the aircraft's [[pressure altitude]] to the transponder, so that it may relay the information to the ATC facility. The encoder uses 11 wires to pass altitude information to the transponder in the form of a [[Gillham Code]], a modified binary Gray code.

[[File:Transponder 2.jpg|thumb|A light aircraft transponder]]
The transponder has a small required set of controls and is simple to operate. It has a method to enter the four-digit [[transponder code]], also known as a ''beacon code'' or ''squawk code'', and a control to transmit an ''[[ident (aviation)|ident]]'', which is done at the controller's request (see SPI pulse below). Transponders typically have 4 operating modes: Off, Standby, On (Mode-A), and Alt (Mode-C). On and Alt mode differ only in that the On mode inhibits transmitting any altitude information. Standby mode allows the unit to remain powered and warmed up but inhibits any replies, since the radar is used for searching the aircraft and exact location of aircraft.

==Theory of operation==
The steps involved in performing an ATCRBS interrogation are as follows:  First, the ATCRBS '''interrogator''' periodically interrogates aircraft on a frequency of 1030&amp;nbsp;MHz.  This is done through a rotating or scanning antenna at the radar's assigned Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF).  Interrogations are typically performed at 450 - 500 interrogations/second.  Once an interrogation has been transmitted, it travels through space (at the speed of light) in the direction the antenna is pointing until an aircraft is reached.

When the aircraft receives the interrogation, the aircraft '''transponder''' will send a reply on 1090&amp;nbsp;MHz after a 3.0 μs delay indicating the requested information.  The interrogator's processor will then decode the reply and identify the aircraft.  The range of the aircraft is determined from the delay between the reply and the interrogation.  The azimuth of the aircraft is determined from the direction the antenna is pointing when the first reply was received, until the last reply is received. This window of azimuth values is then divided by two to give the calculated "centroid" azimuth. The errors in this algorithm cause the aircraft to jitter across the controllers scope, and is referred to as "track jitter." The jitter problem makes software tracking algorithms problematic, and is the reason why monopulse was implemented.

===The interrogation===
Interrogations consist of three pulses, 0.8 μs in duration, referred to as P1, P2 and P3. The timing between pulses P1 and P3 determines the mode (or question) of the interrogation, and thus what the nature of the reply should be. P2 is used in side-lobe suppression, explained later.

Mode 3/A uses a P1 to P3 spacing of 8.0 μs, and is used to request the ''beacon code'', which was assigned to the aircraft by the controller to identify it. Mode C uses a spacing of 21 μs, and requests the aircraft's pressure altitude, provided by the altitude encoder.  Mode 2 uses a spacing of 5 μs and requests the aircraft to transmit its Military identification code.  The latter is only assigned to Military aircraft and so only a small percentage of aircraft actually reply to a mode 2 interrogation.

===The reply===
Replies to interrogations consist of 15 time slots, each 1.45 μs in width. The reply is encoded by the presence or absence of a 0.45 μs pulse in each slot.  These are labeled as follows:

'''F1 C1 A1 C2 A2 C4 A4 X B1 D1 B2 D2 B4 D4 F2   SPI'''

The F1 and F2 pulses are [[frame synchronization|framing]] pulses, and are always transmitted by the aircraft transponder. They are used by the interrogator to identify legitimate replies.  These are spaced 20.3 μs apart.

The A4, A2, A1, B4, B2, B1, C4, C2, C1, D4, D2, D1 pulses constitute the "information" contained in the reply. These bits are used in different ways for each interrogation mode.

For mode A, each digit in the [[transponder code]] (A, B, C, or D) may be a number from zero to seven. These [[octal]] digits are transmitted as groups of three pulses each, the A slots reserved for the first digit, B for the second, and so on.

In a mode C reply, the altitude is encoded by a ''[[Gillham interface]]'', [[Gillham code]], which uses [[Gray code]]. The Gillham interface is capable of representing a wide range of altitudes, in {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} increments. The altitude transmitted is pressure altitude, and corrected for [[altimeter]] setting at the ATC facility. If no encoder is attached, the transponder may optionally transmit only framing pulses (most modern transponders do).

In a mode 3 reply, the information is the same as a mode A reply in that there are 4 digits transmitted between 0 and 7.  The term mode 3 is utilized by the military, whereas mode A is the civilian term.

The X bit is currently only used for test targets.  This bit was originally transmitted by [[Bomarc Missile Program|BOMARC missiles]] that were used as air-launched test targets.  This bit may be used by drone aircraft.

The SPI pulse is positioned 4.35μs past the F2 pulse (3 time slots) and is used as a "Special Identification Pulse".  The SPI pulse is turned on by the "identity control" on the transponder in the aircraft cockpit when requested by air traffic control.  The air traffic controller can request the pilot to ident, and when the identity control is activated, the SPI bit will be added to the reply for about 20 seconds (two to four rotations of the interrogator antenna) thereby highlighting the track on the controllers display.

====Side lobe suppression====
The SSR's directional antenna is never perfect; inevitably it will "leak" lower levels of RF energy in off-axis directions. These are known as [[side lobe]]s. When aircraft are close to the ground station, the side lobe signals are often strong enough to elicit a reply from their transponders when the antenna is not pointing at them. This can cause ''ghosting'', where an aircraft's target may appear in more than one location on the radar scope. In extreme cases, an effect known as ''ring-around'' occurs, where the transponder replies to excess resulting in an arc or circle of replies centered on the radar site.

To combat these effects, '''side lobe suppression''' (SLS) is used. SLS employs a third pulse, P2, spaced 2μs after P1. This pulse is transmitted from the omnidirectional antenna (or the antenna difference channel) by the ground station, rather than from the directional antenna (or the sum channel). The power output from the omnidirectional antenna is calibrated so that, when received by an aircraft, the P2 pulse is stronger than either P1 or P3, ''except'' when the directional antenna is pointing directly at the aircraft. By comparing the relative strengths of P2 and P1, airborne transponders can determine whether or not the antenna is pointing at the aircraft when the interrogation was received. The power to the difference antenna pattern (for systems so equipped) is not adjusted from that of the P1 and P3 pulses. Algorithms are used in the ground receivers to delete replies on the edge of the two beam patterns.

To combat these effects more recently, side lobe suppression (SLS) is still used, but differently. The new and improved SLS employs a third pulse, spaced 2μs either before P3 (a new P2 position) or after P3 (which should be called P4 and appears in the Mode S radar and TCAS specifications). This pulse is transmitted from the directional antenna at the ground station, and the power output of this pulse is the same strength as the P1 and P3 pulses. The action to be taken is specified in the new and improved C74c as:

2.6 Decoding Performance.
 
c. Side-lobe Suppression. The transponder must be suppressed for a period of 35 ±10 microseconds following receipt of a pulse pair of proper spacing and suppression action must be capable of being reinitiated for the full duration within 2 microseconds after the end of any suppression period. The transponder must be suppressed with a 99 percent efficiency over a received signal amplitude range between 3 db above minimum triggering level and 50 db above that level and upon receipt of properly spaced interrogations when the received amplitude of P2 is equal to or in excess of the received amplitude of P1 and spaced 2.0 ±0.15 microsecond from P3.

Any requirement at the transponder to detect and act upon a P2 pulse 2μs after P1 has been removed from the new and improved TSO C74c specification.

Most "modern" transponders (manufactured since 1973) have an "SLS" circuit which suppresses reply on receipt of any two pulses in any interrogation spaced 2.0 microseconds apart that are above the MTL Minimum Triggering Level threshold of the receiver amplitude discriminator (P1-&gt;P2 or P2-&gt;P3 or P3-&gt;P4).  This approach was used to comply with the original C74c and but also complies with the provisions of the new and improved C74c.

The FAA refers to the non-responsiveness of new and improved TSO C74c compliant transponders to Mode S compatible radars and TCAS as "The Terra Problem", and has issued Airworthiness Directives (ADs) against various transponder manufacturers, over the years, at various times on no predictable schedule.  The ghosting and ring around problems have recurred on the more modern radars.

To combat these effects most recently, great emphasis is placed upon software solutions.  It is highly likely that one of those software algorithms was the proximate cause of a mid-air collision recently, as one airplane was reported at showing its altitude as the pre-flight paper filed flight plan, and not the altitude assigned by the ATC controller (see the reports and observations contained in the below reference ATC Controlled Airplane Passenger Study of how radar worked).

==Radar display==
[[File:Syntheticvideo.jpg|thumb|Detail of a radarscreen: a target in skin paint mode (amber) and as synthetic video (white)]]
The beacon code and altitude were historically displayed verbatim on the radar scope next to the target, however modernization has extended the radar data processor with a '''flight data processor''', or FDP. The FDP automatically assigns beacon codes to [[flight plan]]s, and when that beacon code is received from an aircraft, the computer can associate it with flight plan information to display immediately useful data, such as aircraft [[callsign]], the aircraft's next navigational fix, assigned and current altitude, etc. near the target in a ''data block''.
Although the ATCRBS does not display aircraft heading.&lt;ref&gt;Jeppesen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mode S==
{{see also |Secondary surveillance radar#Mode S}}

Mode S, or ''mode select'', despite also being called a mode, is actually a radically improved system intended to replace ATCRBS altogether. A few countries have mandated mode S, and many other countries, including the United States, have begun phasing out ATCRBS in favor of this system. Mode S is designed to be fully backward compatible with existing ATCRBS technology.

Mode S, despite being called a replacement transponder system for ATCRBS, is actually a data packet protocol which can be used to augment ATCRBS transponder positioning equipment (radar and TCAS).

One major improvement of Mode S is the ability to interrogate a single aircraft at a time. With old ATCRBS technology, all aircraft within the beam pattern of the interrogating station will reply. In an airspace with multiple interrogation stations, ATCRBS transponders in aircraft can be overwhelmed. By interrogating one aircraft at a time, workload on the aircraft transponder is greatly reduced.

The second major improvement is increased azimuth accuracy. With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth of the aircraft is determined by the half split (centroid) method. The half split method is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the radar beam sweeps past its position. Then the midpoint between the start and stop azimuth is used for aircraft position. With MSSR (monopulse secondary surveillance radar) and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse. This monopulse method results in superior azimuth resolution, and removes target jitter from the display.

The Mode S system also includes a more robust communications protocol, for a wider variety of information exchange. At this time, this capability is becoming mandatory across Europe with some states already requiring its use.

The '''American Council of Engineering Companies''' (ACEC) is the oldest and largest business association of engineering companies. It is organized as a federation of 52 state and regional councils with national headquarters in Washington, D.C., comprising thousands of engineering practices throughout the country. It administers extensive lobbying and education programs.

==History==
ACEC traces its roots to the Association of Architectural Engineers, founded in New York City in 1905 to promote the business interests of consulting engineers. The organization, which was based on individual memberships, changed its name to the American Institute of Consulting Engineers (AICE) in 1909. Similar organizations soon sprung up in many states.

In 1956, representatives from 10 state associations created a national Consulting Engineers Council (CEC), representing engineering firms rather than individuals. By 1960, CEC had grown to 29 state member organizations, representing more than 1,000 firms.

In 1973, CEC and AICE merged to create the American Consulting Engineers Council (ACEC). To accommodate the individual members of AICE, the new organization created a College of Fellows membership category.

ACEC’s advocacy activities covered a broad range of issues, sometimes necessitating the creation of spin-off groups to pursue specific goals. For example, in 1986, ACEC founded the American Tort Reform Association (ATRA) to lobby for the reform of unfair liability statutes nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Tort Reform Association]]. [http://www.atra.org/about/ About ARTA]. Accessed 2018-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ACEC changed its name to the American Council of Engineering Companies to reflect both its firm-based membership and the increasingly diversified and multi-disciplinary nature of engineering practices, including design-build practices.

In 2006, President George W. Bush gave a major mid-term address at the ACEC Annual Convention in Washington, D.C., recognizing the organization for its public policy advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[George W. Bush|Bush, George W.]]. [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060503-4.html President Bush Discusses Strong and Growing U.S. Economy]. whitehouse.gov. May 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, along with the American Public Works Association (APWA) and American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), ACEC founded the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI), which has developed the Envision® sustainability rating system for infrastructure works.

==Advocacy==

ACEC advocates for the business interests of its member firms before legislatures, executive agencies, courts, and in public media. 

'''Qualifications-Based Selection (QBS).''' In 1972, the Council was a prime mover in the passage of the A/E Selection Procedures Act, also known as the Brooks Act, which requires that the U.S. Federal Government procure engineering and architecture services through Qualifications-Based Selection (QBS) rather than solely by price. Most states have adopted similar legislation. ACEC today seeks to bolster and expand the reach of QBS as a business “best practice” to ensure innovation, successful performance and public safety. 

'''Contracting Out.''' The Council is a strong proponent of both federal and state contracting out of engineering services, asserting that such work is not “inherently a governmental” and can be best and most economically performed by the private sector.

In 2000, ACEC was a key advocate of the "Thomas Amendment" in the Water Resources and Development Act, which limits the extent to which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can compete with private engineering firms in municipal works such as schools, hospitals, and utilities.

In 2016, an ACEC-sponsored contracting out study, conducted by New York University, concluded that contracting out of engineering services by state departments of transportation provided demonstrable savings over having those same services performed by DOT in-house operations.

'''Acquisition Regulations.''' In 2011, ACEC led a large business coalition that won repeal of the 3 percent withholding provision on federal, state, and local contracts. 

The Council has also: secured reforms in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) pertaining to overhead and audit requirements; removed the mandatory 10 percent retainage on fixed-private federal architectural/engineering (A/E) contracts; expanded opportunities for small firms to compete for Department of Defense contracts; exempted A/E services from Project Labor Agreements on federal projects; and secured reforms to the federal design-build competition process. 

'''Infrastructure Investment.''' ACEC has been a leading proponent of increased infrastructure investment in surface transportation, water, aviation and energy.

ACEC has supported the passage of every long-term surface transportation program, including the ''Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act'' (ISTEA) (1991), ''Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century'' (TEA-21) (1998), ''Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users'' (SAFETEA-LU) (2005), ''Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act'' (MAP-21) (2012), and ''Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act'' (FAST Act) (2015).

'''Tax Reform.''' In 2004, ACEC helped win passage of a 9 percent tax deduction for engineering and other firms as part of the American Jobs Creation Act; in 2011, defeated a mandate for filing 1099 forms for every purchase of goods valued at more than $600; and in 2016, secured the extension of key tax benefits for engineering firms, including the R&amp;D tax credit, bonus depreciation, small business expensing, and renewable energy tax credits. The Council also continues to seek protection of the cash method of accounting.

'''Risk Management.''' ACEC helps member firms in understanding and managing risk, and advocates for legislative and regulatory reforms to properly control and fairly allocate risk.

In recent years, ACEC has won judicial or legislative victories on issues including indemnification provisions, the duty to defend, the Economic Loss Doctrine, and the professional standard of care.
Each year, ACEC conducts annual Professional Liability Insurance Surveys of member and carriers to gauge current market conditions.


==Political Action Committee==

The American Council of Engineering Companies Political Action Committee (ACEC/PAC) is a $1 million-plus annual PAC, the largest PAC in the A/E industry and among the top 3 percent of all federal PACs.

During the 2014-2016 election cycle, the PAC contributed more than $2 million to Congressional campaigns and had a 97 percent win record.

ACEC/PAC is bipartisan, funded solely by ACEC member contributions, and supports pro-business candidates.


==Education==

The Council holds more than 100 online classes annually, covering a wide range of business management and engineering topics.

ACEC's Senior Executives Institute (SEI) provides advanced management, leadership and public policy training for firm leaders. More than 500 executives have participated in the program.

In cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration, ACEC holds regular on-site educational workshops on Federal Acquisition Regulations.


==Publications==

ACEC publishes ''Engineering Inc.'', a bi-monthly print and online magazine focusing on business issues. 

''Last Word'' is the Council's weekly online membership newsletter.

The quarterly ''ACEC Engineering Business Index'' surveys member CEOs on the health of the engineering industry.

The Engineers Joint Contract Document Committee (EJCDC)  is a collaboration of ACEC, ASCE, and the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE)  to develop and disseminate standard contract documents for use in design and construction projects. 


==Conferences==

ACEC hosts two conferences per year. Each spring, the ACEC Annual Convention and Legislative Summit is held in Washington, D.C., featuring political speakers and member visits to congressional offices, as well as business education. 

The ACEC Fall Conference is held in different locations each year and focuses on business practice issues, markets, and political developments. 


==Awards Programs==

'''Backchannel''' is the practice of using networked [[computer]]s to maintain a real-time online conversation alongside the primary group activity or live spoken remarks. The term was coined in the field of [[linguistics]] to describe listeners' behaviours during verbal communication.  (See [[Backchannel (linguistics)]].)

The term "backchannel" generally refers to online conversation about the conference topic or speaker.  Occasionally backchannel provides audience members a chance to [[fact-checker|fact-check]] the presentation.

First growing in popularity at technology conferences, backchannel is increasingly a factor in education where [[WiFi]] connections and [[laptop]] computers allow participants to use ordinary chat like [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Joseph F., and Danah Boyd. 2005. "Digital Backchannels in Shared Physical Spaces." In CHI ’05 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI  '05, 1641–1644. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press. {{DOI|10.1145/1056808.1056986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yardi, Sarita. 2006. "The Role of the Backchannel in Collaborative Learning Environments." In Proceeding ICLS ’06 Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Learning Sciences, 852–858. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1150034.1150158.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] to actively communicate during presentation. More recent research include works where the backchannel is brought publicly visible, such as the ClassCommons,&lt;ref&gt;Du, Honglu, Mary Beth Rosson, and John M. Carroll. 2012. "Augmenting Classroom Participation through Public Digital Backchannels." In Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Design of Communication - SIGDOC ’12, 127. {{DOI|10.1145/2389176.2389201}}&lt;/ref&gt; backchan.nl&lt;ref&gt;Harry, Drew, Joshua Green, and Judith Donath. 2009. "Backchan.nl." In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI 09, 1361–1370.

Twitter is also widely used today by audiences to create backchannels during broadcasting of content or at conferences. For example, television drama,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, K.; K Huotari; Yo-Shang Cheng; David Humphrey; Coye Cheshire; and Andrew Brooks. 2012. "Glitter: A Mixed-Methods Study of Twitter Use during Glee Broadcasts." In ''Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work Companion'', 167–170. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2141569&lt;/ref&gt; other forms of entertainment &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Highfield | first1 = Tim | last2 = Harrington | first2 = Stephen | last3 = Bruns | first3 = Axel | last4 = Industries Precinct | first4 = Creative | last5 = Ave | first5 = Musk | last6 = Industries | first6 = Creative | last7 = Grove | first7 = Kelvin | year = 2013 | title = Twitter as a Technology for Audiencing and Fandom | url = | journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society | volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 315–339| doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2012.756053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and magazine programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawthorne | first1 = J. | last2 = Houston | first2 = J.

Many conferences nowadays also have a hashtag that can be used by the participants to share notes and experiences; furthermore such hashtags can be user generated.

==History==

Victor Yngve first used the phrase "[[Backchannel (linguistics)|back channel]]" in 1970 in a linguistic meaning, in the following passage: "In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening.  This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as 'yes' and 'uh-huh' without relinquishing the turn."&lt;ref&gt;Yngve, Victor. "On getting a word in edgewise," page 568. Papers from the Sixth Regional Meeting [of the] Chicago Linguistic Society, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such systems were widely imagined and tested in late 1990s and early 2000s. These cases include researcher's installations on conferences&lt;ref&gt;Rekimoto, Jun, Yuji Ayatsuka, Hitoraka Uoi, and Toshifumi Arai. 1998. "Adding Another Communication Channel to Reality." In CHI 98 Conference Summary on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI ’98, 271–272. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press. {{DOI|10.1145/286498.286752}}&lt;/ref&gt; and classroom settings.&lt;ref&gt;Ratto, Matt, R. Benjamin Shapiro, Tan Minh Truong, and William G. Griswold. 2003. "The Activeclass Project: Experiments in Encouraging Classroom Participation." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Support for Collaborative Learning 2003, 477–486. {{DOI|10.1007/978-94-017-0195-2_57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first famous instance of backchannel communications influencing a talk occurred on March 26, 2002, at the [[PC Forum]] conference, when [[Qwest]] CEO [[Joe Nacchio]] famously lamented the difficulties of raising capital.  Journalists [[Dan Gillmor]] and [[Doc Searls]] posted accounts, from the audience, in real-time, to their [[Blog|weblogs]].  Buzz Bruggeman, a reader of Gillmor's, emailed information about a recent sizable transaction that had made Nacchio very wealthy; both Gillmor and Searls updated their weblogs with that information.

In her article referring to the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20020406182532/http://www.edventure.com/conversation/article.cfm?Counter=8648145 Parallel Channel]," PC Forum host [[Esther Dyson]] wrote, "around that point, the audience turned hostile."  Many commentators later attributed the audience's hostility to the information people shared while surfing and communicating on their laptops during Nacchio's remarks.

==Effect==
Research has demonstrated that backchannels help participants to feel as contributing members, not passive followers&lt;ref&gt;Du, Honglu, Mary Beth Rosson, John M. Carroll, and Craig Ganoe. 2009. "I Felt like a Contributing Member of the Class." In Proceedinfs of the ACM 2009 International Conference on Supporting Group Work - GROUP ’09, 233–242. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press. {{DOI|10.1145/1531674.1531709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rekimoto, Jun, Yuji Ayatsuka, Hitoraka Uoi, and Toshifumi Arai. 1998. "Adding Another Communication Channel to Reality." In CHI 98 Conference Summary on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI ’98, 271–272. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press. {{DOI|10.1145/286498.286752}}&lt;/ref&gt; and make them feel more social.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, K; K. Huotari; Yo-Shang Cheng; David Humphrey; Coye Cheshire; and Andrew Brooks. 2012. "Glitter: A Mixed-Methods Study of Twitter Use during Glee Broadcasts." In Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work Companion, 167–170. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2141569.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the research is mixed on the nature of this discussions, and especially regarding social interaction on the backchannels: some cases report vast interaction where as others highlight that interaction on the platform was considered low.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, K.; K. Huotari; Yo-Shang Cheng; David Humphrey; Coye Cheshire; and Andrew Brooks. 2012. "Glitter: A Mixed-Methods Study of Twitter Use during Glee Broadcasts." In ''Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work Companion'', 167–170. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2141569.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Du, Honglu; Mary Beth Rosson; and John M. Carroll. 2012. "Communication Patterns for a Classroom Public Digital Backchannel." In ''Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Design of Communication - SIGDOC ’12'', 127. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press. {{DOI|10.1145/2379057.2379081}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are indicators that these tools however engage different members of the audience to provide their input.&lt;ref&gt;Nelimarkka, Matti, Kai Kuikkaniemi, and Giulio Jacucci. 2014. "A Field Trial of an Anonymous Backchannel Among Primary School Pupils." In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Supporting Group Work - GROUP ’14, 238–242. New York, New York, USA: ACM Press. {{DOI|10.1145/2660398.2660399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in education==
Since its inception in 1998 at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], the [[Internet2]] initiative known as the [[Access Grid]] (a large-format presentation, [[video conferencing]] and interactive environment) has used backchannel communications to permit the node operators to pass URLs for display at another site, troubleshoot problems and even discuss what's for lunch at their location.  The [[Access Grid]] backchannel has evolved from the use of a [[MOO]] to [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]].

In 2009 Purdue University developed a tool called Hotseat that enabled students to comment on the course lectures in near real-time using social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter.

Using a backchannel for educational purposes can function as a formal class activity or even an independent discussion without instructor participation and awareness. Aside from the normal discussion, a backchannel can also be used for note taking, asking questions, offering suggestions on different topics, and sharing resources with other students and faculty members. There are many different media networks out there that can be used as a backchannel. Including Twitter, Facebook, Yammer and Instant Messaging.

==Experiments==

[[Joichi Ito]]'s [[HeckleBot]] includes an LED text panel displaying phrases sent from the chat room to catch the attention of the speaker or audience.  The [[USC Interactive Media Division]] has experimented with "Google Jockeys" to feed visual information and search results between the speakers and the backchannel, projected on multiple screens surrounding their seminars. Software like [[SubEthaEdit]] allows for more formal backchannel: collaborative notetaking. In 2007 the [http://novemberlearning.com Building Learning Communities Conference] in Boston, Massachusetts used tools such as [[Twitter]] and [[Skype]] to create backchannels that included participants who were not on location and at times in remote parts of the world. At times presenters were not aware of the backchannel and other occasions the presenters themselves were involved in the backchannel.

'''Baker Hughes, a GE company''' ('''BHGE''') is an international industrial service company and one of the world's largest [[List of oilfield service companies|oil field services]] companies. As of July 2017 Baker Hughes is 62.5% owned by [[General Electric]] Company and 37.5% publicly traded (NYSE:BHGE)&lt;ref&gt;Form 8-K,
 Baker Hughes, a GE company, July 3, 2017, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;. It operates in more than 120 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bhge.com/our-company|title=Our Company: Baker Hughes, a GE Company - BHGE|website=sitenametest|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, providing the [[oil and gas industry]] with products and services for [[oil drilling]], [[formation evaluation]], completion, production and reservoir consulting. Baker Hughes, a GE Company has its headquarters in the legacy BHI headquarters in [[Houston, Texas]].

==History==
BHGE is the combination of many companies that have developed and introduced technology to serve the petroleum service industry. Their combined history dates back to the early 1900s. During its history, Baker Hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including: Brown Oil Tools, CTC, EDECO, and Elder Oil Tools (completions); [[Milchem]] and Newpark ([[drilling fluid]]s); EXLOG ([[mud logging]]); [[Frank Christensen|Eastman Christensen]] and Drilex (directional drilling and diamond drill bits); Teleco (measurement while drilling); Tri-State and Wilson (fishing tools and services); Aquaness, [[Chemlink]] and Petrolite (specialty chemicals), [[Western Atlas]] (seismic exploration, well logging), [[BJ Services Company]] (pressure pumping).

[[File:Sharp-Hughes Tool Company, 1915.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hughes Tool Company]]'s oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown Houston, 1915.]]
The [[Hughes Tool Company]] was founded in 1908 by business partners [[Walter Benona Sharp]] and [[Howard R. Hughes, Sr.]], father of [[Howard Hughes|Howard R. Hughes, Jr.]]. That year, Hughes, Sr. and Sharp developed the first two-cone drill bit, designed to enable [[rotary drilling]] in harder, deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits. They conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in [[Goose Creek, Texas]]. Each time, Hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor, pulled the bit from a locked wooden box, and then his associates ran the bit into the hole. The drill pipe twisted off on the first test, but the second was extremely successful. In 1909, the Sharp &amp; Hughes bit was granted a U.S. patent. In the same year, the partners formed the Sharp-Hughes Tool Company in Houston, Texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring 20 by {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

After Walter Sharp died in 1912, Hughes purchased Sharp's half of the business. The company was renamed Hughes Tool Company in 1915, and Hughes, Jr. inherited it after his father's death in 1924. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Hughes Tool Company remained a private enterprise, owned by Hughes. While Hughes was engaged in his Hollywood and aviation enterprises, managers in Houston, such as Fred Ayers and Maynard Montrose, kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion. In 1958, the Engineering and Research Laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments, such as a direct reading spectrometer and x-ray diffractometer. In 1959, Hughes introduced self-lubricating, sealed bearing rock bits. After collecting data from thousands of bit runs, Hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in 1960; 1964 saw the introduction of the X-Line rock bits, combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets.

Baker International was formed by [[Reuben C. Baker]], who developed a [[Casing shoe]], that revolutionized cable tool drilling. In July 1907, R.C. Baker, a 34-year-old inventor and entrepreneur in [[Coalinga, California]], was granted a U.S. patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells. This innovation launched the business that would become Baker Oil Tools and [[Baker Hughes Incorporated]]. Mr. Baker had arrived in the California oilfield in 1895 with 95 cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the Los Angeles oil boom. Subsequently, he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment. In 1928, Baker Casing Shoe Company changed its name to Baker Oil Tools, Inc., to reflect its product line of completion, cementing and fishing equipment.

In early 1956, during one of the most successful periods in the company's history, Reuben C. Baker retired as President of Baker Oil Tools.  A few weeks later, he died after a brief illness at the age of 85 and was succeeded by his long-time associate Ted Sutter.  Although he only had three years of formal education, Mr. Baker had been granted 150 patents.  In 1965, Mr. Sutter was succeeded by E.H. "Hubie" Clark, who would become the first Baker Hughes chairman of the board in 1987; during its 80-year history before the Baker Hughes merger, Baker had only three chief executives.

INTEQ also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of Baker Hughes which consisted of Milpark and others. This division was called 'INTEQ drilling fluids' which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids. In 2003, these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids (BHDF), with INTEQ continuing as the Drilling and Evaluation (D&amp;E) company. INTEQ provides directional Drilling, MWD/LWD, surface logging ([[Mudlogger|Mudlogging]]) and coring services.

The company's flagship brand has been the AutoTrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering [[directional drilling]] tool and has been responsible for the company's relatively strong market share in the past few years.{{when|date=June 2013}} Introduced in 1997 with Agip S.p.A., the tool is fundamentally different compared to contemporary rivals such as the PowerDrive and the GeoPilot employing the hybrid technique &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakerhughes.com/bakerhughes/inDepth/10.no1.2004/article_inteq.pdf |title=InDepth Volume 13, 2007: 100 Years of Service |publisher=Baker Hughes |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of "pushing and pointing (vectoring) the bit" rather than only "pointing the bit" or only "pushing the bit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6840336.html |title=Drilling tool with non-rotating sleeve - Schlumberger Technology Corporation |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Baker International acquired and merged with Hughes Tool Company to form Baker Hughes Incorporated. Shortly after in 1992 Baker Hughes acquired Christensen Diamond Products and merged it with Hughes Tool Company to form the drilling and evaluation division, Hughes Christensen.

After the merger, Hughes Christensen introduced the AR Series, the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating a much wider variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional PDC bits. AR Series bits were designed to resist bit whirl by directing load forces through low-friction gauge pads.
By 1995, Hughes Christensen's Gold Series PDC line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate in front of the cutting edge, reducing the energy required to remove the rock. A year later patented ChipMaster PDCs, known for their efficiency and durability, were built on the success of the Eggbeater product line.
Hughes Christensen next introduced the Genesis HCM bits for steerable motors with patented EZSteer depth-of-cut control technology. This same technology was adapted to Genesis HCR bits for rotary steerable systems, such as the Baker Hughes AutoTrak rotary closed loop system. Genesis ZX PDCs followed with new Zenith cutters.

===Joint venture with Schlumberger===
In 2000, Baker Hughes Incorporated and [[Schlumberger]] formed a [[joint venture]] called [[WesternGeco]]. The Joint venture was signed for a period of five years, and merged Baker's Western Geophysical and Schlumberger's Geco-Prakla, the two leading seismic interpretation companies of the time. Due to diminishing exploration markets, new marginal oil fields, and low barrel prices the worldwide business of seismic exploration was surviving on just the corporate strength of the two big service companies. The only new technology that was being introduced at the time was the 4-dimensional seismic survey monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Login to access the Oil &amp; Gas Journal Subscriber Premium features.|url = http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-97/issue-22/in-this-issue/general-interest/state-of-the-art-of-4d-seismic-monitoring-the-technique-the-record-and-the-future.html|website = www.ogj.com|accessdate = 2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Baker Hughes announced it was selling its 30% share of the WesternGeco joint venture to Schlumberger for $2.4 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = (Press Release) Baker Hughes Incorporated Investor Relations|url = http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=bhi&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=845736|website = www.corporate-ir.net|accessdate = 2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PetroSkills Alliance===
In 2008, Baker Hughes Incorporated joined the [[PetroSkills Alliance]]. Member companies came together to create detailed skill and Competency Maps, which act as a guide for the 200+ short courses, taught to industry professionals in over 40 locations worldwide. Competency Maps are an analysis tool and software application that allows users to assess their skills base to identify gaps in their training, areas needing improvement or mastered skill areas within upstream, downstream, and HSE petroleum subject disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;"PetroSkills LLC: Private Company Information- BusinessWeek"&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31072180]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal charges===
In 2007, Baker Hughes Incorporated pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court to violations of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA), including bribing oil-related industry officials in Russia, Uzbekistan, Angola, Indonesia, and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/business/worldbusiness/27settle.html?ex=1335326400&amp;en=3de754dd4122acf5&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss] New York Times, Baker Hughes Admits to Overseas Bribery&lt;/ref&gt; Under the settlement, a unit of the Houston-based company pleaded guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for payments made between 2001 and 2003 to a commercial agent retained in 2000 in connection with a project in Kazakhstan. After bribes were paid, Baker Hughes was awarded an oil-services contract in a Karachaganak, Kazakhstan field that generated $219 million in revenues from 2001 to 2006.

===Labor action===
During the annual period of negotiations between trade unions and their employer counterparts in [[Norway]] 114 Baker Hughes employees were called to strike action in June 2012. Due to their key positions in the oil industry this strike by SAFE-organized Baker Hughes Incorporated employees would affect more than a dozen offshore oil installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Halvorsen, Toril Hole |title=Streik i Baker Hughes |trans-title=Strike in Baker Hughes |url=http://www.oilinfo.no/index.cfm?event=doLink&amp;famId=295719 |publisher=oilinfo.no |language=Norwegian |date=June 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120611065922/http://www.oilinfo.no/index.cfm?event=doLink&amp;famId=295719 |archivedate=June 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Some Norway oil workers on strike, production unaffected |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/10/idINL5E8HA1LV20120610 |agency=Reuters |date=June 10, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Kr9KddM?url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/10/idINL5E8HA1LV20120610 |archivedate=June 11, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed Acquisition by Halliburton ===

In November 2014, it was announced that Baker Hughes Incorporated had entered talks with [[Halliburton]] over a merger deal valued at $34.6 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3591185/halliburton-baker-hughes-merger-34-6-billion/|title=Oil Merger Worth $34.6 Billion|website=Time|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If carried out, it would have been the largest merger in the history of the industry. Halliburton proposed the acquisition of Baker Hughes, which would unite two of the largest U.S. providers of oil field services. Under the terms of the transaction, Baker Hughes shareholders would have received 1.12 shares of Halliburton common stock and $19.00 in cash for each share of Baker Hughes stock they own. The merger was approved by both Companies Stockholders and was waiting on approval from several jurisdictions, such as the US Department of justice, on concerns on how it will affect the level of competition, prices and consumer welfare for the global oilfield service providing industry. Undoubtedly, the merger would have led to increased consolidation in the oil services market. Also, officials believed that the asset sale would not help the combined company retain competitiveness, as smaller buyers would not utilize their larger rivals’ assets efficiently. The merger had a deadline of the end of April 2016 after which, if a decision had not been made, both companies could walk away from the deal if they chose. At the beginning of May 2016, the day after the deadline expired, Baker Hughes and Halliburton announced the termination of the merger agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halliburton and Baker Hughes set to terminate $35 billion deal|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/01/halliburton-baker-hughes-set-to-terminate-35b-deal-source.html|website=CNBC|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halliburton and Baker Hughes said to call off $28 billion merger|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-01/halliburton-baker-hughes-said-to-call-off-28-billion-merger|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merger with General Electric ===
At the end of October 2016, it was announced that [[General Electric]] was under negotiations for a deal valued at about $30 billion to combine [[GE Oil and Gas]] with Baker Hughes Incorporated. The transaction would create a publicly-traded entity controlled by GE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE to Combine Oil and Gas Business With Baker Hughes|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-combine-oil-and-gas-business-with-baker-hughes-1477908407|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was cleared by the EU in May 2017, and by the DOJ in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-baker-hughes-m-a-ge-eu-idUKKBN18R1RF|title=EU clears GE's Baker Hughes purchase without conditions|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subseaworldnews.com/2017/06/13/u-s-doj-approves-baker-hughes-ge-merger/|title=U.S. DoJ Approves Baker Hughes – GE Merger|publisher=|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, it was announced that Baker Hughes Incorporated would be dividing off its North America Land Pressure Pumping division to form a new [[BJ Services Company|BJ Services]] as part of its divestment agreement with GE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/baker-hughes-to-place-some-operations-into-new-land-pressure-company-1480458447 Baker Hughes to Place Some Operations Into New Land Pressure Company], 2016-12-01&lt;/ref&gt; The new BJ Services company will also be formed by a merger with ALLIED Services and ALTCEM. The merger agreement was approved by shareholders at the end of June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Form 8-K,

== Legacy companies ==

===Completions===
*Brown Oil Tools
*EDECO Petroleum Services Ltd formerly '''E'''nglish '''D'''rilling '''E'''quipment '''Co'''mpany Ltd
*Elder Oil Tools
*[[BJ Services Company]]

In 1929, Cicero C. Brown organized Brown Oil Tools in Houston, and patented the first liner hanger in 1937. Liner hangers enable drillers to lengthen their casing strings without having the liner pipe extend all the way to the surface. This saves capital cost and reduces weight borne by offshore platforms. Hughes Tool Company acquired Brown Oil Tools in 1978. In 1970, Baker Oil Tools acquired Lynes, Inc., which produced liner hangers and other completion equipment. In 1978, Baker Oil Tools introduced the Bakerline casing liner hanger. In 1985, the FlexLock Liner Hanger was introduced, extending the performance range and functionality of liner hanger systems. In 1987, the Brown liner hanger technology was merged into Baker Oil Tools. In 1992, BOT introduced the ZXP Liner Hanger Packer, with expandable metal seals, which set the stage for development of expandable screens, casing systems and liner hangers.

In 1994, Baker Oil Tools introduced multilateral completion systems, which enabled operators to install completion tools and perform selective intervention work in multiple horizontal sections from a common main wellbore.

On August 31, 2009, the company announced an intention to purchase BJ Services Company in a $5.5 billion stock and cash deal. [[Greenhill &amp; Co.]] advised on the transaction. On April 28, 2010, it was announced that Baker Hughes' acquisition of BJ Services had been finalized with some conditions.

===Drilling fluids===
*[[Milchem]]
*Newpark
*Aquaness

In 1931, Max B. Miller devised a drilling mud using a white clay as a weighting material. To market the new mud, he formed The Milwhite Company in Texas. In the mid-1930s, the company mined barites in conjunction with the Magnet Cove Barium Corporation (later called Magcobar). After a hiatus during World War II, the company resumed grinding operations using barite from a mine in Missouri and conducted mud sales through independent distributors. After 1956 Milwhite Mud Sales Company built its own sales network. In 1963 the company acquired the Aquaness chemical company, and in 1964 the combination became Milchem Incorporated. In 1971, Baker Oil Tools acquired Milchem. In 1985, Baker International acquired the drilling fluids division of Newpark Resources and merged it with Milchem's mud division to form Milpark. Meanwhile, in 1942, Oil Base Drilling Company was founded by George Miller, and made its first application of oil base mud. The company was acquired by Hughes Tool Company in 1979, and renamed Hughes Drilling Fluids in 1982. In 1987, when Baker Hughes was formed, Hughes Drilling Fluids was merged into Milpark, and in 1993, Milpark became a product line within Baker Hughes INTEQ. Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids was established as a stand-alone division in 2004.

===Mud logging and Well monitoring===
*EXLOG
*Production Quest

In 1952, in Sacramento, California a group of Stanford University engineering and geology graduates founded Exploration Logging Company (EXLOG) to provide geologic mud logging services from mobile logging units using technical innovations in hot-wire gas detection. Vern Jones was the company's first president. EXLOG would become a world leader in surface logging, rig instrumentation and data acquisition. Baker International acquired EXLOG in 1972, and invested in its expansion. By 1982, the company had more than 200 logging units and 1,000 geologists on staff. Its broad expertise in geological services would eventually become the Surface Logging Service product line of Baker Hughes INTEQ.

===Directional drilling and diamond drill bits===
*[[Frank Christensen|Eastman Christensen]]
*Drilex

In 1929, H. John Eastman introduced "controlled directional drilling" in Huntington Beach, California, using whipstocks and magnetic survey instruments to deflect the drill pipe from shore-based rigs to reach oil deposits offshore. In 1934, Mr. Eastman gained notoriety, and respect for directional drilling techniques, when he drilled the world's first [[relief well]] to control a blowout in [[Conroe, Texas|Conroe]], Texas, that had been on fire for more than a year.

In 1957, Christensen Diamond Products opened its manufacturing plant in Celle, Germany. The facility built diamond core heads and drilling bits and soon began producing stabilizers, drilling jars and other equipment. In 1977, the Celle engineering and manufacturing team introduced the Navi-Drill line of downhole drilling motors, which has led the drilling industry in performance and reliability for three decades. Other innovations developed in Celle include the industry's first steerable motor system, and the AutoTrak Rotary Closed Loop System. In 2007, the Celle Technology Center became Baker Hughes' leading research and engineering facility in the Eastern Hemisphere.

===Measurement while drilling===
*Teleco

Teleco Oilfield Services Inc was founded in 1972 and introduced the world's first MWD tool &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slb.com/media/services/resources/oilfieldreview/ors99/sum99/manage.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313040558/http://www.slb.com/media/services/resources/oilfieldreview/ors99/sum99/manage.pdf|date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978. Schlumberger introduced the LWD service in 1980.
The legacy MWD company Teleco Oilfield Services Inc. was integrated into a new division, to be known as Eastman Teleco in 1992. The division then merged the directional drilling products and services once marketed by the Eastman Christensen division with Teleco's measurement-while-drilling (MWD) services. In January 1992, Baker Hughes agreed to purchase Teleco from Sonat Inc. for $200 million cash, preferred stock and royalty from future sales of Teleco's "triple combo" sensors.

Before the acquisition, Teleco was recognized{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} as the world's leader in MWD, with an estimated $140 million in revenues, of which about $120 million were from MWD alone. Eastman Teleco was then combined with others to form INTEQ in 1993.

===Fishing tools and services===
*Tri-State
*Wilson

Tri-State and Wilson companies were acquired by Baker Oil Tools and merged to the company's Wellbore Intervention division. Tri-State was a multi-national technology leader on products like milling operation, spears, and packer retrieving.

===Specialty chemicals===

*Petrolite - 1997

William Barnickel's Tret-O-Lite business in 1920 had outgrown his initial manufacturing plant, so he built a new one in [[Webster Groves, Missouri|Webster Groves]], Missouri. The ingenious new facility had six times the capacity of the old plant and was built on a hillside so that raw materials were unloaded from a railroad line on the top of the hill, and the chemicals flowed through the plant using the force of gravity. Finished product was loaded on rail cars at the bottom of the hill. In 1922, the company sold 10,815 drums of Tret-O-Lite demulsifier, representing a recovery of {{convert|50|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil from produced oil/water emulsion. In 1923, Mr. Barnickel died at age of 45, of a perforated ulcer, and John S. Lehmann succeeded him as Tret-O-Lite president.

Meanwhile, Frederick Cottrell and James Speed were developing electrostatic methods for separating oil from water. In 1911, Allen C. Wright formed the Petroleum Rectifying Company of California (PETRECO), which built electric dehydrating plants—based on Contrell's and Speed's inventions—to serve California oilfields. By 1922, Petreco had 417 treaters in operation, but was running into competition from Barnickel and his chemical process. In 1930, as the worldwide Depression began, the two competing companies—PETRECO and Tret-O-Lite—merged to form '''Petrolite'''

===Wireline logging and perforating,  and geophysical exploration===
*Acutec
*Birdwell
*Canadian Perforator
*Dialog - a Wedge Division
*[[Dresser Atlas]]
*Du-Al Well Services
*Elgen Corporation
*Heartland Kingfisher
*Lane Wells
*NL McCullogh (formerly owned by NL Industries(fka National Lead Co.))
*Pacific Oil Tool, Ltd.
*PetroTech (former name of the wireline operations of Lane Wells in Venezuela)
*PGAC - Pan Geo Atlas Corporation
*PML (Petroleum Mud Logging Inc.)
*RIS
*SIE (Southeast Industrial Equipment Inc.)
*Sunburst Perforating Services
*Western Atlas - 1998 (previously formed by the merger of Dresser Atlas &amp; Western Geophysical)
*WSI (Well Surveys Inc.)
*Z&amp;S Geoscience, Ltd. founded by Jonathan Zangwill and Craig Shields

In 1932, Bill Lane and Walt Wells invented bullet gun perforating and formed the Lane-Wells Company in Vernon, California. They performed their first job on Union Oil's La Merced #17 well in Los Angeles. The company that would become Western Atlas (later Baker Atlas) grew quickly and added other wireline services, including the gamma ray log in 1939 and the neutron log in 1941, which were developed by Well Surveys Inc., an affiliated company. In 1948, a Lane-Wells crew performed the company's 100,000th job on La Merced #17, the site of the first perforating run.

In 1963, Baker Atlas predecessor Lane-Wells introduced the Neutron Lifetime Log service, providing the ability to detect oil through well casing, and initiating the line of Baker Atlas pulsed-neutron logging tools for cased hole logging and reservoir monitoring. It took another five years for competitors to introduce a comparable service. Beginning in 1948, Well Surveys Inc. physicist Arthur Youmans led the team of engineers and scientists to develop this technology. The highly complex instrument included a miniaturized particle generator and sensors to detect and analyze sub-atomic particles. Mr. Youmans went on to become Vice President of Research and Engineering for Dresser Atlas.

In 1968, Lane-Wells and the Pan Geo Atlas Corporation (PGAC) merged to form Dresser Atlas, a name chosen to “position” the company as more than a perforating provider and as part parent company of Dresser Industries. A competitor with Lane-Wells but possessing deeper expertise and an international reputation in open hole logging, PGAC was the perfect merger partner to form an integrated wireline services company. Since its inception, Lane-Wells had generated most of its income from perforating services, but log interpretation had narrowed down producing zones, resulting in fewer perforations and less revenue. During the oil slump of the 1999, Western Atlas was acquired by Baker Hughes Incorporated and the wireline division was created within the company rebranded as Baker Atlas. Western Geophysical was meanwhile allied with GecoPrakla of Schlumberger and later combined into a separate business entity called WesternGeco.

A succession of South Indian dynasties, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Western Gangas]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] and the [[Hoysalas]], ruled the present region of Bangalore until in 1537 CE, [[Kempe Gowda|Kempé Gowdā]]&amp;nbsp;– a feudal ruler under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]&amp;nbsp;– established a [[Bengaluru Pete|mud fort]] considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore. In 1638, the [[Maratha Empire|Marāthās]] conquered and ruled Bangalore for almost 50 years, after which the [[Mughals]] captured and sold the city to the [[Mysore Kingdom]] of the [[Wadiyar dynasty]]. It was captured by the [[British East India Company|British]] after victory in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the [[Maharaja of Mysore]]. The old city developed in the dominions of the [[Maharaja of Mysore]] and was made capital of the [[Princely State of Mysore]], which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the [[British Raj]].

In 1809, the British shifted their [[Bangalore Cantonment|cantonment]] to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of [[British India]]. Following [[independence of India|India's independence]] in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of [[Mysore State]], and remained capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore&amp;nbsp;– city and cantonment&amp;nbsp;– which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing [[Kannada]] name, ''Bengalūru'', was declared the [[official name]] of the city in 2006.

Bangalore is sometimes referred to as the "[[Silicon Valley of India]]" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading [[information technology]] (IT) exporter.&lt;ref name="cnn-Dec2012"&gt;{{cite news | url    = http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/06/tech/bangalore-india-internet-access| title  = How the 'Silicon Valley of India' is bridging the digital divide| last   = Canton| first  = Naomi| publisher  = CNN| accessdate = 6 December 2012| date   = 6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url    = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/business/worldbusiness/20bangalore.html | title  = Is the Next Silicon Valley Taking Root in Bangalore? | last   = RAI | first  = Saritha |work   = [[The New York Times]]  | accessdate = 20 March 2006 | date   = 20 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url    = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20201666 | title  = Can the 'American Dream' be reversed in India? | last   = Vaidyanathan| first  = Rajini| publisher  = [[BBC World News]]| accessdate = 5 November 2012 | date   = 5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian technological organisations [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]], [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]] and [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited|HAL]] are headquartered in the city.

==Etymology==
The name "Bangalore" represents an [[Anglicization|anglicised]] version of the [[Kannada language]] name, "Bengalūru" [[ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು]] {{IPA-kn|ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru||Bengaluru-Kannada-Pronunciation.ogg}}. It is the name of a village near Kodegehalli and was copied by Kempegowda to the city of Bangalore. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] stone inscription on a "''vīra gallu''{{-"}} ({{lang|kn|ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು}}) (literally, "[[hero stone]]", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in [[Begur, Bangalore|Begur]], "Bengalūrū" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890 [[Common Era|CE]]. It states that the place was part of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga Kingdom]] until 1004 and was known as "''Bengaval-uru''", the "City of Guards" in [[Halegannada]] (Old Kannada).&lt;ref name="OtherNames"&gt;{{cite news

An [[apocryphal]] story recounts that the 12th century [[Hoysala]] king [[Veera Ballala II]], while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengalūru".&lt;ref name="OtherNames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bendakaaluru"&gt;{{cite web

The region of modern-day Bangalore was part of several successive [[South India]]n kingdoms.

These kings belonged to two distinct dynasties: the earlier line of the ''Solar race'' which had a succession of seven kings of the Ratti or Reddi tribe, and the later line of the Ganga race. The [[Western Gangas]] ruled the region initially as a sovereign power (350–550), and later as feudatories of the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas of Badami]], followed by the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] until the tenth century.&lt;ref name="Aditi6"&gt;{{harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=6|Ref=Aditi2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Begur [[Nageshvara Temple, Begur|Nageshwara Temple]] was commissioned around 860, during the reign of the Western Ganga King Ereganga Nitimarga I and extended by his successor Nitimarga II.&lt;ref name="banghist4"&gt;{{harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=7|Ref=Aditi2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="niti"&gt;Sarma (1992), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1004, during the reign of [[Raja Raja Chola I]], the Cholas defeated the Western Gangas under the command of the crown prince [[Rajendra Chola I]], and captured Bangalore.&lt;ref name="banghist4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mysore: A Gazetteer Compiled for Government by B.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 13th century, Bangalore became a source of contention between two warring cousins, the Hoysala ruler [[Veera Ballala III]] of [[Halebidu]] and Ramanatha, who administered from the Hoysala held territory in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="banghist4" /&gt; Veera Ballala III had appointed a civic head at Hudi (now within Bangalore Municipal Corporation limits), thus promoting the village to the status of a town. After Veera Ballala III's death in 1343, the next empire to rule the region was the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], which itself saw the rise of four dynasties, the [[Sangama Dynasty|Sangamas]] (1336–1485), the [[Saluva Dynasty|Saluvas]] (1485–1491), the [[Tuluva Dynasty|Tuluvas]] (1491–1565), and the [[Aravidu dynasty|Aravidu]] (1565–1646).&lt;ref name="banghist6"&gt;{{harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=8|Ref=Aditi2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire, [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] of the [[Tuluva Dynasty]] raised the [[Shivanasamudra Falls|Shivasamudra Dam]] across the [[Arkavati]] river at [[Hesaraghatta]], whose reservoir is the present city's supply of regular piped water.&lt;ref name="Aditi9"&gt;{{harvnb|Aditi|2008|p=9|Ref=Aditi2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Bangalore was begun in 1537 by a [[vassal]] of the Vijayanagara Empire, [[Kempe Gowda I]], who aligned with the Vijayanagara empire to campaign against Gangaraja (whom he defeated and expelled to Kanchi), and who built [[Bengaluru Pete|a mud-brick fort]] for the people at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules made by Achuta Deva Raya, who feared the potential power of Kempe Gowda and did not allow a formidable stone fort. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his "gandubhūmi" or "Land of Heroes".&lt;ref name=gandubhoomi&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions—each called a "pete" ({{IPA-kn|peːteː}}). The town had two main streets—Chikkapeté Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapeté Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapeté Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda I's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore's boundary. During the Vijayanagara rule, many saints and poets referred to Bangalore as "Devarāyanagara" and "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City").&lt;ref name=bglrHist2&gt;{{Cite thesis

After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 in the [[Battle of Talikota]], Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. Kempe Gowda declared independence, then in 1638, a large [[Adil Shahi]] Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by his second in command [[Shahaji|Shāhji Bhōnslé]] defeated Kempe Gowda III,&lt;ref name=bglrHist2 /&gt; and Bangalore was given to Shāhji as a ''[[jagir]]'' (feudal estate). In 1687, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] general Kasim Khan, under orders from [[Aurangzeb]], defeated [[Ekoji I]], son of Shāhji, and sold Bangalore to [[Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar]] (1673–1704), the then ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] for three lakh rupees.&lt;ref name=ekoji&gt;{{Cite news

Bangalore was hit by a [[Bubonic plague|plague]] epidemic in 1898 that claimed nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordinate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was appointed and the city divided into four wards for better co-ordination.

Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and [[water tank]]s, the largest of which are Madivala tank, [[Hebbal]] lake, [[Ulsoor]] lake, Yediyur Lake and [[Sankey Tank]]. Groundwater occurs in [[silt]]y to [[sand]]y layers of the [[alluvial]] sediments. The [[Peninsular Gneiss]]ic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes [[granite]]s, [[gneiss]]es and [[migmatite]]s, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red [[laterite]] and red, fine [[loam]]y to [[clay]]ey soils.&lt;ref name="EIA" /&gt;

Vegetation in the city is primarily in the form of large [[deciduous]] [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] and minority [[coconut]] trees. Though Bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone II (a stable zone), it has experienced quakes of magnitude as high as 4.5.&lt;ref name="quake"&gt;{{cite web

Bangalore's rapid growth has created several problems relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature of growth in the city resulted in massive traffic [[gridlock]]s that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a [[flyover (overpass)|flyover]] system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{cite web

[[Kannada literature]] appears to have flourished in Bangalore even before Kempe Gowda laid the foundations of the city.

[[File:Bigbelly Trash and Recycling Stations.jpg|thumb|Bigbelly public waste and recycling components at DTE Headquarters in Detroit, MI]]
'''Bigbelly''' was originally a [[solar powered]], [[Trash compactor|rubbish-compacting]] bin, manufactured by U.S. company Bigbelly Solar for use in public spaces such as parks, beaches, amusement parks, universities, retail properties, grocery industry and food service operators. The bin was designed and originally manufactured in [[Needham, Massachusetts]] by Seahorse Power, a company set up in 2003 with the aim of reducing [[fossil fuel]] consumption. Due to the bin's commercial success, Seahorse Power changed its name to BigBelly Solar.

Although solar power is still an important feature, the company has since created self-powered stations for use where sun may not be available such as under a convenience store's dispenser canopy and AC powered stations for applications such as corporate cafeterias.

==The bin==
The bin has a capacity of 567 litres. Its compaction mechanism exerts 5.3[[Newton (unit)|kN]] of force, increasing the bin's effective capacity by five. The compaction mechanism is chain-driven, using no [[hydraulic fluid]]s. Maintenance consists of lubricating the front door lock annually. The mechanism runs on a standard 12 volt battery, which is kept charged by the solar panel. The battery reserve lasts for approximately three weeks. Wireless technology-enabled units report their status into the CLEAN (Collection, Logistics, Efficiency and Notification system) dashboard that gives waste management and administration insights for monitoring and route optimization. BigBelly Solar also provides companion recycling units that allow cities, parks and universities to collect single-stream or separated recyclable materials in public spaces.

The first machine was installed in [[Vail, Colorado]] in 2004. Other locations to since use the bin include [[Seattle, Washington]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]; [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Dallas, Texas]]; [[El Paso, Texas]]; [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Ventura, California]]; [[Oakland, California]]; [[San Diego, California]]; [[San Francisco, California]]; [[New York City]]; [[Aberystwyth]]; as well as [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, the Netherlands]]; [[Aberdeen, Scotland]]; [[London, England]]; [[Lower Mainland, Canada]]; [[Hamburg, Germany]]; [[Münster, Germany]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wn.de/Muenster/2012/09/Big-Belly-Stadt-Muenster-testet-solarbetriebene-Muelleimer-mit-Internetanschluss|title=Stadt Münster testet solarbetriebene Mülleimer mit Internetanschluss|last=|first=|date=|work=Westfälische Nachrichten|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uppsala, Sweden]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.vattenfall.se/press-och-media/nyheter/import-nyheter/smart-papperskorg-till-uppsala/ Smart papperskorg till Uppsala].

'''Boring''' is drilling a hole, tunnel, or well in the earth.[[Image:Boring Machine 1911 Illustration.jpg|thumb|A boring machine illustration from the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]].]]
[[Image:Boring machine.jpg|thumb|[[Mud log]] in process, a common way to study the lithology when drilling wells.]]
Boring is used for various applications in [[geology]], [[agriculture]], [[hydrology]], [[civil engineering]], and [[mineral exploration]]. Today, most earth drilling serves one of the following purposes:

* return samples of the [[soil]] and/or [[rock (geology)|rock]] through which the drill passes
* access rocks from which material can be extracted
* access rocks which can then be measured
* provide access to rock for purposes of providing engineering support

Unlike drilling in other materials where the aim is to create a hole for some purpose, often the case of drilling or coring is to get an understanding of the ground/lithology. This may be done for [[prospecting]] to identify and quantify an ore body for mining, or to determining the type of foundations needed for a building or raised structure, or for underground structures, including tunnels and deep basements where an understanding of the ground is vital to determining how to excavate and the support philosophy. Drilling is also used in vertical and inclined shaft construction.

==History==
Borehole drilling has a long history. [[Han Dynasty]] China (202 BC&amp;nbsp;– 220 AD) used deep borehole drilling for mining and other projects. Chinese borehole sites could reach as deep as 600&amp;nbsp;m (2000&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 194"&gt;* Loewe, Michael. (1968). ''Everyday Life in Early Imperial China during the Han Period 202 BC–AD 220''. London: B.T. Batsford Ltd.; New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods==
When drilling in stone, one must pay particular attention to the type of material.  There are three different classifications of drill bits used for drilling into stone: soft, medium, and hard.  Soft formation rock bits are used in unconsolidated sands, clays, and soft limestones, etc.  Medium formation bits are used in [[dolomites]], [[limestones]], and [[shale]], while hard formation bits are used in hard shale, [[mudstones]], [[granite]], [[limestones]] and other hard and/or abrasive formations.

Soft ground drilling can be undertaken using a [[rotary auger]] or [[wash boring]] techniques, while rock drilling often use methods such as [[NMLC]] which allow for recovery of a core of material which can be examined to determine the strength, degree of weathering, understanding of any how intact the rock is ([[RQD]]) and identify any [[Discontinuity (geotechnical engineering)|discontinuities]] or other planes of weakness.

Testing of the material in [[borehole]]s is also possible. In soft ground the [[standard penetration test]] can be used to determine the strength of the material. In rock in-situ stress testing using [[hydrofracturing]] or [[overcoring]], [[Acoustic Televiewer]] can be used to map discontinuities to determine their orientation. It is also possible once a borehole is complete to measure the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]. Samples of water and material are also taken for examination and lab testing.

== Superdeep Borehole ==
In 1961 the United States began [[Project Mohole]], an ambitious attempt to drill through the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] into the [[Mohorovicic discontinuity|Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The project was discontinued due to high cost. 

The [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]] was a similar project of the [[USSR]] in the 1970s and early 1980s the [[USSR]] attempted to drill a hole through the [[crust (geology)|crust]], to sample the [[Mohorovicic Discontinuity]].  The deepest hole ever drilled failed not because of lack of money or time, but because of [[Petrophysics|rock physics]] at depth.  At approximately 12,000 metres depth, rock begins to act more like a [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] solid than a rigid solid.  Rock temperatures of several hundred degrees [[Celsius]], required that the [[drilling fluid]] be [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] before being sent to the cutting face of the drill.  As the drill bits burnt out and were removed for replacement, the hole simply flowed closed, and the rock had to be re-drilled.  The hole was scrapped.

Further attempts are planned by [[United States|American]] consortia and further [[Russia]]n attempts in [[Finland]].

== Ice boring ==

[[Ice cores]] are drilled by hollow bits, in much the same way that sediment cores are drilled. When all that is needed is the hole, hot water drill technology may be used to melt holes in ice or snow for both Arctic and Antarctic research purposes. Equipment for such a method is also lightweight when drilling deep holes, compared to traditional drilling equipment. Hot water drilling has been used successfully in the [[IceCube Neutrino Detector]] and [[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array]] projects to drill as deep as 2,450 meters.

'''CloudBolt''' is a hybrid cloud management platform developed by CloudBolt Software for deploying and managing [[Virtual machine|virtual machines]] (VMs), applications, and other IT resources, both in [[Cloud computing|public clouds]] (e.g., [[Amazon Web Services|AWS]], [[Microsoft Azure|MS Azure]], [[Google Cloud Platform|GCP]]) and in private data centers (e.g., [[VMware]], [[OpenStack]]).

== History ==
The platform was developed by Auggy da Rocha and Bernard Sanders. Auggy began work on a prototype of the platform in 2010, calling it SmartCloud 1.0. Together they created a generalized solution, which was released in August of 2011 as SmartCloud 2.0. The early version focused on simple installs and upgrades of [[Virtual machine|virtual machines]], and building an extensible product that customers could use as a platform for integrating with other technologies.

In 2012, they renamed their company to CloudBolt Software (to avoid a name conflict with an IBM offering), and released version CloudBolt Command and Control 3.0. In 2014, the product name "CloudBolt Command and Control (C2)" was simplified to "CloudBolt".

Product Timeline:

* 2011 - 2.0 released, with support only for [[VMware]] &amp; HP Server Automation (formerly [[Opsware]])
* 2012 - 3.0 released, rebranded as CloudBolt with support for [[Amazon Web Services|AWS]] &amp; [[OpenStack]] added
* 2013 - 4.0 released, support for [[Microsoft Azure]], [[Google Cloud Platform]], [[Infoblox]], vCO (now vRO), and HP Operations Orchestration, Cobbler
* 2014 - 4.5 released, including integration with Puppet &amp; Chef, [[ServiceNow]]
* 2015 - 5.0 released with support for [[Kubernetes]] container orchestrator and Razor bare metal provisioning
* 2016 - 6.0 released, with support for Azure ARM, [[Ansible (software)|Ansible]], Oracle Public Cloud
* 2017 - 7.0 released, with 18 total public clouds and private virtualization systems supported, 4 configuration managers, and 2 external orchestrators
* 2018 - 8.0 released, with everything-as-a-service (XaaS), enhanced containerization and Kubernetes support

The company received [[Series A round|Series A funding]] from [[Insight Venture Partners]] in July 2018

'''Contextual documentation''' is an information block approach to writing in-situ documentation. It becomes particularly useful when dealing with in-situ documentation delivered to the software GUI, to devise a matrix of required help to users in a particular situation or context. 
This concept is based on  [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture|DITA]], where small topics are written when needed asking the right questions:
* What is this and/or what does it do?
* How do I use it?
* Do I have an example?
* Where am I in terms of a workflow?
* What next?
* What pitfalls to avoid?
This is an editorial matrix, a content guideline as sorts. By no means are all items to be written exhaustively as if they were a form to be filled

The '''control unit''' (CU) is a component of a computer's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic out.logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Patterson | first1 = David | last2 = Hennessy | first2 = John | title = Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, 4th ed., revised | year = 2011 | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | isbn = 978-0-12-374750-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It directs the operation of the other units by providing timing and control signals.
Most computer resources are managed by the CU. It directs the flow of data between the CPU and the other devices. [[John von Neumann]] included the control unit as part of the [[von Neumann architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=von Neumann |first1=John |title=First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC |year=1945 |publisher=Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania |url=http://qss.stanford.edu/~godfrey/vonNeumann/vnedvac.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314123032/http://qss.stanford.edu/~godfrey/vonNeumann/vnedvac.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern computer designs, the control unit is typically an internal part of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]&lt;!-- or other device that directs its operation--&gt; with its overall role and operation unchanged since its introduction.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Functions of the control unit ==
The Control unit (CU) is digital circuitry contained within the processor that coordinates the sequence of data movements into, out of, and between a processor's many sub-units. The result of these routed data movements through various digital circuits (sub-units) within the processor produces the manipulated data expected by a software instruction (loaded earlier, likely from memory). It controls (conducts) data flow inside the processor and additionally provides several external control signals to the rest of the computer to further direct data and instructions to/from processor external destinations (i.e. memory).{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Examples of devices that require a CU are CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs). The CU receives external instructions or commands which it converts into a sequence of control signals that the CU applies to the data path to implement a sequence of [[register-transfer level]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Englander|first=Irv|title=The Architecture of Computer Hardware, Systems Software, &amp; Networking, 4th Ed.|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, the Control Unit (CU) is generally a sizable collection of complex digital circuitry interconnecting and directing the many execution units (i.e. ALU, data buffers, registers) contained within a CPU. The CU is normally the first CPU unit to accept from an externally stored computer program, a single instruction (based on the CPU's [[instruction set]]). The CU then decodes this individual instruction into several sequential steps (fetching addresses/data from registers/ memory, managing execution [i.e. data sent to the ALU or I/O], and storing the resulting data back into registers/memory) that controls and coordinates the CPU's inner works to properly manipulate the data. The design of these sequential steps are based on the needs of each instruction and can range in number of steps, the order of execution, and which units are enabled.

Thus by only using a program of set instructions in memory, the CU will configure all the CPU's data flows as needed to manipulate the data correctly between instructions. This results in a computer that could run a complete program and require no human intervention to make hardware changes between instructions (as had to be done when using only [[Plugboard#Unit record equipment|punch cards]] for computations before stored programmed computers with CUs were invented). These detailed steps from the CU dictate which of the CPU's interconnecting hardware control signals to enable/disable or which CPU units are selected/de-selected and the unit's proper order of execution as required by the instruction's operation to produce the desired manipulated data. Additionally, the CU's orderly hardware coordination properly sequences these control signals then configures the many hardware units comprising the CPU, directing how data should also be moved, changed, and stored outside the CPU (i.e. memory) according to the instruction's objective.

Depending on the type of instruction entering the CU, the order and number of sequential steps produced by the CU could vary the selection and configuration of which parts of the CPU's hardware are utilized to achieve the instruction's objective (mainly moving, storing, and modifying data within the CPU). This one feature, that efficiently uses just software instructions to control/select/configure a computer's CPU hardware (via the CU) and eventually manipulates a program's data, is a significant reason most modern computers are flexible and universal when running various programs. As compared to some 1930s or 1940s computers without a proper CU, they often required rewiring their hardware when changing programs. This CU instruction decode process is then repeated when the Program Counter is incremented to the next stored program address and the new instruction enters the CU from that address, and so on till the programs end.

Other more advanced forms of  Control Units manage the translation of instructions (but not the data containing portion) into several micro-instructions and the CU manages the scheduling of the micro-instructions between the selected execution units to which the data is then channeled and changed according to the execution unit's  function (i.e., ALU contains several functions). On some processors, the Control Unit may be further broken down into additional units, such as an [[instruction unit]] or scheduling unit to handle scheduling, or a retirement unit to deal with results coming from the [[instruction pipeline]]. Again, the Control Unit orchestrates the main functions of the CPU: carrying out stored instructions in the software program then directing the flow of data throughout the computer based upon these instructions (roughly likened to how traffic lights will systematically control the flow of cars [containing data] to different locations within the traffic grid [CPU] until it parks at the desired parking spot [memory address/register].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} The car occupants [data] then go into the building [execution unit] and comes back changed in some way then get back into the car and returns to another location via the controlled traffic grid).

== Hardwired control unit ==&lt;!-- Front end processor redirects here --&gt;
'''Hardwired control units''' are implemented through use of [[combinational logic]] units, featuring a finite number of gates that can generate specific results based on the instructions that were used to invoke those responses. Hardwired control units are generally faster than microprogrammed designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~reckert/hardwire3new.html|title=MICRO-PROGRAMMED VERSUS HARDWIRED CONTROL UNITS;|website=www.cs.binghamton.edu|access-date=2017-02-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430162916/http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~reckert/hardwire3new.html|archivedate=2017-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their design uses a fixed architecture&amp;mdash;it requires changes in the wiring if the [[instruction set]] is modified or changed.
This architecture is preferred in [[Reduced instruction set computing|reduced instruction 
set computer]]s (RISC) as they use a simpler instruction set.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

A controller that uses this approach can operate at high speed; however, it has little flexibility, and the complexity of the instruction set it can implement is limited.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The hardwired approach has become less popular as computers have evolved. Previously, control units for CPUs used ad-hoc logic, and they were difficult to design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Williams |first=R. D. |last2=Klenke |first2=R. H. |last3=Aylor |first3=J.

== Microprogram control unit ==
{{main article|Microcode}}

The idea of microprogramming was introduced by [[Maurice Wilkes]] in 1951 as an intermediate level to execute computer program instructions. Microprograms were organized as a sequence of ''microinstructions'' and stored in special control memory. The algorithm for the microprogram control unit,unlike the hardwired control unit, is usually specified by [[flowchart]] description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Barkalov | first1 = Alexander | title = Logic synthesis for FSM based control units / Alexander Barkalov and Larysa Titarenko | year = 2009 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | isbn = 978-3-642-04308-6 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of the microprogram control unit is the simplicity of its structure. Outputs of the controller are organized in microinstructions and  they can be easily replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Wiśniewski | first1 = Remigiusz | title = Synthesis of compositional microprogram control units for programmable devices   | year = 2009 | publisher = University of Zielona Góra | location = Zielona Góra | isbn = 978-83-7481-293-1 | pages = 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dragharrrow.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A 4-foot drag harrow]]
[[File:12 foot spring-tooth drag harrow.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A larger, 12 foot drag harrow simply uses three four foot sections that are connected]]
A '''drag harrow''', a type of '''[[spring-tooth harrow]]''', is a largely outdated type of [[soil]] [[Tillage|cultivation]] [[Tool|implement]] that is used to smooth the ground as well as loosen it after it has been [[plow]]ed and [[cultipacker|packed]].  It uses many flexible [[iron]] teeth usually arranged into three rows.  It has no [[hydraulic]] functionality and has to be raised/adjusted with one or multiple manual levers.  It is a largely outdated piece of [[farm equipment]], having been replaced by more modern [[disc harrow]]s and hydraulically operated [[field cultivator]]s.

==Uses==

A drag harrow is used to loosen and even out soil after it has been [[plow]]ed and packed. It pulls up large rocks which may then be picked up manually and put in the tractor's [[stone box]] to remove from the field. The drag harrow also kills some weeds that may be present, but it is not very efficient in doing so due to its highly flexible teeth, hence it is not one of its primary functions.

==In modern times==
[[File:Drag harrow.jpg|thumb|Three separate implements connected using a home made hitch]]
The drag harrow is not often used in modern farming as other harrows have proven to be more suitable, such as the [[disc harrow]]. Another reason they are not often used is because they cannot be controlled hydraulically, meaning that the [[Operator (profession)|operator]] is required to dismount from the [[tractor]] to adjust it or unclog it.  However it is used as a drag behind several other implements such as a rod weeder. Due to their low cost and simplicity, drag harrows are still used widely by small farmers.&lt;ref name="dragharrow.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragharrow.com/|title=Drag Harrow|accessdate=15 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330194242/http://www.dragharrow.com/|archive-date=2012-03-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:English Electric-BAC Lightning.jpg|thumb|right|''English Electric/BAC Lightning'']]
The '''''English Electric/BAC Lightning''''' ({{ISBN|978-0850455625}}) is an [[aviation]] book by [[British people|British]] [[military historian]] and [[author]] [[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny]] about the [[English Electric Lightning]]. It was published by [[Osprey Publishing]] as part of their [[Aerial warfare|Air Combat]] series. It was a best seller in [[Grimsby]],&lt;ref name=ET22-01-1985 &gt;Information Desk - Information Supplied by Albert Gait Ltd - [[Grimsby Telegraph|Evening Telegraph]] - Tuesday, January 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; the home town of the Lightning.&lt;ref name=ET12-11-1984 &gt;''Struck by Lightning'' - by Pat Otter - [[Grimsby Telegraph|Evening Telegraph]] - Monday, November 12, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The author, known for his books on [[airfields]] and [[aircraft]],&lt;ref name=DM17-11-1984 &gt;''Lightning blamed for coast boom'' - Book Reviews - by Steve Anderson - [[The Daily Mail]] - Monday, December 17, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; spent nine months researching the Lightnings&lt;ref name= "ET12-11-1984"/&gt; with the pilots of [[No. 5 Squadron RAF|5]] and [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|11]] Squadrons and Binbrook's own Lightning Training Flight.&lt;ref name= "ET12-11-1984"/&gt; To gather information for the book, the author talked to men like, [[RAF officer ranks|Sqdn Ldr]] Dave Carden (with 3,000 plus hours, the most experienced Lightning pilot in the world) and fellow pilots and ground staff.&lt;ref name= "ET12-11-1984"/&gt;

Included in the book are several anecdotes, one being a pilot's super sonic flight causing "anger and dismay". Thirty minutes after landing at RAF Binbrook,&lt;ref name= "DM17-11-1984"/&gt; the hapless airman took a telephone call... as Flt Lt Normant Want recalls in the book,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was from the [[Mayor]] of [[Bridlington]] who was complaining about an aircraft that had dropped a supersonic boom on Bridlington and the surrounding area. The boom had broken lots of windows. But the thing that really annoyed him was that the sonic boom sounded just like the signal to launch the lifeboat - which was now in the middle of the North Sea. The Mayor was not too impressed with all this. I did the hot-foot dance routine that most young lads go through when the've been nicked. It was about half a day later that the [[Ground-controlled interception|Ground Controlled Interception]] controller let me off the hook. He 'phoned to tell me that he had been responsible and that it wasn't the Mayor of Bridlington after all!&lt;ref name= "DM17-11-1984"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book itself gives an insight into the workings of [[RAF Binbrook]], its Lightnings, and the men that fly and maintain them.&lt;ref name= "ET12-11-1984"/&gt; Sqdn Ldr Dave Carden takes the reader on a typically "hair-raising mission",&lt;ref name= "ET12-11-1984"/&gt; while another section is devoted to a pilot's experiences when his aircraft caught fire and crashed into the sea off [[Flamborough Head]] in 1981.&lt;ref name= "ET12-11-1984"/&gt; It also deals with the Quick Reaction Alert shed, where two fully armed Lightnings and their pilots were on constant standby to intercept Russian aircraft which used to sometimes fly to within 100 miles of [[Spurn Point]].&lt;ref name= "ET12-11-1984"/&gt;

The '''Eurasian Land Bridge''' ({{Lang-ru|Евразийский сухопутный мост}}, ''Yevraziyskiy sukhoputniy most''), sometimes called the '''New [[Silk Road]]''' (Новый шёлковый путь, ''Noviy shyolkoviy put&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), or [[Belt and Road Initiative]] is the [[rail transport]] route for moving freight and passengers overland between Pacific seaports in the [[Russian Far East]] and [[China]] and seaports in Europe. The route, a [[transcontinental railroad]] and [[Land bridge (rail)|rail land bridge]], currently comprises the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which runs through Russia and is sometimes called the [[Northern East West Freight Corridor|Northern East-West Corridor]], and the [[New Eurasian Land Bridge]] or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge, running through China and [[Kazakhstan]]. As of November 2007, about 1% of the $600 billion in goods shipped from Asia to Europe each year were delivered by inland transport routes.&lt;ref&gt;Berk.&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific seaports such as [[Vladivostok]]. From the 1960s until the early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused the use of the railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former [[Soviet Union]] use a wider [[rail gauge]] than most of the rest of Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.{{why|date=September 2014}}

China's rail system had long linked to the Trans-Siberian via [[northeastern China]] and [[Mongolia]]. In 1990 China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via [[Kazakhstan]]. China calls its uninterrupted rail link between the port city of [[Lianyungang]] and Kazakhstan the ''New Eurasian Land Bridge'' or ''Second Eurasian Continental Bridge''. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including [[Iran]]. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the [[Bosphorus]] under the [[Marmaray]] project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and [[South Asia]].

Proposed expansion of the Eurasian Land Bridge includes construction of a railway across Kazakhstan that is the same gauge as Chinese railways, rail links to India, [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]] and elsewhere in [[Southeast Asia]], construction of a rail tunnel and highway bridge [[Bering Strait crossing|across the Bering Strait]] to connect the Trans-Siberian to the North American rail system, and construction of a [[Japan–Korea Undersea Tunnel|rail tunnel]] between South Korea and Japan. The [[United Nations]] has proposed further expansion of the Eurasian Land Bridge, including the [[Trans-Asian Railway]] project.

==History==
[[File:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumb|right|Silk Road trading routes during the 1st century [[AD]]]]
Commercial traffic between Europe and Asia took place along the [[Silk Road]] from at least the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]]. The Silk Road was not a specific thoroughfare, but a general route used by traders to travel, much of it by land, between the two continents along the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s through Central Asia. The {{convert|5000|mi|km|-2|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} route was used to exchange goods, ideas and people primarily between China and India and the Mediterranean and helped create a single-world system of trade between the civilisations of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="Christian; Ōtsuka, p. 42"&gt;Christian; Ōtsuka, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exports from Asia transported along the Silk Road included fabrics, carpets, furs, weapons, utensils, metals, farm produce, livestock and slaves. Civilisations active in trading during the road's history included [[Scythia]], [[Ancient Greece|Ancient]] and [[Byzantine Greece]], the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], [[Rouran]], [[Sogdiana]], [[Göktürks]], [[Xiongnu]], [[Yuezhi]] and the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;Christian.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 5th century AD, new land routes between Asia and Europe developed further to the north, in the [[Rus' (region)|Rus']]. Many of these routes passed through [[Yugra]] and extended to the [[Baltic region]]. The [[Khazars]], [[Volga Bulgaria]], and the [[Rus' Khaganate]] were active in trading along the northern trade routes.&lt;ref name="Christian"/&gt;

Traffic along the southern Silk Road routes greatly diminished with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the 15th century and development of the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the 16th century. By the 18th century, European influence on trade and new national boundaries severely restricted the movement of traders along all land routes between Europe and China, and overland trade between East Asia and Europe virtually disappeared.&lt;ref name="Christian; Ōtsuka, p. 42"/&gt;

==Trans-Siberian Railway==
{{Main|Trans-Siberian Railway}}
The Trans-Siberian Railway and its various associated branches and supporting lines, completed in 1916, established the first rail connection between Europe and Asia, from Moscow to Vladivostok. The line, at {{convert|9200|km|mi|-1}}, is the longest rail line in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigue; Wehrfritz.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map Trans-Siberian railway.png|thumb|left|Map of the Trans-Siberian (red) and [[Baikal–Amur Mainline]] (green) Railways]]
The Trans-Siberian connects the Russian Pacific ports of  [[Vladivostok]] and [[Nakhodka]] with Moscow. Rail links at Moscow allow passengers and freight to connect to train lines running further west into Europe. By making further transfers, passengers and freight can eventually reach Western European seaports.&lt;ref&gt;Ōtsuka, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trans-Siberian also connects with [[North Korea]] (e.g. via [[Dandong]] in Northeastern China, or directly at [[Khasan (urban-type settlement)|Khasan]] south of Vladivostok).&lt;ref&gt;Hisako Tsuji, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=89 Trans-Korean Main Line] (At the official [[Russian Railways]] site)&lt;/ref&gt;

A fully electrified and double-tracked line, the Trans-Siberian Railway line is capable of transporting around 100 million tons of freight annually. The line can handle up to 200,000 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] of containerized international transit freight per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=87 Transsiberian Railway] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127000000/http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=87 |date=27 November 2011 }} (At the [[Russian Railways]] official site)&lt;/ref&gt;

A more northerly east-west route across Siberia, parallel to the Trans-Siberian line and known as the [[Baikal–Amur Mainline]] was mostly completed in 1989. It terminates at the Pacific ports of [[Vanino, Khabarovsk Krai|Vanino]] and [[Sovetskaya Gavan]]. Although this line is comparatively little used (the management mentions 6 million tons of freight per year, not indicating the year), the management expects the line to be fully used in the foreseeable future for oil and copper ore export, and has  plans to double-track it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=88 Baikal – Amur Main Line] (At the [[Russian Railways]] official site)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Trans-Siberian has always been used by the [[Russian Empire|Czarist]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and modern Russian government to project political power into their territories in Asia, in the 1960s it was opened by the USSR as an international trade route connecting the Western Pacific with Europe. Freight shipments on the Trans-Siberian, however, experienced increasing problems over time with dilapidated rail infrastructures, theft, damaged freight, late trains, inflated freight fees, uncertain scheduling for return of containers and geopolitical tension. As a result, use of the railway for international trade declined to almost zero by the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigue, Ōtsuka, p. 49; Wehrfritz.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hofstra University]], as of 2001 there was renewed interest in using the Trans-Siberian as a route across Asia to Europe. Also, the Trans-Siberian links directly to railways which ultimately connect, via Finland and Sweden, to the year-round ice-free port of [[Narvik]] in Norway.  At Narvik, freight can be transshipped to ships to cross the Atlantic to North America. Rail links from Russia also connect to [[Rotterdam]], but may encounter greater congestion along this route with resulting delays. The trade route between the east coast of North America and eastern Russia using the Trans-Siberian is often called the [[Northern East West Freight Corridor]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigue.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to attract use of the Trans-Siberian to transport goods from Japan, China, and Korea to Europe, in the mid-1990s Russia lowered tariffs on freight using the railway. As a result, freight volume over the rail line doubled in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Wehrfritz.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February and March 2011, Japan's [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] sponsored a test of the route by shipping roof tiles to Europe via the Trans-Siberian. The tiles were transported by ship from [[Hamada, Shimane]] to Vladivostok, then by the railway to Moscow. The transit time was expected to be 30 days, in comparison with the 50 days on average it takes to ship cargo by ship from Hamada to ports in western Russia. If successful, the ministry would use the results of the test to encourage other Japanese companies to utilize the Trans-Siberian over the sea route.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20110301a8.html Land, sea routes to Russia tested]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 1 March 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a direct container rail service began carrying car parts {{convert|11,000|km}} from [[Leipzig]], Germany, to inland [[Shenyang]], China, through [[Siberia]] in 23 days, every day.&lt;ref name="siberia"&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/db-schenker-to-launch-daily-freight-train-to-china.html DB Schenker to launch daily freight train to China] ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'', 30 September 2011.

In 2013  a direct container, pallet, and general cargo rail service began, {{convert|10,000|km}} from [[Łódź]], Poland, to inland [[Chengdu]], China, through Siberia in 14 days, 3 days each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,126565,14012866,Pociag_Lodz___Chiny__trzy_razy_w_tygodniu.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613122344/http://wyborcza.pl/1,126565,14012866,Pociag_Lodz___Chiny__trzy_razy_w_tygodniu.html |archivedate=13 June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Russian statistics, the amount of international container shipments transiting annually through Russia over the Trans-Siberian has grown by a factor of 7 between 2009 and 2014, reaching 131,000 TEU (55,000 physical containers) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gudok.ru/news/freighttrans/?ID=1314529 Транзитные контейнерные перевозки по Транссибу в сообщении с КНР растут опережающими темпами.

Belarusian Railways reported similar statistics: in 2014, the volume of direct container traffic from China to Western Europe crossing Belarus amounted to 40,600 TEU, on 25 direct container train routes.

===Direct connections between Russia and China===
[[File:ManzhouliTracks.jpg|thumb|[[Manzhouli]], China's oldest and busiest rail gate to Russia]]
The original Moscow–Vladivostok route, completed in 1904, cut across China's [[Northeast China|northeastern provinces]], or [[Manchuria]]; the section of the railway located within China was known as the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]. While the more northerly Trans-Siberian route, located entirely on Russian soil, was completed in 1916, the former Chinese Eastern Railway route continues as an important connector between the two countries' railway networks.&lt;ref name=cer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1d5nd0j7/ |title=Guide to the Photograph Album of the Chinese Eastern Railway |publisher=Oac.cdlib.org |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The western border point ([[Zabaykalsk]]/[[Manzhouli]]) and the line connecting it to the Trans-Siberian main line, are now being upgraded, with the goal of enabling the railway by 2010 to pass 30 freight trains in each direction across the border, each one up to 71 cars long. The cross-border freight volume at this rail crossing is expected to reach 25.5 million tons by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zabzd.rzd.ru/isvp/public/zabzd?STRUCTURE_ID=98  Забайкальская железная дорога  | Инвестиционный проект "Южный ход"  | Общие сведения] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009185115/http://zabzd.rzd.ru/isvp/public/zabzd?STRUCTURE_ID=98 |date=9 October 2011 }} (Transbaikal Railway: The Southern Branch investment project: General information) (Not dated, but appear to be written ca. 2005) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides  cargo (principally, Russian oil exported to China), this crossing sees a direct weekly passenger train, Moscow–Beijing, as well as some local passenger trains.&lt;ref name=zabGauge&gt;[http://zabzd.rzd.ru/isvp/public/zabzd?STRUCTURE_ID=93&amp;layer_id=4069&amp;refererLayerId=3307&amp;id=102261 Реконструкция пункта перестановки вагонов: В круглосуточном  режиме на станции Забайкальск Забайкальской железной дороги ведется реконструкция пункта перестановки пассажирских вагонов] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301104622/http://zabzd.rzd.ru/isvp/public/zabzd?STRUCTURE_ID=93&amp;layer_id=4069&amp;refererLayerId=3307&amp;id=102261 |date=1 March 2012 }} ("Reconstruction of the bogie exchange facility: workers at Zabaykalsk Station of the Transbaikalian Railway are working round the clock, renovating the passenger railcar bogie exchange facility").

The eastern border point of the former Chinese Eastern Railway, at [[Suifenhe]]/[[Pogranichny, Primorsky Krai|Grodekovo]], sees significant use as well, with over 8 million tons of freight crossing the border there in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vladivostoktimes.ru/show.php?id=18199&amp;p= Primorye Export to China Increased: Mainly timber and fertilizers are exported] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716200503/http://vladivostoktimes.ru/show.php?id=18199&amp;p= |date=16 July 2011 }} (''Vladivostok Times'', 5 December 2007); the article reported over 8 million tons over the first 11 months of 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and regular cross-border passenger service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poezda.net poezda.net], &lt;!-- Unusable site: Russian train schedules site.

In November 2008, the transport ministries of Russia and the China signed an agreement about creating one more link between the railway systems of the two countries. It will involve a railway bridge between across the [[Amur River|Amur (Heilong) River]], connecting [[Tongjiang, Heilongjiang|Tongjiang]] in China's [[Heilongjiang]] province with [[Nizhneleninskoye]] in Russia's [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://russian.china.org.cn/china/txt/2008-11/27/content_16842776.htm "Строительство первого железнодорожного моста соединяющего Китай и Россию начнется в 2009 году"] (Construction of the first railway bridge connecting Russia and China will start in 2009) China.org.cn, 27 November 2008. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200706/19/eng20070619_385591.html (This is somewhat obsolete by now])&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 November 2010, the project director, Wang Jin, told [[Xinhua News Agency]] that construction on the bridge would begin in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xinhua News Agency]], "[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2010-11/07/content_21289505.htm Sino-Russian cross-border railway bridge to be built]", ''[[China Internet Information Center]]'', 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia to China via Mongolia===
The [[Trans-Mongolian Railway|Trans-Mongolian line]], connecting [[Ulan-Ude]] on the Trans-Siberian with China's [[Erenhot]] via the Mongolian capital [[Ulaanbaatar]], both serves as a crucial link to the outside world for landlocked Mongolia, and the shortest connection between the Trans-Siberian Railway and Beijing. This line's capacity, however, is limited by its being single-track.&lt;ref&gt;''Economist Intelligence Unit''; Hisako Tsuji, [http://www.erina.or.jp/en/Research/dp/pdf/0409e.pdf A competitive environment for linking the TSR &amp; TKR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722121125/http://www.erina.or.jp/en/Research/dp/pdf/0409e.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }}.

===Kazakhstan to China===
[[File:Western-most end of Northern Xinjiang Railway.jpg|thumb|right|Terminus of the Lanxin railway at [[Alataw Pass]] where the Chinese rail system connects with that of Kazakhstan at Dostyk.]]
While the USSR had long been connected with China via the rail links in Northeastern China and [[Mongolia]], since the 1950s plans existed to connect the two countries' rail networks at the [[Kazakhstan]]/[[Xinjiang]] border. The Soviets completed their line from Aktogay (a station on the [[Turksib]] in eastern Kazakhstan) to their border station Druzhba (now [[Dostyk]]), but the construction on the Chinese side stopped because of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s. In 1985 construction commenced on the [[Northern Xinjiang Railway]] to link the Chinese and Russian rail networks via Kazakhstan. The section between [[Ürümqi]] and [[Alashankou Railway Station|Alashankou]] was completed on 16 September 1990, linking the railway lines of the two countries at Dostyk. In July 1991 the first [[goods train]] traveled along the line from China to Kazakhstan's then-capital of [[Almaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Ōtsuka, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2009, a second rail link from China was built to the Kazakhstan border at [[Khorgos]].  The [[Jinghe–Yining–Khorgos Railway]] forks off of the Northern Xinjiang Railway at Jinghe and approaches Kazakhstan from the [[Ili River]] Valley.  A rail link on Kazakh side will extend the line to [[Sary-Ozek, Almaty Region|Saryozek]] by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.xinhuanet.com/chinanews/2010-07/06/content_20258480.htm "精伊霍铁路打破交通瓶颈 助推新疆伊犁经济发展"] 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The rail link through the Korgas Pass was completed in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xinhua News Agency]], "China Opens Second Railway To Kazakhstan", 22 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Kazakhstan was once a member of the USSR, its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, as well as the other Central Asian republics of [[Turkmenistan]], Uzbekistan, [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ōtsuka, pp. 42–43, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kazakhstan, four major north-south railways connect with the Russian rail system.  Two connect with the Trans-Siberian Railway (the [[Turksib]] and the [[Akmola Oblast|Shu]]–[[Astana]]–[[Petropavl]] [[meridional line]]) while the other two (the [[Trans-Aral Railway]], and the connection via [[Atyrau]] and [[Astrakhan Oblast]]) go directly to European Russia. These links to the Russian rail system are sometimes called the Eurasian Railway.&lt;ref&gt;Ōtsuka, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan plays an important role in the "New Silk Road" initiative, known as "One Belt, One Road" linking China and Europe through Central Asia and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China's Triple Wins: The New Silk Roads|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/helenwang/2016/01/15/chinas-triple-wins-the-new-silk-roads/#411f44e1520b|website=www.forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new direction of the Silk Road was launched in January 2016 and included the Ukraine – Georgia – Azerbaijan – Kazakhstan – China route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silk Road Renewed With Launch of New Commercial Transit Route|url=http://astanatimes.com/2016/01/silk-road-renewed-with-launch-of-new-commercial-transit-route/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan's infrastructure development program [[Nurly Zhol]] was developed in line with the New Silk Road Initiative. President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev even noted that Nurly zhol was a part of the New Silk Road Economic Belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nazarbayev: Nurly zhol is a part of New Silk Road Economic Belt|url=http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2819255|website=inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Through service between China and Western Europe===
{{See also|Trans-Eurasia Logistics}}
There are 3 main routes for container services from China to Europe: Eastern route from Vostochny Port (Russia), northern route from west China via Manzhouli/Zabaikalsk border stations and southern route from east China via Dostyk border station, through which totally 25k TEU has been transported on rail by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Uysal, Onur. [http://railturkey.org/2014/10/09/china-europe-railway-routes/ "Iron Silk Road from China to Europe via Russia in 15 Days"], ''Rail Turkey'', 9 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2008 China and Germany inaugurated a long-distance freight train service between Beijing and [[Hamburg]]. Travelling a total of {{convert|10000|km|mi|-1}}, the train uses the China Railways and the [[Trans-Mongolian Railway|Trans-Mongolian line]] to travel from [[Xiangtan]] (in [[Hunan]] Province) to [[Ulaanbaatar]], where it then continues north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching the end of the Trans-Siberian at Moscow the train continues to Germany via rail links in [[Belarus]] and Poland. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average it would take for the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the [[Fujitsu]] company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigue; International Railway Journal; Underhill; Batbayar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonas M.

Page 31, and the map on p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hartmut Mehdorn]], chairman of [[Deutsche Bahn]] (DB), stated in March 2008 that regularly scheduled, weekly China-Germany freight services should be in operation by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;International Railway Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2009, however, DB postponed the service indefinitely because of the [[Late-2000s recession|global economic crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Batbayar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another test run, from [[Chongqing]] to [[Duisburg]] via [[Alashankou]] crossing, [[Kazakhstan]], Russia, [[Belarus]], and Poland took place in March–April 2011, covering {{convert|10300|km|0|abbr=on}} in 16 days. It was again said by DB that if there is enough demand, the service can be made regular already in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriemagazin.net/home/artikel/Grossprojekt/Deutsche_Bahn_plant_regelmaessigen_Gueterverkehr_nach_China/aid/6278?analytics_from=thema_single Deutsche Bahn plant regelmäßigen Güterverkehr nach China], 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= A.

The transportation authorities in another industrial center of central China, [[Wuhan]], plan to organize regular runs of direct freight train between Wuhan and European destinations (Czech Republic, Poland, Germany) starting in April 2014. Plans call for the service starting from 1–2 trains per month in April–June 2014, gradually increasing the frequency to 1–2 trains per week in 2015. A new customs facility is under construction in Wuhan's Wujiashan (吴家山) industrial area; after its planned opening in October 2015,  exports from the Wuhan region will be able to clear Chinese customs there, instead of [[Alashankou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.huochepiao.com/2014-4/20144814571122.htm 湖北：汉新欧铁路月底重新鸣笛 将延伸至西欧], (Hubei: the Hankou-Xinjiang-Europe rail link will resume operations at the end of the month. Service extending into Western Europe), 8 April 2014 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, the freight rail service between a number of container terminals in China and their counterparts in Europe has become fairly regular. Between some city pairs, there is one train per week.&lt;ref name=forbes2016/&gt;

Both with respect to cost and speed, the China-Europe direct train service is in between the air and sea options. While it is estimated that the overall volume of goods moving between China and Europe by rail is not going to surpass 1–2% of the sea cargo volume, it may eat significantly into the air cargo volume.&lt;ref name=forbes2016/&gt;

The service is typically used for valuable and somewhat time-sensitive cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is heavy enough to make the cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery and spare parts (in both directions), as well as high-end groceries and consumer goods (primarily toward China).&lt;ref name=forbes2016/&gt; While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also make it possible to send less-than-container shipments.&lt;ref name=forbes2016/&gt;

On the European end of the freight route, the rail terminal near [[Duisburg]]'s river port ([[Ruhrort]]) is a major destination. According to a 2018 report, Duisburg is either the destination, or one of the destinations, of some 80% of all direct China-Western Europe cargo trains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2158959/germanys-china-city-how-duisburg-became-xi Germany’s China City: how Duisburg became Xi Jinping’s gateway to Europe: Some 80 per cent of trains from China make the world’s largest inland port their first European stop], by PHILIP OLTERMANN, 9 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Eurasian Land Bridge===
{{Main|New Eurasian Land Bridge}}
The New Eurasian Land Bridge, also called the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, is the name given to China's rail link with Central Asia. The route includes China's east-west railways which, in addition to the Beijiang line, are the [[Longhai Railway]] and the [[Lanzhou–Xinjiang Railway]]. Together, the railways create an uninterrupted rail link between the port city of [[Lianyungang]] in [[Jiangsu]] province and Kazakhstan. In 1995 the Chinese and Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports,&lt;ref&gt;''China Daily'', Ōtsuka, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and the former intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Ren.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Almaty in Kazakhstan, the railway extends to [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan and then to [[Tejen]], Turkmenistan. From Tejen, another line continues to [[Ashgabat]], the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan]], a port on the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name="Otsuka 44"&gt;Ōtsuka, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; (After a direct rail link between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan opened, it became possible for the freight to bypass Uzbekistan, which has poor relations with its neighbors).

In 1996 a branch railway from Tejen was constructed across the border with [[Iran]] (at [[Serakhs]]) and linked to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Railways]]. The link potentially enables rail freight from China to reach ports on the [[Persian Gulf]] and via other train lines, to reach into the [[Caucasus]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ōtsuka, pp. 42, 44; Mirak-Weissbach.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2016, direct container train service was inaugurated on this route,  between [[Yiwu]] ([[Zhejiang]] Province) and [[Teheran]]; the trip takes 14 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cncnews.cn/news/v_show/54902_Yiwu-Tehran_cargo_train.shtml Yiwu-Tehran cargo train]&lt;/ref&gt;

The central Asian route did not extend all the way into Europe until October 2013 when the rail link across the [[Bosphorus]] though the [[Marmaray]] link was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Ōtsuka, pp. 42, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marmaray Opened|url=http://railturkey.org/2013/10/29/marmaray-opened/|publisher=Rail Turkey|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian rail lines use {{convert|1435|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=2}} gauge, requiring freight cars transiting from China into Iran to change wheel gauges twice. The train ferry across [[Lake Van]] is also a capacity restriction.&lt;ref name="Otsuka 44" /&gt;

Chinese state media claims that the New Eurasian Land/Continental Bridge extends from Lianyungang to [[Rotterdam]], a distance of {{convert|11870|km|mi|-2}}. The exact route used to connect the two cities, whether through Mongolia or Kazakhstan, however, is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, "NW China mulls 'New Silk Road' exhibition park".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron Silk Road via Turkey===
An alternative way from China to Europe is via Turkey. The route from China follows Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey. Due to longer distance, insufficient service and border crossings, this route has never been used for transports from China to Europe. However, a number of projects may strengthen this route in the future. 

The [[Marmaray|Marmaray project]] is one of them, connecting Europe and Asia via a tunnel under the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Uysal, Onur. [http://railturkey.org/2013/05/20/completely-false-facts-about-marmaray/ "Completely False Facts About Marmaray"], ''Rail Turkey'', 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the project, a continuous run of trains will be possible between Asia and Europe, which is now done by rail ferry service.&lt;ref&gt;Uysal, Onur.

Another project is Baku–Tbilisi–Kars railway project, which will be able to shorten the route via the Caspian Sea by bypassing Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Uysal, Onur. [http://railturkey.org/2014/10/20/baku-tblisi-kars-railway/ "10 Things to Know About Baku-Tbilisi-Kars Railway Project"], ''Rail Turkey'', 20 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The new railway lines constructed in Kazakhstan will make it shorter.

===Break of gauge issues===
[[File:WheelChanging.jpg|thumb| Changing [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]] at the Sino-Mongolian border]]
Former countries of the USSR, as well as Mongolia, use a [[Rail gauge|track gauge]] of {{RailGauge|1520mm}}. The international standard rail gauge used in most of Europe and China is {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. As a result, trains cannot run from China or European countries [[Break-of-gauge|into or out of]] the former USSR without [[Bogie exchange|changing bogies]]. Large facilities to carry out this procedure exist at most border crossing between the "[[Russian gauge|Russian]]" and "[[Standard gauge|standard]]" gauge territories (e.g., at [[Zabaykalsk]]&lt;ref name=zabGauge/&gt; or [[Erenhot]])&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Potts, "[http://www.salon.com/travel/diary/pott/1999/11/09/siberia1 Horse races, open spaces and the fate of Genghis Khan's balls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430190031/http://www.salon.com/travel/diary/pott/1999/11/09/siberia1/ |date=30 April 2009 }}". ''Salon'' Magazine, 9 November 1999. Quote: "a set of huge hydraulic cranes at the Sino-Mongolian border that lifted each train-car off the ground as the wheels ([[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]]) were changed to fit the new track-gauge"&lt;/ref&gt;
Changing the [[bogie]]s on a [[Railroad car|rail car]] takes hours and special, heavy equipment&lt;!-- Really!?!? --&gt;. In many cases (especially, [[shipping container|containerized]] freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead of changing the bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as [[Khorgos]]; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another in as little as 47 minutes.&lt;ref name=forbes2016&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2016/01/28/why-china-europe-silk-road-rail-transport-is-growing-fast |title=Why The China-Europe 'Silk Road' Rail Network Is Growing Fast |last=Shepard |first=Wade  |date=28 January 2016 |website=Forbes |type=Blog}}{{self-published source|date=February 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.&lt;ref&gt;''China Daily''; Ōtsuka, p. 48; Rodrigue.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that on some lines [[Variable gauge|variable gauge axles]] would achieve significant time savings in comparison to [[bogie exchange]]. Their implementation however would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either [[retrofitting]] or replacement of existing bogies&lt;!-- Really, NOT the whole car!!! --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, "Development of the Trans-Asian Railway", pp. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed development==

===Expansion projects===
{{See also|Trans-Asian Railway|Kunming–Singapore Railway|Japan–Korea Undersea Tunnel}}
[[File:ChinaRailwaysNetwork.png|thumb|right|China's rail system. The link with Kazakhstan is at the upper left corner of the map.]]
On 10 March 2004 the Kazakhstan Railway Company Ltd announced that it was looking for investors to fund the construction of a railway stretching {{convert|3083|km|mi|-1}} from China across Kazakhstan to the Caspian Sea that would be the same gauge as Chinese railways. Thus, the railway would allow trains from China to cross Kazakhstan without having to change bogies. The reported construction cost of the new railway was $3.5 billion. Chinese media reported that the railway would complete the link between China and Europe via central Asia, but it is unclear where the actual link to Europe would be. Also unclear is whether construction has yet to begin on the project.&lt;ref&gt;''China Daily''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of India and [[Burma]] have proposed building, with China's cooperation, a link to the Eurasian Land Bridge that would start in India or Burma and connect to the Chinese rail system in [[Yunnan]]. The route would allow freight from India and Burma to travel overland to Europe. The link would also give rail access for China to the Indian Ocean. One proposed starting point for the route is [[Kyaukpyu]]. The governments of [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] are also studying the feasibility of establishing rail links with China.&lt;ref&gt;Wehrfritz; ''The Statesman''; Xinhua, "Experts propose developing SW corridor of third Asia-Europe land-bridge".&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Russia and China are seeking to establish a permanent rail link with South Korea by way of [[North Korea]] to allow South Korean goods to be shipped to Europe via the Eurasian Land Bridge. According to Choi Yeon-Hye, a professor of marketing and management at the Korea National Railway College, a rail connection from [[Busan]] to Rotterdam would cut shipping time from 26 to 16 days and save $800 per container of freight.&lt;ref&gt;Wehrfritz; Funabashi.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its plan to link the Trans-Siberian to North and South Korea, Russia rebuilt its railink from Khasan to [[Rajin]], finishing in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yonhap]]'', "[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2011/09/14/0401000000AEN20110914011000315.HTML Russia to test railway to N. Korea next month: report]" [http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/0400000001.html alternate link]), 15 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[NHK World]]'', "Russia, N. Korea Complete Railway Renovation Work", 14 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean government announced on 2 December 2009 that it would conduct an economic and technical study on the feasibility of constructing undersea tunnels for transporting goods and people to and from the country directly to [[Kyushu]], Japan and [[Shandong]], China.&lt;ref&gt;Kyodo;  Wehrfritz also describes a proposal to construct a rail tunnel from [[Busan]] to Japan in order to provide access for Japanese trains to the Trans-Siberian Railway. Wehrfriz, however, does not mention any involvement in the proposal by the Korean government, stating simply, ''"Some have proposed extending the line with a tunnel linking the South Korean port of Pusan to Japan."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has advocated greater regional integration along the Eurasian Land Bridge, including development of rail links between the countries of South and Southeast Asia and Central Asia, called the [[Trans-Asian Railway]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, "China northwest city to host UN meet on Eurasia continental bridge 29 June to 4 July"; Islam.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese leaders have called for the establishment of [[free trade zone]]s at both ends of the Eurasian Land Bridge to facilitate development.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, "China: Congress deputies propose free trade zones along continental bridge".&lt;/ref&gt;  Said Khalid Malik, United Nations [[Resident Coordinator]] in China, "If this comes true, it will enable the continental bridge to play its due role in enhancing co-operation between Asia and Europe, and promoting world peace and development."&lt;ref&gt;Fu.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 and 2011, China announced plans to finance expansion of the rail systems in Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam and [[Kunming-Singapore Railway|connect them]] to China's rail system via [[Kunming]].  The plans include construction of a high-speed rail line from Kunming to [[Vientiane]], beginning in April 2011, with a possible future extension to [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', "China coming down the tracks", 22 January 2011, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2011, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced that a rail link was being considered between Sakhalin Island and Japan.  The rail line, constructed in an undersea tunnel, would link Japan to the Trans-Siberian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Putin mulls Sakhalin to Japan undersea tunnel", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 17 December 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bering Strait link===
{{Details|Bering Strait crossing}}
[[File:BeringBridge.jpg|thumb|right|Possible route of a bridge or tunnel across the Bering Strait]]
In April 2007 the Russian government announced that it was considering building a double track [[broad gauge]] rail tunnel under the [[Bering Strait]] between [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]] and [[Alaska]]. The tunnel, as projected, would be {{convert|60|mi|km|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and would include oil and gas pipelines, [[fiber optic]] cables and power lines.&lt;ref&gt;Blomfield.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel project was estimated to cost $65 billion and take 15–20 years to build. In addition to the Russian government, sponsors of the project apparently include [[Transneft]] and RAO United Energy Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst; Associated Press, "Bering Strait tunnel proposed".&lt;/ref&gt;

The project, as envisioned, would connect the Trans-Siberian via [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]]/[[Yakutsk]] in Siberian Russia with the [[North American rail network]] (gauge to be widened) at [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia]], Canada, a distance of {{convert|3700|mi|km|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}. A significant hurdle for the project is that the nearest major road to the Russian end of the tunnel is {{convert|1000|mi|km|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} away. In addition, Alaska has no direct rail link to either Canada or the [[contiguous United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Blomfield; Hearst.&lt;/ref&gt; Other leaders, including [[Wally Hickel]], [[Lyndon LaRouche]], [[Sun Myung Moon]], and the [[14th Dalai Lama]] have also advocated the construction of a tunnel or bridge across the strait.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson; DiBenedetto; Church &amp; State; Sciacca; ''Virginian-Pilot''; Qazwini.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-speed rail===
It was reported in the press in March 2007 that China intends to build a high-speed rail link between China and Western Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Loyd |first=Beth |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/europe-asia-days-proposed-high-speed-rail-network/story?id=10048404&amp;page=2 |title=China's Railway Calls for High-Speed Diplomacy |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comparecarhire.co.uk/news/china-to-launch-global-high-speed-rail-53815399.html |title=DVICE – China plans massive high-speed train network across Asia and Europe |publisher=Comparecarhire.co.uk |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/03/chinas-16-000-mile-17-nation-railroad-faces-bumpy-ride/37611/ |title=China's 16,000-Mile, 17-Nation Railroad Faces Bumpy Ride |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis |first=Andrew |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2010/gb20100316_622801.htm |title= China Explores Rail Routes to Europe |work=Business Week |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the possibility of a high-speed rail journey from Beijing to London taking just two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1256647/Fast-train-link-London-Beijing-days.html |title='New Orient Express' fast train could get travellers to Beijing from London in TWO days |work=Daily Mail |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Malcolm |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7397846/Kings-Cross-to-Beijing-in-two-days-on-new-high-speed-rail-network.html |title=King's Cross to Beijing in two days on new high-speed rail network |work=Daily Telegraph |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, the Chinese government announced that it would jointly sponsor the construction of a high-speed rail line between Astana and Almaty in Kazakhstan.  The announced completion date was 2015.&lt;ref&gt;An Lu ([[Xinhua]]), "[http://www.gov.cn/english/2011-02/22/content_1808269.htm Vice premier: high-speed railway project, new highlight of Sino-Kazakh co-op]", [http://english.gov.cn/ The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China], 22 February 2011; retrieved 25 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fabric shaver''' (also known as a '''lint shaver''' or '''fuzz remover''') is a handheld electrical device that has a rotating blade underneath a blade net. It allows users to remove [[Lint (material)|fuzz]] on a fabric without damaging the fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-fabric-shaver.htm|title=What is a Fabric Shaver? (with pictures)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied on different fabric-made items such as [[Bedding|bedding]], [[Curtain|curtain]] or [[Carpet|carpet]], but mostly used for removing fuzz on a clothes, especially [[Sweater|sweaters]], [[Hoodie|hoodies]], or clothes made by [[Wool|wool]], [[Angora_wool|angora]] or [[Cashmere_wool|cashmere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/02/the-fabric-shaver-i-trust-on-my-favorite-sweaters.html|title=The Sweater De-Piller That I Trust on My Most Beloved Cashmere|first=Katy|last=Schneider|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fabric shaver can be powered by two different ways; using a [[Battery_charger|battery charger]] or a [[Dry_cell|dry cell]]. To use the fabric shaver, all the user has to do is check its battery and then press on/off button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2464090&amp;cid=51399&amp;categoryId=51399|title=보풀제거기|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[garrison]] engineer holds the rank of executive engineer in the [[Military Engineer Services|Indian Defense Service of Engineers]]. Garrisson Engineer is a designation which is  held either by a civilian officer of M.E.S. or by a military officer of the rank of Lt Col. The Garrison engineer's staff includes at least three assistant garrison engineers, a barrack stores officer, an accounts officer, and junior engineers. Responsibilities of the position include procuring contracts and executing them. One of the elected members of the [[cantonment board]] has to be a former garrison engineer.

The first [[Indian people|Indian]] to become an officiating garrison engineer was [[Rai Bahadur]] Pandit Ram Prasad Tewari, who served in the [[Military Engineer Service]]s from 1880 to 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibhutewary.com/data/ebooks/tewari/tewari.pdf#page=9|title=Testimonial and Services of Rai Bahadur Pandit Ram Prasad Tewari, G.

{{further|Timeline of computing}}
The '''history of computing''' is longer than the [[history of computing hardware]] and [[computer|modern computing technology]] and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables.  

==Concrete devices==
 
Digital [[computing]] is intimately tied to the representation of [[number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/computing/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/digital-computing|title=Digital Computing - Dictionary definition of Digital Computing {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; But long before [[abstraction]]s like ''the number'' arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization. These concepts are implicit in concrete practices such as :
*''[[one-to-one correspondence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/teachingresources/discipline/maths/continuum/Pages/onetoone.aspx One-to-One Correspondence: Foundation Level]&lt;/ref&gt; a rule to [[counting|count]] ''how many'' items, say on a [[tally stick]], eventually abstracted into ''numbers'';
*''comparison to a standard'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method for assuming ''[[reproducibility]]'' in a [[measurement]], for example, the number of [[coin]]s 	
*the ''3-4-5'' right triangle was a device for assuring a ''right angle'', using [[rope]]s with 12 evenly spaced [[knot]]s, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/345Triangle.html|title=3, 4, 5 Triangle|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers==
Eventually, the concept of numbers became concrete and familiar enough for counting to arise, at times with sing-song mnemonics to teach [[sequence]]s to others. All known languages have words for at least [[numbers in various languages|"one" and "two"]] (although this is disputed: see [[Piraha language]]), and even some animals like the [[common blackbird|blackbird]] can distinguish a surprising number of items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Konrad Lorenz|authorlink1=Konrad Lorenz|year=1961|title=King Solomon's Ring|translator1=Marjorie Kerr Wilson|publisher=Methuen|location=London|isbn=0-416-53860-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in the [[numeral system]] and [[mathematical notation]] eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be [[theorem|stated formally]], and even [[mathematical proof|proven]]. See, for example, [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]] for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

By the High Middle Ages, the [[positional notation|positional]] [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] had reached [[Europe]], which allowed for systematic computation of numbers. During this period, the representation of a calculation on [[paper]] actually allowed calculation of [[mathematical expression]]s, and the tabulation of [[mathematical function]]s such as the [[square root]] and the [[common logarithm]] (for use in multiplication and division) and the [[trigonometric function]]s. By the time of [[Isaac Newton]]'s research, paper or vellum was an important computing resource, and even in our present time, researchers like [[Enrico Fermi]] would cover random scraps of paper with calculation, to satisfy their curiosity about an equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIY: Enrico Fermi’s Back of the Envelope Calculations|url=http://www.knowqout.com/science-technology/diy-enrico-fermis-back-of-the-envelope-calculations/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even into the period of programmable calculators, [[Richard Feynman]] would unhesitatingly compute any steps which overflowed the memory of the calculators, by hand, just to learn the answer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Early computation==
{{Main|Timeline of computing hardware 2400 BC–1949}}

The earliest known tool for use in computation is the [[Sumer]]ian [[abacus]], and it was thought to have been invented in [[Babylon]] c. 2700–2300 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known computer and most advanced system of calculation known to date - preceding Greek methods by 2,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In c. 1050–771 BC, the [[south-pointing chariot]] was invented in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. It was the first known [[gear]]ed mechanism to use a [[differential gear]], which was later used in [[analog computer]]s. The [[China|Chinese]] also invented a more sophisticated abacus from around the 2nd century BC known as the [[Chinese abacus]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the 5th century BC in [[History of India|ancient India]], the [[Philologist|grammarian]] [[Pāṇini]] formulated the [[grammar]] of [[Sanskrit]] in 3959 rules known as the [[Ashtadhyayi]] which was highly systematized and technical. Panini used metarules, [[Transformational grammar|transformations]] and [[recursion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0024-3841(78)90076-1| title = On the status of recursive rules in transformational grammar| journal = [[Lingua (journal)|Lingua]]| volume = 44| issue = 2–3| pages = 169| year = 1978| last1 = Sinha | first1 = A. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, [[Archimedes]] used the mechanical principle of balance (see [[Archimedes Palimpsest#Mathematical content]]) to calculate mathematical problems, such as the number of grains of sand in the universe (''[[The sand reckoner]]''), which also required a recursive notation for numbers (e.g., the [[myriad]] [[myriad]]).

Around 200 BC the development of gears had made it possible to create devices in which the positions of wheels would correspond to positions of astronomical objects. By about 100 AD [[Hero of Alexandria]] had described an odometer-like device that could be driven automatically and could effectively count in digital form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1107|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until the 1600s that mechanical devices for digital computation appear to have actually been built.

The [[Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/project/general/the-project.html ''The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project''], The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. Retrieved 2007-07-01&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the [[Antikythera]] wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and [[Crete]], and has been dated to ''circa'' 100 BC.

Mechanical analog computer devices appeared again a thousand years later in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] and were developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]], such as the mechanical geared [[astrolabe]] by [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]],&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/woi_knowledge.html|title=Islam, Knowledge, and Science|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|accessdate=2008-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119010548/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/woi_knowledge.html|archivedate=2008-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[torquetum]] by [[Jabir ibn Aflah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=R.

During the Middle Ages, several European philosophers made attempts to produce analog computer devices. Influenced by the Arabs and [[Scholasticism]], Majorcan philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1232–1315) devoted a great part of his life to defining and designing several ''logical machines'' that, by combining simple and undeniable philosophical truths, could produce all possible knowledge. These machines were never actually built, as they were more of a [[thought experiment]] to produce new knowledge in systematic ways; although they could make simple logical operations, they still needed a human being for the interpretation of results. Moreover, they lacked a versatile architecture, each machine serving only very concrete purposes. In spite of this, Llull's work had a strong influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (early 18th century), who developed his ideas further, and built several calculating tools using them.

Indeed, when [[John Napier]] discovered logarithms for computational purposes in the early 17th century, there followed a period of considerable progress by inventors and scientists in making calculating tools. The apex of this early era of formal computing can be seen in the [[difference engine]] and its successor the [[analytical engine]] (which was never completely constructed but was designed in detail), both by [[Charles Babbage]]. The analytical engine combined concepts from his work and that of others to create a device that if constructed as designed would have possessed many properties of a modern electronic computer.  These properties include such features as an internal "scratch memory" equivalent to [[RAM]], multiple forms of output including a bell, a graph-plotter, and simple printer, and a programmable input-output "hard" memory of [[punch cards]] which it could modify as well as read.  The key advancement which Babbage's devices possessed beyond those created before his was that each component of the device was independent of the rest of the machine, much like the components of a modern electronic computer. This was a fundamental shift in thought; previous computational devices served only a single purpose, but had to be at best disassembled and reconfigured to solve a new problem.  Babbage's devices could be reprogramed to solve new problems by the entry of new data, and act upon previous calculations within the same series of instructions.  [[Ada Lovelace]] took this concept one step further, by creating a program for the analytical engine to calculate [[Bernoulli numbers]], a complex calculation requiring a recursive algorithm.  This is considered to be the first example of a true computer program, a series of instructions that act upon data not known in full until the program is run.

Several examples of analog computation survived into recent times.  A [[planimeter]] is a device which does integrals, using [[distance]] as the analog quantity. Until the 1980s, [[HVAC]] systems used [[air]] both as the analog quantity and the controlling element. Unlike modern digital computers, analog computers are not very flexible, and need to be reconfigured (i.e., reprogrammed) manually to switch them from working on one problem to another. Analog computers had an advantage over early digital computers in that they could be used to solve complex problems using behavioral analogues while the earliest attempts at digital computers were quite limited.

[[Image:Visual Smith Chart.png|thumb|A [[Smith Chart]] is a well-known [[nomogram]].]]
Since computers were rare in this era, the solutions were often ''hard-coded'' into paper forms such as [[nomogram]]s,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which could then produce analog solutions to these problems, such as the distribution of pressures and temperatures in a heating system.

None of the early computational devices were really computers in the modern sense, and it took considerable advancement in mathematics and theory before the first modern computers could be designed.

The first recorded idea of using [[digital electronics]] for computing was the 1931 paper "The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena" by [[C. E. Wynn-Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wynn-Williams | first = C. E. | author-link = C. E.

The 1937 [[Atanasoff–Berry computer]] design was the first digital [[electronics|electronic]] computer (though not programmable), and the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3 computer]] from 1941, by [[Germany|German]] inventor [[Konrad Zuse]] was the first working programmable, fully automatic computing machine.

[[Alan Turing]] modelled computation in terms of a one-dimensional storage tape, leading to the idea of the [[Turing machine]] and [[Turing-complete]] programming systems.

During World War II, ballistics computing was done by women, who were hired as "computers." The term computer remained one that referred to mostly women (now seen as "operator") until 1945, after which it took on the modern definition of machinery it presently holds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Light|first=Jennifer S.|date=July 1999|title=When Computers Were Women|url=|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=40|pages=455–483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) was the first electronic general-purpose computer, announced to the public in 1946. It was Turing-complete,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} digital, and capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems. Women implemented the programming for machines like the ENIAC, and men created the hardware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Manchester Baby]] was the first electronic [[stored-program computer]]. It was built at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] by [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C.

The [[microprocessor]] was introduced with the [[Intel 4004]]. It began with the "[[Busicom]] Project"&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Masatoshi Shima]]'s three-chip [[CPU]] design in 1968,&lt;ref name=tout1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/busicom_141-pf_and_intel_4004.html|title=The Busicom 141-PF calculator and the Intel 4004 microprocessor|author=Nigel Tout|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; before [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s [[Tadashi Sasaki (engineer)|Tadashi Sasaki]] conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and [[Intel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="sasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url        = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Tadashi_Sasaki |title      = Oral-History: Tadashi Sasaki |last       = Aspray |first      = William |date       = 1994-05-25 |work       = Interview #211 for the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering |publisher  = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. |accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intel 4004 was then developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Federico Faggin]] and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The microprocessor led to the development of [[microcomputer]]s, and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

The 1980s brought about significant advances with microprocessor that greatly impacted the fields of engineering and other sciences. The [[Motorola 68000 series|Motorola 68000]] microprocessor had a processing speed that was far superior to the other microprocessors being used at the time. Because of this, having a newer, faster microprocessor allowed for the newer [[microcomputer]]s that came along after to be more efficient in the amount of computing they were able to do. This was evident in the 1983 release of the Apple computer Lisa. Lisa was the first personal computer with [[Graphical user interface|graphical user interface (GUI)]] that was sold commercially, she ran on the Motorola 68000, dual floppy disk drives, a 5 MB hard drive and had 1MB of [[Random-access memory|RAM .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/#169ebbe2ad45559efbc6eb3572083fb7|title=Computers {{!}} Timeline of Computer History {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After successfully launching Lisa, a year later Apple released its first [[Macintosh]] computer still running on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Another advancement because of microprocessors came from Texas Instruments. Texas Instruments first introduced their [[TMS9900]] processor in June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuartconner.me.uk/tm990/tm990.htm|title=Stuart's TM 990 Series 16-bit Microcomputer Modules|last=Conner|first=Stuart|website=www.stuartconner.me.uk|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then used their microprocessor in their [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI 99/4]] computer.

Late 1980s and beginning in the early 1990s we see more advances with actual computers to aid with actual computing.{{clarify |date=September 2017 |reason=What are "non-actual" computers and computing here?}} In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh Portable]], it was heavy weighing {{cvt|7.3|kg|lb}} and extremely expensive. It was not met with great success and was discontinued only two years later.  That same year Intel introduced the Touchstone Delta [[supercomputer]], which had 512 microprocessors. This technological advancement was very significant as it was used as a model for some of the fastest multi-processors systems in the world. It was even used a prototype for Caltech researchers who used the model for projects like real time processing of satellite images and simulating molecular models for various fields of research.

==Navigation and astronomy==

Starting with known special cases, the calculation of logarithms and trigonometric functions can be performed by looking up numbers in a [[mathematical table]], and [[interpolation|interpolating]] between known cases.  For small enough differences, this linear operation was accurate enough for use in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]] in the [[Age of Exploration]]. The uses of interpolation have thrived in the past 500 years: by the twentieth century [[Leslie Comrie]] and [[W.J. Eckert]] systematized the use of interpolation in tables of numbers for punch card calculation.

==Weather prediction==

The numerical solution of differential equations, notably the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] was an important stimulus to computing,
with [[Lewis Fry Richardson]]'s numerical approach to solving differential equations. The first computerised weather forecast was performed in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists [[Jule Charney]], Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist [[Ragnar Fjørtoft]], applied mathematician [[John von Neumann]], and [[ENIAC]] programmer [[Klara Dan von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Fjörtoft and von Neumann, 1950, Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation

==Symbolic computations==

By the late 1960s, computer systems could perform [[computer algebra|symbolic algebraic manipulation]]s well enough to pass college-level [[calculus]] courses.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52668">The first [[smart antennas]] were developed for [[military communications]] and intelligence gathering. The growth of cellular telephone in the 1980s attracted interest in commercial applications. The upgrade to digital radio technology in the mobile phone, indoor wireless network, and satellite broadcasting industries created new opportunities for smart antennas in the 1990s, culminating in the development of the [[MIMO]] (multiple-input multiple-output) technology used in [[4G]] wireless networks.

== Directional antennas ==
The earliest success at tracking and controlling wireless signals relied on the antennas’ physical configuration and motion. The German inventor and physicist [[Karl F. Braun]] demonstrated [[beamforming]] for the first time in 1905. Braun created a [[phased array]] by positioning three antennas to reinforce radiation in one direction and diminish radiation in other directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/braun-lecture.html|title=Nobel Lecture: Electrical Oscillations and Wireless Telegraphy|last=Braun|first=Karl Ferdinand |publisher=Nobel Media AB 2013 |date=11 December 1909|website=Nobelprize.org|accessdate= 21 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guglielmo Marconi]] experimented with directional antennas in 1906.&lt;ref name= Mailloux&gt;{{cite book |last=Mailloux |first=Robert J. |editor-first=Tapan K. |editor-last=Sarkar|title=History of Wireless |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2006 |pages=567–603 |chapter=Chapter 17: A History of Phased Array Antennas |isbn=978-0-471-71814-7|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Directional antennas were rotated to detect and track enemy forces during World War I. The British admiralty used goniometers (radio compasses) to track the German fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hugill |first= Peter J. |title= Global Communications Since 1844: Geopolitics and Technology |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press |year= 1999 |page=143 |isbn=0-8018-6039-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edwin H. Armstrong]] invented the [[superheterodyne receiver]] to detect the high frequency noise generated by German warplanes’ ignition systems. The war ended before Armstrong’s creation was ready to help direct antiaircraft fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Douglas |first=Alan |year=1990 |title= The Legacies of Edwin Howard Armstrong |url= http://antiqueradios.com/superhet |journal= Proceedings of the Radio Club of America |volume=64 |issue=3 |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiple elements (a fed dipole, a director, and reflectors) were assembled in the 1920s to create narrow transmit and receive antenna patterns. The Yagi-Uda array, better known as the [[Yagi antenna]], is still widely used.&lt;ref name= Mailloux /&gt; [[Edmond Bruce]] and [[Harald T. Friis]] developed directional antennas for shortwave and microwave frequencies during the 1930s.&lt;ref name= Mailloux /&gt;

AT&amp;T’s decision to use microwave to carry inter-city telephone traffic led to the first large-scale commercial deployment of directional antennas (based on Friis’ horn reflector design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Robert W. |editor-first=Alain |editor-last=Blanchard|title=Physical Cosmology |publisher=Editions Frontieres |year= 1991 |pages=3 |chapter=Chapter 1: Discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background |isbn=2-86332-094-7|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1947. Directional antennas with alternating polarization enabled a single pair of frequencies to be reused over many consecutive hops. Microwave links are less expensive to deploy and maintain than coaxial cable links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.corp.att.com/history/nethistory/transmission.html |title= History of Network Transmission |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=About.ATT.com |publisher= |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phased array radar ==
The first mechanically scanned [[phased array]] radar (using a rotating Yagi antenna) was demonstrated in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/weap-sen/radar/us/early-ex.htm |title= Early U.S. Navy Experimental Radars |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=History.Navy.Mil |publisher=Department of the Navy—Naval Historical Center |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first electronically scanned radars used electromechanical devices (such as mechanical tuners or switches) to steer the antenna’s beam.

Germany built the [[Wullenweber]] circular array for direction finding during the early years of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Robert M. |title= The Technical Collection of Intelligence |publisher=CQ Press |year= 2011 |pages=179 |isbn=978-1-483-30495-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wullenweber could electronically scan the horizon 360° and determine the direction of any signal with reasonably good accuracy. Circular arrays were enhanced during the Cold War for eavesdropping purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schonauer |first=Scott |date=5 February 2003 |title=Cold War relic ‘Bull Ring’ is being dismantled at Rota |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/cold-war-relic-bull-ring-is-being-dismantled-at-rota-1.1674 |newspaper=Stars and Stripes |location= |publisher= |accessdate=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The American Physicist [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] developed the first [[ground-controlled approach]] (GCA) system for landing aircraft in bad weather based on an electronically steered microwave phased array antenna. Alvarez tested and deployed the system in England in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McAleer |first= Neil |title= Sir Arthur C. Clarke: Odyssey of a Visionary: The Biography |publisher= RosettaBooks |year= 2013 |pages= |isbn=978-0-795-33297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the war, Germany’s GEMA built an early warning phased array radar system (the PESA Mammut 1) to detect targets up to 300&amp;nbsp;km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kopp |first=Carlo |date=August 2012 |title= Evolution of AESA Radar Technology |url= http://www.mwjournal-digital.com/mwjournal/201208?pg=142#pg142 |journal= Microwave Journal, Military Microwaves Supplement |volume= |issue= |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polyrod fire control antenna was developed by [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1947 using cascaded phase shifters controlled by a rotary switch (spinning at ten revolutions per second) to create a continuous scanning beam.&lt;ref name= Mailloux /&gt;

A major push to meet national security response time and coverage requirements called for the development of an all-electronic steerable planar phased array radar.&lt;ref name=fenn&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fenn |first= Alan J.|date=August 2000 |title= The development of phased-array radar technology|url= http://www.ll.mit.edu/news/delaneyNAE.html |journal= Lincoln Laboratory Journal |volume=12 |issue=2 |accessdate=October 23, 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR’s launch of Sputnik in 1957 suggested the need for ground-based satellite surveillance systems. [[Bendix Corporation]] responded by building its Electronically Steerable Array Radar (ESAR) in 1960. Enhanced beamforming techniques, such as multiple-beam Butler matrices, were developed for detecting and tracking objects in space.&lt;ref name=fenn /&gt;

The launch of Explorer 1 by the United States in 1958 suggested another application: space-based radar systems for detecting and tracking aircraft, ships, armored vehicles, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. These systems required the development of special techniques for canceling the radar clutter seen from space, nulling ground-based jammers, and compensating for Doppler shifts experienced by fast-moving satellites.&lt;ref name=fenn /&gt;

Space-based radar systems spurred the development of smaller, lighter weight, and less costly components: monolithic microwave integrated circuits ([[MMIC]]s) for operation at frequencies in the 1&amp;nbsp;GHz to 30&amp;nbsp;GHz (microwave) and 30&amp;nbsp;GHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz (millimeter wave) ranges. The high power levels needed for detection are easier to achieve at microwave frequencies. The narrow beams required for high resolution target tracking are best achieved at millimeter wave frequencies. Companies such as [[Texas Instruments]], [[Raytheon]], [[RCA]], [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], [[General Electric]], and [[Hughes Electronics]] participated in the early development of MMICs.&lt;ref name=fenn /&gt;

The first all-solid state radar was built for the United States Marines in 1972 by General Electric. It was a mobile 3-D radar system with its array mounted on a rotating platform for scanning the horizon.&lt;ref name= Mailloux /&gt; The first all-solid state phased array radar was the [[PAVE PAWS]] (precision acquisition vehicle entry - phased array warning system) UHF radar built in 1978 for the United States Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/track/pavepaws.htm |title= AN/FPS-115 PAVE PAWS Radar |author=John Pike |date=6 March 2000 |website=FAS.org |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Phased array antennas are also used in radio astronomy. [[Karl Jansky]], discoverer of the radio waves emanating from the Milky Way galaxy, used a Bruce array for experiments he conducted in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Jansky.html |title= Jansky, Karl (1905-1950) |date=|website=ScienceWorld.Wolfram.com |publisher= Wolfram Research |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern phased array radio telescopes typically consist of a number of small, interconnected antennas such as the [[Murchison Widefield Array]] in Australia, constructed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.engadget.com/2013/07/09/murchison-widefield-array-goes-live/ |title= Murchison Widefield Array goes live, will study the sun, space junk, the early universe and more |author= Jamie Rigg |date=9 July 2013 |website=Engadget.com |publisher= AOL Inc. |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptive antenna arrays ==
L. C. van Atta was first to describe a [[retrodirectivity|retrodirective]] antenna, which redirects (rather than reflects) a signal back in the direction from which it came, in his 1959 patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number=2908002 |status= patent |title= Electromagnetic Reflector |pubdate=1959-16-10 |fdate= |pridate= |invent1=Lester C. van Atta |assign1= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signal can be modulated by the redirecting host for purposes such as [[radio-frequency identification]] and traffic control (radar target echo enhancement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Tatsuo |editor-last= Itoh|title= RF Technologies for Low-Power Wireless Communications |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2001 |pages=341–342 |chapter= |isbn=0-471-38267-1|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first adaptive array, the side-lobe canceller, was developed by Paul Howells and Sid Applebaum at General Electric in 1959 to suppress radar jamming signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/First-Hand:Sidelobe_Cancellers_and_the_Like |title= First-Hand:Sidelobe Cancellers and the Like |author=Dean Chapman |date= |website=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on [[Norbert Wiener]]’s work with analog filters, in 1960 Stanford University professor [[Bernard Widrow]] and PhD student [[Ted Hoff]] developed the [[least mean squares]] (LMS) algorithm that automatically adjusts an antenna’s directivity pattern to reinforce desired signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Bernard_Widrow |title=Bernard Widrow Oral History |author=Andrew Goldstein |year=1997 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ted Compton at Ohio State University developed an adaptive antenna technique for recovering direct sequence spread spectrum signals in the presence of narrowband co-channel interference. Compton’s method, reported in 1974, only requires knowledge of the desired signal’s pseudorandom noise (PN) code—not its direction of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Compton |first= R.T.|date= March 1978 |title= An Adaptive Array in a Spread Spectrum Communications System |url= |journal= Proc.

A 1977 paper by Bell Labs researchers Douglas O. Reudink and Yu S. Yeh described the advantages of scanning spot beams for satellites. The authors estimated that scanning spot beams could save 20&amp;nbsp;dB in link budget which in turn could be used to reduce transmit power, increase communication capacity, and decrease the size of earth-station antennas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reudink |first=D.

The [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), proposed in 1983, became a major source of funding for technology research in several areas. The algorithms developed to track intercontinental ballistic missiles and direct x-ray laser weapons were particularly relevant to smart antennas.

== Digital antenna arrays ==
These are antenna arrays with multi channels ''digital [[beamforming]]'', usually by using [[FFT]].

The theory of the 'digital antenna arrays' (DAA) started to emerge as a theory of multichannel estimation. Its origins go
back into methods developed in the 1920s that were used to determine direction of the arrival of radio signals by a set of
two antennas based on the phase difference or amplitudes of their output voltages. Thus, the assessment of the directions of
arrival of a single signal was conducted according to pointedtype indicator readings or according to the Lissajous curves,
drawn by beam on the oscilloscope screen.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa&gt;Slyusar V. I. Origins of the Digital Antenna Array Theory.// International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques, 24–27 May 2017, Kyiv, Ukraine. – Pp. 199 - 201 [http://www.slyusar.kiev.ua/Slyusar_ICATT_2017_m.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s this approach caused the emergence of the theory of three-channel antenna analyzers that provided the
solution to the problem of signal separation of air target and “antipode” reflected from the underlying surface by solving
system of equations which were obtained with the help of complex voltages of three-channel signal mix.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt;

The growing complexity of solving such radar challenges, as well as the need to implement effective signal processing by
the end of the 1950s predetermined the use of electronic computers in this field. For example, in 1957, Ben S. Meltont
and Leslie F. Bailey published a very significant article in this field,&lt;ref&gt;Ben S. Meltont and Leslie F. Bailey, Multiple Signal Correlators.//Geophysics .- July, 1957. - Vol. XXII, No. 3. - Pp. 565-588. - DOI: 10.1190/1.1438390&lt;/ref&gt; where authors offered options of implementation of algebraic operations for signal processing with the help of electronic circuits, their equivalents, with the aim to develop signal correlator on the base of certain analogue computer.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt;

The replacement of analogue computer facilities by digital technologies three years after in 1960 was embodied in the
idea of using high-speed computers to solve directional finding problems, initially to locate earthquake epicenter. B. A. Bolt
was one of the first who implemented this idea in practice,&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Bolt. The Revision of Earthquake Epicentres, Focal Depths and Origin-Times using a High-speed Computer.//Geophysical Journal. - 1960, Vol. 3, Issue 4. - Pp. 433 — 440. - DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-246X.1960.tb01716.x.&lt;/ref&gt; he has developed a program for IBM 704 for seismic direction finding based on the method of least squares.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt; Almost simultaneously a similar approach was used by Flinn, research fellow of the Australian National University.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Flinn. Local earthquake location with an electronic computer.//Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. - July 1960. - Vol. 50, No. 3. – Pp. 467 - 470&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that in the mentioned experiments the interface between sensors and computer was implemented with the help of data input cards, such decision was a decisive step on the way of the appearance of the DAA. Then, there was only to solve the problem of direct digital data, obtained from sensing elements, input into computer, excluding the stage of preparation of punch card and operator assistance as a surplus link.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt;

Apparently, it was Polikarpov B.I. who first drew attention to the potential possibilities of multichannel analyzers in the
former USSR&lt;ref&gt;Polikarpov B.I. On some possibilities of application of independent channels of signal reception and the use of
electronics and computer technologies to improve antijamming capabilities and resolution characteristic of radar measurement//Express Information, BNT, № 23, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Polikarpov B.I. shows the principal possibility of signal sources
resolution with an angular distance less than aperture angle of the antenna system.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt;

However, a specific solution to the problem of superRayleigh resolution of the emission sources was proposed by Varyukhin V.A. and Zablotskiy M.A. only in 1962, they invented corresponding method of measuring of directions to sources of electromagnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;A.S. USSR № 25752. Method of measuring of directions to sources of electromagnetic field. // Varyukhin V.A., Zablotskiy M.A. – 1962&lt;/ref&gt; This method was based on the processing of information contained in the distribution of complex voltage amplitudes at the outputs of amplitude, phase and phase-amplitude multichannel analyzers and it permitted to determine the angular coordinates of sources within the width of the main lobe of the receiving antenna system.

Further Varyukhin V.A. developed a general theory of multichannel analyzers, based on the processing of information contained in the distribution of complex voltage amplitudes at the outputs of the digital antenna array. An important milestone in the recognition of the scientific results of Varyukhin V.A. was the defence of his doctor of science dissertation, held in 1967.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt;

A distinctive feature of developed by him theoretical foundations is the maximum automation of the process of assessment of the coordinates and parameters of signals, whereas an approach based on the generation of the response function of seismic multichannel analyzer and assessment of its resolution capabilities on the basis of visual impressions was just arisen at that time.&lt;ref name=slyusardaa/&gt; What is meant here is a Capon method&lt;ref&gt;J. Capon, “High–Resolution Frequency–Wavenumber Spectrum Analysis,” Proceedings of the IEEE, 1969, Vol. 57, pp. 1408–1418&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further [[multiple signal classification]] (MUSIC), [[Estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques]] (ESPRIT) methods and other projection methods of spectral estimation.
 
Of course, it is ungrateful to make a conclusion about the priority and importance of various alternative scientific
approaches in the process of development of a general theory of the DAA, taking into account classified nature of the
majority works and the lack of the possibility to study scientific heritage of that time, even taking into account
Internet. Proposed here historical journey only slightly raised the veil of time over the true development of scientific
research and its main aim was to point general niche and time frame of the inception of the theory of multichannel analysis
through the lens of historical background. A detailed presentation of the historical stages of development of the DAA theory deserves standalone consideration.

== Advanced processing techniques ==
A 1979 paper by Ralph O. Schmidt of [[Electromagnetic Systems Laboratory]] (ESL, a supplier of strategic reconnaissance systems) described the [[multiple signal classification]] (MUSIC) algorithm for estimating signals’ angle of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= Ralph O. |last= Schmidt | authorlink= | title= Multiple emitter location and signal parameter estimation | conference= RADC Spectrum Estimation Workshop.

Griffiss Air Force Base, NY |year=1979 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt used a [[signal subspace]] method based on geometric modeling to derive a solution assuming the absence of noise and then extended the method to provide a good approximation in the presence of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schmidt |first=Ralph O. |date=March 1986 |title= Multiple emitter location and signal parameter estimation |url= |journal= IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=276–280 |doi=10.1109/TAP.1986.1143830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt’s paper became the most cited and his signal subspace method became the focus of ongoing research.

Jack Winters showed in 1984 that received signals from multiple antennas can be combined (using the optimum combining technique) to reduce co-channel interference in digital mobile networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Winters |first=Jack H. |date=July 1984 |title= Optimum Combining in Digital Mobile Radio with Cochannel Interference |url= http://kom.aau.dk/~pe/education/literature/8sem/J_Winters_JSAC84.pdf  |format=PDF | journal= IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=528–539|doi=10.1109/JSAC.1984.1146095 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to this time, [[antenna diversity]] had only been used to mitigate multipath fading. However, digital mobile networks would not become common for another ten years.

Richard Roy developed the [[Estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques]] (ESPRIT) algorithm in 1987. ESPRIT is a more efficient and higher resolution algorithm than MUSIC for estimating signals’ angle of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Roy |first=Richard H. |last2= Kailath |first2=Thomas |date=July 1989 |title= ESPRIT—Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques |url= http://www.vtvt.ece.vt.edu/research/references/uwb/ranging_mobile_location/esprit.pdf |format=PDF | journal= IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages= 984–995 |doi= 10.1109/29.32276 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brian Agee and John Treichler developed the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) for blind equalization of analog FM and telephone signals in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Treichler |first= John R. |last2= Agee |first2=Brian |date=April 1983 |title=A new approach to multipath correction of constant modulus signals |url= | journal= IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages= 459–472 |doi= 10.1109/TASSP.1983.1164062 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CMA relies on knowledge of the signal’s waveform rather than channel state information or training signals.

During the 1990s companies such as [[Applied Signal Technology]] (AST) developed airborne systems to intercept digital cellular phone calls and text messages for law enforcement and national security purposes. While an airborne system can eavesdrop on a mobile user anywhere in a cellular network, it will receive all mobile stations reusing the same user and control frequencies at roughly the same power level. Adaptive antenna beamforming and interference cancellation techniques are used to focus on the target user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lum |first= Zachary |year=1998 |title= COMINT Goes to Cell Hell-The cellular revolution has led to a communications intelligence counter-revolution |url= https://data.epo.org/gpi/EP1253436A1.pdf?download=true | journal= Journal of Electronic Defense |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages= 35–42 |doi= |accessdate= October 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AST was acquired by Raytheon in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hubler |first=David |date=20 December 2010 |title=Raytheon buys Applied Signal Technology |url=http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/12/20/raytheon--applied-signal-technology.aspx |newspaper=Washington Technology |location= |publisher= 1105 Media Inc. |accessdate=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space division multiple access (SDMA) ==
In 1947 [[Douglas H. Ring]] wrote a Bell Laboratories internal memorandum describing a new way to increase the capacity of metropolitan radio networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privateline.com/archive/Ringcellreport1947.pdf |title=Technical Memorandum: Mobile Telephony – Wide Area Coverage |publisher=Bell Telephone Laboratories |format=PDF |date=11 December 1947 |accessdate=24 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207062016/http://www.privateline.com/archive/Ringcellreport1947.pdf |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring proposed dividing a city into geographic cells, using low power transmitters with omnidirectional antennas, and reusing frequencies in non-adjacent cells. Ring’s [[cellular radio]] scheme did not become practical until the arrival of integrated circuits in the 1970s.

As the number of mobile phone subscribers grew in the 1980s and 1990s researchers investigated new ways to increase mobile phone network capacity. Directional antennas were used to divide cells into sectors. In 1989, Simon Swales at Bristol University in the United Kingdom proposed methods for increasing the number of simultaneous users on the same frequency. Receive signals can be distinguished based on differences in their direction-of-arrival at the cell site antenna array. Transmit signals can be aimed at the intended recipient using beamforming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= Simon C. |last= Swales |first2= Mark A. |last2= Beach |first3= David J. |last3= Edwards | authorlink= | title= Multi-beam adaptive base-station antennas for cellular land mobile radio systems | conference= IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference.

Richard Roy and [[Björn Ottersten]] at [[ArrayComm|Arraycomm]] patented a [[Space-division multiple access|spatial division multiple access]] method for wireless communication systems in the early 1990s. This technology was employed in Arraycomm’s IntelliCell product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number=5642353 |status= patent |title= Spatial division multiple access wireless communication systems |pubdate=1997-24-06 |fdate= |pridate= |invent1=Richard H.

== First commercial smart antennas ==
Richard Roy and French entrepreneur Arnaud Saffari founded [[ArrayComm]] in 1992 and recruited [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Marty Cooper]], who led the [[Motorola]] group that developed the first portable cell phone, to head the company. ArrayComm’s smart antennas were designed to increase the capacity of wireless networks employing time division duplex (TDD) such as the PHS ([[Personal Handy-phone System]]) networks that were deployed throughout Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gross |first=Neil |date=18 June 2000 |title=Telecom's Contrarian |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2000-06-18/telecoms-contrarian|newspaper=BusinessWeek |location= |publisher=Bloomberg LP |accessdate=25 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bell Labs researcher Douglas O. Reudink founded Metawave Communications, a maker of switched beam antennas for cellular telephone networks, in 1995. Metawave claimed that by focusing capacity on areas with the highest traffic it could boost cell capacity up to 75%. Though Metawave managed to sell switched beam antennas to at least one major carrier, the company went out of business in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.manta.com/c/mmgklfm/metawave-communications-corp |title= Metawave Communications |date=|website=Manta.com |publisher= |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, AT&amp;T Wireless Group announced plans to offer fixed wireless service at speeds up to 512 kbit/s. Project Angel promised non-line of sight (NLOS) coverage using beamforming and  [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing]] (OFDM). Service was launched in ten cities in 2000. However, by 2002 AT&amp;T sold its fixed wireless service business to Netro Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Solomon |first=Deborah |date=15 January 2002 |title= AT&amp;T Wireless to Sell Fixed-Wireless Assets To Netro for $45 Million in Cash and Stock |url= https://www.wsj.com/article/SB1011051961799877200.djm.html |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Co. |accessdate=25 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of 4G MIMO ==
Smart antenna research led to the development of [[4G]] MIMO. Conventional smart antenna techniques (such as diversity and beamforming) deliver incremental gains in spectral efficiency. 4G MIMO exploits natural [[multipath propagation]] to multiply spectral efficiency.

Researchers studying the transmission of multiple signals over different wires in the same cable bundle helped create a theoretical foundation for 4G MIMO. Specifically, techniques for cancelling the effects of crosstalk using knowledge of the source signals were investigated. The “wireline MIMO” researchers included Lane H. Brandenburg and Aaron D. Wyner (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Brandenburg |first= Lane H. |last2= Wyner |first2= Aaron D.|date=May–June 1974 |title=Capacity of the Gaussian Channel with Memory: The Multivariate Case |url= | journal= Bell System Technical Journal |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages= 745–778 |doi= 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1974.tb02768.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Raleigh|Greg Raleigh]]’s 1996 paper was first to propose a method for multiplying the capacity of point-to-point wireless links using multiple co-located antennas at each end of a link in the presence of multipath propagation. The paper provided a rigorous mathematical proof of MIMO capacity based on a precise channel model and identified OFDM as the most efficient air interface for use with MIMO. The paper was submitted to the [[IEEE]] in April 1996 and presented in November at the 1996 Global Communications Conference in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= Gregory |last= Raleigh |first2= John M. |last2= Cioffi | authorlink= | title= Spatio-temporal coding for wireless communications | conference= Global Telecommunications Conference, 1996.

Raleigh discovered that multipath propagation could be exploited to multiply link capacity after developing an improved channel model that showed how multipath propagation affects signal waveforms. The model took into account factors including radio propagation geometry (natural and man-made objects serving as “local reflectors” and “dominant reflectors”), antenna array steering, angle of arrival, and delay spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= Gregory|last= Raleigh | authorlink= | title= Characterization of fast fading vector channels for multi-antenna communication systems | conference= Conference Record of the Twenty-Eighth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers.

Bell Labs researcher [[Gerard J. Foschini]]’s paper submitted in September 1996 and published in October of the same year also theorized that MIMO could be used to significantly increase the capacity of point-to-point wireless links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Foschini |first= Gerard.

[[Space-time block code]] (also known as the Alamouti code) was developed by [[Siavash Alamouti]] and is widely used in [[MIMO-OFDM]] systems. Alamouti’s 1998 paper showed that the benefits of receive diversity can also be achieved using a combination of transmit diversity and space-time block codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Alamouti |first= Siavash M.  |date= October 1998 |title= A Simple Transmit Diversity Technique for Wireless Communications |url= http://www.sal.ufl.edu/eel6935/stc.pdf | journal= IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages= 1451–1458 |doi= 10.1109/49.730453 |accessdate= 25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key advantage of transmit diversity is that it does not require multiple antennas and RF chains in handsets.

== Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ==
OFDM emerged in the 1950s when engineers at [[Collins Radio]] Company found that a series of non-contiguous sub-channels are less vulnerable to inter-symbol interference (ISI).&lt;ref name="LaSorte et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite conference |first= Nick |last= LaSorte| authorlink= | title= The history of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing | conference= IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 Conference. |year=2008 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224356518_The_History_of_Orthogonal_Frequency_Division_Multiplexing/file/d912f5134c7c2454bc.pdf |format=PDF |DOI=10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.690 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFDM was studied more systematically by Robert W.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created a task group in late 2003 to develop a wireless LAN standard delivering at least 100 Mbit/s of user data throughput. There were two major competing proposals: TGn Sync was backed by companies including Intel and Philips, and WWiSE was supported by companies including Airgo Networks, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments. Both groups agreed that the 802.11n standard would be based on MIMO-OFDM with 20&amp;nbsp;MHz and 40&amp;nbsp;MHz channel options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Cox |first= John |date=8 February 2005 |title= 802.11n update: TGn Sync vs WWiSE |url= http://www.networkworld.com/net.worker/news/2005/020705netleadside.html |newspaper=Network World |publisher= IDG |accessdate=28 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TGn Sync, WWiSE, and a third proposal (MITMOT, backed by Motorola and Mitsubishi) were merged to create what was called the Joint Proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Smith |first= Tony |date=1 August 2005 |title= 802.11n rivals agree to merge |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/01/tgn_sync_wwise_join_forces |newspaper=UK Register |publisher=  |accessdate=28 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final 802.11n standard supported speeds up to 600 Mbit/s (using four simultaneous data streams) and was published in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ngo |first= Dong |date=11 September 2009 |title= 802.11n Wi-Fi standard finally approved |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10351215-94.html |newspaper=CNET |publisher= CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=28 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[WiMAX]] was developed as an alternative to cellular standards, is based on the [[802.16e]] standard, and uses MIMO-OFDM to deliver speeds up to 138 Mbit/s. The more advanced 802.16m standard enabled download speeds up to 1 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimaxforum.org/sites/wimaxforum.org/files/document_library/wimax_802.16m.pdf |title=WiMAX and the IEEE 802.16m Air Interface Standard |date=April 2010 |website=WiMAXforum.org |publisher=WiMAX Forum |accessdate=28 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207054411/http://www.wimaxforum.org/sites/wimaxforum.org/files/document_library/wimax_802.16m.pdf |archivedate=7 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A nationwide WiMAX network was built in the United States by [[Clearwire]], a subsidiary of [[Sprint-Nextel]], covering 130 million pops by mid-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcc.gov/document/16th-mobile-competition-report |title= Annual Report and Analysis of Competitive Market Conditions With Respect to Mobile Wireless, Including Commercial Mobile Services |date= 21 March 2013 |pages=8 |website=FCC.gov |publisher= Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearwire subsequently announced plans to deploy LTE (the cellular 4G standard) covering 31 cities by mid-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gigaom.com/2011/12/13/clearwire-green-lights-lte-build-by-raising-734-million/ |title= Clearwire green-lights LTE build by raising $734 million |author= Kevin Fitchard |date= 13 December 2011 |pages= |website=GIGAOM.com |publisher= GIGAOM |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emerging 5G MIMO-OFDM standards ==
The [[802.11ac]] wireless LAN standard was proposed to deliver speeds of 1 Gbit/s and faster. Development of the specification began in 2011 and is expected to be completed by 2014. 802.11ac uses the 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band, defines channels up to 160&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, supports up to 8 simultaneous MIMO data streams, and delivers raw data rates up to nearly 7 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/the-five-things-you-need-to-know-about-gigabit-wi-fi-802-11ac-7000017112/ |title= Gigabit Wi-Fi: 802.11ac is here: Five things you need to know |author= Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols |date= 21 June 2013 |pages= |website= zdnet.com |publisher= CBS Interactive |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of products based on 802.11ac draft specifications are now available.

Fifth generation ([[5G]]) mobile network concepts are in the exploratory stage. Commercialization is expected by the early 2020s. In March 2013, [[NTT DoCoMo]] tested a10 Gbit/s uplink using 400&amp;nbsp;MHz in the 11&amp;nbsp;GHz band. In May 2013, Samsung announced that it is experimenting in the 28&amp;nbsp;GHz band using base stations with up to 64 antennas and has achieved 1 Gbit/s at distances up to 2 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/01/ntt-docomo-5g-wireless-network-vision-demo-ceatec |title= NTT DoCoMo's vision of '5G' wireless: 100x faster than LTE, but not until 2020 |author= Darren Murph |date= 1 October 2013 |pages= |website= engadget.com |publisher= AOL Tech |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samsung]] claims the technology could deliver tens of Gbit/s under favorable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Sang-Hun |first= Choe |date=13 May 2013 |title= Samsung Advances Toward 5G Networks |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/technology/samsung-announces-breakthrough-in-mobile-data-speed.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |publisher= The New York Times Company |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research papers suggest that 5G networks are likely to consist of small distributed cells operating at frequencies up to 90&amp;nbsp;GHz using “massive MIMO.” According to Jakob Hoydis of Bell Laboratories, [[Alcatel-Lucent]], Germany, “Network densification is the only solution to the capacity crunch.” This could involve two-tier networks (“HetNets”) using existing cellular base stations to ensure broad coverage and high mobility and interspersed small cells for capacity and indoor service. Massive MIMO would also be employed in high-speed backhaul links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first= Jakob |last= Hoydis | url=http://www.ieee-ctw.org/2013/slides/Jakob.pdf |format=PDF | title= On the Complementary Benefits of Massive MIMO, Small Cells, and TDD | conference= IEEE Communication Theory Workshop.

The incident happened some {{convert|200|km}} off the coast of [[Sakhalin]] island, in waters more than {{convert|1000|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=upstream191211&gt;

'''Limoges porcelain''' is [[hard-paste porcelain]] produced by factories in and around the city of [[Limoges]], [[France]] beginning in the late 18th century, but does not refer to a particular manufacturer.  By about 1830 Limoges, which was close to the areas where suitable clay was found, had replaced Paris as the main centre for private porcelain factories, although the state-owned [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres porcelain]] near Paris remained dominant at the very top of the market. Limoges has maintained this position to the present day. 

== History ==
Limoges had strong antecedents in the production of decorative objects. The city was the most famous European centre of [[vitreous enamel]] production in the 12th century, and [[Limoges enamel]] was known as ''Opus de Limogia'' or ''Labor Limogiae''.&lt;ref name="Addison"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F5zL1xN_Cs4C&amp;pg=PA97 ''Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages'' by Julia De Wolf Gi Addison p.97''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Limoges had also been the site of a minor industry producing plain [[faience]] earthenware since the 1730s. 
[[File:Service Cérès en biscuit de porcelaine dure Limoges Manufacture Pouyat 1855.jpg|thumb|[[Biscuit porcelain]] centrepiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle of 1855]], Pouyat factory]]
The manufacturing of [[hard-paste porcelain]] at Limoges was established by [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] in 1771 following the discovery of local supplies of [[kaolin]] and a material similar to [[petuntse]] in the economically distressed area at [[Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche]], near Limoges. The materials, which were quarried beginning in 1768, were used to produce hard-paste porcelain similar to [[Chinese porcelain]]. 

A manufactory at Limoges was placed under the patronage of the [[Charles X of France|comte d'Artois]], brother of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and was later purchased by the King in 1784, apparently with the idea of producing hard-paste bodies for decoration at [[Sèvres porcelain|Sèvres]], although this never happened.

After the [[French Revolution]] a number of private factories were established at Limoges, including [[Bernardaud]] and [[Haviland &amp; Co.]]

== Present day ==
Limoges maintains the position it established in the 19th century as the premier manufacturing city of porcelain in France.

Counterfeiting of Limoges porcelain has been documented for decades.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/sep/04/dinner-set-scam-porcelain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2010/03/watch-out-regent-china-are-com.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''English inventions and discoveries''' are objects, processes or techniques invented, innovated or discovered, partially or entirely, in [[England]] by a person from England (that is, someone born in England – including to non-English parents – or born abroad with at least one English parent and who had the majority of their education or career in England). Often, things [[Discovery (observation)|discovered]] for the first time are also called inventions and in many cases, there is no clear line between the two.

The following is a list of inventions, innovations or discoveries known or generally recognised to be English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">'''Micro process engineering''' is the science of conducting chemical or
physical processes ([[unit operation]]s) inside small volumina,
typically inside channels with diameters of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm
(microchannels) or other structures with sub-millimeter dimensions.  
These processes are usually carried out in continuous
flow mode, as opposed to [[batch production]], allowing a throughput
high enough to make micro process engineering a tool for chemical
production. Micro process engineering is therefore not to be confused
with microchemistry, which deals with very small overall quantities of
matter.

The subfield of micro process engineering that deals with chemical
reactions, carried out in microstructured reactors or
"[[microreactor]]s", is also known as
'''microreaction technology'''.

The unique advantages of microstructured reactors or ''[[microreactor]]s'' are [[enhanced heat transfer]] due to the large surface [[area-to-volume ratio]], and enhanced
[[mass transfer]]. For example, the length scale of [[diffusion]]
processes is comparable to that of microchannels or even shorter, and efficient mixing
of [[reactant]]s can be achieved during very short times (typically
milliseconds). The good heat transfer properties allow a precise
temperature control of reactions. For example, highly 
[[exothermic reaction]]s 
can be conducted almost [[isothermal]]ly when the
microstructured reactor contains a second set of microchannels ("cooling
passage"), fluidically separated from the reaction channels ("reaction
passage"), through which a flow of cold fluid with sufficiently high
[[heat capacity]] is maintained. It is also possible to change the temperature of
microstructured reactors very rapidly to intentionally achieve a non-isothermal behaviour.

==Process intensification==

While the dimensions of the individual channels are small, a micro
process engineering device ("microstructured reactor") can contain many
thousands of such channels, and the overall size of a microstructured
reactor can be on the scale of meters. The objective of micro process
engineering is not primarily to miniaturize production plants,
but to increase [[Yield (chemistry)|yields]] and selectivities of chemical reactions, thus
reducing the cost of chemical production. This goal can be achieved by
either using chemical reactions that cannot be conducted in larger
volumina, or by running chemical reactions at parameters (temperatures,
pressures, concentrations) that are inaccessible in larger volumina due
to safety constraints. For example, the detonation of the
[[stoichiometric]] mixture of two volume unit of [[hydrogen]] gas and
one volume unit of [[oxygen]] gas does not propagate in microchannels
with a sufficiently small diameter. This property is referred to as the
"[[intrinsic safety]]" of microstructured reactors. The improvement of yields
and selectivities by using novel reactions or running reactions at more
extreme parameters is known as "process intensification".

==History==

Historically, micro process engineering originated around the 1980s,
when mechanical micromachining methods developed for the fabrication of
[[uranium]] [[isotope separation]] nozzles were first applied to the
manufacturing of compact [[heat exchanger]]s at the 
[[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe (Nuclear) Research Center]].

'''''Moustapha Alassane, cinéaste du possible''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]].

== Synopsis ==
[[Moustapha Alassane]] is a living legend in [[African cinema]]. His adventures take us to the era of "pre-cinema", to the times of magical lantern and Chinese shadows. He is the first director of [[Nigerien cinema]] and animation films in Africa. He tells very old stories with current technology, but he also narrates the most current events with the most archaic means. This documentary not only tells the adventure of a human being and an extraordinary professional, but the memories of a generation, the history of a country, [[Niger]] in its golden age of cinema.&lt;ref name="de Bussy"&gt;{{cite news|last=de Bussy|first=Arthur|title=" Moustapha Alassane, Cinéaste du Possible " de Maria Silvia Bazzoli et Christian Lelong (2009)|url=http://artetpoiesis.blogspot.com/2010/12/moustapha-alassane-cineaste-du-possible.html|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=ART ET «POÏÈSIS»|date=28 December 2010|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multibanco in itself does not only encompass ATMs. It has a fully-fledged [[Electronic funds transfer|EFTPOS]] network called [[Multibanco Automatic Payment]], and is also a provider of mobile phone and Internet banking services through the [[TeleMultibanco]] and [[MBNet]] services respectively. It is also the provider of the [[Via Verde]] automated toll payment service.

==History==
[[File:Cax aut1.jpg|thumb|180px|Multibanco's old logo (1985–2008).]]
The Caixa Automático Multibanco (Multibanco ATM) was the first project developed by SIBS and started operating on September 2, 1985, with the installation of 12 terminals in the cities of [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=43&amp;type=0|title=Multibanco: ATM Network|accessdate= 2006-12-19|publisher = SIBS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003221314/http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=43&amp;type=0 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the network had 3,745 ATMs; in 2006 had more than 11,200; and as of December 2014 it had 12,700, on which an average of more than 75 million operations are made every month.&lt;ref name = "2015report"&gt;https://mbway.azurewebsites.net/sibsfps/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/08/SIBS_Market_Report_JUL2015.pdf#page=9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Multibanco is known for having more functionality than standard ATMs in other countries.&lt;ref name="manyfunc"/&gt; Initially, the machines only offered withdrawal of cash, checking of balances and checking of recent transactions. Later, features such as service and shopping payments, [[Prepaid mobile phone]] top-up and show ticket sales, among others, were introduced. Nowadays, 60 different services are offered by the Multibanco network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=135&amp;type=0|title= ATM Network: Operations|accessdate= 2006-12-19|publisher = SIBS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003222419/http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=135&amp;type=0 |archivedate = 2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
From 2001 to 2005, the average number of transactions&lt;ref name="transactions"&gt;Includes cash withdrawals, deposits, account and transfers checking, payments and "other operations"&lt;/ref&gt; by year is over 630 million. The number has been rising every year; 719 million were recorded in 2005. This has since grown substantially, with 900 million operations recorded in 2014.&lt;ref name = "2015report" /&gt;

==Security==
Multibanco allows users with a local (Portuguese) bank account to withdraw a maximum of 400 [[Euro]]s daily (holders of foreign accounts can withdraw more, depending on their bank). If the user fails to enter the correct [[Personal identification number|PIN]] after three attempts, the ATM will not return the card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=148&amp;type=0|title= ATM Network: Userful Information|accessdate= 2006-12-19|publisher = SIBS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003222427/http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=148&amp;type=0 |archivedate = 2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the user fails to take the money out of the ATM after a certain period of time, the ATM takes back the cash to prevent theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=151&amp;type=6#p3|title= ATM Network: FAQs|accessdate= 2006-12-19|publisher = SIBS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003222337/http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=151&amp;type=6#p3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent security measure has been introduced under the form of a tinting mechanism that releases ink and stains the money in the event of forced opening of the ATM. When in possession of a tinted bill, one must report it to the police (for further investigation, as it is likely to be from a stolen ATM) and can later have it traded at a bank for a non-tinted one, without additional charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clientebancario.com/2009/01/posse-de-notas-tintadas.html|title= Clientebancario.com - posse de notas tintadas}} ''(Portuguese)''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to security cameras, many ATM terminals include a rear-view mirror above the interactive screen, and the money withdrawal slot is located at approximately waist-level, for quick and more secluded storage of the money.

==Other Multibanco Services==

===Pagamento Automático MB (Automatic Payment)===
The Multibanco Automatic Payment is an [[EFTPOS]] network which began operating in 1987. It allows electronic payments made at the point of sale, through the use of a system accepted card. Therefore, this service allows real time payments protected with security measures, with 266,000 such terminals on the network as of 2014.&lt;ref name = "2015report" /&gt; In 2014, 781 million payments were made using this system.&lt;ref name = "2015report" /&gt;

===MB PHONE===
MB PHONE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/pt/mb/prodserv/mbphone/|title= SIBS: MB PHONE|accessdate= 2010-07-07|publisher = SIBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched as TeleMultibanco in 1996 and rebranded to the current designation in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sic.sapo.pt/online/arquivo/2008/6/dinheiro/1/2008060+Renovacao+do+Multibanco.htm|title=SIC Online: Nova imagem e mais serviços|accessdate= 2010-07-07|publisher = SIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows its users to check their account balance and transactions, make transfers, service and shopping payments, and request [[cheque]] books through their mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/pt/mb/prodserv/mbphone/operacoes/|title= SIBS: Operações MB PHONE|accessdate= 2010-07-07|publisher = SIBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, around 3 million transactions&lt;ref name="transactions"/&gt; were made by the 300,000 mobile phone clients using this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/pt/mb/prodserv/mbphone/estatisticas/|title= SIBS: Estatísticas MB PHONE|accessdate= 2007-07-07|publisher = SIBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MB NET===
MB NET allows users to make payments through the [[Internet]] and it is set up for online shopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/pt/mb/prodserv/mbnet/|title= SIBS: MB NET|accessdate= 2007-07-07|publisher = SIBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1 million payments were made using MB NET in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/pt/mb/prodserv/mbnet/estatisticas/|title= SIBS: Estatísticas MB NET|accessdate= 2007-07-07|publisher = SIBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MB NET allows the creation of virtual credit cards to be used online. Depending on the card system, one will get an [[American Express]], [[VISA]] or [[MasterCard]] virtual card. For example, if the card is a VISA or [[Visa Electron]] then the generated cards by MB NET are VISAs. This system is compatible with most payment systems, including PayPal and all places that accept credit cards as payment.

To generate a virtual credit card one must login to the MB NET site and enter a limit. Then the site instantly gives the [[Payment card number|credit card number]] and security codes (CVC2 and CVV2) to pay for your online purchase.  The number is also valid for offline purchases. The virtual cards allow for normal credit card interactions; either payment or crediting the holder's account. There are two types of virtual card—one for one-time use, and one meant for multiple uses.

All cards are given a usable lifetime of between 1 and 12 months. More specifically, they are valid until the end of the month following the one when it is requested/issued. The great advantage of MB NET is that the customer's real payment details are never known to the vendor and the card's limit can be set according to the purchase's value. Even if a vendor or a hacker tries to extort a higher amount, the defined limit prevents it. Shopping online is hence made safer.

Registration to use MB NET is required. To do so, one must go to a Multibanco ATM or one's [[home banking]] website (if the bank allows that operation on such a medium). The client sets a password but the username is given by the system. Registration links the MB NET service to a debit or credit card of one of the SIBS associated banking institutions that support it.

===Via Verde and Host to Host===
The automated toll payment service [[Via Verde]] is also operated by SIBS. Host to Host is the name given to the system that allows users to perform ATM transactions&lt;ref name="transactions"/&gt; through their own bank site, enabling [[online banking]] which has been active since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=157&amp;type=0|title= Multibanco: Others|accessdate= 2006-12-19|publisher = SIBS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003222245/http://www.sibs.pt/en/conteudo.php?id=157&amp;type=0 |archivedate = 2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17362">The '''NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer''' ('''NRCSD''') is a device to deploy [[CubeSat]]s into orbit from the [[International Space Station]].

Currently,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- as of when? --&gt; there are two [[CubeSat]] deployers on board the [[International Space Station]] (ISS): The [[Japanese Experiment Module]] (JEM) Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD) and the [[NanoRacks]] CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD). The J-SSOD is the first of its kind to deploy small satellites from the [[International Space Station]]. The NRCSD is the first commercially operated small satellite deployer from the ISS, maximizing full capabilities of each airlock cycle{{clarify|date=December 2014}} of deployments.

CubeSats belong to a class of research spacecraft called [[nanosatellite]]s. The basic cube-shaped satellites measure {{convert|10|cm|sp=us}} on each side, weigh less than {{convert|3|lb}}, and have a volume of about {{convert|1|litre|sp=us}}, although CubeSats are built, and deployed, that are multiples of 10&amp;nbsp;cm in length.

{{asof|2014}}, one method of getting CubeSats to [[low-Earth orbit|orbit]] is to [[space transport|transport]] them aboard a larger spacecraft as part of [[Automated cargo spacecraft|a cargo load]] to a larger [[space station]].  When this is done, deploying the CubeSats into orbit as a separate [[artificial satellite]] requires a special apparatus, such as the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer. The NRCSD is put into position to be grabbed by one of the ISS's robotic arms, which then places the CubeSat deployer into the correct position externally mounted to the ISS to be able to release the miniature satellites into proper orbit.

==Background==
The [[International Space Station]] was designed to be used as both a microgravity laboratory, as well as a launch pad for low-Earth-orbit services. The Japanese Space Agency's ([[JAXA]]) [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo]] ISS module includes a small satellite-deployment system called the J-SSOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/j_ssod.html|title=CubeSats in Orbit After Historic Space Station Deployment|publisher=Nasa.gov|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NanoRacks]], via its Space Act Agreement with [[NASA]], deployed a CubeSat using the J-SSOD. Seeing the emerging market demand for CubeSats, NanoRacks self-funded its own ISS deployer, with the permission of both NASA and JAXA. NanoRacks evolved away from the J-SSOD due to the small number of satellites that could be deployed in one airlock cycle and their desire to maximize the capacity of each airlock cycle. The J-SSOD used a full airlock cycle to only launch 6U. The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer uses two airlock cycles, each holding 8 deployers. Each deployer is capable of holding 6U, allowing a total of 48U per airlock cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanoracks.com/products/smallsat-deployment/|title=Small Satellite Deployment from ISS - CubeSat. Smallsat Launches|publisher=Nanoracks.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2014}}

Deploying CubeSats from ISS has a number of benefits. Launching the vehicles aboard the logistics carrier of ISS visiting vehicle reduces the vibration and loads they have to encounter during launch. In addition, they can be packed in protective materials so that the probability of CubeSat damage during launch is reduced significantly. In addition, for earth observation satellites, such as those of [[Planet Labs]], the lower orbit of the ISS orbit, at roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km, is an advantage.  In addition, the lower orbit allows a natural decay of the satellites, thus reducing the build-up of orbital debris.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==History==

===JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer===
The Japanese Experiment Module Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD) is the first of its kind to deploy small satellites from the International Space Station. The facility provides a unique satellite install case to the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Remote Manipulator System (RMS) for deploying small, CubeSat, satellites from the ISS.&lt;ref name="JAXA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/jssod|title=J-SSOD:Experiment - International Space Station - JAXA|author=JAXA|publisher=Iss.jaxa.jp|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The J-SSOD holds up to 3 small one-unit (1U, 10 x 10 x 10 centimeters) small CubeSats per satellite install case, 6 in total, though other sizes up to 55 x 55 x 35&amp;nbsp;cm may also be used. Each pre-packed satellite install case is loaded by crewmembers onto the Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform (MPEP) within the JEM habitable volume.&lt;ref name="JAXA"/&gt; The MPEP platform is then attached to the JEM Slide Table inside the JEM airlock for transfer to the JEMRMS and space environment. The JEMRMS grapples and maneuvers the MPEP and J-SSOD to a predefined deployment orientation and then jettisons the small CubeSat satellites.&lt;ref name="JAXA"/&gt;

The MPEP is a platform that acts as an interface between operations inside and outside the ISS, and the J-SSOD mechanism is installed on this platform. On July 21, 2012, JAXA launched the [[Kounotori 3]] (HTV-3) cargo spacecraft to the ISS on [[Expedition 33]]. The J-SSOD was a payload on this flight along with five CubeSats that were planned to be deployed by the J-SSOD mounted on the JEMRMS (JEM- Remote Manipulator System), a robotic arm, later in 2012. The five CubeSats were deployed successfully on Oct. 4, 2012 by the JAXA astronaut [[Akihiko Hoshide]] using the newly installed J-SSOD. This represented the first deployment service of J-SSOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/j_ssod.html|title=NASA - CubeSats in Orbit After Historic Space Station Deployment|publisher=Nasa.gov|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer development===
In October 2013, NanoRacks became the first company to coordinate the deployment of small satellites (CubeSats/nanosatellites) from the ISS via the airlock in the Japanese KIBO module. This deployment was done by NanoRacks using J-SSOD. NanoRacks' first customer was FPT University of Hanoi, Vietnam. Their [[F-1 (satellite)|F-1]] [[CubeSat]] was developed by young engineers and students at FSpace laboratory at FPT University of Hanoi. The mission of F-1 was to "survive" the space environment for one month, measuring temperature and magnetic data while taking low-resolution photos of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kuoa/news/kuoa_120921.html|title=F-1 and companion CubeSats to be deployed to space from Kibo module on September 27:Kibo Utilization Office for Asia (KUOA) - International Space Station - JAXA|author=JAXA|publisher=Iss.jaxa.jp|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, NanoRacks sought permission from NASA to develop their own hardware and CubeSat/SmallSat deployer to use over the JEM- Small Satellite Deployer. NanoRacks brought leadership to the American small satellite industry by building a larger deployer capable of deploying 48U of satellites. NanoRacks designed, manufactured, and tested the deployer for NASA and JAXA approval to reach the International Space Station.

The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer was launched on January 9, 2014, on the [[Orbital Sciences]] [[Cygnus CRS Orb-1]] mission along with 33 small satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2014/01/09/spaceflight-nanoracks-team-cubesat-launches/|title=Spaceflight, NanoRacks Team Up on CubeSat Launches at Parabolic Arc|publisher=Parabolicarc.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NRCSD technical details==
The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) is a self-contained CubeSat deployer system that mechanically and electrically isolates CubeSats from the ISS, cargo resupply vehicles, and ISS crew. The NRCSD design is compliant with NASA ISS flight safety requirements and is space-qualified.&lt;ref name="Nanoracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanoracks.com/wp-content/uploads/Current_edition_of_Interface_Document_for_CubeSat_Customers.pdf|format=PDF|title=NanoRacks Interface Document for NRCSD|publisher=Nanoracks.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRCSD is a rectangular tube that consists of anodized aluminum plates, base-plate assembly, access panels, and deployer doors. The NRCSD deployer doors are located on the forward end, the base-plate assembly is located on the aft end, and access panels are provided on the top.&lt;ref name="Nanoracks"/&gt; The inside walls of the NRCSD are a smooth-bore design to minimize and/or preclude hang-up or jamming of CubeSat appendages during deployment, should these become released prematurely. However, deployable systems shall be designed such that there is no intentional contact with the inside walls of the NRCSD.&lt;ref name="Nanoracks"/&gt;

For a deployment, the platform is moved outside via the Kibo Module's Airlock and slide table that allows the JEMRMS to move the deployers to the correct orientation for the satellite release and also provides command and control to the deployers. Each NRCSD (NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer) is capable of holding six CubeSat Units, allowing it to launch two 3U satellites or a number of 2U and 1U satellites.

==Manufacturing the NRCSD==
Quad-M, Inc. developed the CubeSat Deployer to be compliant with the Cal Poly standard.  It was redesigned and manufactured to NanoRacks' specification for use on the International Space Station.

Quad-M performed an initial design analysis to ensure a compliant design. The structural analysis included a modal analysis to evaluate vibration response, and the thermal analysis included calculations to evaluate different door coating options and an initial transient thermal analysis to estimate. In addition, Quad-M performed development tests for: the door release, the CSD/CubeSat Deployment test, random vibration test, and temperature cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quadminc.com/|title=QUADM CNC Machine Shop, manufacturing and engineering services|work=Quad-M, Inc.|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission profile==

===Integrating the CubeSats===
CubeSat integration begins with unpacking the CSD from the shipping container and then removing the Base Plate Assembly from the rear of the CSD. Next, the CubeSat is inserted from the rear and is slid up snug against the doors. Additional CubeSats are then inserted from the rear in the same progress. The Base Plate Assembly is then reinstalled. Four jack screws are then adjusted with the Pusher Plate and locked. The Containment Bolt is then removed, and the deployer is packed for shipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1534">The '''Open Forum of Cambodia''' ('''OFC''') was formed in 1994 and is a not-for-profit organisation that aims to promote dialogue in Cambodian society.

It provided the first e-mail service in the country in 1994 to encourage dialogue and address social concerns. Its programme includes paper-based publications, in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[English language|English]] which   [https://web.archive.org/web/20070115234032/http://www.forum.org.kh/ according to its website] included until January 2007 the editorialized weekly overview of all local newspapers reflecting the diverse points of views on political and social issues; electronic communication." It also promoted its website, and advocacy through research. OFC has also played an important role in the localisation of [[Free Software]] into the [[Khmer language|Khmer]] language.

OFC's [[Nobert Klein]] edited a weekly press review of the [[Khmer language|Cambodian]] language press in [[English language|English]] for 10 years. It was a 16-page publication. OFC has faced a funding crunch in recent months.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7009">The '''Orkney Wireless Museum''' in [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]], Scotland, houses a collection of domestic and military wireless equipment. It developed from the private collection of the late Jim MacDonald from [[St Margaret's Hope]] and marks the importance of wireless communications in Orkney during [[World War II]].

==Museum==
The Orkney Wireless Museum is located at Kiln Corner, [[Kirkwall]] in [[Orkney]] and is run on an entirely voluntary basis. It is registered as a Charitable Company. The Friends of the museum, from all over the world, help raise funds for the museum. The local branch of the society organises volunteers to man the Museum every day of the season, from April to September.

The displays and photographic archive bear testament to the strategic and military importance of Orkney during [[World War II]]. In the collection there is much reference to the [[Home Fleet]] in [[Scapa Flow]], Orkney. The museum demonstrates the importance of wireless communications and Radar to the civilian and military populations.

The Amateur Radio call sign GB2OWM is frequently activated at the museum. During the [[Orkney Science Festival]] every September, worldwide contacts are made and [[QSL cards]] are subsequently exchanged with the stations contacted.

==Exhibits==
[[File:Ardent hearing aid.JPG|thumb|Ardent hearing aid]]
The museum has an extensive collection of early domestic radio and wartime communications equipment. Most of the equipment was built in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[United States|USA]]. The museum also houses early advertising and posters. An archive of photographs depicts wartime forces and includes coverage of the building of the [[Churchill Barriers]] which were built primarily as naval defences to protect the anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]].

Some examples of exhibits:

* No. 19 Tank Set
* early recording equipment e.g. The Recordon dictating machine made by [[Thermionic Products Ltd]] of England - features a flat, magnetically coated paper disk.
* example of 1930s Ardent hearing aid
* a working crystal set (made about 1912) with the crystal/[[cat's whisker]] detector clearly visible.  Visitors may put the headphones on and listen to BBC Radio Scotland.
* original Scapa Flow boom defence chart
* [[U-boat]] radio
* spy Suitcase Radio
* radios used as [[Y-stations]] by Y-service operators
* photographic archive of life in "Fortress Orkney"
* domestic wireless receivers made in the USA by companies such as [[Emerson Radio]], [[Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation|Weston]], [[Philco]]
* wireless receivers made in the UK by companies such as [[EKCO]].

==Museum History==
Jim MacDonald had a love of wireless sets and gathered an extensive and varied collection of domestic and military wireless equipment. The Museum was founded in 1983 when he was persuaded to display his collection in what he called "An Orkney Wireless Museum" in the family home in [[St Margaret's Hope]], [[South Ronaldsay]]. After he died of cancer in 1988, his family carried out his wishes to develop the museum.
 
In June 1990 a registered family Trust was set up to run the museum. In 1994, the Museum was admitted as a member of the [[Museums and Galleries Commission]] of Great Britain. The Museum was awarded a Certificate from the [[Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society]] "For work in collecting, preserving and displaying the radio and electronic heritage of Scapa Flow and the Orkney Isles"

In 1997, the collection moved to Kiln Corner, [[Kirkwall]] which allowed a greater number of exhibits to be displayed. The Museum has received many financial donations.

==Founder==
James "Jim" MacDonald (1927 - 1988) was born and brought up on South Ronaldsay.&lt;ref name="owm"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.orkneywirelessmuseum.org.uk/| title=Orkney Wireless Museum| publisher=Orkney Wireless Museum| accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was locally educated and served his apprenticeship as an electrician and radio repairman. During his boyhood, wireless was rapidly developing and he started to gather old, interesting sets which were becoming redundant. This became the nucleus for his collection which includes such rare and interesting examples as "Kit Sets" and the very, very expensive models by such famous names as Marconi, [[Cossor]], MacMichael, K.B., Lowe and [[Amplion]].&lt;ref name="owm"/&gt;

With the outbreak of war in 1939, he was listed as in a reserved occupation, and worked for the War Office as a civilian in the great Naval Base at [[Lyness]]. He was also employed at other [[RAF]] sites such as [[Netherbutton]], with one of the world's first active operational [[Radar]] installations. (This was actually the prototype, modified, which was shipped from [[England]], as the one being built for [[Orkney]] was not nearly ready. When Orkney's was finished, it was sent to [[Dover]] where it was to play such a vital role in the [[Battle of Britain]]).&lt;ref name="owm"/&gt;

After the war, Jim collected as many examples of relevant equipment as he could; many operations were still classified as Top Secret. Another problem to collection was that equipment was deliberately destroyed in order to prevent flooding the market with surplus goods (as had happened after the [[First World War]]). The collected equipment had played a vital part in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] and North Sea, and has all seen active service.&lt;ref name="owm"/&gt;

A '''pedalboard''' (also called a '''pedal keyboard, pedal clavier''', or, with electronic instruments, a '''bass pedalboard'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondorgan.co.uk/bass.htm|title=Hammond XPK100 MIDI Bass Pedals|author=|date=|website=www.hammondorgan.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719080145/http://www.hammondorgan.co.uk/bass.htm|archivedate=19 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] played with the feet that is usually used to produce the low-pitched [[bass line]] of a piece of music. A pedalboard has long, narrow lever-style keys laid out in the same semitone scalar pattern as a [[Musical keyboard|manual keyboard]], with longer keys for C, D, E, F, G, A and B, and shorter, higher keys for C{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}}, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}. Training in pedal technique is part of standard organ pedagogy in church music and art music.

Pedalboards are found at the base of the [[organ console|console]] of most [[pipe organ]]s, [[theatre organ]]s, and [[electronic organ]]s. Standalone pedalboards such as the 1970s-era [[Moog Taurus]] [[bass pedals]] are occasionally used in [[progressive rock]] and [[fusion jazz|fusion]] music. In the 21st century, [[MIDI]] pedalboard controllers are used with synthesizers, [[Clonewheel organ|electronic Hammond-style organs]], and with digital pipe organs. Pedalboards are also used with [[pedal piano]]s and with some [[harpsichord]]s, [[clavichord]]s, and [[carillon]]s (church bells).

==History==

===13th century to 16th century===

The first use of pedals on a [[pipe organ]] grew out of the need to hold bass drone notes, to support the polyphonic musical styles that predominated in the Renaissance. Indeed, the term [[pedal point]], which refers to a prolonged bass tone under changing upper harmonies, derives from the use of the organ pedalboard to hold sustained bass notes.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. "Pedal point"&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest pedals were wooden stubs nicknamed ''mushrooms'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;The Organ: An Encyclopedia. Douglas Earl Rush and Richard Kassel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While the term "mushroom" may seem unusual to English speakers, in French, the term "champignon" (mushroom) also refers to pedals, such as the accelerator pedal in a car.&lt;/ref&gt; which were placed at the height of the feet. These pedals, which used simple pull-downs connected directly to the manual keys, are found in organs dating to the 13th century. The pedals on French organs were composed of short stubs of wood projecting out of the floor, which were mounted in pedalboards that could be either flat or tilted. Organists were unable to play anything but simple bass lines or slow-moving [[plainsong]] melodies on these short stub-type pedals. Organist [[E. Power Biggs]], in the liner notes for his album ''Organs of Spain'' noted that "One can learn to play them, but fluent pedal work is impossible".

[[File:ShortOctaveOnC.svg|thumb|left|150 px|A diagram of one type of "short octave" as used on a manual keyboard; while this exact layout was not used on pedalboards, it shows the different note layouts that were used on some instruments]]

There were two approaches used for the [[accidental (music)|accidental]] notes (colloquially referred to as the "black" notes). The first approach can be seen in the 1361 Halberstadt organ, which uses shorter black keys placed above the white keys. Other organs positioned the black keys on the same level and depth as the white keys. The first pedal keyboards only had three or four notes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Eventually, organ designers augmented this range by using eight notes, an approach now called a "short octave" keyboard, because it does not include accidental notes such as C{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}}, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, and A{{music|sharp}}.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The 17th-century north German organ builder [[Arp Schnitger]] used an F{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} in the lowest octave of the manuals and pedal keyboards, but not a C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|sharp}}. From the 16th to 18th centuries, short octave keyboards were also used in the lowest octave of upper manual keyboards.

By the 14th century, organ designers were building separate windchests for the pedal division, to supply the pipes with the large amount of wind that bass notes need to speak. These windchests were often built into tall structures called "organ towers". Until the 15th century, most pedal keyboards only triggered the existing Hauptwerk pipes already used by the upper manual keyboards. Beginning in the 15th century, some organ designers began giving pedal keyboards their own set of pipes and stops. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the pedal division usually consisted of a few 8′ ranks and a single 16′ rank. By the early 17th century, pedal divisions became more complex, with a richer variety of pipes and tones. Nevertheless, the pedal division was usually inconsistent from one country to another.

===17th century to 18th century===
[[File:Zeil Kirche Chororgel Spieltisch.jpg|thumb|left|This 1609 organ shows the short, button-style pedals of early pedal setups]]
By the beginning of the 17th century, organ designers began to give pedalboards on large organs a larger range, encompassing twenty-eight to thirty notes. As well, German organ designers began to use longer, narrower pedals, with a wider space between the pedals. By this point, most pedals were given a smoother lever-action by including a fulcrum at the back of each pedal. These design changes allowed performers to play more complex, fast-moving pedal lines. This gave rise to the dramatic pedal solos found in German organ works from composers from the Lutheran Organ School, such as [[J.S. Bach]]. In Bach's organ music the [[cantus firmus]] melody, which is usually a [[hymn tune]], is often performed in the pedal, using a reed stop to make it stand out.

Several sources, including an encyclopedia on the organ, claim that the pedalboard design improvements of the 17th century allowed the organist to actuate the pedals either with the toe of the foot or with the heel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, organist [[Ton Koopman]] argues that
"Bach's complete oeuvre [can be played] with the pedal technique of his time, in other words without the use of the heel." Koopman claims that in "Bach's day toe and heel pedalling was not yet known, as is evident from his organ works, in which all the pedal parts can be played with the toe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonkoopman.nl/vol12organ.htm|title=With Heart and Mind - Ton Koopman|author=|date=1 October 2006|website=archive.org|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001120849/http://www.tonkoopman.nl/vol12organ.htm|archivedate=1 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What evolved as "German" pedal technique in the late 18th and early 19th century promoted heel-and-toe pedaling, while the "French" style was predicated on "toe only" pedal technique.
[[File:OrganumFollis.jpg|thumb|300px|This 1776 diagram depicts the setup of the manuals and pedal keyboard]]
In the 17th and 18th century, pedalboards were rare in England. A critic for the ''New York Times'' in 1895 argued that this may explain why Handel's published organ works are generally lighter-sounding than those of J.S. Bach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/05/26/102458626.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=The Organ in Bach's Time | date=1895-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries, the pedal part of organ music was rarely given its own staff. Instead, the organ part would be put into two staves, which were mostly used for the upper and lower manual parts. When the composer wanted a part played with the pedal keyboard, they marked ''Pedal'', ''Ped.'', or simply ''P''. Often, composers omitted these signs, and player had to decide if the range of all the parts or the lowest part was appropriate for the pedal keyboard.&lt;ref name="www-scf.usc.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~eunjeonp/contents%204.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708223000/http://www-scf.usc.edu/~eunjeonp/contents%204.htm |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of specification is in keeping with many other aspects of Baroque musical [[performance practice]], such as the use of improvised chords by organists and harpsichord players in the [[figured bass]] tradition and the use of improvised ornaments by solo singers and instrumentalists.

===19th century to 20th century===

In the late 1820s, the pedalboard was still fairly unfamiliar in the UK. In the organ at the Church of St James at Bermondsey in 1829, "a finger [manual] keyboard was added for those unable to play with their feet." If an organist was performing a piece with a pedal part, "an assistant was needed to play the bottom line of the finger keyboard, offset on the bass side of the console." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/stjamesorgan/stjamesorgan.htm|title=The Restoration of the 1829 Organ at St James', Bermondsey, London|author=|date=|website=www.buildingconservation.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821181859/http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/stjamesorgan/stjamesorgan.htm|archivedate=21 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 in England, Henry Willis patented a concave design for the pedalboard that also radiated the ends keyboard outward and used longer keys, bringing the end keys closer to the performer. This design became common in the UK and in the US in the late 19th century, and by 1903, the [[American Guild of Organists]] (AGO) adopted it as their standard.

In the 19th century and early 20th century, the pedal division also underwent changes. The pedal divisions of the Baroque era often included a small number of higher-pitched stops, which allowed performers to perform higher melodies on the pedalboard. In the 19th century and early 20th century, organ designers omitted most of these higher-pitched stops, and used pedal divisions which were dominated by 8′ and 16′ stops. This design change, which coincided with the musical trend for music with a deep, rich bass part, meant that players used the pedalboard mainly for bass parts.

By the mid-19th century, the pedal part of organ music was increasingly given its own staff, which meant that composers and transcribers began writing organ music in three-stave systems (upper manual, lower manual, and pedal keyboard).&lt;ref name="www-scf.usc.edu"/&gt; Whereas early organ composers left the way that pedal keyboard lines were played to the player's discretion, in the later 19th century, composers began to indicate specific foot actions.

In addition to telling the organist whether to use the left or right foot, symbols indicate whether they should use the toe or heel. A "^" symbol indicates the toe, and a "u" or "o" indicates the heel.  Symbols below notes indicate the left foot, and above notes indicates the right foot.

Swedish organist L. Nilson published a method for the pedal keyboard, the English translation of which was titled ''A System of Technical Studies in Pedal Playing for the Organ'' (Schirmer, 1904). Nilson lamented that it "...is a melancholy fact that only very few eminent organists since Bach's time have made it their business to lift pedal-playing out of its primitive confusion..." (page 1 of Preface). He argued that the great organ pedagogues such as Kittel and Abbe Vogler did not make any efforts to improve the "...system of playing on the pedals". Nilson makes one exception from this critique: the organ method of J. Lemmens, who he praises as having reformed pedal playing by introducing "...sound principles of execution" (page 2 of Preface). Nilson's pedal method includes scale and arpeggio studies, polyphonic studies with both feet playing in contrary motion, studies written in parallel octaves, and studies written in thirds.

===1990s–2000s===

In the 1990s, standalone electronic [[MIDI controller]] pedalboards became widely available on the market. MIDI pedalboards do not produce any tones by themselves, and so they must be connected to a MIDI-compatible electronic keyboard or MIDI sound module and an amplified loudspeaker to produce musical tones. In the 1990s and 21st century, some churches{{Which|date=August 2011}} began using electronic-trigger equipped pedalboards for the 16′ and 32′ stops. The MIDI information from the electronic pedalboard sensors triggers pipe organ sounds from digital sound modules (e.g., Wicks CM-100, Ahlborn Archive Modules, or Walker Technical sound generation),{{Citation needed|reason=June2009|date=June 2009}} which are then amplified through loudspeakers.

These MIDI systems can be much less expensive than metal or wooden bass pipes, which are very costly to purchase and install, due to their heavy weight (up to one ton per pipe), large size, and need for large amounts of wind. Another rationale for using MIDI systems is that it may be easier to get a focused sound with a MIDI system, because all of the bass tone emanates from a single speaker or set of speakers. With traditional pipes, it can be difficult to give the pedal division a focused sound, because the large pipes tend to be spread out over the entire organ pipe chest.

This cost-saving measure has been the subject of controversy in the organ scene. Advocates of MIDI pedal divisions{{Who|date=August 2011}} argue that a good quality MIDI system produces a better tone than an inexpensive set of bass pipes with money-saving "shortcuts" such as using stopped pipes and [[Resultant (organ)|resultant]] tones to reduce the number of required pipes. However, critics{{Who|date=August 2011}} dislike the way that the use of MIDI pedal divisions blends electronically amplified lower voices with the natural, wind-driven upper ranks. Willi Apel and Peter Williams argue that by definition, an organ must make its sound by air flowing through pipes. Some critics{{Who|date=August 2011}} argue that the bass tone from a MIDI pedal division, which comes from an amplified 12-inch [[subwoofer]], is not as "natural" and "open-sounding" as the vibrations from a massive, wind-driven 32-foot pipe.

==Design==

===Keyboards===

Pedalboards range in size from 13 notes on small spinet organs designed for in-home use (an octave, conventionally [[Scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]–C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to 32 notes (two and a half octaves, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) on church or concert organs. Modern pipe organs typically have 30- or 32-note pedalboards, while some electronic organs and many older pipe organs have 25-note pedalboards.

Besides the number of pedals, the two main identifying aspects of a pedalboard are:
#whether all the pedals are at the same height relative to the floor ("flat"), or whether the pedals in the middle are lower than those on the outer edges, forming a curved-in shape ("concave"), and
#whether all the pedals are completely parallel to each other ("parallel"), or whether the pedals are closer together at the far end than at the end closest to the organ console ("radiating"). Specifications vary by country, organ builder, era, and individual tastes.

Exact design specifications for pedalboards are published in [[Great Britain]] by the [[Royal College of Organists|RCO]], in the [[United States]] by the [[American Guild of Organists|AGO]] (which requires a design similar to the RCO's), and in [[Germany]] by the [[Bund Deutscher Orgelbaumeister|BDO]] (which allows both 30- and 32-note pedalboards, of both concave/radiating and concave/parallel varieties).

===Pedal division===

In an organ with more than one keyboard, the stops and the ranks that the stops control are separated into different divisions, in which the ranks of pipes are grouped together so that they make a "focused" or coherent sound. The pedal division, which is played from the pedal keyboard, usually includes more stops of 16′ pitch. The sound of the pedal division is generally voiced so that the pedal division complements the sound of the great division. Common 16′ stops found in the pedal division include the 16′ Bourdon, the 16′ Principal, and the 16′ Trombone. Eight foot stops include the 8′ Open Diapason. Pedal divisions may also include higher-register stops, such as the 4′ Choral Bass or various mixtures. When pedal parts are performed, a 16′ stop is usually paired with an 8′ one to provide more definition. For pedal parts that need accentuation, such as the Cantus Firmus melody in a 17th-century organ piece, many organs have a nasal-sounding reed stop in the pedal division, or a 4′ Principal designated on the stop knob as "Choralbass".

A few pedalboards have a pedal divide system that lets the organist split the pedalboard at its midpoint. With this system, an organist can play a melody with the right foot and a bass part with the left.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The divided pedal is a type of coupler. It allows the sounds played on the pedals to be split, so the lower octave (principally that of the left foot) plays stops from the pedal division while the upper half (played by the right foot), plays stops from one of the manual divisions. The choice of manual is at the discretion of the performer, as is the 'split point' of the system.

The system can be found on the organs of [[Gloucester Cathedral]], having been added by [[Nicholson &amp; Co Ltd|Nicholson &amp; Co (Worcester) Ltd]]/[[David_Briggs_(English_musician)|David Briggs]] and [[Truro Cathedral]], having been added by [[Mander Organs]]/[[David_Briggs_(English_musician)|David Briggs]], as well as on the new nave console of [[Ripon Cathedral]]. The system as found in [[Truro Cathedral]] operates like this:

===Controls===

In some organs, a wooden panel called a "kickboard" or "kneeboard" is installed above the pedalboard, between the pedals and the lowest manual keyboard. Expression pedals, coupler controls and toe studs (to activate stops or stop combinations) may be located on or set into the kickboard. Expression pedals are used to open and close shades or shutters that enclose the pipes of a given division. Combination pistons are used to make rapid stop changes from the console on organs with electric stop action. Toe studs are pistons that can be operated by the feet, which change either the pedal stops or the entire organ.

In some organs, a "pedalboard check" mechanism serves as a safety catch, to shut off the pedalboard keys. The mechanism prevents accidental foot contact with the pedalboard from sounding notes in a section written only for the upper manuals.
[[File:Pedalierdorgue2.jpg|thumb|This photo of a BDO pedalboard shows the variety of other controls that are positioned near the pedalboard, including foot pistons and expression pedals.]]

===Repertoire===

The works of  [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[composer]], [[organist]], and [[pedagogue]]  [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]] (1562–1621) contain the earliest example of an independent part for the pedal, rather than a sustained bass drone. His work straddled the end of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras, and he helped establish the [[German organ schools|north German organ tradition]].

[[Dieterich Buxtehude]] (1637–1707), who was the most renowned composer of his time, was famous for his "...virtuosity and innovation at the pedal board." The young Johann Sebastian Bach was influenced by Buxtehude, who used the pedal board "as a full-fledged keyboard and devot[ed] virtuoso passages to it."{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[J.S. Bach]] used the pedal to perform the melody in works such as his setting of the Christmas hymn, [[In Dulci Jubilo]], in which the main theme in the tenor voice is played in the pedal on a higher-pitched stop. Bach also wrote compositions that use the pedal for dramatic virtuoso displays of scales and figurated passage-work in preludes, toccatas, fantasias and fugues.

There are a small number of organ compositions that are written solely for the pedal keyboard. English organist and composer [[George Thalben-Ball]] (1896–1987) wrote a piece entitled “Variations on a Theme by Paganini” for pedal keyboard. Based on [[Paganini]]'s “[[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|Caprice No. 24]]”, a virtuoso work for solo violin, it includes pedal [[glissandi]], leaps from one end of the pedalboard to the other, and four-note chords.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Firmin Swinnen]] (1885–1972) was a Belgian organist who became famous in the US in the 1920s for his [[theater organ]] improvisations during [[silent film]]s. Swinnen wrote a pedal cadenza for an arrangement of [[Charles-Marie Widor|Widor's]] ''[[Symphony for Organ No. 5 (Widor)|Fifth Symphony]]''. The cadenza was published separately by ''The American Organist''. The publisher promoted the cadenza it as the "most daring, the most musical Pedal Cadenza obtainable"; this praise is corroborated by reviewers who were at the performance, who remarked at the complex footwork required by the work.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The symphony was performed 29 times during the week of its premiere, to "...literally screaming audiences...who had never seen such a sight as an organist up on a lift [platform] in the spotlight playing with his feet alone".&lt;ref&gt;Rollin Smith. ''Stokowski and the Organ''. Pendragon Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the pedalboard is most frequently used for the bass part, composers from the 17th century to the present have often used it for higher parts as well. In his serene ''Le Banquet Céleste'' [[Olivier Messiaen]] places the tune, registered for 4′ flute (and higher mutation ranks), in the pedals.

From the early 20th century, composers have increasingly demanded an advanced pedal technique at the organ.  Performers display their virtuosity in such works as [[Wilhelm Middelschulte]]'s ''Perpetuum mobile'', [[Leo Sowerby]]'s ''Pageant'' (1931), and [[Jeanne Demessieux]]'s ''Six études'', Op. 5 (1944), which recall the dramatic organ pedal solos of the Baroque era.

===Use on instruments other than organs===

====Pedal harpsichord and clavichord====
[[File:Peter Watchorn pedal harpsichord.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter Watchorn]] plays a pedal harpsichord by Hubbard &amp; Broekman, Boston, 1990]]
Pedal keyboards were developed for the [[clavichord]] and [[harpsichord]]s during the Baroque era so that organists could practise the pedal parts of their organ repertoire when they had no-one available to work the [[bellows]] for a church organ or, in the wintertime, to avoid having to practice on a church organ in an unheated [[Church (building)|church]]. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] owned a pedal harpsichord and his organ trio sonatas BWV 525-530, [[BWV 582|Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor BWV 582]], [[BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D minor BWV 565]], and other works sound well when played on the instrument.

====Pedal piano====
[[Image:Pedal Piano 3.JPG|thumb|150px|An upright pedal piano]]
The [[pedal piano]] (or pedalier piano)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loguerhythm.com/Images.htm |title=''Images'' notes |accessdate=2008-01-24 |author=Logue, Karl |year=1997 |work=Logue Rhythm Productions |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622200646/http://www.loguerhythm.com/Images.htm |archivedate=2007-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[piano]] that includes a pedalboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Belt |first=Philip |title=The Piano |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X3FoI_Z6cQC |year=1997 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=0-393-30518-X |page=150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of pedal piano:
* A pedal board integrated with a manual piano instrument, using the same strings and mechanism as the manual keyboard
* An independent, pedal played piano with its own mechanics and strings, placed below a regular piano
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] owned a [[fortepiano]] with independent pedals, built for him in [[1785 in music|1785]].  [[Robert Schumann]] had an upright pedal piano with 29 notes. In the 21st century, pedal pianos, the [[Doppio Borgato]] are made in the [[Luigi Borgato|Borgato]] workshop in [[Italy]]. The bass pedalboard has 37 notes, A0 to A3 (rather than the standard 30 or 32 on an organ).

====Carillon====
Some large carillon systems for playing church bells include a pedalboard for the lowest-pitched bells. Carillon pedal keys activate a pull-down coupler that visibly moves the keys of the manual clavier and heavy clappers for the largest bells.  These keys resemble the "button keys" of early organs, and are played by the player's toes.  Because this non-legato technique involves no sliding, shoes with leather soles are not required.
[[Image:CarillonKeyboardPlummerBldg.JPG|thumb|left|100px|[[Carillon]] keyboard for playing church bells; the pedals play the lowest-pitched bells.]]

==In non-classical music==

===Jazz organ===

After jazz organist [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]] popularized the [[Hammond organ]] in jazz in the 1950s, many jazz pianists "...&amp;nbsp;who thought that getting organ-ized would be a snap ..." realized that the Hammond "...&amp;nbsp;B-3 required not only a strong left hand, but studied coordination on the pedals to create the strong and solid "jazz bass" feel."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119003211/http://www.catalog-of-cool.com/organ.html&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Dennerlein]] combines advanced pedalboard techniques with agile playing on the [[Manual (music)|manuals]]. Jazz organists from more recent decades{{Who|date=August 2011}} typically perform the bass line with their left hand on one of the keyboards, rather than by using the pedalboard. Organists who play the bassline on the lower manual may do short taps on the bass pedals – often on the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] of a tune's key and in the lowest register of the pedalboard – to simulate the low, resonant sound of a plucked [[upright bass]] string.

In popular music, pedaling style may be more varied and idiosyncratic, in part because jazz or pop organists may be self-taught. Also, pedaling styles may differ due to the design of electromechanical organs and spinet organs, many of which have shorter pedalboards designed to play primarily with the left foot, so that the right foot can control a volume (swell) pedal.
[[File:Hammond TR200.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Hammond spinet organ shows the relatively short pedals and 13-note range used on spinet organs]]

===Rock and fusion===
In the 1970s, some [[progressive rock]] groups such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Atomic Rooster]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] used standalone [[Moog Taurus]] bass pedalboard synths. The Taurus generated a bass tone for amplification by a [[bass amp]]. Other groups, such as [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Van Der Graaf Generator]] used the bass pedals of the [[Hammond organ]] in place of a [[bass guitar]] for several of their recordings and for live performances.

Other users included metal and hard rock bands such as [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], and [[Francis Buchholz]] of the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], and Justin Harris of [[Menomena]]. Ex-Genesis guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] had a set mounted waist high, which his brother, [[John Hackett (musician)|John Hackett]], played with his hands for the intro of ''Clocks – The Angel Of Mons'' from the album [[Spectral Mornings]]. [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]] uses the Moog Taurus along with an [[Access Virus]] B synth to trigger live effects. The keyboardist for the rock group [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] took this idea to its logical conclusion by performing all of the first movement, and part of the second of ''The Three Fates'' on the organ of [[Royal Festival Hall]] in [[London]].
[[File:Moog Taurus (small).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 1970s-era Moog Taurus synth]]
As well, some pop groups (e.g., [[The Police]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[U2]]) and [[fusion jazz|fusion]] bands have used bass pedalboards to produce sounds in the bass range. They are most commonly used by keyboard players as an adjunct to keyboards, but can be played in combination with other instruments (e.g., by the bass guitar or electric guitar player), or by themselves.

Standalone pedalboards usually have a 13-note range and short pedals, which limits the types of basslines to fairly simple passages. A group's [[bass guitarist]] or electric guitarist playing the pedalboard from a standing position can only use one foot at a time, which further limits what they can play. The BASYN analog bass synthesizer is a two-[[Voltage-controlled oscillator|VCO]] [[analog synthesizer]] with a 13-note "button board"—with momentary push-button switches in place of pedals. Another variant used in rock bands is a bass pedalboard laid out as a [[tabulature]] representation of part of the four strings of an electric [[bass guitar]].{{rn|date February 2018}}

===MIDI and synthesizer pedalboards===
In the 1990s, standalone electronic [[MIDI controller]] pedalboards became widely available. Unlike the Moog Taurus pedalboards, MIDI pedalboards do not produce tones by themselves, but control a MIDI-compatible electronic keyboard or MIDI sequencer. In jazz [[organ trio]]s, a keyboardist using this type of pedalboard usually connects it to a MIDI-compatible [[clonewheel organ|electronic Hammond organ-style keyboard]]. On modern electronic synthesizers such as the [[Yamaha]] [[Electone]], the pedals are not limited to traditional bass notes but may instead produce many different sounds, including high-register tones. While MIDI pedalboards are typically used for musical sounds, since they use MIDI, technically the footpedals could be used to trigger lights or other electronic elements of a show.

MIDI pedalboards offer a range of features. Some MIDI pedalboards contain velocity-sensitive triggers, which produce MIDI velocity information for musical dynamics. MIDI pedalboards such as the 13-note Roland PK-5 include a row of MIDI toe switches above the pedal keyboard, so the performer can select preset tones or MIDI channels or change the octave.  Larger 25-note Roland pedalboards also include an expression pedal for controlling the volume or other parameters. In the 2000s, controller designer Keith McMillen developed a 13-note velocity-sensitive pedalboard with a [[USB]] output that can be connected to a [[MIDI]]-equipped [[synthesizer]]. McMillen's pedalboard differs from other pedalboards in that it senses a variety of types of velocity and pressure, which the user can program to cause different effects on the synthesizer patch. McMillen's pedalboard can be programmed so that pressing an individual pedal triggers chords (up to five simultaneous notes), which a [[one person band]] could use to provide [[accompaniment]] for live shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.keithmcmillen.com/products/12-step/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326091725/https://www.keithmcmillen.com/products/12-step |archivedate=2016-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roland PK-9 and the Hammond XPK-200 are 20-note pedalboards that sound from low C to a high G. The Nord PedalKeys is a 27-note pedalboard, going from a low C to a high D. As compared with a 25-note pedalboard, the PedalKeys adds a high C# and a high D.

Some MIDI pedalboards are designed for the church pipe organ market, which means that they use AGO specifications such as a 32-note range. Most pipe organ-style MIDI pedalboards are too unwieldy for transportation, so they are typically installed under the upper manuals. However, a German company makes a MIDI pedalboard with a hinge in the middle and wheels on the underside for easy transport. Since AGO-specification MIDI pedalboards are often priced in between [[US$]]1000 and US$3000, some amateur home organists make [[DIY]] MIDI pedalboards by retrofitting an old pedalboard with MIDI. Due to the popularity of [[theater organ]]s and [[Hammond organ]]s during the 1950s and 1960s, many organ parts are on the market—including pedalboards (often with less than 32 notes, such as 20 or 25 notes) that cost under US$300. After the pedalboard is cleaned up and glass [[reed switch]]es are repaired or replaced, the pedal contacts are soldered into a [[keyboard matrix (music)|keyboard matrix circuit]]-equipped MIDI encoder, which then connects to any MIDI device to produce the sound of an organ or other instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2008/04/18/diy-midi-pedalboard/|title=DIY Midi pedalboard|author=|date=19 April 2008|website=hackaday.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227153414/https://hackaday.com/2008/04/18/diy-midi-pedalboard/|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tpost1.jpg|thumb|upright|A red-colored post pounder next to two green steel t-posts]]

A '''post pounder''', '''post driver''', '''post knocker''' or '''fence driver''' is a tool used for driving [[steel fence post|fence posts]] and similar items into land surfaces.  It consists of a heavy [[steel]] [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] which is closed at one end and has handles [[Welding|welded]] onto the sides.  It is normally used by one person, but larger versions may require two.

==History==
An early type was developed in 1933 by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] to aid the installation of fencing along roads and highways. &lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=motor+gun+boat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6AXqTIOfAsienAf959ngDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=motor%20gun%20boat&amp;f=true "Miniature Pile Driver Sinks Fence Posts", October 1933, Popular Mechanics] bottom of page 26, left side of page &lt;/ref&gt;  

==Operation==
The open end is put over the top of the post to be driven, then the tool is lifted and dropped repeatedly onto the top of the post.  The closed end strikes the top of the post, driving it into the ground.  Unlike a [[sledgehammer|maul]] it can be used easily on tall posts, such as those used for [[Agricultural fencing#Deer fence|deer fencing]].  Because the tube guides the striking force consistently in line with the post and strikes it across its full width, a post pounder usually damages the top of the post less than a maul.  It is not suitable for posts which will be shorter than the length of the tool, or for posts which do not fit easily into the tube because of bulges or curves, or their over-large diameter.  The tool is difficult to use on slanting posts.

The post pounder can also be used to remove t-posts&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Flat Funnel|title=How to REMOVE a T-post using a T-post hammer|date=2018-06-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCepzHURhxs|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To do so, put the closed end of the post pounder on the ground about 6 inches from the t-post. It should be on the side of the post with the knobs. Push back on the t-post away from the pounder, then push the top of the pounder so the rim sets beneath the lowest knob possible on the t-post. With the pounder lodged beneath the t-post knob, pull the t-post back to the starting position and it will lift up a few inches. Repeat process until t-post can be removed. 

==Safety and Precautions==
Single-person post pounders tend to be around {{convert|20|lb|kg|0}}, but weight varies with model types.  The diameter depends on the size of the post to be pounded.  They can be dangerous to handle, especially if the lower edge of the pounder catches on the top of the post, when it can pivot towards the user and strike them on the head.

[[Earplug|Hearing protection]] and a [[hard hat]] are often recommended.

It has been a widely used resource by [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC]] system developers&lt;ref name="Technix_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; as well as application programmers in the pre-[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] era.&lt;ref name="Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulman_1990_Undocumented-DOS"/&gt; Parts of the compiled information have been used for and in the creation of various books on systems programming.&lt;ref name="Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulman_1990_Undocumented-DOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_PC-Interrupts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_Network-Interrupts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_1994_Uninterrupted-Interrupts"/&gt; As such it has proven to be an important resource in developing various closed and open source operating systems, including [[Linux]] and [[FreeDOS]].&lt;ref name="Hall_2002_FreeDOS"/&gt; Today it is still used as a reference to BIOS calls and to develop programs for DOS as well as other system-level software.

The project is the result of the research and collaborative effort of more than 650 listed contributors worldwide over a period of 15 years, of which about 290 provided significant information (and some 55 of them even more than once).&lt;ref name="RBIL61"/&gt; The original list was created in January 1985 by Janet Jack and others,&lt;ref name="Jack_1985"/&gt; and, named "Interrupt List for MS-DOS", it was subsequently maintained and mailed to requestors on [[Usenet]] by [[Ross M. Greenberg]] until 1986.&lt;ref name="Greenberg_1985_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg_1985_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg_1986"/&gt; Since October 1987 it is maintained by Ralf D. Brown,&lt;ref name="Brown_1987"/&gt; a researcher at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Language Technologies Institute]].&lt;ref name="Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulman_1990_Undocumented-DOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_Homepage"/&gt; In order to establish one comprehensive reference information from several other compilations was merged into the list. Over the years, Michael A. Shiels, [[Tim Farley]], Matthias Paul, Robin Walker, Wolfgang Lierz and Tamura Jones became major contributors to the project, providing information all over the list.&lt;ref name="RBIL61"/&gt; The project was also expanded to include other PC development related information and therefore absorbed a number of independently maintained lists on PC I/O ports (by Wim Osterholt and Matthias Paul), BIOS CMOS memory contents (by Padgett Peterson), processor opcodes (by Alex V. Potemkin) and bugs (by Harald Feldmann).&lt;ref name="RBIL61"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_INTER61_Contents"/&gt; Brown and Paul also conducted several systematic surveys on specific hard- and software details among a number of dedicated user groups&lt;!-- CPM/CDOS/MDOS-family users, HP-LX users, PC/GEOS users, MS-DOS/PC DOS, DR-DOS and FreeDOS users --&gt; in order to validate some info and to help fill some gaps in the list.&lt;ref name="Brown_1989_Call"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_ID"/&gt;

Originally, the list was distributed in an archive named INTERRUP in various compression formats as well as in form of [[diff]]s.  The distribution file name was changed to include a version in the form INTERnyy (with n = issue number, and yy = 2-digit release year) in 1988. In mid 1989 the distribution settled to only use [[PKZIP|ZIP]] compression.&lt;ref name="Brown_1989_892-1"/&gt; When the archive reached the size of a 360&amp;nbsp;KB [[floppy]] in June 1991, the distribution split into several files following a INTERrrp.ZIP naming scheme (with rr = revision starting with 26 for version 91.3, and p = part indicator of the package starting with letter A). Officially named "MS-DOS Interrupt List" and "x86 Interrupt List" (abbreviated as "INTER") by its maintainer, the community coined the unofficial name "Ralf Brown's Interrupt List" (abbreviated as "RBIL") in the 1990s.

The publication is currently at revision 61 as of 17 July 2000 with almost 8&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] of [[ASCII]] text including close to {{val|9600}} entries plus about {{val|5400}} tables,&lt;ref name="RBIL61"/&gt; fully cross linked, which would result in more than 3700 pages (at 60 lines per page) of condensed information when printed. Of this, the interrupt list itself makes up some 5.5&amp;nbsp;MB for more than 2500 pages printed.&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_INTER61_Contents"/&gt;

While the project is not officially abandoned and the website is still maintained (as of 2017), new releases have not been forthcoming for a very long time, despite the fact that information was still pending for release even before the INTER61 release in 2000.&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_KBD2"/&gt; New releases were planned for at several times in 2001&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_RBIL62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_SwitChar"/&gt; and 2002,&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_RBIL62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_CPM86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_Filesystem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_ID"/&gt; but when they did not materialize, portions of the new information on DOS and PC internals provided by Paul were circulated in preliminary form in the development community for peer-review and to assist in operating system development.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_SwitChar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_GRAFTABL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_INT16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_RPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_COM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_EXEC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_COM64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_ID"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_KBD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_Codepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_NLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_EMM386"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1082">The '''reckoning board''', also called a '''memory board''' or '''hole board''', could be used on its own as a basic counting device or used with an abacus for engineering.

There were two types of reckoning board. The older type was a simple 10&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10 grid of holes. A peg would be inserted into a hole and moved along, starting from the top and working downwards. It was used as a memory aid when counting certain units. For every sack of grain or bar of steel, the peg would be moved forward and after a day or a week, the total number counted could be seen.

The more advanced type had columns of holes, with the columns indicating place value.

'''Richard Wesley Hamming''' ([[Chicago, Illinois]], February 11, 1915 – [[Monterey, California]], January 7, 1998) was an American [[mathematician]] whose work had many implications for [[computer engineering]] and [[telecommunications]]. His contributions include the [[Hamming code]] (which makes use of a [[Hamming matrix]]), the [[Hamming window#Hamming window|Hamming window]], [[Hamming numbers]], [[sphere-packing]] (or [[Hamming bound]]), and the [[Hamming distance]].

Born in Chicago, Hamming attended [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Nebraska]] and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he wrote his doctoral thesis in mathematics under the supervision of [[Waldemar Trjitzinsky]] (1901–1973). In April 1945 he joined the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where he programmed the [[IBM]] [[calculating machines]] that computed the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists. He left to join the [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1946. Over the next fifteen years he was involved in nearly all of the Laboratories' most prominent achievements.

After retiring from the Bell Labs in 1976, Hamming took a position at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]], where he worked as an [[adjunct professor]] and [[senior lecturer]] in [[computer science]], and devoted himself to teaching and writing books. He delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before he died  from a [[heart attack]] on January 7, 1998.

== Early life ==
Richard Wesley Hamming was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 11, 1915,&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://computer.org/computer-pioneers/hamming.html |title=Computer Pioneers – Richard Wesley Hamming |publisher=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Richard J. Hamming, a credit manager, and Mabel G. Redfield.{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} He grew up in Chicago, where he attended [[Crane High School (Chicago)|Crane Technical High School]] and [[Malcolm X College|Crane Junior College]].{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}}

Hamming initially wanted to study engineering, but money was scarce during the [[Great Depression]], and the only scholarship offer he received came from the [[University of Chicago]], which had no engineering school. Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics,&lt;ref name="ACM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hamming_1000652.cfm |title=Richard W. Hamming – A.M. Turing Award Winner |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1937.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt; He later considered this a fortunate turn of events. "As an engineer," he said, "I would have been the guy going down manholes instead of having the excitement of frontier research work."&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

He went on to earn a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1939, and then entered the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he wrote his doctoral thesis on ''Some Problems in the Boundary Value Theory of Linear Differential Equations'' under the supervision of [[Waldemar Trjitzinsky]].&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; His thesis was an extension of Trjitzinsky's work in that area. He looked at [[Green's function]] and further developed [[Jacob Tamarkin]]'s methods for obtaining [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic]] solutions.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hamming.html |title=Hamming biography |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was a graduate student, he discovered and read [[George Boole]]'s  ''[[The Laws of Thought]]''.{{sfn|Hamming|1998|p=643}}

The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign awarded Hamming his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1942, and he became an Instructor in Mathematics there. He married Wanda Little, a fellow student, on September 5, 1942,&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; immediately after she was awarded her own Master of Arts in English literature. They would remain married until his death, but had no children.{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} In 1944, he became an [[Assistant Professor]] at the [[J.B. Speed School of Engineering|J.B. Speed Scientific School]] at the [[University of Louisville]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
With [[World War II]] still ongoing, Hamming left Louisville in April 1945 to work on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], in [[Hans Bethe]]'s division, programming the [[IBM]] [[calculating machines]] that computed the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists. His wife Wanda soon followed, taking a job at Los Alamos as a [[human computer]], working for Bethe and [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; Hamming later recalled that:{{quote|Shortly before the first field test (you realize that no small scale experiment can be done—either you have a critical mass or you do not), a man asked me to check some arithmetic he had done, and I agreed, thinking to fob it off on some subordinate. When I asked what it was, he said, "It is the probability that the test bomb will ignite the whole atmosphere." I decided I would check it myself! The next day when he came for the answers I remarked to him, "The arithmetic was apparently correct but I do not know about the formulas for the capture cross sections for oxygen and nitrogen—after all, there could be no experiments at the needed energy levels." He replied, like a physicist talking to a mathematician, that he wanted me to check the arithmetic not the physics, and left. I said to myself, "What have you done, Hamming, you are involved in risking all of life that is known in the Universe, and you do not know much of an essential part?" I was pacing up and down the corridor when a friend asked me what was bothering me. I told him. His reply was, "Never mind, Hamming, no one will ever blame you."{{sfn|Hamming|1998|p=643}} }}

Hamming remained at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a post at the  [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought [[Klaus Fuchs]]'s old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the [[FBI]] regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming.{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a "computer janitor",{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=972}} he saw [[computer simulation]]s of experiments that would have been impossible to perform in a laboratory. "And when I had time to think about it," he later recalled, "I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed".&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

== Bell Laboratories ==
[[File:Hamming.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A two-dimensional visualisation of the [[Hamming distance]]. The color of each [[pixel]] indicates the [[Hamming distance]] between the [[binary representation]]s of its x and y coordinates, [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 16, in the 16-color system.]]
At the Bell Labs Hamming shared an office for a time with [[Claude Shannon]]. The Mathematical Research Department also included [[John Tukey]] and Los Alamos veterans Donald Ling and [[Brockway McMillan]]. Shannon, Ling, McMillan and Hamming came to call themselves the [[Young Turks (Bell Labs)|Young Turks]].&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; "We were first-class troublemakers," Hamming later recalled. "We did unconventional things in unconventional ways and still got valuable results. Thus management had to tolerate us and let us alone a lot of the time."&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

Although Hamming had been hired to work on [[elasticity theory]], he still spent much of his time with the calculating machines.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=972}} Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off.&lt;ref name="Additional Materials" /&gt; Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen "[[bit]]s".{{sfn|Shannon|1948|p=379}} If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a [[parity bit]] was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. "If the computer can tell when an error has occurred," Hamming reasoned, "surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself."&lt;ref name="Additional Materials"&gt;{{cite web |title=Richard W. Hamming Additional Materials |url=http://amturing.acm.org/info/hamming_1000652.cfm |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamming set himself the task of solving this problem,{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} which he realised would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept of the number of positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one [[code word]] into another, which is today known as the [[Hamming distance]].{{sfn|Morgan|1998|pp=973–975}} Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical [[error-correcting code]], which are called [[Hamming code]]s. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|pp=973–975}}{{sfn|Hamming|1950|pp=147–160}}

The [[Hamming bound]], also known as the sphere-packing or volume bound is a limit on the parameters of an arbitrary [[block code]]. It is from an interpretation in terms of [[sphere packing]] in the Hamming distance into the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of all possible words.  It gives an important limitation on the [[efficiency]] with which any error-correcting code can utilize the space in which its code words are embedded.  A code which attains the Hamming bound is said to be a perfect code. Hamming codes are perfect codes.{{sfn|Ling|Xing|2004|pp=82–88}}{{sfn|Pless|1982|pp=21–24}}

Returning to [[differential equation]]s, Hamming studied means of numerically integrating them. A popular approach at the time was Milne's Method, attributed to [[Edward Arthur Milne|Arthur Milne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weisstein |first=Eric W. |title=Milne's Method |publisher=MathWorld |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MilnesMethod.html |accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the [[Linear multistep method|Adams method]].{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=975}} He did extensive research into digital [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]], devising a new filter, the [[Hamming window]], and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, ''Digital Filters'' (1977).{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=976–977}}

During the 1950s, he programmed one of the earliest computers, the [[IBM 650]], and with Ruth A. Weiss developed the L2 programming language, one of the earliest computer languages, in 1956. It was widely used within the Bell Labs, and also by external users, who knew it as Bell 2. It was superseded by [[Fortran]] when the Bell Labs' IBM 650 were replaced by the [[IBM 704]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/99.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140902215751/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/99.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 2, 2014 |title=Computing Science Technical Report No. 99 – A History of Computing Research at Bell Laboratories (1937–1975) |first=Bernard D. |last=Holbrook |first2=W. Stanley |last2=Brown |publisher=[[Bell Labs]] |accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Discipline of Programming'' (1967), [[Edsger Dijkstra]] attributed to Hamming the problem of efficiently finding [[regular numbers]].{{sfn|Dijkstra|1976|pp=129–134}} The problem became known as "Hamming's problem", and the regular numbers are often referred to as Hamming numbers in Computer Science, although he did not discover them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HammingProblem |title=Hamming Problem |publisher=Cunningham &amp; Cunningham, Inc. |accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his time at Bell Labs, Hamming avoided management responsibilities. He was promoted to management positions several times, but always managed to make these only temporary. "I knew in a sense that by avoiding management," he later recalled, "I was not doing my duty by the organization. That is one of my biggest failures."&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

== Later life ==
Hamming served as president of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] from 1958 to 1960.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=972}} In 1960, he predicted that one day half of the Bell Lab's budget would be spent on computing. None of his colleagues thought that it would ever be so high, but his forecast  actually proved to be too low.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=977}} His philosophy on scientific computing appeared as the motto of his ''Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers'' (1962): {{quote|The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.{{sfn|Hamming|1962|pp=vii, 276, 395}} }}

In later life, Hamming became interested in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, when he left the Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at [[Stanford University]], [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], the [[City College of New York]], the [[University of California at Irvine]] and [[Princeton University]].{{Sfnm|Carnes|2005|1p=220–221|Tveito, Bruaset, and Lysne|2009|2p=59}} As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed in the first half of his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

In 1976 he moved to the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]], where he worked as an [[Adjunct professor|Adjunct Professor]] and [[senior lecturer]] in [[computer science]].{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} He gave up research, and concentrated on teaching and writing books.&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; He noted that:
{{quote|The way mathematics is currently taught it is exceedingly dull. In the calculus book we are currently using on my campus, I found no single problem whose answer I felt the student would care about! The problems in the text have the dignity of solving a crossword puzzle – hard to be sure, but the result is of no significance in life.&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; }}
Hamming attempted to rectify the situation with a new text, ''Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics'' (1985).&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; In 1993, he remarked that "when I left BTL, I knew that that was the end of my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it's really the end."&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt; And so it proved. He became [[Professor Emeritus]] in June 1997,&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Obits2/Hamming_NYTimes.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |last=Fisher |first=Lawrence |date=January 11, 1998 |title=Richard Hamming, 82, Dies; Pioneer in Digital Technology |accessdate=August 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before his death from a [[heart attack]] on January 7, 1998.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=972}} He was survived by his wife Wanda.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Shlomo Kramer has been actively involved with technology all his life. As a youth, he worked on mainframes and sold video games.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-03/kramer-s-startup-spree-helps-turn-israel-into-cyber-power |title=Kramer’s Startup Spree Helps Turn Israel Into Cyber Power |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He landed his first job – selling personal computers at a [[Tel Aviv]] shop – at age 15. After discovering that one of the shop’s best-selling games was developed and marketed by a 17-year-old in Britain who had set up his own company, Kramer knew that he “wanted to be like him — an entrepreneur, even though it would be quite a few years before I knew the word.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5388-shlomo-kramer-entrepreneurist.htm ]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer, who has been called “the godfather of Israeli cybersecurity,” is a serial high-tech investor and entrepreneur with “a long track record of success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krupkinyesterday |first=Taly |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.673364 |title=The heart of Israeli cyber, a Check Point brotherhood - Business |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2015-08-29 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he co-founded Check Point Software Technologies along with [[Gil Shwed]] and Marius Nacht;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2016/05/12/check-point-software-technologies-co-founder-launched-to-the-cloud/ |title=Check Point Software Co-Founder Launches Simple Network Security In The Cloud |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company introduced the first firewall to the commercial market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roy Goldenberg |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-network-security-co-cato-networks-raises-20m-1001076514 |title=Network security co Cato Networks raises $20m |publisher=Globes English |date=2015-10-27 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to become “a world leader in protecting the information that flows round the Internet, and a flagship of Israel's high-tech industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tali Tsipori |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000872622 |title=Shlomo Kramer to reap some $240m from Trusteer sale |publisher=Globes English |date=2013-08-15 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer left Check Point in 1998 and used the money from the sale of his stake to strike out on his own as an entrepreneur and investor in numerous startups.&lt;ref name="fortune1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowan |first=Lynn |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204358004577027963971361068 |title=Imperva Jumps in IPO |publisher=WSJ |date=2011-11-09 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Kramer founded his second startup, Imperva, together with Mickey Boodaei and Amichai Shulman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/business/business-features/65504/cyber-hacking-these-israelis-are-case |title=Cyber hacking is on the up - but these Israelis are on the case |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imperva moved away from perimeter defenses such as firewalls and instead deployed its software to protect against hackers and business-data theft by identifying and preventing attacks before they find their way to the inside of an organization.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Tova |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-israel-kramer-idUSKCN0VJ138 |title=Firewall pioneer Kramer bets on shift to cloud security |publisher=Reuters |date=2016-02-10 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company’s initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raised $90 million, with its shares gaining 33% on its first day of trading on 9 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2011/11/09/imperva-ipo-goes-high-at-90m.html |title=Imperva IPO goes high at $90M |publisher=Silicon Valley Business Journal |date=2011-11-09 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Imperva acquired Skyfence, a cloud security gateway startup in which Kramer was a lead investor, and bought the shares it did not already own in [[Incapsula]], a cloud-based website performance and security service in which it had already invested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krupkinyesterday |first=Taly |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.573270 |title=Shlomo Kramer’s Imperva buys two of his Israeli firms - Business |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2014-02-09 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisitions helped Imperva extend its data security strategy throughout the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityweek.com/imperva-makes-three-acquisitions-unveils-new-cloud-strategy |title=Imperva Makes Three Acquisitions, Unveils New Cloud Strategy |publisher=SecurityWeek.Com |date=2014-02-07 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer’s belief in the cloud as the next big development in cybersecurity led him to establish Cato Networks in 2016, together with former [[Imperva]] colleague Gur Shatz. Cato Networks’ software integrates all the elements of an organization’s network – including branch locations, data centers, mobile users and more – into one encrypted network in the cloud. This means the enterprise is no longer tied to an array of location-bound appliances to protect its data.

==Investments==
In addition to co-founding [[Check Point]], Imperva and Cato Networks, Kramer has invested in many startups, mostly in the field of data security.
A partial list of his investments since 2000 includes: Insert; SafeBreach; LightCyber; TopSpin Security; Exabeam; [[Fundbox]]; Splacer; Indegy; Comilion; Lacoon Mobile Security; Alicanto ; WatchDox ; [[Sumo Logic]]; Worklight; Trusteer; Business Layers and Aqua Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shlomo Kramer|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/shlomo-kramer#/entity|publisher=crunchbase|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 2006, Kramer was selected by Network World magazine as one of 20 luminaries who changed the network industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/06/11/exabeam-raises-10-million-in-new-funding-to-continue-to-develop-its-anti-cyberattack-software/ |title=Exabeam Raises $10 Million in new Funding to Continue to Develop Its Anti-Cyberattack Software - Jewish Business News |publisher=Jewishbusinessnews.com |date=2014-06-11 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he was named CEO of the Year by SC Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/sc-awards-europe-2008-winners-announced/article/110228/ |title=SC AWARDS EUROPE 2008: Winners announced |publisher=Scmagazineuk.com |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Kramer was inducted into the Infosecurity Europe Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosecprofessional.com/2013/04/infosecurity-europe-2013-hall-of-fame.html |title=Infosec Pro - The Independent Information Security Blog |publisher=Infosecprofessional.com |date=2013-04-24 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''signed overpunch''' is a code used to store the [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] of a number by changing the last digit. It is used in character data on IBM mainframes by languages such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]], and [[IBM RPG|RPG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=IBM Corporation |title=RPG/400 Reference |date=June 1994 |page=403 |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_i5_54/books/c0918170.pdf?view=kc |accessdate=Aug 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to save a character that would otherwise be used by the sign digit.&lt;ref name="EncycArk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3480-3590-data-conversion.com/article-signed-fields.html |title=Tech Talk, COBOL Tutorials, EBCDIC to ASCII Conversion of Signed Fields |accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The code is derived from the [[punched card#IBM 80-column punched card formats and character codes|Hollerith Punched Card Code]], where both a digit and a sign can be entered in the same card column. Character data which may contain overpunches is called ''[[Binary-coded decimal#Zoned decimal|zoned decimal]]''.

The &lt;code&gt;PACK&lt;/code&gt; instruction on [[IBM System/360 architecture]] machines converts the sign of a zoned decimal number when converting to ''[[Binary-coded decimal#Packed BCD|packed decimal]]'',
and the corresponding &lt;code&gt;UNPK&lt;/code&gt; instruction will set the correct overpunched sign of its zoned decimal output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=IBM Corporation |title=z/Architecture Principles of Operation |date=Oct 2001 |pages=7-112,7-158 |edition=2nd |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg23f570d52b991b62e85256ed2006374c6&amp;aid=1 |accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language support==
===PL/I===
PL/I uses the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE&lt;/code&gt; attribute to declare zoned decimal data with a signed overpunch. Each character in a numeric picture except &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates the position of the assumed decimal point, represents a digit. A picture character of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; indicates a digit position which may contain an overpunch. &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the position will contain {–I if positive and }–R if negative. &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the position will contain {–I if positive and 0-9 if negative. &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the position will contain 0–9 if positive and }–R if negative.

For example &lt;code&gt;PICTURE 'Z99R'&lt;/code&gt; describes a four-character numeric field. The first position may be blank or will contain a digit 0–9. The next two positions will contain digits, and the fourth position will contain 0–9 for a positive number and }–R for negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=IBM Corporation |title=IBM PL/I for MVS &amp; VM Language Reference |date=June 1995 |pages=294–296 |url=http://web.eah-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/IBM-PLI-MVS-VM-LangRef.pdf |accessdate=Aug 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigning the value 1021 to the above picture will store the characters  "1021" in memory; assigning -1021 will store "102J".

Decimal points are usually implied and not explicitly stated in the text. Using numbers with two decimal digits:

1000} is -100.00

==ASCII representation==
COBOL representation of signed overpunch characters "is not standardized in ASCII, and different compilers use different overpunch codes."  In most cases, "the representation is not the same as the result of converting an EBCDIC Signed field to ASCII with a translation table."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EBCDIC to ASCII Conversion of Signed Fields |url=http://www.3480-3590-data-conversion.com/article-signed-fields.html |website=DISC Media Conversion Specialists |accessdate=Nov 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PL/I compilers on ASCII systems use the same set of characters as in EBCDIC to represent overpunches.

'''sipXecs''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] enterprise communications system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipfoundry.org Enterprise Communications System]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initially developed as a proprietary [[voice over IP]] telephony server in 2003 by Pingtel Corporation in Boston, MA,&lt;ref name="voipnews"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.voip-news.com/feature/essential-guide-open-source-voip-031208/|title= The Essential Guide to Open-Source VoIP - VoIP News|accessdate=2008-03-13 |quote= SipX is an open-source VoIP telephony server.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later extended with additional collaboration capabilities in the [[SIPfoundry]] project. Its core feature is a software implementation of the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), which makes it an IP based communications system (IP PBX).

sipXecs is often compared to other open source telephony and softswitch solutions such as [[Asterisk]],&lt;ref name="VoIP today"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.voiptoday.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=131:asterisk-now-vs-sipxecs-vs-switchvox-vs-trixbox-pro-comparing-user-benefits&amp;catid=55:pbx-comparison&amp;Itemid=229 |title= Asterisk NOW vs. sipXecs vs. SwitchVox vs. Trixbox Pro - Comparing User Benefits |accessdate= 2009-05-08 |quote= comparison between Asterisk NOW, SwitchVox, Trixbox Pro and sipXecs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FreeSWITCH]],&lt;ref name="FreeSWITCH"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.freeswitch.org/node/178 | title= New Version of sipXecs Uses FreeSWITCH for Automated Attendant, Conferencing |accessdate= 2009-04-28 | quote= ...includes FreeSWITCH as an underlying component of the automated attendant and conferencing systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SIP Express Router]], but the design of sipXecs is substantially different from Asterisk and FreeSWITCH.

==History==
Development of sipXecs was started in 2003 by Pingtel Corp, a Boston, MA based venture backed company. In 2004, Pingtel adopted an open-source business model and contributed the codebase to the not-for-profit organization [[SIPfoundry]].&lt;ref name="eWeek 2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mobile.eweek.com/c/a/IT-Infrastructure/Pingtel-Goes-Open-Source-with-IP-Telephony-Platform/ |title= Pingtel Goes Open Source with IP Telephony Platform |accessdate= 2004-03-25 | quote= Small Massachusetts company form a nonprofit SIPfoundry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been an open source project since then.&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://github.com/SIPfoundry |title= SIPfoundry on GitHub |accessdate= 2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pingtel's assets were acquired by Bluesocket in July 2007.&lt;ref name="NetworkWorld"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.networkworld.com/article/2293035/network-security/bluesocket-snaps-up-open-source-ip-pbx-maker-pingtel.html|title= Bluesocket snaps up open source IP PBX maker Pingtel|accessdate=2007-07-24 |quote= Wireless security vendor Bluesocket has bought open source IP PBX maker Pingtel .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008 the Pingtel assets were acquired from Bluesocket by Nortel.&lt;ref name="Boston Business Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2008/08/nortel-picks-up-pingtel-from-bluesocket.html | title= Nortel picks up Pingtel from Bluesocket |accessdate=2008-08-13|quote= Nortel picks up Pingtel from Bluesocket.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the acquisition by Nortel, Nortel released the SCS500&lt;ref name="NetworkWorld 3"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.networkworld.com/article/2346227/security/first-look--nortel-ramps-up-scs500-platform.html |title= First Look: Nortel Ramps Up SCS500 Platform |accessdate= 2008-09-16 |quote= The technologies from Pingtel's SIPFoundry suite would evolve into Nortel's Software Communications System 500 (SCS500).}}&lt;/ref&gt; product based on sipXecs. SCS500 was positioned as an open and software-only telephony server for the SMB market up to 500 users and received some recognition.&lt;ref name="TMC4"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.tmcnet.com/the-hyperconnected-enterprise/unified-communications/asterisk-may-be-older-but-sipxecs-is-better.asp |title= Asterisk may be older, but sipXecs is better |accessdate=2008-06-12 |quote= SCS500 is the culmination of more than 250 groundbreaking contributions from Nortel into SIPfoundry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later renamed SCS and positioned as an Enterprise Communications System.&lt;ref name="eWeek"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Midmarket/Nortel-Expands-Software-Communication-System-Solution-461124/ |title= Nortel Expands Software Communication System Solution  |accessdate= 2009-06-26 | quote= Nortel announced it is expanding its Software Communication System solution to accommodate enterprises beyond small and medium-size businesses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the Nortel bankruptcy&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal 2"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123193994047481129 |title= Nortel Networks Files for Chapter 11 |accessdate= 2009-01-15 | quote= Nortel Networks Files for Chapter 11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the acquisition of the Nortel assets by Avaya,&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB125292350335808267 | title= Avaya to Purchase Nortel Unit | accessdate= 2009-09-15 | quote= Avaya to Purchase Nortel Unit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avaya has backed away from SCS in an effort to rationalize its product portfolio post acquisition of Nortel.  The sipXecs solution continued to be used as the basis for the [http://avayalive.com/ Avaya Live] cloud based communications service.

In April 2010 the founders of [[SIPfoundry]] founded eZuce.&lt;ref name="TMCnet"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tmcnet.com/voip/departments/articles/114454-sipfoundry-founders-go-commercial-with-ezuce.htm |title= SIPfoundry Founders Go Commercial with eZuce |accessdate= 2010-10-01 | quote= SIPfoundry Founders Go Commercial with eZuce.}}&lt;/ref&gt; eZuce commercialized the sipXecs solution in close cooperation with SIPfoundry and the open source community.

sipXecs is typically deployed by enterprises wanting to replace a traditional [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) with a software-based solution that can be produced in a cloud environment. In addition to telephony features, sipXecs offers collaboration capabilities such as enterprise instant messaging and conferencing.

==Design philosophy==
sipXecs is designed as a software-only, distributed [[cloud application]].  It runs on the Linux operating system [[CentOS]] or [[RHEL]] on either virtualized or physical servers. A minimum configuration allows running all of the sipXecs components on a single server, including database, all available services, and the sipXecs management. Global clusters can be built using built-in auto-configuration capabilities from the centralized management system.

sipXecs uses [[MongoDB]] as a distributed and partition tolerant database for global transactions, includes [[CFEngine]] for orchestration of clusters and [[JasperReports]] for reporting. The management and configuration system is based on the [[Spring Framework]]. sipXecs includes [[FreeSWITCH]] as its media server and [[Openfire]] for presence and instant messaging services.

sipXecs follows standards such as [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol|SRTP]], [[XMPP|Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)]], [[Transport Layer Security|SIP and XMPP over TLS]], and several Web standards including [[WebRTC]], [[WebSocket|WebSOCKET]] and [[Representational State Transfer]] (REST).

eZuce, Inc.holds the US patent on the architecture referred to as SIP Session Oriented Architecture or SSOA.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Adoption==
Adoption of open source solutions is difficult to quantify. SIPfoundry claims on its Web site that over one million users have downloaded sipXecs in small and large companies worldwide.

Amazon.com was an early adopter of sipXecs.&lt;ref name="TMC"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/rich-tehrani/open-source/open-source-communications-and-sip-come-to-amazoncom.html |title= Open Source Communications and SIP come to Amazon.com |accessdate= 2006-10-09 |quote= Amazon.com will soon be deploying 5,000 phones connected to the Pingtel ECS platform running on Linux..}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial 5,000 user deployment expanded considerably in the following years.

'''Sling Media Inc.''' is a technology company that develops [[placeshifting]] and [[Smart TV]] solutions for consumers, [[multiple-system operator]]s and set top box manufacturers. The company is based in Foster City, California, and was a subsidiary of [[Echostar Corporation|EchoStar Corporation]] (acquired in the fall of 2007).  Their initial product, the [[Slingbox]], debuted on the US market on July 1, 2005.  The EchoStar business unit was part of a corporate assets exchange with [[Dish Network]] at the beginning of 2017 and now operates as Dish Technologies Corporation under [[Dish Network]].

==History==
The company was founded in 2004 by brothers Blake and Jason Krikorian from [[San Francisco]], along with Bhupen Shah,&lt;ref&gt;Preeth J., Techcircle.in, April 18, 2011. [http://techcircle.vccircle.com/2011/04/18/india-is-very-critical-for-sling-media-founder-bhupen-shah/ “India Is Very Critical For Sling Media”: Founder Bhupen Shah] (Retrieved July 22, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; who had the relationships to help establish Sling's presence in Bangalore. The idea for Sling originated during the 2002 [[Major League Baseball]] season, when the Krikorian brothers, who are dedicated [[San Francisco Giants]] fans, often traveled far from home, and faced missing the best games of the season.&lt;ref&gt;Engadget, July 18, 2005. [https://www.engadget.com/2005/07/18/the-engadget-interview-blake-krikorian-ceo-of-sling-media/ The Engadget Interview: Blake Krikorian, CEO of Sling Media] (Retrieved April 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2007, [[Echostar Corporation|EchoStar]] announced an agreement to acquire Sling Media for approximately $380 million USD.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, Erick. TechCrunch, September 26, 2007. [https://techcrunch.com/2007/09/26/sling-media-sells-out-to-echostar/ Sling Media Sells Out to EchoStar] (Retrieved July 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake and Jason left the company in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;GigaOM, January 12, 2009. [http://gigaom.com/2009/01/12/breaking-sling-team-leaving-the-building/ Sling Team Leaving the Building] (Retrieved April 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2016, Blake Krikorian died of a heart attack at age 48.&lt;ref name=deadline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/blake-krikorian-dies-tech-entrrepreneur-sling-1201798689/|title=Blake Krikorian Dies: Tech Entrepreneur And Sling Founder Was 48|first=David|last=Lieberman|work=Deadline|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

===Retail Slingbox Hardware===
&lt;sub&gt;(see also [[Slingbox]])&lt;/sub&gt;

The original Slingbox, now referred to as the Slingbox Classic, was released July 1, 2005. It was designed by [[Yves Béhar]],&lt;ref&gt;fuseproject website - [http://www.fuseproject.com/work/slingbox/personal_broadcaster/ Slingbox Personal Broadcaster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142757/http://www.fuseproject.com/work/slingbox/personal_broadcaster/ |date=2014-04-13 }} (Retrieved April 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and had the appearance of a "foil-wrapped chocolate bar."

====Second Generation - AV, Tuner and Pro====
Improvement came with the introduction of the second-generation line of Sling Media products: the Slingbox AV, the Slingbox Tuner, and the Slingbox Pro.  While the Slingbox AV became a simplified unit with [[s-video]] and [[Composite video|composite]] inputs only, the Slingbox Tuner provided service for the other end of the spectrum, with only a single [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] input for use by basic cable and antenna-only applications.  The Slingbox Pro introduced a four input design, combining the capabilities of the AV and Tuner units while also allowing for the connection of high definition sources with the use of an accessory cable adding [[Component video#YPbPr analog component video|component]] and [[TOSLINK|digital audio]] inputs.

====Third Generation - SOLO and PRO-HD====
In 2007, Sling introduced the Slingbox SOLO, a third generation box that was a "streamlined version of the Slingbox Pro".&lt;ref&gt;C|NET, September 26, 2007. [http://www.cnet.com/products/sling-media-slingbox-solo-sb260100/ Sling Media Slingbox SOLO Review] (Retrieved April 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; It provided a high quality standard definition video stream and a lower price point. This model was followed up 
in 2008 by the Slingbox PRO-HD, a high-end device that supported placeshifting HDTV (1080i) video and currently is the only Slingbox to include an ATSC tuner for over-the-air HDTV broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;C|NET, September 25, 2008. [http://www.cnet.com/products/sling-media-slingbox-pro-hd-sb300100/ Sling Media Slingbox Pro-HD review] (Retrieved April 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Slingbox SOLO was also later repackaged as the Slingbox 120 for special vertical and international markets.&lt;ref&gt;Zatz Not Funny, April 14, 2011. [http://www.zatznotfunny.com/2011-04/new-slingbox-120-launches-in-india/ New Slingbox 120 Launches (In India)] (Retrieved April 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

An unknown number of the third generation Slingboxes were susceptible to the [[capacitor plague]]. While many enthusiasts replaced these capacitors on their own,&lt;ref&gt;Place Shifting Enthusiasts - [http://placeshiftingenthusiasts.com/slingbox-solo-freezing-stuck-optimizing-losing-connection-check-the-capacitors/ Slingbox Solo Freezing, Stuck Optimizing, Losing Connection? Check the Capacitors] (Retrieved April 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Place Shifting Enthusiasts - [http://placeshiftingenthusiasts.com/forum/slingbox-hardware/slingbox-solo-bulging-capcitors/ Slingbox Solo bulging Capcitors] (Retrieved April 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Sling later addressed these issues in support. Remanufactured and refurbished third-generation Slingboxes have been fixed as well.

====Fourth Generation - 350 and 500====
In October 2012, Sling Media launched the Slingbox 350 and 500 to replace the Slingbox SOLO and PRO-HD. With the [[digital television transition in the United States]], the desirability of a standard definition focused product no longer existed in Sling's main market. Therefore, both boxes include HDTV capability, though the ATSC digital tuner that was included in the PRO-HD was not included in either Slingbox. The Slingbox 350 is the base product, with one SD/HD audio-video input (composite or component) and an ethernet port to connect to the Internet.

The Slingbox 500 was positioned as a platform for next-generation [[Smart TV]] capabilities. In addition to placeshifting, the Slingbox 500 included streaming apps from [[Dish Network|Dish]] Digital, including Dishworld and Blockbuster On-Demand, as well as the ability to manage and view personal media, including video. The Slingbox 500 had [[Wi-Fi]] networking and [[HDMI]] passthrough capabilities. However, because of restrictive [[HDCP]] [[Digital rights management|DRM]], Sling still recommends that customers use component cables for placeshifting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.sling.com/KB/KB-2000491 Using an HDMI video source with the Slingbox 500] (Retrieved July 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth generation - Slingbox M1====
In July 2014, Sling Media launched the award-winning&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, Will. PCMag, July 23, 2014. [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2461146,00.asp Sling Media Slingbox M1] (Retrieved July 24, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Slingbox M1 to replace the Slingbox 350. With the introduction of this Slingbox, the entire line of Slingbox hardware now support Wi-Fi connectivity. In addition, users were now able to configure a Slingbox M1 using the Slingplayer for iPad, iPhone and Android phone, as well as the Slingplayer for Desktop that was reintroduced at the same time.&lt;ref name="M1TV"&gt;Baumgartner, Jeff. Multichannel News, July 15, 2015. [http://www.multichannel.com/news/technology/sling-media-targets-mainstream/375988 Sling Media Targets The Mainstream] (Retrieved July 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

====SlingTV and the Slingbox 500====
Also introduced in July 2014, SlingTV was a free upgrade to the Slingbox 500 that provides a graphical user interface and information overlays for living room TV viewing in addition to providing place shifting capabilities. The interface also provides recommendations based on aggregate viewing data, popularity and social activity. It was released in September 2014 to current Slingbox 500 customers.&lt;ref name="M1TV" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Introducing SlingTV!| publisher=Sling Media | date = September 11, 2014 | url =http://blog.sling.com/2014/09/11/introducing-slingtv/ | accessdate = September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =SlingTV Deployment Update | publisher=Sling Media | date = September 3, 2014 | url =http://blog.sling.com/2014/09/03/slingtv-deployment-update/ | accessdate = September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the licensing of the Sling brand to [[Dish Network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Zatz|first=David|title =Despite Branding Confusion, Slingbox Lives On | publisher=Zatz Not Funny | date = January 5, 2015 | url =http://zatznotfunny.com/2015-01/the-sling-is-dead-long-live-the-sling/| accessdate = January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Sling TV|Sling Television]] [[Over-the-top content|OTT]] service, the SlingTV box reverted to the Slingbox 500 product name.

===Other Hardware and Accessories===
In 2008, Sling introduced the SlingCatcher, a hardware device to view content from a remote Slingbox, as well as personal media. The product garnered mixed reviews from its limited capabilities, including no support for HDTV, complex nature and its price.&lt;ref&gt;PC Mag, November 24, 2008. [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335377,00.asp SlingCatcher Review &amp; Rating] (Retrieved April 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because early Slingboxes did not support Wi-Fi, connecting them to a network was difficult if a customer did not have an ethernet jack near their set top box. To address these needs, Sling released the SlingLink line of [[Power-line communication|power line adapter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Test Freaks, April 22, 2009 [http://blog.testfreaks.com/review/slinglink-turbo-single-port/ SlingLink Turbo Single Port] (Retrieved April 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of a Wi-Fi-enabled Slingbox 500, the product was discontinued and is no longer supported.

===Slingplayer Apps===

====Viewing on the Desktop - Slingplayer for Desktop and Watch====
When the original Slingbox Classic was launched, customers used free downloadable software for Windows or Macintosh to access video that was streamed from the Slingbox. That application was phased out with the introduction of the Slingbox [http://watch.sling.com Watch] website, which utilized an NPAPI plug-in for video streaming. Because of the discontinuation of the NPAPI support on Chrome and demand from customers, Sling reintroduced the Slingplayer for Desktop application for Windows and Apple Mac OS X with the launch of the Slingbox M1.&lt;ref&gt;Roettgers, Janko. GigaOM, July 15, 2014. [http://gigaom.com/2014/07/15/sling-revamps-entry-level-place-shifting-box-adds-apps-and-tv-guide-to-premium-model/ Sling revamps entry-level place shifting box, adds apps and TV guide to premium model] (Retrieved July 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relaunched desktop application is only compatible with the Slingbox M1 models. In addition, Sling has also added banner ads and periodic pre-roll video ads when using the Watch website.

====Slingplayer for Mobile====
Customers can also purchase the Slingplayer apps for their mobile smartphones and tablets. Supported platforms include [[iOS]] (iPhone and iPad), Android (phones and tablets), [[Kindle Fire]] and Microsoft Windows 8.1 tablets.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;[http://sling.com/products/SlingplayerApps.aspx Sling Website - Slingplayer] (Retrieved July 15, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Previously supported platforms include Blackberry, Palm OS and Symbian.

Slingplayer apps also have the ability to "cast" their video stream to a TV screen through a Smart TV streaming box. Supported platforms include:
* [[AppleTV]] via [[AirPlay]] (iOS Slingplayer apps only)
* [[Roku]] devices, which requires a Roku customer to download a Slingplayer for Roku app

There were several native apps for Connected Devices that can view and control a remote Slingbox. Those devices included:&lt;ref name="SPCD"&gt;Sling Support - [http://www.sling.com/sitecore/content/Support/KB/KB-2000539?sc_lang=en-US Slingbox models compatible with SlingPlayer for Connected Devices] (Retrieved July 20, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Western Digital|WD]] TV Live
* [[Sony]] Internet Player with [[Google TV]]
* [[Netgear]] NeoTV
* [[Boxee Box]]
* [[Logitech]] Revue

These apps have been deprecated as of July 2014 and will no longer be supported.&lt;ref name="SPCD" /&gt;

===OEM Solutions===
In addition to developing products and services for consumers, Sling also provides [[multiple-system operator]]s and set top box manufacturers a solution for mobile viewing of licensed content and the integration of Smart TV technologies. These capabilities include an [[Software development kit|SDK]], [[Slingbox#Cloud Infrastructure|cloud infrastructure]] and [[Non-recurring engineering|engineering resources]].

Sling's technology is currently embedded in the following products:
*[[Dish Network]] Sling Adapter for ViP 722, ViP 722k and XiP 813 (Hopper) set top boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Dish Network Support - [http://www.mydish.com/support/sling-adapter Sling Adapter] (Retrieved April 14, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the Slingbox 700U.

==Criticism and controversy==
Early in its history, the Slingbox caused widespread speculation of its possible legal implications.&lt;ref&gt;Sathyanarayana, S., The John Marshall Journal of Information Technology &amp; Privacy Law (Vol. 25, Issue 1, Winter 2007) [http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=jitpl Slingbox: Copyright, Fair Use, and Access to Television Programming Anywhere in the World] (Retrieved April 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; High on the list of issues cited by critics, was the ability to provide a loophole around proximity control, potentially allowing people outside the approved viewing area for events, especially sports, in which distribution traditionally has been restricted by time and region.  However, the practice of placeshifting is not unlike that of timeshifting, which has been upheld in courts across the world due to the personal nature of a timeshifted rebroadcast, which is deemed "non-infringing fair use". Furthermore, Sling Media's technology limits access to a single authorized user, which prevents unauthorized or multi-user access thereby maintaining the personal nature of the placeshifted content.

==Broadcasting==
Ironically, given the controversy, the retail Slingbox hardware has found an unexpected [[niche market]] in [[television]] [[broadcasting]]. [[Broadcast engineer]]s at several [[TV station]]s have installed them at remote "towercam" locations to [[traffic camera|observe traffic]] and [[weather]] conditions. [[KPIX-TV]] in [[San Francisco]] has several connected with [[wireless network]]ing, using [[EV-DO]] via a [[cellular network]] ([[mobile phone]]) provider.  This costs only a few hundred dollars for each site, versus well over ten thousand for a setup with a [[remote pickup unit]] and [[broadcast auxiliary service|auxiliary]] [[broadcast license]]s. However, the system is not yet reliable or [[broadband]] enough to handle live [[remote broadcast]]s.

Cable TV providers are also using it to provide proof of performance for companies that run [[TV ad]]s on their systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/pages/s.0082/t.7133.html The Slingbox Solution | Broadcasters adapt innovative online device for remote cam coverage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Broadcast Engineering]] – [http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/whiz-tv-eng-slingbox-wireless/ WHIZ-TV finds ENG role for Slingbox, wireless Ethernet bridge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[CNET Networks]] – [http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9717136-1.html San Francisco TV station Slings the news]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used with [[Amateur television]] transmissions. There are also [[Dedicated hosting service|hosted]] Slingbox services where the slingbox and set top box are hosted in a [[data centre]] on behalf of the user. This means that the management of the devices is done by the host and that the user can access TV streams from their hosted Slingbox wherever, whenever and whatever device ([[Personal computer|PC]], [[Smartphone|Mobile]], [[TV]]) they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Live US TV Online - Hosted Slingbox|url=http://www.mytv2me.com/hosted_slingbox.html|publisher=mytv2me|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clip+Sling==
During the 2007 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the firm announced a future feature named Clip+Sling. It allows users to share clips of their favorite TV shows with each other through a hosted Web service. The announcement was made during [[Leslie Moonves]]' keynote speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livedigitally.com/2007/01/15/sling-media-shows-clipsling-at-ces2007-cbs-keynote-video/ |title=Sling Media shows Clip+Sling at CES2007: CBS Keynote video |author=Jeremy Toeman |date=15 January 2007 |work=LIVEdigitally}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C|NET, November 1, 2007.

On December 2, 2008, Sling Media announced the public launch of Sling.com, an online video entertainment destination. Users can go to Sling.com to watch clips, TV shows, films, news and sports. This includes video programming from over 90 content providers spanning 150 content brands.  In addition to the on-demand offerings, Slingbox owners could connect to their Slingbox through the website, making their Slingboxes available without a software client download.&lt;ref&gt;Sling Media Website - [http://slingbox.com/get/io_1228240506944.html Like to Watch?

[[File:Подводный арбалет Beuchat-mundial-competition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Speargun]]
[[File:Speargun.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Speargun]]
A '''speargun''' is an underwater fishing implement designed to launch a spear at fish or other underwater animals or targets. Spearguns are used in sport fishing and underwater target shooting. The two basic types are pneumatic and those powered by rubber bands. Spear types come in a number of varieties including threaded, break-away and lined. Floats and buoys are common accessories when targeting larger fish.

==Components==
The basic components of a speargun are a spear, a stock or barrel, and a handle or grip containing a trigger mechanism. Spearguns are usually from {{convert|0.5|to|2|m|ft}} long, round or roughly rectangular from {{convert|28|to|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter/width.

==Types of spearguns==
The two most common types are:
# Rubber (or band) powered - which are the simplest and cheapest to maintain, with rubber being the predominant type, and;
# Air powered (Pneumatic).

Rubber powered spearguns come in two types: those made from wood, and those of sealed tubing metal or composite and/or a combination of these materials construction: referred to as the Stock or Barrel respectively.The wooden type is often referred to as a Hawaiian sling.&lt;ref name="Hamilton2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=S.L.|title=Spearfishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teXPBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|date=1 January 2015|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-62969-289-0|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hawaiian Squid-Hook Sinkers and Sling-Stones", [[James Edge-Partington|J. Edge-Partington]], ''Man'', Vol. 17. (May, 1917), pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those of a tubular barrel variety have separate "muzzles" fitting in or over one end of the tube, for attaching the rubber bands; while others (usually those made of wood), mainly have the bands passing through a horizontal slot in the stock.&lt;ref name="Hamilton2015"/&gt;

A rubber powered gun, besides the barrel, has the following parts:
*A spear (being a steel shaft slightly longer than the stock/barrel of from {{convert|6 |– |10 |mm|1}} in diameter, which lies on top of the barrel or in a track or groove on the top), and a trigger mechanism to engage the spear (usually in or near a handle or grip at or near the rear) to keep the gun in a loaded state of readiness when it is loaded.
*Such loading is from one or more latex rubber bands (usually tubing){{snd}} which provide the propelling force{{snd}} and are about one third of the barrel length and from {{convert|9 |– |20 |mm|1}} in diameter, being attached to the front of the gun.
*The ends of these bands have ‘bridles’ or 'wishbones', (which are usually metal or synthetic cord) fitted to them and when these bands are pulled by the diver to engage the 'wishbones' in notches in the spear or 'fins' welded on the top at the rear just before the trigger, the gun is loaded.&lt;ref name="Hamilton2015"/&gt;

A Pneumatic gun differs from a rubber model in that it has a thicker spear that goes inside a sealed internal barrel encased in a hollow sealed outer casing that contains the air which is at ambient pressure until it is pumped up by hand to a pressure usually equal to one strong rubber band. The trigger mechanism (which is at the back of the gun) has a handle/grip below it or midway up the gun. Once at the required pressure the spear is forced down the barrel to engage the trigger mechanism and is then loaded and ready. There will usually be a strong line at least twice the length of the gun connecting the spear to the front of the gun. When loaded great caution must be exercised as the speargun is now a dangerous weapon. Without a trigger, rubber bands or air pressure the speargun cannot be loaded and therefore cannot function.&lt;ref name="Hamilton2015"/&gt;

==Uses of spearguns==
Spears and spearguns have various uses:
*Sport [[spearfishing]]&lt;ref name="Kamberg2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamberg|first=Mary-Lane|title=Saltwater Fishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07wjimPn7FEC&amp;pg=PA31|date=August 2011|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4488-4599-6|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In tropical seas, some natives [[spearfishing|spearfish]] for a living, often using a home-made snorkelling kit&lt;ref name="Kamberg2011"/&gt;
*As a weapon, as in the planned hijacking of [[Federal Express Flight 705]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jet Lands Safely After Attack on Crew|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/04/08/jet-lands-safely-after-attack-on-crew/d6481a01-a4ee-4e63-9c23-29504c5f9ee3/|accessdate=March 3, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=April 8, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Underwater target shooting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Rules Underwater Target Shooting|url=http://www.spearfishing.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/International_Rules_Underwater_Target_Shooting.pdf|publisher=STOWARZYSZENIE SPEARFISHING POLAND|accessdate=14 February 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underwater target Shooting General Rules|url=http://www.tir.subaquatique.org/|publisher=Commission Nationale de Tir sur Cible Subaquatique , FFESSM|accessdate=14 February 2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All spearguns have a [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]] mechanism that holds a spear in place along the barrel.

Traditionally, rear-handle spearguns are popular in Europe and mid-handle guns were used in North America, however as spearfishing has developed as an international sport these distinctions have blurred.

[[South Africa]]n speargun manufacturers have improved speargun designs with the use of a rail along the barrel that prevents the spear from flexing under pressure from the rubber bands.

===Accessories===
The speargun can have:
*Buoy or float, tethered to the speargun or directly to the spear. It helps to subdue large fish. It can also assist in storing fish, but is more importantly used as a safety device to warn boat drivers there is diver in the area.&lt;ref name="Alswang2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alswang|first=Joel|title=The South African Dictionary of Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXKaaSlJJgsC&amp;pg=PA243|year=2003|publisher=New Africa Books|isbn=978-0-86486-535-9|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Floatline, connecting the buoy to the speargun. Often made from woven plastic, they can also be a mono-filament encased in an airtight plastic tube, or made from stretchable bungee cord.&lt;ref name="Alswang2003"/&gt;

==Spear shaft types==

===Threaded===
Threaded shafts allow for different tips to be used by having them screw on or off. Some tips include a basic short tip with a folding flopper and others use longer tips with a rotating feature, usually with multiple floppers. When larger fish are targeted a break-away tip is recommended (not to be confused with the break-away setup below) as it allows some portion, usually {{convert|4|-|6|in|cm|order=flip}}, of the tip to "break-away" from the main shaft after it penetrates a fish allowing the shaft to "fall out" of the fish but maintain the fish connection by either a small steel cable or high-strength spectra or kevlar line.&lt;ref name="Tinker1967"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tinker|first=Gene|title=Skin diving made easy|year=1967|publisher=Petersen Pub. Co.|pages=166–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawaiian===
Hawaiian shafts are the simplest shaft as the tip is shaped on the end and a folding barb installed directly behind the tip to keep the fish from sliding off. There are different length barbs and sometimes multiples (sometimes referred to as a Florida rig).&lt;ref name="Hamilton2015"/&gt;

==Speargun setups==

===Line Rig===
In this setup, the most common, the speargun is attached to the shaft by a line. The line is usually a heavy monofilament ({{convert|300|-|400|lb|order=flip}} test), spectra, or other spectra-like material (braided line) with 180–270+&amp;nbsp;kg (400–600+&amp;nbsp;lb) rating. The line wraps around the bottom or side of the gun upon loading and releases via a mechanical release or tension release to allow the line to travel with the spear after firing. There are typically two different methods of connecting the line to the spear shaft, either a slide ring that travels up and down the shaft to machined stopping points or via a hole drilled through some portion of the shaft (usually the rear). This is the most common method for taking fish by speargun and the majority of the other types of setups use the mentioned connection options to the shaft. Some newer setups offer an option to quickly attach line to, or disconnect from, a shaft making for a line or free shaft option on a single speargun.&lt;ref name="Howorth1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howorth|first=Peter|title=Foraging along the Pacific Coast: from Mexico to Puget Sound : the complete illustrated handbook|date=June 1986|publisher=Capra Press|isbn=978-0-88496-228-1|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed rig===
Here the spear gun is connected to a buoy via a float rope. After spearing a fish, the spearfisher detaches the float rope and uses a speed stick (a metal spike) attached to the float rope to thread the fish onto the float rope through its gills. The fish will then gradually slide up the float rope as the diver swims until it rests underneath the buoy. When shooting larger fish, the diver can let go of his gun and play the fish from the float line, giving the fish more room to tire and preventing it from tearing off the spear or dragging the spearfisher under the water.&lt;ref name="Howorth1986"/&gt;

===Break-away rig===
Here the spear shaft is connected directly to the buoy. It is loosely fitted to the gun as well while hunting, but after the spear is fired its force of movement detaches the line from the gun. The spearfisher is then able to subdue the fish from the buoy or float line while retaining possession of his gun. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the gun can be used to push off sharks or signal the boat driver, and secondly to prevent loss of the gun should the fish break the line, or should the spearfisher lose grip on the buoy. This setup can be used in conjunction with elastic [[bungee jumping|bungee]]-style rope and a body board style float with locking cleats. This respectively maintains constant pressure on the fish and allows the spearfisher to rest while being towed around. They can then gather the bungee line as the fish tires and lock it off in order to gradually pull the fish closer.&lt;ref name="Tinker1967"/&gt;

===Reel on gun===
Here the gun has a line reel like on a fishing rod. After spearing a fish, the reel unwinds, allowing the spearfisher room to play the fish. Reel setups are useful when ocean structures such as built up reef or kelp gardens prevent the spearfisher from towing a buoy.

===Free-shafting===
Here the spear shaft is not connected to a gun or buoy. This is more commonly associated with spearfishing on [[Scuba diving|scuba]] where excess cable or line can be problematic. Also it can be used in the areas with exceptionally clear water, where underwater hunter can track his shaft after firing it. It is not used in turbid waters with poor visibility.&lt;ref name="Graver(U.S.)1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graver|first=Dennis|title=Advanced diving: technology and techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFYQAQAAIAAJ|year=1989|publisher=National Association of Underwater Instructors|isbn=978-0-916974-39-8|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riding Rig===
Here, the spear shaft is connected to monofilament or other small high strength line, which is wrapped around the speargun, then connected to a larger, easier to handle rope which the diver holds in his hand. On the larger rope there is a loop on the end big enough for the divers thumb. The rope is placed on the thumb, then wrapped around the back of the hand. In this setup the spear is also totally free from the gun, allowing the diver to work the fish using the large rope, while keeping his gun safe. If the fish is too large to hang on to, the diver can tie it off or release it, only losing his spear and rope. This is used usually when fishing around oil rigs, or other hazardous diving such as hunting larger fish or in poor visibility.

In business, '''stealth mode''' is a company's temporary state of secretiveness, usually undertaken to avoid alerting competitors to a pending product launch or other business initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=stealth+mode&amp;i=56097,00.asp|title=Definition of stealth mode}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hush&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_4_29/ai_73121430|accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=Entrepreneur|title=Hush Hush - stealth product development can protect innovations|date=April 2001|author=Mark Henricks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''stealth product''' is a product a company develops in secret, and a '''stealth company''' is a new company that avoids initial disclosure as to its existence, purpose, products, personnel, funding, brand name, or other important attributes. The term '''stealth innovation''' has been applied to individual projects and ideas that are developed in secret inside a company.&lt;ref name="Stealth innovation article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Paddy|author2=Wedell-Wedellsborg, Thomas |title=The Case for Stealth Innovation|journal=[[Harvard Business Review]]|date=March 2013|url=http://hbr.org/2013/03/the-case-for-stealth-innovation/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Whereas secrecy is the historical norm in many fields of business,&lt;ref name=hush/&gt; [[Startup company|start-up companies]] often thrive on publicity and open sharing of information.  Openness is common to the business culture of [[Silicon Valley]] and other technology centers, with competitors freely exchanging news of discoveries, products under development, and other company news.  There is intense media interest in some business sectors, with even relatively small [[funding round]]s covered in specialized press. [[Public relations]] is considered useful to attract interest from talent, customers, and investors, and to promote the careers of the people involved.  Additionally, competitors often collaborate on projects, or buy each other's products.

Some companies nevertheless avoid publicity in fields that are ordinarily not secretive.  Among the reasons, a small, relatively unfunded company may wish to avoid giving companies with more resources time to develop competing technologies.  The very announcement that a larger or better-known company is working on a competing product may damp interest in the smaller upstart.  If the innovative company has no realistic means of protecting its new [[intellectual property]], it may seek to obtain a "[[first-mover advantage]]" by waiting until the company or its products are ready to sell before they are announced.  This gives as long a lead as possible before others may copy its products, distribution channels, brand, or other business advantages.  Conversely, companies with a protectable new technology may nevertheless wish to wait until they have filed or obtained a [[patent]].&lt;ref name=hush/&gt;

==Behavior==
When an entire company is in stealth mode it may attempt to mislead the public about its true company goals.  For example, it may give code names to its pending products.&lt;ref name=hush/&gt;  It may operate a [[corporate website]] that does not disclose its personnel or location.  New companies may operate under a temporary "stealth name" that does not disclose its field of business.

To enforce stealthy behavior, companies often require employees to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, and strictly control who may speak with the media.&lt;ref name=hush/&gt;

At the in-company level, stealth mode can also refer to a new project or idea that is kept secret, not just from external parties, but also from internal stakeholders in order to avoid a (premature) dismissal of the idea. Key behaviors can include soliciting informal project sponsors, engaging in covert testing of the concept, freeing up extra resources and building a "cover story" for the project.&lt;ref name="Stealth innovation article" /&gt;

The '''step response''' of a system in a given initial state consists of the time evolution of its outputs when its control inputs are [[Heaviside step function]]s. In [[electronic engineering]] and [[control theory]], step response is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general [[system]] when its inputs change from zero to one in a very short time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a [[dynamical system]] using an [[Dynamical system (definition)#General definition|evolution parameter]].

From a practical standpoint, knowing how the system responds to a sudden input is important because large and possibly fast deviations from the long term steady state may have extreme effects on the component itself and on other portions of the overall system dependent on this component. In addition, the overall system cannot act until the component's output settles down to some vicinity of its final state, delaying the overall system response. Formally, knowing the step response of a dynamical system gives information on the [[stability theory|stability]] of such a system, and on its ability to reach one stationary state when starting from another.

== Time domain ''versus'' frequency domain ==
Instead of frequency response, system performance may be specified in terms of  parameters describing time-dependence of response. The step response can be described by the following quantities related to its '''time behavior''',

*[[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]]
*[[rise time]]
*[[settling time]]
*[[ringing (signal)|ringing]]

In the case of [[linear]] dynamic systems, much can be inferred about the system from these characteristics. [[Step response#Results|Below]] the step response of a simple two-pole amplifier is presented, and some of these terms are illustrated.

==Step response of feedback amplifiers==
[[Image:Block Diagram for Feedback.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Ideal negative feedback model; open loop gain is ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; and feedback factor is β.]]

This section describes the step response of a simple [[negative feedback amplifier]] shown in Figure 1. The feedback amplifier consists of a main '''open-loop''' amplifier of gain ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; and a feedback loop governed by a '''feedback factor''' β. This feedback amplifier is analyzed to determine how its step response depends upon  the time constants governing the response of the main amplifier, and upon the amount of feedback used.

A negative-feedback amplifier has gain given by (see [[negative feedback amplifier]]):

:&lt;math&gt;A_{FB} = \frac {A_{OL}} {1+ \beta A_{OL}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; = '''open-loop''' gain, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;FB&lt;/sub&gt; = '''closed-loop''' gain (the gain with negative feedback present) and β = '''feedback factor'''.

===With one dominant pole===
In many cases, the forward amplifier can be sufficiently well modeled in terms of a single dominant pole of time constant τ, that it, as an open-loop gain given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{OL} = \frac {A_0} {1+j \omega \tau}, &lt;/math&gt;

with zero-frequency gain ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and angular frequency ω = 2π''f''.  This forward amplifier has unit step response

:&lt;math&gt;S_{OL}(t) = A_0(1 -   e^{-t / \tau})&lt;/math&gt;,

an exponential approach from 0 toward the new equilibrium value of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The one-pole amplifier's transfer function leads to the closed-loop gain:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{FB} = \frac {A_0} {1+ \beta A_0}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp; • &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt; \  \frac {1} {1+j \omega \frac { \tau } {1 + \beta A_0} }.  &lt;/math&gt;

This closed-loop gain is of the same form as the open-loop gain: a one-pole filter.  Its step response is of the same form: an exponential decay toward the new equilibrium value.  But the time constant of the closed-loop step function is  τ / (1 + β ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), so it is faster than the forward amplifier's response by a factor of 1 + β ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{FB}(t) =  \frac {A_0} {1+ \beta A_0}(1 -   e^{-t (1 + \beta A_0)/ \tau})&lt;/math&gt;,

As the feedback factor β is increased, the step response will get faster, until the original assumption of one dominant pole is no longer accurate.  If there is a second pole, then as the closed-loop time constant approaches the time constant of the second pole, a two-pole analysis is needed.

===Two-pole amplifiers===
In the case that the open-loop gain has two poles (two [[time constant]]s, τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the step response is a bit more complicated. The open-loop gain is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{OL} = \frac {A_0} {(1+j \omega \tau_1) (1 + j \omega \tau_2)}, &lt;/math&gt;

with zero-frequency gain ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and angular frequency ω = 2π''f''.

====Analysis====
The two-pole amplifier's transfer function leads to the closed-loop gain:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{FB} = \frac {A_0} {1+ \beta A_0}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp; • &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt; \  \frac {1} {1+j \omega \frac { \tau_1 + \tau_2 } {1 + \beta A_0} + (j \omega )^2 \frac { \tau_1 \tau_2} {1 + \beta A_0} }.  &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Conjugate poles in s-plane.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Figure 2: Conjugate pole locations for a two-pole feedback amplifier; ''Re''(s) = real axis and ''Im''(s) = imaginary axis.]]

The time dependence of the amplifier is easy to discover by switching variables to ''s'' = ''j''ω, whereupon the gain becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; A_{FB} = \frac {A_0} { \tau_1 \tau_2 }&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp; • &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {s^2 +s \left( \frac {1} {\tau_1} + \frac {1} {\tau_2} \right) + \frac {1+ \beta A_0} {\tau_1 \tau_2}} &lt;/math&gt;

The poles of this expression (that is, the zeros of the denominator) occur at:

:&lt;math&gt;2s = - \left( \frac {1} {\tau_1} + \frac {1} {\tau_2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt { \left( \frac {1} {\tau_1} - \frac {1} {\tau_2} \right) ^2 -\frac {4 \beta A_0 } {\tau_1 \tau_2 } },&lt;/math&gt;

which shows for large enough values of βA''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the square root becomes the square root of a negative number, that is the square root becomes imaginary, and the pole positions are complex conjugate numbers, either ''s''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; or ''s''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;; see Figure 2:

:&lt;math&gt; s_{\pm} = -\rho \pm j \mu, &lt;/math&gt;

with

::&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac {1}{2} \left( \frac {1} {\tau_1} + \frac {1} {\tau_2} \right ), &lt;/math&gt;

and
::&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac {1} {2} \sqrt { \frac {4 \beta A_0} { \tau_1 \tau_2} - \left( \frac {1} {\tau_1} - \frac {1} {\tau_2} \right)^2 }. &lt;/math&gt;
Using polar coordinates with the magnitude of the radius to the roots given by |''s''| (Figure 2):

:&lt;math&gt; | s | = |s_{ \pm } | =  \sqrt{ \rho^2 +\mu^2}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the angular coordinate φ is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \cos \phi = \frac { \rho} { | s | } , \sin \phi = \frac { \mu} { | s | }.&lt;/math&gt;
Tables of [[Laplace transforms]] show that the time response of such a system is composed of combinations of the two functions:

::&lt;math&gt; e^{- \rho t} \sin ( \mu t) \quad\text{and} \quad &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; e^{- \rho t} \cos ( \mu t), &lt;/math&gt;

which is to say, the solutions are damped oscillations in time. In particular, the unit step response of the system is:&lt;ref name=Kuo&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \left(\frac {A_0} {1+ \beta A_0}\right)\left(1 -   e^{- \rho t} \  \frac {  \sin \left( \mu t + \phi \right)}{ \sin( \phi )}\right)\ , &lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;S(t) = 1 -   e^{- \rho t} \  \frac {  \sin \left( \mu t + \phi \right)}{ \sin( \phi )}&lt;/math&gt;

when ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; tends to infinity and the feedback factor &amp;beta; is one.

Notice that the damping of the response is set by ρ, that is, by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier. In contrast, the frequency of oscillation is set by μ, that is, by the feedback parameter through β''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Because ρ is a sum of reciprocals of time constants, it is interesting to notice that ρ is dominated by the ''shorter'' of the two.

====Results====
[[Image:Step response for two-pole feedback amplifier.PNG|thumbnail|350px|Figure 3: Step-response of a linear two-pole feedback amplifier; time is in units of&amp;nbsp;1/ρ, that is, in terms of the time constants of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt;; curves are plotted for three values of ''mu''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''μ'', which is controlled by&amp;nbsp;β.]]
Figure 3 shows the time response to a unit step input for three values of the parameter μ. It can be seen that the frequency of oscillation increases with μ, but the oscillations are contained between the two asymptotes set by the exponentials [&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;exp&amp;nbsp;(−ρt)&amp;nbsp;] and [&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;exp(−ρt)&amp;nbsp;]. These asymptotes are determined by ρ and therefore by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier, independent of feedback.

The phenomenon of oscillation about the final value is called '''[[ringing (signal)|ringing]]'''. The '''[[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]]''' is the maximum swing above final value, and clearly increases with μ. Likewise, the '''undershoot''' is the minimum swing below final value, again increasing with μ. The '''[[settling time]]''' is the time for departures from final value to sink below some specified level, say 10% of final value.

The dependence of settling time upon μ is not obvious, and the approximation of a two-pole system probably is not accurate enough to make any real-world conclusions about feedback dependence of settling time. However, the asymptotes [&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;exp&amp;nbsp;(−ρt)&amp;nbsp;] and [&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;exp&amp;nbsp;(−ρt)&amp;nbsp;] clearly impact settling time, and they are controlled by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier, particularly the shorter of the two time constants. That suggests that a specification on settling time must be met by appropriate design of the open-loop amplifier.

The two major conclusions from this analysis are: 
#Feedback controls the amplitude of oscillation about final value for a given open-loop amplifier and given values of open-loop time constants,  τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
#The open-loop amplifier decides settling time. It sets the time scale of Figure 3, and the faster the open-loop amplifier, the faster this time scale.

As an aside, it may be noted that real-world departures from this linear two-pole model occur due to two major complications: first, real amplifiers have more than two poles, as well as zeros; and second, real amplifiers are nonlinear, so their step response changes with signal amplitude.
[[Image:Overshoot control.PNG|thumbnail|300px|Figure 4: Step response for three values of&amp;nbsp;α. Top: α &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4; Center: α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2; Bottom: α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5. As α is reduced the pole separation reduces, and the overshoot increases.]]

====Control of overshoot====
How overshoot may be controlled by appropriate parameter choices is discussed next.

Using the equations above, the amount of overshoot can be found by differentiating the step response and finding its maximum value. The result for maximum step response ''S''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is:&lt;ref name=Kuo2&gt;
{{cite book 
|author=Benjamin C Kuo &amp; Golnaraghi F
|title=p. 259
|isbn=0-471-13476-7 
|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-471-13476-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_\max= 1 + \exp \left( - \pi \frac { \rho }{ \mu } \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The final value of the step response is 1, so the exponential is the actual overshoot itself. It is clear the overshoot is zero if μ = 0, which is the condition:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {4 \beta A_0} { \tau_1 \tau_2} = \left( \frac {1} {\tau_1} - \frac {1} {\tau_2} \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

This quadratic is solved for the ratio of time constants by setting ''x'' = ( τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;1 / 2 &lt;/sup&gt; with the result

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{ \beta A_0 } + \sqrt { \beta A_0 +1 }. &lt;/math&gt;

Because β ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; 1, the 1 in the square root can be dropped, and the result is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \tau_1} { \tau_2} = 4 \beta A_0. &lt;/math&gt;

In words, the first time constant must be much larger than the second. To be more adventurous than a design allowing for no overshoot we can introduce a factor α in the above relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \tau_1} { \tau_2} = \alpha \beta A_0, &lt;/math&gt;

and let α be set by the amount of overshoot that is acceptable.

Figure 4 illustrates the procedure. Comparing the top panel (α = 4) with the lower panel (α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5) shows lower values for α  increase the rate of response, but increase overshoot. The case α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 (center panel) is the [[Butterworth filter#Maximal flatness|''maximally flat'']] design that shows no peaking in the [[Bode plot|Bode gain vs. frequency plot]]. That design has the [[rule of thumb]] built-in safety margin to deal with non-ideal realities like multiple poles (or zeros), nonlinearity (signal amplitude dependence) and manufacturing variations, any of which can lead to too much overshoot. The adjustment of the pole separation (that is, setting&amp;nbsp;α) is the subject of [[frequency compensation]], and one such method is [[pole splitting]].

====Control of settling time ====
The amplitude of ringing in the step response in Figure 3 is governed by the damping factor exp ( −ρ t ). That is, if we specify some acceptable step response deviation from final value, say Δ, that is:

:&lt;math&gt; S(t)  \le 1 + \Delta, &lt;/math&gt;

this condition is satisfied  regardless of the value of β ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; provided the time is longer than the settling time, say ''t''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, given by:&lt;ref&gt;This estimate is a bit conservative (long) because the factor 1 /sin(φ) in the overshoot contribution  to ''S'' ( ''t'' ) has been replaced by  1 /sin(φ)  &amp;asymp; 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta = e^{- \rho t_S }\text{ or }t_S = \frac { \ln \left( \frac{1} { \Delta} \right) } { \rho } = \tau_2 \frac {2 \ln \left( \frac{1} { \Delta} \right) } { 1 + \frac { \tau_2 } { \tau_1} } \approx 2 \tau_2 \ln \left( \frac{1} { \Delta} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where the  τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt;&amp;nbsp;τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is applicable because of  the overshoot control condition, which makes τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''αβA''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Often the settling time condition is referred to by saying the settling period is inversely proportional to the unity gain bandwidth,  because 1/(2π&amp;nbsp;τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is close to this bandwidth for an amplifier with typical [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|dominant pole compensation]]. However, this result is more precise than this [[rule of thumb]]. As an example of this formula, if Δ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/e&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.8 %, the settling time condition is  ''t''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In general, control of overshoot sets the time constant ratio, and settling time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; sets&amp;nbsp;τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Johns&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;According to Johns and Martin, ''op. cit.'', settling time is significant in [[switched capacitor|switched-capacitor circuits]], for example, where an op amp settling time must be less than half a clock period for sufficiently rapid charge transfer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== System Identification using the Step Response: System with two real poles ====
[[File:PT2 System Step-Reponse Diagram with required Measurements (2018).png|thumb|340x340px|Step response of the system with &lt;math&gt;x(t)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Measure the significant point &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t_{25}&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;t_{75}&lt;/math&gt;.]]
This method uses significant points of the step response. There is no need to guess tangents to the measures Signal. The equations are derived using numerical simulations, determining some significant ratios and fitting parameters of nonlinear equations. See also &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackaday.io/page/4829-identification-of-a-damped-pt2-system|title=Identification of a damped PT2 system {{!}} Hackaday.io|website=hackaday.io|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Here the steps:

* Measure the system step-response &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;of the system with an input step signal &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Determine the time-spans &lt;math&gt;t_{25}&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;t_{75}&lt;/math&gt;where the step response reaches 25% and 75% of the steady state output value.
* Determine the system steady-state gain &lt;math&gt;k=A_0&lt;/math&gt;with &lt;math&gt;k=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} \dfrac{y(t)}{x(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate

&lt;math&gt;r=\dfrac{t_{25}}{t_{75}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P=-18.56075\,r+\dfrac{0.57311}{r-0.20747}+4.16423&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X=14.2797\,r^3-9.3891\,r^2+0.25437\,r+1.32148&lt;/math&gt;
* Determine the two time constants

&lt;math&gt;\tau_2=T_2=\dfrac{t_{75}-t_{25}}{X\,(1+1/P)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tau_1=T_1=\dfrac{T_2}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate the transfer function of the identified system within the Laplace-domain

&lt;math&gt;G(s)=\dfrac{k}{(1+s\,T_1)\cdot(1+s\,T_2)}&lt;/math&gt;

====Phase margin====
[[Image:Phase for Step Response.PNG|thumbnail|280px|Figure 5: Bode gain plot to find phase margin; scales are logarithmic, so labeled separations are multiplicative factors. For example, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&amp;nbsp;dB&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''βA''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
Next, the choice of pole ratio τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is related to the phase margin of the feedback amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;The gain margin of the amplifier cannot be found using a two-pole model, because gain margin requires determination of the frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;180&lt;/sub&gt; where the gain flips sign, and this never happens in a two-pole system. If we know ''f''&lt;sub&gt;180&lt;/sub&gt; for the amplifier at hand, the gain margin can be found approximately, but ''f''&lt;sub&gt;180&lt;/sub&gt; then depends on the third and higher pole positions, as does the gain margin, unlike the estimate of phase margin, which is a two-pole estimate.&lt;/ref&gt;  The procedure outlined in the [[Bode plot#Examples using Bode plots|Bode plot]] article is followed. Figure 5 is the Bode gain plot for the two-pole amplifier in the range of frequencies up to the second pole position. The assumption behind Figure 5 is that the frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&amp;nbsp;dB&lt;/sub&gt; lies between the lowest pole at ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/(2πτ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and the second pole at ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/(2πτ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). As indicated in Figure 5, this condition is satisfied for values of&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

Using Figure 5 the frequency (denoted by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&amp;nbsp;dB&lt;/sub&gt;) is found where the loop gain β''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the unity gain or 0&amp;nbsp;dB condition, as defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; | \beta A_\text{OL} ( f_\text{0 db} ) | = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

The slope of the downward leg of the gain plot is (20&amp;nbsp;dB/decade); for every factor of ten increase in frequency, the gain drops by the same factor:

:&lt;math&gt; f_\text{0 dB} = \beta A_0 f_1. &lt;/math&gt;

The phase margin is the departure of the phase at ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&amp;nbsp;dB&lt;/sub&gt; from −180°. Thus, the margin is:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi_m = 180 ^\circ - \arctan (f_\text{0 dB} /f_1) - \arctan ( f_\text{0 dB} /f_2). &lt;/math&gt;

Because ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&amp;nbsp;dB&lt;/sub&gt; / ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''βA''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, the term in ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 90°. That makes the phase margin:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi_m = 90 ^\circ - \arctan ( f_\text{0 dB} /f_2) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = 90 ^\circ -  \arctan \left( \frac {\beta A_0 f_1} {\alpha \beta A_0 f_1 } \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = 90 ^\circ - \arctan \left( \frac {1} {\alpha } \right) = \arctan \left(  \alpha  \right). &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for case α = 1,  φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 45°, and for α = 2, φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 63.4°. Sansen&lt;ref name=Sansen3&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; recommends α = 3, φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 71.6° as a "good safety position to start with".

If α is increased by shortening τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the settling time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; also is shortened. If α is increased by lengthening τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the settling time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is little altered. More commonly, both τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''and'' τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; change, for example if the technique of [[pole splitting]] is used.

As an aside, for an amplifier with more than two poles, the diagram of Figure 5 still may be made to fit the Bode plots by making ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a fitting parameter, referred to as an "equivalent second pole" position.&lt;ref name=Palumbo&gt;

== Formal mathematical description ==
[[Image:Step response.jpg|right|frame|Figure 4: Black box representation of a dynamical system, its input and its step response.]]
This section provides a formal mathematical definition of  step response in terms of the abstract mathematical concept of a [[dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathfrak{S}&lt;/math&gt;: all notations and assumptions required for the following description are listed here. 
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t\in T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamical system (definition)|evolution parameter]] of the system,  called "[[time]]" for the sake of simplicity,
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{x}|_t\in M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamical system (definition)|state]] of the system at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, called "output" for the sake of simplicity,
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Phi:T\times M\longrightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamical system [[dynamical system (definition)|evolution function]],
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Phi(0,\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{x}_0\in M&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamical system [[dynamical system (definition)|initial state]],
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heaviside step function]]

=== Nonlinear dynamical system ===
For a general dynamical system, the step response is defined as follows:

::&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{x}|_t = \Phi_{\{H(t)\}} \left(t,{\boldsymbol{x}_0} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

It is the [[dynamical system (definition)|evolution function]] when the control inputs (or [[linear differential equation|source term]], or [[forcing input]]s) are Heaviside functions: the notation emphasizes this concept showing ''H''(''t'') as a subscript.

=== Linear dynamical system ===
For a [[linear system|linear]] [[Time-invariant system|time-invariant]] black box, let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathfrak{{S}}\ \equiv \ S&lt;/math&gt; for notational convenience: the step response can be obtained by [[convolution]] of the [[Heaviside step function]] control and the [[impulse response]] ''h''(''t'') of the system itself

::&lt;math&gt;a(t) = {h*H}(t) = {H*h}(t) = \int_{-\infty }^{+\infty} h(\tau) H(t - \tau ) \, d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^t h(\tau) \, d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

which for an LTI system is equivalent to just integrating the latter. Conversely, for an LTI system, the derivative of the step response yields the impulse response:

:: &lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\, a(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

However, these simple relations are not true for a non-linear or [[time-variant system]].&lt;ref name="Shmaliy2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuriy Shmaliy|title=Continuous-Time Systems|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6272-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silfurberg.jpg|right|thumb|290px|[[Iceland spar]], possibly the Icelandic medieval sunstone used to locate the sun in the sky when obstructed from view.]]
The '''sunstone''' ({{lang-is|sólarsteinn}}) is a type of [[mineral]] attested in several 13th–14th century written sources in [[Iceland]], one of which describes its use to locate the sun in a completely overcast sky. Sunstones are also mentioned in the inventories of several [[church (building)|church]]es and one [[monastery]] in 14th–15th century Iceland and  Germany.

A theory exists that the sunstone had [[Polarizer|polarizing]] attributes and was used as a [[History of navigation|navigation]] instrument by seafarers in the [[Viking Age]].&lt;ref name="thorkild"/&gt; A stone found in 2013 off [[Alderney]], in the wreck of a 16th-century warship, may lend evidence of the existence of sunstones as navigational devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Satter |first=Raphael |title=Researchers: We may have found a fabled sunstone |date=March 8, 2013 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/researchers-may-found-fabled-sunstone-103151097.html |publisher=Yahoo News |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
One [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] source in Iceland, "[[Rauðúlfs þáttr]]",&lt;ref name="jtp_1947"/&gt;&lt;ref name="faulkes66"/&gt; mentions the sunstone as a mineral by means of which the sun could be located in an overcast and snowy sky by holding it up and noting where it emitted, reflected or transmitted light (''hvar geislaði úr honum'').&lt;ref name="sample_guardian"/&gt; Sunstones are also mentioned in ''[[Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar]]'' (13th century)&lt;ref name="hgp87"/&gt; and in church and monastic inventories (14th–15th century) without discussing their attributes. The sunstone texts of ''Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar'' were copied to all four versions of the medieval [[hagiography]] ''[[Guðmundur Arason|Guðmundar saga góða]]''.&lt;ref name="karlsson_1983"/&gt;

The description in "Rauðúlfs þáttr" of the use of the sunstone is as follows:
{{Verse translation|lang=is|
{{noitalic|&lt;small&gt;In Icelandic:&lt;/small&gt;}}
Veður var þykkt og drífanda sem Sigurður hafði sagt. Þá lét konungur kalla til sín Sigurð og Dag. Síðan lét konungur sjá út og sá hvergi himin skýlausan. Þá bað hann Sigurð segja hvar sól mundi þá komin. Hann kvað glöggt á. Þá lét konungur taka sólarstein og hélt upp og sá hann hvar geislaði úr steininum og markaði svo beint til sem Sigurður hafði sagt.&lt;ref name="tt_trans"/&gt;
|
&lt;small&gt;Thorsteinn Vilhjalmsson translation:&lt;/small&gt;
The weather was thick and snowy as Sigurður had predicted. Then the king summoned Sigurður and Dagur (Rauðúlfur's sons) to him. The king made people look out and they could nowhere see a clear sky. Then he asked Sigurður to tell where the sun was at that time. He gave a clear assertion. Then the king made them fetch the solar stone and held it up and saw where light radiated from the stone and thus directly verified Sigurður's prediction.&lt;ref name="timetravel"/&gt;
}}

==Allegorical nature of the medieval texts==
Two of the original medieval texts on the sunstone are [[allegorical]]. ''Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar'' contains a burst of purely allegorical material associated with Hrafn’s slaying. This involves a celestial vision with three highly cosmological [[knight]]s, recalling the horsemen of the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref name="hgp87"/&gt; It has been suggested&lt;ref name="ein_grip"/&gt; that the horsemen of Hrafns saga contain allegorical allusions to the [[winter solstice]] and the [[classical element|four elements]] as an omen of Hrafn’s death, where the sunstone also appears.

"Rauðúlfs þáttr", a tale of [[Saint Olav]], and the only medieval source mentioning how the sunstone was used, is a thoroughly allegorical work.&lt;ref name="saintolaf"/&gt;  A round and rotating house visited by Olav has been interpreted as a model of the [[cosmos]] and the human [[soul]],&lt;ref name="hild_imagery"/&gt; as well as a [[wikt:prefiguration|prefiguration]] of the Church.&lt;ref name="loescher"/&gt; The intention of the author was to achieve an [[apotheosis]] of St. Olav, through placing him in the symbolic seat of [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="saintolaf"/&gt; The house belongs to the [[genre]] of "abodes of the sun,"  which seemed widespread in medieval literature.&lt;ref name="faulkes66"/&gt; St. Olav used the sunstone to confirm the time reckoning skill of his host right after leaving this allegorical house. He held the sunstone up against the snowy and completely overcast sky and noted where light was emitted from it (the Icelandic words used do not make it clear whether the light was reflected by the stone, emitted by it or transmitted through it). It has been suggested&lt;ref name="ein_grip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bragason"/&gt; that in "Rauðúlfs þáttr" the sunstone was used as a symbol of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]], following a widespread tradition in which the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] of Christ is compared with glass letting a ray of the sun through.&lt;ref name="abreeze"/&gt;

The allegories of the above-mentioned texts exploit the symbolic value of the sunstone, but the church and monastic inventories, however, show that something called sunstones did exist as physical objects in Iceland.&lt;ref name="foote_56"/&gt; The presence of the sunstone in "Rauðúlfs þáttr" may be entirely symbolic&lt;ref name="schnall75"/&gt; but its use is described in sufficient detail to show that the idea of using a stone to find the sun's position in overcast conditions was commonplace.&lt;ref name="ein_grip"/&gt;

==Possibility of sunstones for orientation and navigation==
Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou posited that the sunstone could have been one of the minerals ([[cordierite]] or [[Iceland spar]]) that [[Polarizer|polarize]] light and by which the [[azimuth]] of the sun can be determined in a partly overcast sky or when the sun is just below the horizon.&lt;ref name="thorkild"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thorkild_nav"/&gt; The principle is used by many animals&lt;ref name="animals"/&gt; and [[Polar route|polar flights]] applied the idea before more advanced techniques became available.&lt;ref name="skyc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kollsmanskycompass"/&gt; Ramskou further conjectured that the sunstone could have aided [[Longship#Navigation|navigation]] in the open sea in the Viking period. This idea has become very popular,&lt;ref name="peasoup"/&gt; and research as to how a sunstone could be used in nautical navigation continues.&lt;ref&gt;Horvàth, G. et al. (2011). 'On the trail of Vikings with polarized skylight: experimental study of the atmospheric optical prerequisites allowing polarimetric navigation by Viking seafarers' Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2011) 366, 772–782 {{doi|10.1098/rstb.2010.0194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in 2011 by Ropars et al.,&lt;ref name="Ropars11" /&gt; confirms that one can identify the direction of the sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye.  The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow [[Entoptic phenomenon|entoptic]] pattern on the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] of the eye. Alternatively a dot can be placed on top of crystal so that when you look at it from below, two dots appear, because the light is “depolarised” and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of the top face now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at the [[British Geological Survey]] in 2014 failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904813040|title=Science of the magical : from the Holy Grail to love potions to superpowers|last=1977-|first=Kaplan, Matt,|isbn=9781476777108|edition=First Scribner hardcover|location=New York|oclc=904813040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan communicated extensively with Ropars and neither could understand why the samples of Iceland spar that were being used during the trials did not reveal the sun's direction.

The recovery of an Iceland spar sunstone from an Elizabethan ship which sank near Alderney in 1592 suggests the possibility that the navigational technology may have persisted after the invention of the magnetic [[compass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shipwreck may contain near-mythical Viking navigation aid |work=[[The Raw Story]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=March 5, 2013 |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/03/05/shipwreck-may-contain-near-mythical-viking-navigation-aid/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the stone was found near a navigational instrument, its use remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57573239/researchers-may-have-found-a-viking-sunstone/ |title=Researchers may have found a Viking sunstone |work=[[CBS News]] |date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond nautical navigation, a [[Pleochroism|polarizing crystal]] would have been useful as a [[sundial]], especially at high [[latitude]]s with extended hours of twilight, in mountainous areas, or in partly overcast conditions. This use would require the polarizing crystal to be used in conjunction with known landmarks; churches and monasteries would have valued such an object as an aid to keep track of the [[canonical hours]].&lt;ref name="ein_grip"/&gt;

A Hungarian team proposed that a sun compass artifact with crystals might have allowed Vikings to guide their boats at night too. A type of crystal they called a sunstone can use scattered sun light from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that calcite stone crystals similar to one found amongst navigational tools on a sixteenth century sunken ship were used in combination with [[Haidinger's brush]]. If so, the Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where during the summer it never goes completely dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Balázs |last1=Bernáth |first2=Alexandra |last2=Farkas |first3=Dénes |last3=Száz |first4=Miklós |last4=Blahó |first5=Ádám |last5=Egri |first6=András |last6=Barta |first7=Susanne |last7=Åkesson |first8=Gábor |last8=Horváth |title=How could the Viking Sun compass be used with sunstones before and after sunset?

'''Sustainable electronics''' are electronic products made with no [[toxic chemicals]], recyclable parts, and reduced [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emission]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s during production. "Sustainability is still very new, emerging business concept. Because of that, we lack uniform guidelines or standards applicable per industry sector that can help companies establish best practices." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Key Sustainability Issues in the Electronics Industry: Sustainability Industry Report - SCM {{!}} Supply Chain Resource Cooperative (SCRC) {{!}} North Carolina State University|url = https://scm.ncsu.edu/scm-articles/article/key-sustainability-issues-in-the-electronics-industry-sustainability-indust|website = scm.ncsu.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brands ==

According to [[Rank a Brand]] Electronics Green Fair Ranking Report in 2014, none of the electronic brands met all of their green requirements for level A. The only company to reach level B was [[Fairphone]], who met 60% of their standards. Level C was awarded to Apple and Nokia with 45% and 40% respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dziamski|first1=Mario|title=Sustainable Electronics Report 2014|url=http://www.rankabrand.org/static/electronics-green-fair-ranking-report-2014.pdf|publisher=Rank a Brand e.V.|accessdate=22 December 2015|location=Berlin/ Amstgerdam|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the researched electronic brands were put into level D. These brands include Sony, Acer, Dell HP, Samsung, Motorola, Philips, Blackberry, Lenovo, Toshiba. They met less than 35% of the Rank a Brand criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rankabrand.org/static/electronics-green-fair-ranking-report-2014.pdf|title=Sustainable Electronics|last=Dziamski|first=Mario|date=June 2014|website=rankabrand.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rank a Brand generalizes their findings into 4 main categories: reporting on sustainability, climate protection, ecology, and fair labor. All brands report on sustainability. Nokia is the top brand for climate protection, and Fairphone is the top brand for both ecology and fair labor. Apple, although criticized for their sustainability efforts, is a strong second in all of these categories apart from ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/why-apple-wants-to-bust-your-iphone.html|title=Cracking the Apple Trap|last=Rampell|first=Catherine|date=29 October 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies who receive an E label are stamped with Electronic [[Greenwashing]] Alert, which means that consumer can not clearly find or understand their sustainability information and might find them self confused or misguided.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Use of hazardous chemicals ==

Many hazardous chemicals and materials are used in the production of electronics. These substances are further outlined in this page about [[Electronic waste#Electronic waste substances|electronic waste substances]].

No brand in 2014 had completely eliminated use of [[Phthalate]]s, [[beryllium]], [[antimony]], [[Brominated flame retardant|BFRs]], and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] in their productions, but [[Nokia]] and [[Motorola]] have the best track record by eliminating 3 out of 5 above mentioned chemicals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Benefits ==

"Sustainable [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] will enable us to protect and enhance human health and well-being and the environment over generations while minimizing the adverse life-cycle impacts of devices, infrastructure and services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sahle-Demessie|first1=E.|title=Sustainable Electronics Roadmap|url=http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-05/documents/roadmap.pdf|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=22 December 2015|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Electronics contain many chemicals that are known to cause issues with human health. A lot of these chemicals also easily seep into the environment, whether it be in soil, water or the air. A lot of e-waste is exported to third world countries such as China and India, where the waste is put in a landfill and the chemicals are allowed to seep into the environment. In the U.S. in 2011 only about 25% of e-waste was actually recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/about-us/campaign-platform/|title=Campaign Platform|last=|first=|date=|website=electronicstakeback.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://svtc.org/our-work/e-waste/|title=E-Waste|last=|first=|date=|website=svtc.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using sustainable electronics principles, such as Green Engineering, chemicals can be prevented from entering electronics in the first place, or can be removed properly once a product has reached the end of its life cycle.

The generation of natural bio-composites based electronics would remove the need for corrosive acids, currently used in [[Electronic waste]] recycling to recover precious metals.  In developing countries, the use of these chemicals is very common as it is cheap, however. These acids, primarily hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, create massive amounts of leaching which require further processing to prevent pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tansel|first=Berrin|date=2017-01-20|title=From electronic consumer products to e-wastes: Global outlook, waste quantities, recycling challenges|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2016.10.002|journal=Environment International|volume=98|pages=35–45|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2016.10.002|issn=0160-4120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their unregulated use is harmful for both the environment and the workers that utilize it. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Needhidasan|first=Santhanam|last2=Samuel|first2=Melvin|last3=Chidambaram|first3=Ramalingam|date=2014-01-20|title=Electronic waste – an emerging threat to the environment of urban India|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3908467/|journal=Journal of Environmental Health Science and Engineering|volume=12|pages=36|doi=10.1186/2052-336X-12-36|issn=2052-336X|pmc=3908467|pmid=24444377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of bio generated composites removes the need for acid digestion in the recycling process as current plastic based recycling methods suffice at collecting the recoverable metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Needhidasan|first=Santhanam|last2=Samuel|first2=Melvin|last3=Chidambaram|first3=Ramalingam|date=2014-01-20|title=Electronic waste – an emerging threat to the environment of urban India|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3908467/|journal=Journal of Environmental Health Science and Engineering|volume=12|pages=36|doi=10.1186/2052-336X-12-36|issn=2052-336X|pmc=3908467|pmid=24444377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green engineering is the process of using sustainable materials and methods to create products that can be used for long periods of time and can be taken apart and reused; ultimately fostering a sustainable way to build and use technology. Green engineering works to find solutions to the waste and hazardous materials that are frequently used in the building of technology today. The goals of green engineering are to use materials that will “conserve and improve natural ecosystems while protecting human health and well-being.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/green-engineering|title=About Green Engineering|last=|first=|date=17 August 2016|website=EPA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this, the EPA wants to have incentives to motivate companies and developers to have green engineering in mind when they produce their products. They want green engineering to become the norm as technology moves forward. The development of green engineering across communities and across the globe will promote a more sustainable way of life as humans continue to rely on technology to improve their daily lives.

'''Tristram Ogilvie Cary''', [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (14 May 1925{{spaced ndash}}24 April 2008) was a pioneering English-Australian [[composer]].&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9fcedf78&lt;/ref&gt; He was also active as a teacher and music critic.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/02/film.obituaries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tristram-cary-pioneer-of-electronic-music-817249.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cary was born in [[Oxford]], England, and educated at the [[Dragon School]] in Oxford and [[Westminster School]] in London. He was the third son and child of a pianist and the novelist [[Joyce Cary]], author of ''[[Mister Johnson]]''.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w9s3Kbi4wJ0C&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=%22tristram%20Cary%22%20third%20joyce%20-wikipedia&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tristram%20Cary%22%20third%20joyce%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false Joyce Cary Remembered: In Letters and Interviews by His Family and Others]&lt;/ref&gt; While working as a radar engineer for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II, he independently developed his own conception of electronic and tape music, and is regarded as among the earliest pioneers of these musical forms.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

Following World War II, he created one of the first electronic music studios, later travelling around Europe to meet the small numbers of other early pioneers of electronic music and composition. He studied arts at the [[University of Oxford]] and went on to study composition, conducting, piano, viola and horn at [[Trinity College London]].&lt;ref name=jo&gt;Jo Litson, "Maestro with a motherboard", ''Weekend Australian'', 11–12 November 2000, Review, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Peter Zinovieff]] and [[David Cockerell]], he founded [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd]], which created the first commercially available portable synthesiser, the [[EMS VCS 3]], and was then involved in production of such distinctive EMS products as the [[EMS Synthi 100]].

In 1967 he created an electronic music studio at the [[Royal College of Music]].&lt;ref name=jo/&gt; This led to an invitation from the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1973 for a lecture tour, which in turn led to an invitation to become the Visiting Composer at the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1974. He remained there as a lecturer until 1986. He also wrote music criticism for ''[[The Australian]]''.&lt;ref name=jo/&gt;

==Musical works==
His concert works of note include a [[Sonata (music)|Sonata]] for [[guitar]] (1959), ''Continuum'' for [[Compact Cassette|tape]] (1969), a [[cantata]] ''Peccata Mundi'' (1972), ''Contours and Densities at First Hill'' for [[orchestra]] (1972), a [[Nonet (music)|Nonet]] (1979), [[String Quartet]] No. 2 (1985) and ''The Dancing Girls'' for [[orchestra]] (1991).

Cary is also particularly well known for his film and television music. He wrote music for the [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (including the first [[Dalek]] story&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Thomas (author)|Chris Thomas]], ''Music-maker for the Daleks'', p.41, [[The West Australian]]'', 12 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as the score for the [[Ealing comedy]] ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ae6de59&lt;/ref&gt; Later film scores included ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967) and ''[[Blood from the Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1971), both for [[Hammer horror|Hammer]].&lt;ref name=bfi/&gt; He also composed the score for the ABC TV animated version of ''[[A Christmas Carol (1971 film)|A Christmas Carol]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (1975), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; and the children's Animated special ''[[Katya and the Nutcracker]]

Cary was one of the first British composers to work in [[musique concrète]]. In 1967 he created the first electronic music studio of the [[Royal College of Music]]. He built another at his home in [[Suffolk]], which he transported to Australia when he emigrated there, and incorporated it into the [[University of Adelaide]] where he worked as a lecturer until 1986.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/26/db2601.xml Tristram Cary], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He provided the visual design for the EMS [[VCS3]] synthesizer.&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt;

==Death==
Cary died in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on 24 April 2008, aged 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=31273_0_2_0_C Tristram Cary is no longer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Cary won the 1977 [[Albert H. Maggs Composition Award]]. He was awarded the [[Order of Australia|Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 1991 in recognition of service to music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870332&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true CARY, Tristram Ogilvie], ''It's an Honour'' (Australian Government), 10 June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20021016052118/http://www.adelaidecritics.com/html/thelifetimeachievers.html lifetime achievement award] from the Adelaide Critics' Circle for his contribution to music in England and Australia.

The '''Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits''' (UCP) is a set of rules on the issuance and use of [[letters of credit]]. The UCP is utilized by [[bankers]] and commercial parties in more than 175 countries in [[trade finance]]. Some 11-15% of [[international trade]] utilizes letters of credit, totaling over a trillion dollars (US) each year.

Historically, the commercial parties, particularly banks, have developed the techniques and methods for handling letters of credit in international [[trade finance]]. This practice has been standardized by the ICC ([[International Chamber of Commerce]]) by publishing the UCP in 1933 and subsequently updating it throughout the years. The ICC has developed and moulded the UCP by regular revisions, the current version being the UCP600. The result is the most successful international attempt at unifying rules ever, as the UCP has substantially universal effect. The latest revision was approved by the Banking Commission of the ICC at its meeting in Paris on 25 October 2006. This latest version, called the UCP600, formally commenced on 1 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-uniform-customs-and-practice-for-documentary-credits-ucp-600-leaflet-format-set-of-25 | title = ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits | accessdate = 29 January 2013 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICC and the UCP==

A significant function of  the ICC is the preparation and promotion of its uniform rules of practice. The ICC’s aim is to provide a codification of international practice occasionally selecting the best practice after ample debate and consideration. The ICC rules of practice are designed by bankers and merchants and not by legislatures with political and local considerations. The rules accordingly demonstrate the needs, customs and practices of business. Because the rules are incorporated voluntarily into contracts, the rules are flexible while providing a stable base for international review, including judicial scrutiny. International revision is thus facilitated permitting the incorporation of the changing practices of the commercial parties. ICC, which was established in 1919, had as its primary objective facilitating the flow of international trade at a time when nationalism and protectionism threatened the easing of world trade. It was in that spirit that the UCP were first introduced – to alleviate the confusion caused by individual countries’ promoting their own national rules on letter of credit practice. The aim was to create a set of contractual rules that would establish uniformity in practice, so that there would be less need to cope with often conflicting national regulations. The universal acceptance of the UCP by practitioners in countries with widely divergent economic and judicial systems is a testament to the rules’ success.

==UCP600==

The latest (July 2007) revision of UCP is the sixth revision of the rules since they were first promulgated in 1933. It is the outcome of more than three years of work by the ICC's Commission on Banking Technique and Practice.

The UCP remain the most successful set of private rules for trade ever developed. A range of individuals and groups contributed to the current revision including: the UCP Drafting Group, which waded through more than 5000 individual comments before arriving at this final text; the UCP Consulting Group, consisting of members from more than 25 countries, which served as the advisory body; the more than 400 members of the ICC Commission on Banking Technique and Practice who made pertinent suggestions for changes in the text; and 130 ICC National Committees worldwide which took an active role in consolidating comments from their members.

During the revision process, notice was taken of the considerable work that had been completed in creating the '''International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/international-standard-banking-practice-3 | title = International Standard Banking Practice ISBP 745 | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICC Publication 745. This publication has evolved into a necessary companion to the UCP for determining compliance of documents with the terms of [[letters of credit]]. It is the expectation of the Drafting Group and the Banking Commission that the application of the principles contained in the ISBP, including subsequent revisions thereof, will continue during the time UCP 600 is in force. At the time UCP 600 is implemented, there will be an updated version of the ISBP (the most recent one being the 2013 revision) to bring its contents in line with the substance and style of the new rules.


Note that UCP600 does not automatically apply to a credit if the credit is silent as to which set of rules it is subject to. A credit issued by SWIFT MT700 is no longer subject by default to the current UCP; it has to be indicated in field 40E, which is designated for specifying the "applicable rules".

Where a credit is issued subject to UCP600, the credit will be interpreted in accordance with the entire set of 39 articles contained in UCP600. However, exceptions to the rules can be made by express modification or exclusion. For example, the parties to a credit may agree that the rest of the credit shall remain valid despite the beneficiary's failure to deliver an installment. In such case, the credit has to nullify the effect of article 32 of UCP600, such as by wording the credit as: "The credit will continue to be available for the remaining installments notwithstanding the beneficiary's failure to present complied documents of an installment in accordance with the installment schedule."

==eUCP==

The eUCP was developed as a supplement to UCP due to the sense at the time that [[bank]]s and corporates together with the transport and insurance industries were ready to use electronic commerce. The hope and expectation that surrounded the development of eUCP has failed the UCP600 and it will remain as a supplement albeit slightly amended to identify its relationship with UCP600.

An updated version of the eUCP came into effect on 1 July 2007 to coincide the commencement of the UCP600. There are no substantive changes to the eUCP, merely references to the UCP600.

==CDCS==
The Certificate for Documentary Credit Specialists (CDCS) is the leading qualification for documentary credit specialists. Recognised worldwide as a benchmark of competence for international practitioners, it enables documentary credit specialists to demonstrate practical knowledge and understanding of the complex issues associated with documentary credit practice such as:

* Documentary credits - types, characteristics and uses, including standby credits
* Rules and trade terms, including '''ISBP 745''', '''ISP 98''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/isp-98-international-standby-practices | title = ISP 98- International Standby Practices | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''UCP 600''', '''URR 725'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-uniform-rules-for-bank-to-bank-reimbursements-under-documentary-credits | title = ICC Uniform Rules for Bank-to-Bank Reimbursements under Documentary Credits | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Incoterms 2010'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2010 | title = Incoterms 2010 - English edition | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Types and methods of payment / credit used in documentary credit transactions

CDCS was developed by the Institute of Financial Services and Bankers Association for Finance and Trade (formerly IFSA), in partnership with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The qualification was first examined in 1999 and has seen a rapid growth in the uptake of the programme across the world.

The Certificate is examined in over 30 countries each year and is taught through distance learning and self-study over a four-month period. The CDCS assessment involves a three-hour multiple-choice examination of 70 questions, designed to test knowledge and its application to real-life situations. Once a practitioner has achieved the qualification, they have the right to add the professional designation of ‘CDCS’ after their name for a period of three years.

After the three-year period a process of Re-Certification is required where the professional has to provide evidence of Continued Professional Development to maintain the accreditation or re-sit the examination.

A '''vessel traffic service''' ('''VTS''') is a marine traffic monitoring system established by harbour or port authorities, similar to [[air traffic control]] for aircraft.  Typical VTS systems use [[radar]], [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV), [[VHF]] [[radiotelephony]] and [[automatic identification system]] to keep track of vessel movements and provide navigational safety in a limited geographical area.

== VTS personnel ==
The VTS guidelines (see VTS Manual IALA, Edition 6, Chapter 12, for general reference) require that the VTS authority should be provided with sufficient staff, appropriately qualified, suitably trained and capable of performing the tasks required, taking into consideration the type and level of services to be provided in conformity with the current IMO guidelines on the subject.

[[International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities|IALA]] Recommendation V-103 is the Recommendation on Standards for Training and Certification of VTS Personnel. There are four associated model courses V103/1 to V-103/4 which are approved by IMO and should be used when training VTS personnel for the VTS qualifications.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;VTS Manual IALA, Edition 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information service ==
[[File:VH14 sign.jpg|thumb|Sign telling mariners to contact the [[Port of London]] VTS as they enter the [[Thames Barrier]] control zone]]
An information service is a service to ensure that essential information becomes available in time for on-board navigational decision-making.

The information service is provided by broadcasting information at fixed times and intervals or when deemed necessary by the VTS or at the request of a vessel, and may include for example reports on the position, identity and intentions of other traffic; waterway conditions; weather; hazards; or any other factors that may influence the vessel's transit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Traffic organization service ==
A traffic organization service is a service to prevent the development of dangerous maritime traffic situations and to provide for the safe and efficient movement of vessel traffic within the VTS area.

The traffic organization service concerns the operational management of traffic and the forward planning of vessel movements to prevent congestion and dangerous situations, and is particularly relevant in times of high traffic density or when the movement of special transports may affect the flow of other traffic. The service may also include establishing and operating a system of traffic clearances or VTS sailing plans or both in relation to priority of movements, allocation of space, mandatory reporting of movements in the VTS area, routes to be followed, speed limits to be observed or other appropriate measures which are considered necessary by the VTS authority.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Navigational assistance service ==

A navigational assistance service is a service to assist on-board navigational decision-making and to monitor its effects.

The navigational assistance service is especially important in difficult navigational or meteorological circumstances or in case of defects or deficiencies. This service is normally rendered at the request of a vessel or by the VTS when deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
