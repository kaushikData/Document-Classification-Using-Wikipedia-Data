[[File:Chiran high school girls wave kamikaze pilot.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chiran, Kagoshima|Chiran]] school girls wave farewell to a departing pilot with branches of [[cherry blossoms]]]]
The airbase at [[Chiran, Kagoshima|Chiran]], [[Minamikyūshū, Kagoshima|Minamikyūshū]], on the [[Satsuma Peninsula]] of [[Kagoshima prefecture|Kagoshima]], Japan, served as the departure point for hundreds of [[Japanese Special Attack Units|Special Attack]] or [[kamikaze]] sorties launched in the final months of [[World War II]]. A [[peace museum]] dedicated to the pilots, the {{nihongo|'''Chiran Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots'''|知覧特攻平和会館|Chiran Tokkō-Heiwa-Kaikan}}, now marks the site.

==Airbase==
The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] airbase at [[Chiran, Kagoshima]], with its two runways, was the principal kamikaze base during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. Of the 1,036 army aviators who died in these attacks, 439 were from Chiran. Of the total number, 335 were classed as "young boy pilots" (少年飛行兵).&lt;ref name="Official Guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.minamikyushu.lg.jp/contents/file/20110121145009.pdf |title=Chiran Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots (NB downloads slowly) |publisher=City of [[Minamikyushu, Kagoshima|Minamikyushu]] |accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace Museum==
[[File:Ki-43 Hayabuya Kagoshima Japan.jpg|thumb|Ki-43 Hayabuya]]
In 1975 a museum was built to commemorate the lives of the pilots and document their "[[patriotism|patriotic]] efforts for peace".&lt;ref name="Official Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/spn/kagoshima/map_plus_info/locations.html |title=Chiran |publisher=[[Japan National Tourism Organization]] |accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enlarged in 1986, exhibits include four planes: a [[Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa]], a 1943 [[Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien]], a 1944 [[Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate]], and a [[Mitsubishi Zero]] recovered from the seabed in 1980.  On a personal level, the exhibit includes letters, poems, essays, testaments, and other artefacts; as well as photographs of the 1,036 pilots, arranged in the order in which they died.  There is also the grand piano on which two of the pilots played the ''[[Moonlight Sonata]]'' the night before their final mission.&lt;ref name="Official Guide"/&gt;

==Other monuments==
The {{nihongo|Tokkō Kannondō|特攻観音堂}} is a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temple]] dedicated to the "Special Attack [[Kannon|Goddess of Mercy]]".&lt;ref name="Official Guide"/&gt; The [[Cult image|image]] enshrined within is a 1.8m replica [[Japanese sculpture|statue]] of the Yumechigai Kannon (夢違観音 Dream-Changing [[Kannon]]), a [[List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)|National Treasure]] at [[Hōryū-ji]].&lt;ref name="Official Guide"/&gt; The names of the kamikaze pilots are written on paper within her [[Womb Realm|womb]].&lt;ref name="Official Guide"/&gt; It was erected in 1955 thanks to donations collected by Tome Torihama, who ran the Tomiya Inn frequented by the pilots, and who sought to redeem their [[Collective memory|memory]] after the war.&lt;ref name="Tome Torihama"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,344136,00.html |title=Ascent of the Fireflies |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author=Cullen, Lisa Takeuchi |date=26 August 2002 |accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tōrō|Stone lanterns]] dedicated to the pilots line the approach to the museum.

[[File:Sant'Egidio.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sant'Egidio (Church)|church of Sant'Egidio]] in Rome, seat of the community of Sant'Egidio]]
The '''Community of Sant'Egidio''' ({{lang-it|Comunità di Sant'Egidio}}) is a Christian community that is officially recognized by the [[Catholic Church]] as a "Church public lay association". It claims 50,000 members in more than 70 countries.  Its main activities are:

* [[prayer]], centered on a reading of the [[Bible]]
* spreading the [[Gospel]] to help people who are looking for a sense to their life.
* service to the [[poverty|poor]], which is free and unpaid
* commitment to [[ecumenism]] (the Community of Sant'Egidio is also ecumenical, though rooted in the Catholic Church)
* [[Interfaith|dialogue]] with members of other religions and non-believers.

Created as an NGO in 1968 it acts in more than 70 countries.

Today the Community has expanded greatly since its creator [[Andrea Riccardi]] created it in 1968 and now has more than 50,000 members.

==History==
The Community of Sant'Egidio was founded in [[Rome]] in 1968 by a group of Roman high-school students led by [[Andrea Riccardi]] in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]] under the papacy of [[Pope Paul VI]]. It is named after the Roman [[Church of Sant'Egidio]] (Italian for [[Saint Giles]]) in [[Trastevere]], its first permanent meeting place.  Since 1968, the community has gathered each night to pray and read from the Bible, reflecting on the Gospel, eventually spreading throughout the world with a mission of helping those in need.

In 1973, Sant Egidio founded his first church in Trastevere (the first church in that community) and from that moment the community of Sant'Egidio grew all over the world with the strange custom of daily community prayer. From 1977-1978 began to expand between the different Italian cities and in the 80s began to spread across the different continents. On May 18, 1986, the council of the laity named the community of Sant'Egidio as "an international association of the faithful of pontifical right".

Their activities include setting up refuges for the old, hospices for AIDS patients, and printing a handbook titled "Where to Eat, Sleep, and Wash in Rome" as gifts to the homeless. The lay Catholic Community of Sant'Egidio is among global leaders on HIV/AIDS, running programs across Africa, pushing scientific research ''inter alia'' on mother-child transmission, and advocating passionately that everyone deserves the best care.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Katherine. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katherine-marshall/aids-from-judgment-to-hope_b_1127943.html AIDS: From Judgment to Hope], ''Huffington Post'', 12/6/11. Retrieved 12/6/11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The charitable efforts of Sant'Egidio also led it to be a well-regarded mediator in peace negotiations. In the late 1980s, the Community came to the realization that their humanitarian efforts in [[Mozambique]], then torn by the [[Mozambican Civil War]], could not succeed without peace.  In 1990, the Community was accepted by the ruling [[FRELIMO]] and rebel [[Mozambican National Resistance]] as a mediator, playing a key role in the [[Rome General Peace Accords]] signed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/organizations/community-of-sant-egidio "Community of Sant'Egidio", Berkley Center, Georgetown University]&lt;/ref&gt; They continue peace initiatives in [[Algeria]] (notably the 1995 [[Sant'Egidio Platform]]), the [[Balkans]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and other areas, in the belief that war is the "mother of every poverty".

The community of Sant'Egidio shows its commitment against the [[death penalty]] by maintaining penpalships with many Death convicts, collecting signatures for a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] of executions and inviting cities around the world to take part in the [[Cities for Life Day]]. One of the members of the community spearheading the movement against the death penalty, [[Mario Marazziti]], published an English-language book on the topic, [[13 Ways of Looking at the Death Penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=13 Ways of Looking at the Death Penalty |first=Mario |last=Marazziti |year=2015 |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president of the Community is [[Marco Impagliazzo]].

==Governance==
Being a large community there are several positions:
* '''World President:''' Charge of all the communities of Saint Egidio of the world (Rome, Italy)
* '''National President:''' Responsible for all the communities in your country
* '''President of the community (centers):''' head of the community building, responsible for organizing charity events, activities, solidarity programs.
*'''Volunteers:''' People who present themselves without receiving any salary just to help those in need.

The President and the Council of Presidency are elected every five years by the General Assembly of representatives of all nuclei of communities (if there are several communities in that country).

==Works==
[[File:Mapa_san_egidi_ff.jpg|thumb|Map of the world of the community of Santo Edigio]]

It is active in:
*Europe: 23 countries

Although in countries with problems this NGO always helps them in what they can in giving them food and place to live. There are several Volunteer programs that are dedicated to accompanying those people who are alone or do not have anyone to go see them.

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Bangladesh.svg|150px]]}}
'''Corruption in Bangladesh''' has been a continuing problem. According to all major ranking institutions, Bangladesh routinely finds itself among the most corrupt countries in the world.&lt;ref name="anticorruptionportal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/south-asia/bangladesh/show-all.aspx|title=Business Corruption in Bangladesh|date=December 2015|website=Business Anti-corruption Portal|publisher=Business Anti-corruption Portal|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 143rd place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public sectors conducted by the Government are the most corrupted sectors of the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zafarullah|first=Habib|last2=Siddiquee|first2=Noore Alam|date=1 December 2001|title=Dissecting Public Sector Corruption in Bangladesh: Issues and Problems of Control|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1013740000213|journal=Public Organization Review|language=en|volume=1|issue=4|pages=465–486|doi=10.1023/A:1013740000213|issn=1566-7170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh|Anti Corruption Commission]] is formed in 2004, but is considered to be largely ineffective in investigating and preventing corruption because of governmental control over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ACC largely ineffective |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/acc-largely-ineffective-25194 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=21 May 2014 |access-date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://govpoliju.com/anti-corruption-commission-and-political-government-an-evaluation-of-awami-league-regime-2009-2012/|title=Anti Corruption Commission and Political Government: An Evaluation of Awami League Regime (2009–2012) {{!}} Government and Politics, JU|website=govpoliju.com|access-date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Corruption ==
After splitting from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh was ruled by a series of civilian and military governments. Riots surrounding the 2014 elections resulted in hundreds of deaths and [[Freedom House]] changed the country's "political rights" rating from 3 to 4 (with 1 being best, 7 worst). This was only one incident, however, in a modern history of highly fatal political violence.&lt;ref name=trans&gt;{{cite web| title =Bangladesh: Overview of corruption and anti-corruption with a focus on the health sector| work =Transparency International | url =http://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/Country_profile_Bangladesh_2015_Focus_on_health.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's score for rule of law on the Worldwide Governance Indicators declined from 28.6 (on a scale of 0–100) in 2011 to 22.7 in 2013. Although Bangladesh has experienced notable social and economic progress since around the turn of the century, it remains one of the world's poorest nations, with 76.5% in 2010 living on less than US$2 a day.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Corruption by sector==

Bribery, rent-seeking and inappropriate use of government funds, excessive lobbying, long time delays in service performance, pilferage, irresponsible conduct from the government officials, bureaucratic intemperance have made public sector departments the most corrupt sectors of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Khan |first=Mohammad Mohabbat |date=July 2003 |title=State of Governance in Bangladesh |journal=The Round Table |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=92 |issue=370 |pages=391–405 |doi=10.1080/0035853032000111116 |issn=0035-8533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public sectors in Bangladesh include police departments, fire departments, water supply, electricity, gas supply, education, waste disposal, health, transportation, administration etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladesh.com/public-services/ |title=Public Services in Bangladesh |website=bangladesh.com |access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}

A 2012 study found that 97% of MPs were involved in illegal activities, with 77% abusing their positions on local election boards, 75% abusing development projects for their own benefit, including accepting commissions in exchange for approving projects or programs, 53% being involved in outright criminal acts, 69% influencing procurement decisions, and 62% influential local elections.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Fully 45% of Bangladeshis view political parties as corrupt, while 41% regard the parliament as corrupt. Only the police and the judiciary are viewed as more corrupt. Many politicians are regarded as out-and-out criminals, while the parties also "are believed to harbour criminals and terrorists," according to ''TI Bangladesh''. The parties routinely exchange party funds for favours or pay them out because of extortion. They also improperly use state funds to buy jobs, licenses, and contracts for party members and other purposes. Party finances are largely non-transparent; despite regulations requiring reporting to the election commission, reports are scanty or absent and non-compliance is rarely punished. Also, both the parliament and the political parties are under the influence of business, with 56% of MPs now being business people.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

On 29 August 2012, Anti Corruption Commission of Bangladesh said that they have the information that [[Syed Modasser Ali]], adviser to the prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina]], allegedly influenced [[Sonali Bank]] authorities into granting scam loan to the controversial [[Hallmark-Sonali Bank Loan Scam|Hallmark Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-247643|title=Adviser's shadow in Hallmark scam|date=30 August 2012|newspaper=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government ==
Corruption abounds in Bangladeshi government offices. Many officials receive salaries without having any actual assigned work. Officials are recruited and promoted for reasons that are not objectively clear. Solicitation of bribes is common. In a 2013 survey, 76% of respondents said corruption was a problem in the public sector, and 39% said they had paid a bribe during the previous 12 months. Bribes were especially common when dealing with the police (72%), the judiciary (63%), land services (44%), and registry and permit services (33%). Bribes were paid to obtain a service (58%), to speed up service (33%), to express thanks (7%), or to obtain cheaper services (3%). These numbers, though unimpressive, mark a significant improvement over 2010.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

In 2010, then president [[Zillur Rahman]] pardoned twenty convicted murderers of Shabbir Ahmed Gamma.

[[Padma Bridge Scandal]], occurred in 2011, was the largest political scandal in [[Bangladesh]] that involved the ruling Bangladesh Awami League's government who allegedly sought a large amount money from the Canadian construction company [[SNC-Lavalin]] in exchange for awarding them the construction contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/12/12/125661.php|title=Padma Bridge Chronology|website=www.observerbd.com|access-date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ebangladesh.com/3904|title=Timeline: The WB, Padma bridge &amp; Abul Hossain|date=26 July 2012|newspaper=E-Bangladesh|language=en-US|access-date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public services===
The public sectors are among the country's most corrupt. In few countries is bribery more common in connection with public utilities. Nearly six out of ten firms report that they have to offer bribes, "gifts," or facilitation payments in exchange for licenses or public utility concessions or to  "get things done." Unclear, contradictory regulations abound, and are often exploited by officials seeking informal payments.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;&lt;ref name="trans2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015|title=Transparency International – The Global Anti-Corruption Coalition|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|access-date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land administration===
Corruption is widespread in the Bangladeshi land administration. Most companies expect to make informal payments in exchange for construction permits. In a country where land is scarce, title disputes are common, and title registration takes much longer than is the average in South Asia. The collapse of an eight-story factory in April 2013 was the result of substantial building code violations, and highlighted the role of corruption in the issuance of permits and licenses and in safety inspections.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Tax administration===
The Bangladeshi tax system is highly corrupt. In no country is it more common to be charged irregular payments in connection with taxation. More than forty percent of firms surveyed expected to present tax officials with gifts. Because the National Board of Revenue is poorly administered, tax collectors are able to collude with taxpayers, accepting personal payments in exchange for lower tax rates.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Public procurement===
The awarding of government contracts in Bangladesh very frequently involves nepotism, fraud, bribery, and favouritism. Nearly half of companies surveyed expect to make irregular payments to secure government contracts. The Public Procurement Act, Public Procurement Rules, and other legislation are intended to guarantee above-board conduct in this sector, but they are at best poorly enforced.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

=== Judiciary ===
The Bangladeshi judicial system is inefficient and under the influence of the executive branch. Political appointments, promotions, and firings are routine, and it can be difficult to enforce contracts and resolve disputes.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; The payment of bribes in exchange for favourable verdicts is common. Prosecutors, who earn only $37.50 ??? a month, are especially susceptible to bribery.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

==== Politics of trial ====
In Bangladesh, generally government files politically motivated cases against oppositions, and these cases get withdrawn or quashed when they gets to the government again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/withdrawal-of-political-cases-rule-of-law-stripped-away-14759|title=Withdrawal of political cases: Rule of law stripped away|date=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bangladesh Police ====

Low salaries and poor training make the police susceptible to bribery as well. The force is characterised by political patronage and a culture of impunity.

=== Banking ===
In 2015, it was revealed that some Bangladeshi accounts of [[HSBC]] were involved in money laundering activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.newagebd.net/93938/bangladeshi-accounts-linked-to-hsbc-tax-scandal/|title=Bangladeshi accounts linked to HSBC tax scandal – New Age|date=10 February 2015|newspaper=New Age|language=en-GB|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HSBC]] was also involved in tax evasion activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdchronicle.com/detail/news/32/14529|title=Tax evasion scandal: Bangladesh Bank to inspect HSBC's local office  {{!}} Bdchronicle.com|website=BD Chronilce|language=en|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health and hygiene ===
A 2012 Survey by Transparency International Bangladesh showed that 40.2% of the people fell victim to the irregularities and corruptions in public hospitals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/health/2014/nov/07/tib-health-sector-sickened-bribery-and-corruption|title=TIB: Health sector sickened with bribery and corruption|last=Azad|first=Abid|date=7 November 2014|newspaper=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors, nurses and other professionals working in government-run public hospitals have long been accused of demanding bribes for services which are supposed to be provided free of cost.&lt;ref name="irinhealth"&gt;{{citation|title=Activists are calling for stronger action to address rising levels of corruption in Bangladesh's troubled public health care system|date=12 February 2013|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/97454/bangladeshi-health-sector-corruption-hits-poor-hardest|author=A.M.

The survey reported that there is lack of regulation from the government in the private health care sector. The medical practitioners in these sector earn money by driving up health care costs and commission agreements with diagnostic centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TIB: Health sector sickened with bribery and corruption|date=7 November 2014|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/health/2014/nov/07/tib-health-sector-sickened-bribery-and-corruption|author=Abid Azad|publisher=Dhaka Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to patients, even in emergency needs, they were unable to access services unless a bribe is paid first.&lt;ref name="irinhealth" /&gt;

== Business ==
Companies have been reported to be subjected to expensive and useless license and permit requirements.&lt;ref name="anticorruptionportal" /&gt; In 2014–2015, business executives said corruption was the second largest obstacle to doing business in Bangladesh. Business people are often expected to bribe public officials, often in connection with annual taxes. Fully 48% of companies have been asked to pay bribes, and most firms seeking licenses are asked for bribes, with 55% of construction permits, 77% of import licenses, 56% of water connection arrangements and 48% of electricity connection arrangements involving bribes.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Politicians are involved in giving contracts to foreign companies by taking bribes or kickbacks in closed-door negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bribe/2009/08/bangladesh-a-dirty-deal-back-fires.html|title=Bangladesh: The Blowback of Corruption|date=21 August 2009|website=PBS.org|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation.|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/06/29/world-bank-statement-padma-bridge|title=World Bank Statement on Padma Bridge|date=29 June 2012|website=The World Bank|publisher=The World Bank|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major public contracts are often said to involve corruption. Fully 49% of companies said they had to present "gifts" to win state contracts, with those "gifts" averaging a value of 3% of the contract value.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Business owners do not obey proper safety codes of the buildings and workplaces. As a result, several large accidents occurred and killed hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/in_bangladesh_corruption_kills_hundreds|title=In Bangladesh, corruption kills hundreds – Transparency International|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garment industry is also rife with corruption, with leaders in the industry obtaining tax concessions, gaining special access to infrastructure, and ignoring with impunity official safety and security regulations. Because of this brand of corruption, the Rana Plaza factory complex collapsed, killing over 1200. Owing to corruption, the builders had been able to ignore many construction regulations.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Various international sources provided $2.9&amp;nbsp;billion to build the Padma Multilateral Purpose Bridge near Dhaka in 2011. After the World Bank learned in 2012 of "a high-level corruption conspiracy among politicians, businessmen, and private individuals" in connection with the bridge, support for the project was withdrawn by several of the sources.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Transparency International attributes the ubiquity and high level of corruption in Bangladesh to the power of business interests over the political parties and parliament.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

==Anti-corruption==

=== Anti Corruption Commission ===
{{Main|Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh}}
Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh (ACC) was formed through an act promulgated on 23 February 2004 that came into force on 9 May 2004. The commission is often criticised for being ineffective and a wastage of resources due to the influence of the government over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syeda Naushin Parnini|first=|date=2011|year=|title=Governance Reforms and Anti-Corruption Commission in Bangladesh|url=http://www.sar.org.ro/polsci/?p=587|department=Governance and Corruption|journal=The Romanian Journal of Political Science|series=|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Corruption Commission of Bangladesh is crippled by the 2013 amendment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/151739/bd-s-anti-corruption-body-made-ineffective|title=BD's anti-corruption body made ineffective|date=11 August 2005|newspaper=DAWN.COM|language=en|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Anti Corruption Commission Act introduced by the ruling [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] government, which makes it necessary for the commission to obtain permissions from the government to investigate or file any charge against government bureaucrats or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Anti-corruption Commission (Amendment) Bill Unconstitutional, discriminatory, self-defeating|date=14 November 2013|url=http://www.ti-bangladesh.org/beta3/index.php/en/report-s/3883-anti-corruption-commission-amendment-bill-unconstitutional-discriminatory-self-defeating|author=Iftekhar Zaman, Executive Director of Transparency International Bangladesh|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the ACC investigated the case of [[Padma Bridge Scandal]]. Even though the [[World Bank]] continuously pressed the government to take actions against the perpetrators, after 53 days' of investigation, ACC found nobody to be guilty. On the basis of ACC's report, Dhaka district judge court acquitted all the seven government officials who were believed to be involved in the corruption plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/all-padma-bridge-graft-accused-acquitted-47466|title=All Padma bridge graft accused acquitted|date=26 October 2014|newspaper=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, ACC even exonerated [[Syed Abul Hossain]] and ex-state minister for foreign affairs [[Abul Hasan Chowdhury]] from the allegation of involvement in the corruption conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/10/27/63153/print|title=The Financialexpress-bd|website=print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dachau trials''' ({{lang-sl|Dachauski procesi}})&lt;ref name="Ivanic"&gt;Ivanič, Martin. 1988. Dachauski procesi. ''Enciklopedija Slovenije'', vol. 2, p. 167. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Slovenia]] were a group of [[show trial]]s held between 1947/48 and 1949. The name refers to the fact that 31 of the defendants had been prisoners at the [[Dachau concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Nečak"&gt;Nečak, Dušan. 1999. Dachauski procesi 1947–1949. ''Kronika'' 57: 533–542.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and procedure ==
The trials marked a departure from previous communist show trials in Slovenia such as the [[Nagode Trial]] because until this point the authorities had sought enemies outside the Communist Party, among the non-proletariat and the non-communist intelligentsia. By selecting enemies from the ranks of the Communist Party, a Yugoslav version of the [[Moscow Trials|Stalinist show trials]] was launched.&lt;ref name="Nečak"/&gt;

In the preparations for the trials, a large number of writers, physicians, politicians, and engineers were arrested without knowing whether they would be accused or merely used as witnesses.&lt;ref name="Repe"&gt;Repe, Božo. 1999. Politični sodni proces. ''Enciklopedija Slovenije'', vol. 9, pp. 94–99. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Those arrested were tortured and deprived of their legal rights.&lt;ref name="Nečak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Repe"/&gt; Forged documents were prepared as evidence against them and false testimony was prepared.&lt;ref name="Repe"/&gt;

The defendants in the trials were forced to confess to being Nazi spies while imprisoned at the Dachau concentration camp, collaborating with the Gestapo, and working for Western powers after the Second World War in order to undermine socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Job, Cvijeto. 2002. ''Yugoslavia's Ruin: The Bloody Lessons of Nationalism, a Patriot's Warning''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Revolution"&gt;Lenin, Vladimir Ilʹich (ed. Slavoj Žižek). 2002. ''Revolution at the Gates: A Selection of Writings from February to October 1917''. London: Verso, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Land"&gt;Luthar, Oto (ed.). 2002. ''The Land Between: A History of Slovenia''. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, pp. 453–454.&lt;/ref&gt;  The proceedings were broadcast to the public via special loudspeakers on the streets.&lt;ref name="Repe"/&gt; Most of the defendants were shot immediately after being condemned to death, and others were sent to the [[Goli Otok]] prison camp.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt; The total number of people executed, the specific dates when they were killed, and where their bodies were disposed of remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Land"/&gt; Some are believed to lie in the forest near [[Kočevje]], and others in Ljubljana's [[Žale]] cemetery.&lt;ref name="Nečak"/&gt; 

The sentences handed down in the trials were reversed in April 1986 at the Tenth Congress of the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="Ivanic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nečak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Repe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Land"/&gt;

'''Data-centric security''' is an approach to security that emphasizes the security of the [[data]] itself rather than the security of [[Computer network|networks]], [[Server (computing)|servers]], or applications. Data-centric security is evolving rapidly as enterprises increasingly rely on digital information to [[business process|run their business]] and [[big data]] projects become mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data-centric security also allows organizations to overcome the disconnect between IT security technology and the objectives of business strategy by relating security services directly to the data they implicitly protect; a relationship that is often obscured by the presentation of security as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==
Common processes in a data-centric security model include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Discover: the ability to know what data is stored where including sensitive information.
* Manage: the ability to define access policies that will determine if certain data is accessible, editable, or blocked from specific users, or locations.
* Protect: the ability to defend against data loss or unauthorized use of data and prevent sensitive data from being sent to unauthorized users or locations.
* Monitor: the constant monitoring of data usage to identify meaningful deviations from normal behavior that would point to possible malicious intent.

From a technical point of view, information(data)-centric security relies on the implementation of the following:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Information (data) that is self-describing and defending.
* Policies and controls that account for business context.
* Information that remains protected as it moves in and out of applications and storage systems, and changing business context.
* Policies that work consistently through the different data management technologies and defensive layers implemented.

== Technology ==

===Data access controls and policies=== 
Data [[access control]] is the selective restriction of access to data. Accessing may mean viewing, editing, or using. Defining proper access controls requires to map out the information, where it resides, how important it is, who it is important to, how sensitive the data is and then designing appropriate controls.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Encryption===
{{main|Encryption}}
Encryption is a proven data-centric technique to address the risk of data theft in smartphones, laptops, desktops and even servers, including the cloud. One limitation is that encryption is not always effective once a network intrusion has occurred and cybercriminals operate with stolen valid user credentials.&lt;ref&gt;  Encryption solutions with multi-factor authentication are much more effective in preventing such access.

 | date = 2015
 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/view/535111/encryption-wouldnt-have-stopped-anthems-data-breach/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data masking===
{{main|Data masking}}
Data Masking is the process of hiding specific data within a database table or cell to ensure that data security is maintained and that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized personnel. This may include masking the data from users, developers, third-party and outsourcing vendors, etc.
Data masking can be achieved multiple ways: by duplicating data to eliminate the subset of the data that needs to be hidden, or by obscuring the data dynamically as users perform requests.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | last = IRI
 | title = Dynamic Data Masking Software
 | date = 2017
 | url = http://www.iri.com/solutions/data-masking/dynamic-data-masking
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Auditing===
{{main|Security audit}}
Monitoring all activity at the data layer is a key component of a data-centric security strategy. It provides visibility into the types of actions that users and tools have requested and been authorized to on specific data elements. Continuous monitoring at the data layer combined with precise access control can contribute significantly to the real-time detection of data breaches, limits the damages inflicted by a breach and can even stop the intrusion if proper controls are in place. A 2016 survey&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web
 | last = Dark Reading
 | title = Databases Remain Soft Underbelly Of Cybersecurity
 | date = 2016
 | url = http://www.darkreading.com/application-security/database-security/databases-remain-soft-underbelly-of-cybersecurity/d/d-id/1325216
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
shows that most organizations still don't assess database activity continuously and lack the capability to identify database breaches in a timely fashion.

== Cloud computing  ==
[[Cloud computing]] is an evolving paradigm with tremendous momentum, but its unique aspects exacerbate security and privacy challenges. Heterogeneity and diversity of cloud services and environments demand fine-grained access control policies and services that should be flexible enough to capture dynamic, context, or attribute-based access requirements and data protection.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | last =  IEEE 
 | title = Security and Privacy Challenges in Cloud Computing Environments
 | date = 2010
 | url = http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/SE765/Paper/security2.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data-centric security in the public cloud environments=== 
In recent decades many organizations rely on managing database services in public clouds such [[Amazon Web Services]], [[Oracle Cloud]], [[Google Cloud Platform]] or [[Microsoft Azure]] to organize their data.
Such approach has its own limitations on what users can do with managing security of their sensitive data. For instance, hardware security appliances or agents running on the database servers are no longer an option. This requires innovative ways to secure data and databases such as using reverse proxy sitting between clients / applications and database servers. The requirements such supporting a load balancing, high availability and fail-over in data-centric security brings additional challenges that database security vendors must meet. &lt;ref&gt;

{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|History}}
'''De-Stalinization''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: десталинизация, ''destalinizatsiya'') consisted of a series of political reforms in the [[Soviet Union]] after the death of long-time leader [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and the ascension of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to power.&lt;ref name="World Transformed p. 153"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed: 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=153|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms consisted of changing or removing key institutions that helped Stalin hold power: the [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality that surrounded him]], the [[Stalinism|Stalinist political system]], and the [[Gulag|Gulag labour-camp system]], all of which had been created and dominated by him. Stalin was succeeded by a [[collective leadership]] after his death in March 1953, consisting of [[Georgi Malenkov]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union]]; [[Lavrentiy Beria]], head of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)#Soviet era|Ministry of the Interior]]; and Nikita Khrushchev, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU).

==Terminology issues==
The term "de-Stalinization" is one which gained currency in both [[Russia]] and the [[Western world]] following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], and was never used during the [[Khrushchev era]]. However, de-Stalinization efforts were set forth at this time by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and the [[Government of the Soviet Union]] under the guise of the "overcoming/exposure of the cult of personality", with a heavy criticism of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s "era of the cult of personality".&lt;ref name="Jones2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Polly Jones|title=The Dilemmas of De-Stalinization: Negotiating Cultural and Social Change in the Khrushchev Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7dYiQYo1nwC&amp;pg=PA2|date=7 April 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-28347-7|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Khrushchev's "Secret Speech"]] to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], no direct association between Stalin as a person and "the cult of personality" was openly made by Khrushchev or others within the party, although archival documents show that strong criticism of Stalin and [[Stalinism|his ideology]] featured in private discussions by Khruschchev at the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]].&lt;ref name="Jones2006"/&gt;

=="Silent de-Stalinization"==
There were dangers in denouncing Stalin as he was placed on a pedestal both at home and among [[communists]] abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh7nAAAAMAAJ|year=1956|page=9|volume=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1953–1955, a period of "silent de-Stalinization" took place, as the revision of Stalin's policies was done in secret, and often with no explanation. This period saw a number of non-publicised [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|political rehabilitations]],&lt;ref name="Adler2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nanci Adler|title=The Gulag Survivor: Beyond the Soviet System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pxtCbSg293gC&amp;pg=PA21|date=1 February 2004|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3712-5|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Politburo]] members [[Robert Eikhe]] and [[Jānis Rudzutaks]], and those executed in the [[Leningrad Affair]]&lt;ref name="Boterbloem2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kees Boterbloem|title=A History of Russia and Its Empire: From Mikhail Romanov to Vladimir Putin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbivAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261|date=28 August 2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6840-2|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the release of "[[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58ers]]".&lt;ref name="Adler2004" /&gt; However, due to the huge influx of prisoners returning from the camps (90,000 prisoners in 1954–55 alone), this could not continue.&lt;ref name="Adler2004" /&gt;

In December 1955 Khrushchev proposed a commission to be set up in order to investigate Stalin's activities on behalf of the Presidium; this investigation found out that out of the 1,920,635 arrested for anti-Soviet activities – who were arrested on fabricated evidence in the first place and confessed under [[torture]] authorized by Stalin – 688,503 were executed.&lt;ref name="Swedin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric G.

==Khrushchev's "Secret Speech"==
[[File:First edition of Krushchev's "Secret Speech".jpg|thumb|''O kulcie jednostki i jego następstwach'', Warsaw, March 1956, first edition of the Secret Speech, published for the inner use in the [[PUWP]].]]
De-Stalinization meant an end to the role of large-scale [[labor camp|forced labour]] in the economy. The process of freeing [[Gulag]] prisoners was started by [[Lavrentiy Beria]]. He was soon removed from power, arrested on 26 June 1953, and executed on 24 December 1953.  [[Nikita Khrushchev]] emerged as the most powerful Soviet politician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1954succession&amp;Year=1954 soviethistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

While de-Stalinization was quietly underway ever since Stalin's death, the watershed event was Khrushchev's speech entitled "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]", concerning Stalin. On 25 February 1956, he spoke to a closed session of the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], delivering an address laying out some of Stalin's crimes and the "conditions of insecurity, fear, and even desperation" created by Stalin.&lt;ref name="World Transformed p. 153" /&gt; Khrushchev shocked his listeners by denouncing Stalin's dictatorial rule and his [[cult of personality]] as inconsistent with communist and Party ideology. Among other points, he condemned the treatment of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s, people who had supported communism before the revolution, many of whom Stalin had executed as traitors. Khrushchev also attacked the crimes committed by associates of Beria.

===Motivation===
One reason given for Khrushchev's speech was his moral conscience; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] said that Khrushchev spoke out of a "movement of the heart". This, the Communists believed, would prevent a fatal loss of self-belief and restore unity within the Party.&lt;ref name="History Today.1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavendish|first1=Richard|title=Stalin Denounced by Nikita Khrushchev|journal=History Today|date=2 February 2006|volume=56|issue=2|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/stalin-denounced-nikita-khrushchev|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin McCauley (historian)|Martin McCauley]] argues that Khrushchev's purpose was to "liberate Party officials from the fear of repression". Khrushchev argued that if the Party were to be an efficient mechanism, stripped from the brutal abuse of power by any individual, it could transform the Soviet Union as well as the entire world.&lt;ref name="McCauley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin McCauley|title=The Khrushchev Era 1953-1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYuwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=9 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-88922-9|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others have suggested that the speech was made in order to deflect blame from the Communist Party or the principles of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and place the blame squarely on Stalin's shoulders, thus preventing a more radical debate.&lt;ref name="History Today.1" /&gt; However, the publication of this speech caused many party members to resign in protest, both abroad and within the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="History Today.1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boterbloem2013" /&gt;

By attacking Stalin, McCauley argues, he was undermining the credibility of Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and other political opponents who had been within "Stalin's inner circle" during the 1930s more than he had been. If they did not "come over to Khrushchev", they "risk[ed] being banished with Stalin" and associated with his dictatorial control.&lt;ref name="McCauley2014" /&gt;

==Changes==
===Improved prison conditions===
Khrushchev attempted to make the Gulag labour system less harsh, by allowing prisoners to post letters home to their families, and by allowing family members to mail clothes to prisoners, which was not allowed under Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulaghistory.org/nps/downloads/gulag-curriculum.pdf |title=Gulag : Soviet Prison Camps and their Legacy |publisher=Gulaghistory.org |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Stalin died, the Gulag was "radically reduced in size".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulaghistory.org/nps/onlineexhibit/stalin/ |title=Gulag: Soviet Forced Labor Camps and the Struggle for Freedom |publisher=Gulaghistory.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 1956, a resolution of the CPSU declared that the existence of the Gulag labour system was "inexpedient".&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;[[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] http://www.memo.ru/history/nkvd/gulag/Articles/chapter3main.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulag institution was closed by the MVD order No 020 of 25 January 1960.&lt;ref name="memo1"&gt;[[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] http://www.memo.ru/history/NKVD/GULAG/r1/r1-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-naming of places and buildings===
Khrushchev renamed or reverted the names of many [[List of places named after Joseph Stalin|places bearing Stalin's name]], including cities, territories, landmarks, and other facilities.&lt;ref name=bursa1985&gt;{{cite journal |title=Political Changes of Names of Soviet Towns |author= G.R.F. Bursa |journal= Slavonic and East European Review |volume= 63 |year= 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] was purged of references to Stalin. The Stalin-centric and [[World War II]]-era lines in the lyrics were effectively excised when an [[instrumental]] version replaced it. The [[Palace of Culture and Science|Joseph Stalin Palace of Culture and Science]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland was renamed in 1956.

===Destruction of monuments===
[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-11500-0497,_Berlin,_Karl-Marx-Allee,_Denkmal_Stalin.jpg|thumb|The [[Stalin Statue (Berlin)|Statue of Stalin]] on Stalinallee in Berlin-Friedrichshain was removed in 1961.]]

The [[Yerevan]] monument was removed in spring 1962 and replaced by [[Mother Armenia]] in 1967. Thousands of [[List of statues of Stalin|Stalin monuments]] have been destroyed not only in the Soviet Union, but in other former Communist countries. In November 1961, the large [[Stalin Statue (Berlin)|Stalin Statue]] on Berlin's monumental Stalinallee (promptly renamed [[Karl-Marx-Allee]]) was removed in a clandestine operation. The [[Stalin Monument (Budapest)|Monument in Budapest]] was destroyed in October 1956. The biggest one, the [[Stalin Monument (Prague)|Prague monument]], was taken down in November 1962.

===Re-location of Stalin's body===
Given momentum by these public renamings, the process of de-Stalinization peaked in 1961 during the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Congress of the CPSU]]. Two climactic acts of de-Stalinization marked the meetings: first, on 31 October 1961, Stalin's body was moved from [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in [[Red Square]] to a location near the Kremlin wall;&lt;ref name="cnnthisday"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=CNN Interactive - Almanac - October 31|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/almanac/9810/31/#today|quote=''(October 31) 1961, Russia's de-Stalinisation program reached a climax when his body was removed from the mausoleum in Red Square and re-buried.''|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; second, on 11 November 1961, the "hero city" Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd.&lt;ref name="nytimes_namechanged"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Stalingrad Name Changed|date=1961-11-11|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|quote=''MOSCOW, Saturday, Nov. 11 (Reuters) -- The "Hero City" of Stalingrad has been renamed Volgograd, the Soviet Communist party newspaper Pravda reported today.''|author=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/11/11/archives/stalingrad-name-changed.html|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of de-Stalinization==
Contemporary historians regard the beginning of de-Stalinization as a turning point in the [[history of the Soviet Union]] that began during the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. It subsided during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1964–82)|Brezhnev period]] until the mid-1980s, and accelerated again with the policies of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

De-Stalinization has been considered a fragile process. Historian Polly Jones said that "re-Stalinization" was highly likely after a brief period of "thaw".&lt;ref name="Jones2006" /&gt; [[Anne Applebaum]] agrees: "The era which came to be called the 'Thaw' was indeed an era of change, but change of a particular kind: reforms took two steps forward, and then one step—or sometimes three steps—back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Applebaum|first1=Anne|title=Gulag: A History|date=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780767900560|chapter=Thaw – and Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dettmer v. Landon''''', 799 [[F.2d]] 929 ([[4th Cir.]] 1986),&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Dettmer v. Landon |vol=799 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=929 |pinpoint= |court=4th Cir. |date=1986 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/799/929/117777/ |accessdate=2018-03-24 |quote=}} {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[case law|court case]] in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] held that although [[Wicca]] was a religion, it was not a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to deny a prisoner access to ritual objects.

==Facts==
The plaintiff, Herbert Daniel Dettmer, was a [[Virginia]] prisoner, and a member of the [[Church and School of Wicca|School of Wicca]]. Dettmer  desired access to ritual objects, including several varieties of knife, with which to practice [[Wicca]]n rituals. Knives, of course, are not available to prisoners. When the state would not provide him these ritual objects, he sued Robert Landon, the Director of the [[Virginia Department of Corrections]] in [[United States federal court|federal court]] to get access to objects he claimed were necessary for his religious practice.  The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] decided in Dettmer's favor, finding that Wicca was a religion, rejecting the argument put forward by the Department of Correction that it was merely a "conglomeration" of occult practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Dettmer v. Landon |vol=617 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=592 |pinpoint= |court=E.D. Va. |date=1985 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/617/592/2246829/ |accessdate=2018-03-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and was argued before the appellate court in April 1986.

==Opinion of the Fourth Circuit==
The Fourth Circuit, in a decision by Senior Circuit Judge [[John D. Butzner, Jr.]], affirmed the district court's ruling that [[Wicca]] was a religion, but vacated the injunction.

The appellate court considered but rejected the claims of the government about Wicca itself, which included that Wicca was a mere "conglomeration" of "various aspects of the [[occultism|occult]], such as [[faith healing]], self-[[hypnosis]], [[tarot card reading]], and [[spells (paranormal)|spell casting]], none of which would be considered religious practices standing alone,"&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt; and that even if Dettmer's beliefs were religious, the rituals were not.

The conclusion of the Fourth Circuit was that the District court had found that Dettmer had a religious belief entitled to full First Amendment protections, but that he was not entitled to an injunction, since "[t]he decision to prohibit Dettmer from possessing the items that he sought did not discriminate against him because of his unconventional beliefs."

==Importance of the case==
While not entirely a victory for Dettmer, this was the first time Wicca was recognized by a court of law as a legitimate religion.

'''Diplomatic history''' deals with the history of [[international relations]] between states. Diplomatic history can be different from international relations in that the former can concern itself with the foreign policy of one state while the latter deals with relations between two or more states. Diplomatic history tends to be more concerned with the history of diplomacy, but international relations concern more with current events and creating a model intended to shed explanatory light on international politics.&lt;ref name="Matusumoto pages 314-316"&gt;Matusumoto, Saho "Diplomatic History" pages 314-316 in Kelly Boyd, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' (1999) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==

===Ranke===
[[Thucydides]] was highly concerned with the relations among states. However the modern form of diplomatic history was codified in the 19th century by [[Leopold von Ranke]], as the leading German historian of the 19th century.  Ranke wrote largely on the history of [[Early Modern Europe]], using the diplomatic archives of the European powers (particularly the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]) to construct a detailed understanding of the history of Europe ''wie es eigentlich gewesen'' ("as it actually happened.").  Ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the "Primacy of Foreign Affairs" (''Primat der Aussenpolitik''), arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state. Ranke's understanding of diplomatic history relied on the large number of official documents produced by modern western governments as sources, which he argued should be examined in an objective and neutral spirit.&lt;ref name="Matusumoto pages 314-316"/&gt;

===20th century scholars===
In the early 20th centuries, work by prominent diplomatic historians such as Charles Webster, Harold Temperley, Alfred Pribram, R.H. Lord and B.E. Schmitt were mostly concerned with the events such as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] and the origins of the [[Franco-German War]].&lt;ref name="Matusumoto pages 314-316"/&gt; A notable event in diplomatic history occurred in 1910 when the French government start to publish all of the archives relating to the [[war of 1870]]. The Bolsheviks in Russia published key secret papers from the Allies in 1918.

Ranke's understanding of the dominance of foreign policy, and hence an emphasis on diplomatic history, remained the dominant paradigm in historical writing through the first half of the twentieth century.  This emphasis, combined with the effects of the [[War Guilt Clause]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) which ended the [[First World War]], led to a huge amount of historical writing on the subject of the [[origins of the war of 1914]], with the involved governments printing huge, carefully edited, collections of documents and numerous historians writing multi-volume histories of the origins of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Covered in depth in [[William L. Langer]], ''The diplomacy of imperialism: 1890-1902'' (2nd ed. 1951) and [[A.J.P. Taylor]], ''Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918''  (Oxford UP, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the interwar period, most diplomatic historians tended to blame all of the Great Powers of 1914 for the First World War, arguing that the war was in effect everybody's responsibility. In general, the early works in this vein fit fairly comfortably into Ranke's emphasis on ''Aussenpolitik''.

Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War:
: diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789-1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt;
She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing political, intellectual and social history to displace diplomatic history.

For the first half of the 20th century, most diplomatic history working within the narrow confines of the ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' approach was very narrowly concerned with foreign-policy making elites with little reference to broader historical forces. The most notable exceptions to this tendency were [[A. J. P. Taylor]] and [[W. N. Medlicott|William Medlicott]] in Britain, [[Pierre Renouvin]] in France, and [[William L. Langer]] in the United States, who examined economic and domestic political forces.&lt;ref name="Matusumoto pages 314-316"/&gt;

===Causes of World War Two===
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}

Sir [[Winston Churchill]]'s multi-volume ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]'', especially the first volume ''The Gathering Storm'' (1948) set the framework and the interpretation for much later [[historiography]].  His interpretation, echoing his own position before the war, that World War II was caused by the mad ambitions of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Churchill damned the cowardly and weak-willed British and French leaders who used [[appeasement]] in a futile effort to avoid the war. Churchill did not consider the argument that the alternative to appeasement was a premature war that Germany would win in 1938. The British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]]'s 1961 book ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]'' challenged Churchill's viewpoint and argued that Hitler had no master-plan for conquering the world. Instead he was an ordinary statesman –-an opportunistic leader seizing whatever chances he had for expansionism. The fact that a world war started over Poland in 1939 was due to diplomatic miscalculation by all the countries concerned, instead of being a case of German aggression.  British historians such as D.C. Watt, Paul Kennedy, George Peden and David Dilks argued that appeasement was not an aberration, and that it was an old British tradition which in this case flowed from numerous structural, economic and military factors. Historians such as [[Christopher Thorne (historian)|Christopher Thorne]] and [[Harry Hinsley]] abandoned the previous focus on individual leaders to discuss the broader societal influences such as public opinion and narrower ones like intelligence on diplomatic relations. In recent years the debates regarding the 1930s have continued, but new approaches are in use, such as an analysis in terms of Britain's national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Finney, "The romance of decline: The historiography of appeasement and British national identity." ''Electronic Journal of International History'' 1 (2000) [http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/3385/1/Journal_of_International_History_2000-06_Finney.pdf Online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald C. Watt, "The historiography of appeasement." in [[Alan Sked]] and Chris Cook, eds. ''Crisis and controversy: Essays in honour of AJP Taylor'' (1976) pp 100+.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French approaches===
A group of French historians centered around [[Pierre Renouvin]] (1893-1974) and his ''protégés'' [[Jean-Baptiste Duroselle]] and Maurice Baumont started a new type of international history in the 1950s that included taking into account what Renouvin called ''{{lang|fr|forces profondes}}'' (profound forces) such as the influence of domestic politics on French foreign policy.  However, Renouvin and his followers still followed the concept of ''{{lang|fr|la décadence}}'' with Renouvin arguing that French society under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was “sorely lacking in initiative and dynamism” and Baumont arguing that French politicians had allowed "personal interests" to override "any sense of the general interest".  In 1979, Duroselle's book ''La Décadence'' offered a total condemnation of the entire Third Republic as weak, cowardly and degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson,  “Post-War Politics and the Historiography of French Strategy and Diplomacy Before the Second World War" ''History Compass'', Volume 4/5, 2006 pp 870-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. W. Helprin, ''Some Twentieth-Century Historians'' (1961) pp 143-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fischer debate on World War One===
At the same time, in 1961 when the German historian [[Fritz Fischer]] published ''Griff nach der Weltmacht'', which established that Germany had caused the First World War led to the fierce "Fischer Controversy" that tore apart the West German historical profession.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Matusumoto, Saho "Diplomatic History" pages 314-316 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' page 315.&lt;/ref&gt; One result of Fischer's book was the rise in the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' (Primacy of Domestic Politics) approach.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As a result of the rise of the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' school, diplomatic historians increasing started to pay attention to domestic politics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1970s, the conservative German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]], together with his close associate [[Klaus Hildebrand]], was involved in a very acrimonious debate with the leftish German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] over the merits of the ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' ("primacy of foreign politics") and ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' ("primacy of domestic politics") schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kershaw, Ian]] ''The Nazi Dictatorship'', London, Arnold, 2000, pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillgruber and Hildebrand made a case for the traditional ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' approach to diplomatic history with the stress on examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship'', London, Arnold, 2000, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Wehler, who favored the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' approach, for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of [[social history]], calling for theoretically-based research,  and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question.&lt;ref name="Kershaw"&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, under the influence of the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' approach, diplomatic historians in the 1960s, 70s and 80s start to borrow models from the social sciences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Mason-Overy debate on internal pressures inside Nazi Germany===
A notable example of the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' approach was the claim by the British [[Marxist historian]] [[Timothy Mason]] who claimed that the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a “barbaric variant of social imperialism”.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Mason argued that “Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion”.&lt;ref name="Kaillis, Aristotle page 165"&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted.&lt;ref name="Kaillis, Aristotle page 165"/&gt; In Mason's view in the period between 1936–41, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's "will" or "intentions" that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian' page 88"&gt;Kershaw, Ian'' The Nazi Dictatorship'' London : Arnold 2000 page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]] of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian' page 88"/&gt; According to Mason, by 1939, the “overheating” of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  pages 165-166&lt;/ref&gt; Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless “smash and grab” foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 166&lt;/ref&gt; Mason's theory of a "Flight into war" being imposed on Hitler generated much controversy, and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian [[Richard Overy]] over this matter.  Overy maintained the decision to attack [[Poland]] was not caused by structural economic problems, but rather was the result of Hitler wanting a localized war at that particular time in history. For Overy, a major problem with the Mason thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way unrecorded by the records, that information was passed on to Hitler about the ''Reich'''s economic problems.&lt;ref name="Mason, Tim page 102"&gt;Mason, Tim &amp; Overy, R.J. “Debate: Germany, `domestic crisis’ and the war in 1939” from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney, Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1997 page 102&lt;/ref&gt; Overy argued that there was a major difference between economic pressures inducted by the problems of the [[Four Year Plan]], and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserve of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Overy, Richard “Germany, ‘Domestic Crisis’ and War in 1939” from ''The Third Reich'' edited by Christian Leitz,  Blackwell: Oxford, 1999 pages 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Overy asserted that the repressive capacity of the German state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness was somewhat downplayed by Mason.&lt;ref name="Mason, Tim page 102"/&gt;

===Japanese-American relations===
In addition, because World War II was a global war, diplomatic historians start to focus on [[Japanese-American relations]] to understand why Japan had attacked the United States in 1941.  This in turn led diplomatic historians to start to abandon the previous Euro-centric approach in favor of a more global approach.&lt;ref&gt;Saho Matusumoto, "Diplomatic History" in Kelly Boyd, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' (1999) pp 314-165&lt;/ref&gt;  A sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the Japanese historian Chihiro Hosoya, the British historian [[Ian Nish]], and the American historian [[Akira Iriye]], which was the first time that Asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians.

===Vietnam war and revisionism===
The [[Cold War]] and [[decolonization#Cold War|decolonization]] greatly added the tendency to a more global diplomatic history. The [[Vietnam War]] led to the rise of a revisionist school in the United States, which led many American historians such as [[Gabriel Kolko]] and [[William Appleman Williams]] to reject traditional diplomatic history in favor of a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' approach that saw a widespread examination of the influence of American domestic politics together with various social, economic and cultural forces on foreign-policy making. In general, the American Cold War revisionists tended to focus on American foreign policy decision-making with respect to the genesis of the Cold War in the 1940s and on how the United States became involved in Vietnam in the 1960s. Starting in the 1960s, a ferocious debate has taken place within Cold War histriography between the advocates of the “orthodox” school which saw the Cold War as a case of Soviet aggression such as [[Vojtech Mastny]] against the proponents of the “revisionist” school which saw the Cold War as a case of American aggression. Latterly, a third school known as "neo-orthodox" whose most prominent member is the American historian [[John Lewis Gaddis]] has emerged, which holds through the United States borne some responsibility for the Cold War, the lion's share of the responsibility goes to the Soviet Union.

===Recent trends===
In Europe diplomatic history fell out of favor in the late Cold War era. Since the collapse of communism in 1989-91, however, there has been a renaissance, led especially by historians of the early modern era, in the history of diplomacy. The new approach differs from previous perspectives by the wholesale incorporation of perspectives from political science, sociology, the history of mentalities, and cultural history.

In the U.S. since the 1980s, the discipline of diplomatic history has become more relevant to and better integrated with the mainstream of the academic history profession. It has taken the lead in internationalization of American historical studies. Since it explores the interaction of domestic and international forces, the field has become increasingly important for its study of culture and identity and the exploration of political ideologies as applied to foreign affairs. There have been major influences from other new approaches such as [[Orientalism]] and [[globalism]], as well as gender and racial history.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Zeiler, “The Diplomatic History Bandwagon: A State of the Field,” ''[[Journal of American History]]'' (March 2009), v 95#4 pp 1053-73&lt;/ref&gt; The history of human rights has become important as well.&lt;ref&gt;Micheline R. Ishay, ''The history of human rights: From ancient times to the globalization era'' (2008) [https://edocs.uis.edu/Departments/LIS/Course_Pages/LIS411/readings/Ishay_Human_Rights_Enlightenment.pdf excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite all these innovations, however, the core endeavor of diplomatic history remains the study of the state interacting with other states, which is also a key to its broadening appeal, since considerations of America's superpower status is essential to understanding the world internationally.

In the early 1980s, historian Jeffrey Kimball surveyed the ideological preferences of 109 active diplomatic historians in the United States as well as 54 active military historians. He reports that:
:Of historians in the field of diplomatic history, 7% are Socialist, 19% are Other, 53% are Liberal, 11% are None and 10% Conservative. Of military historians, 0% are Socialist, 8% are Other, 35% are Liberal, 18% are None and 40% are  Conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kimball, "The Influence of Ideology on Interpretive Disagreement: A Report on a Survey of Diplomatic, Military and Peace Historians on the Causes of 20th Century U. S. Wars," ''The History Teacher''  (May, 1984) 17#3 pp. 355-384 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/493146.pdf in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. since 1980, the discipline of diplomatic history has become more relevant to and integrated with the mainstream of the historiographic profession, having been in the forefront of the internationalization of American historical studies. As a field that explores the meeting of domestic and international forces, the study of US foreign relations has become increasingly important for its examination of both the study of culture and identity and the exploration of political ideologies. Particularly shaped by the influence of studies of Orientalism and globalism, gender studies, race, and considerations of national identity, diplomatic history was often at the cutting edge of historical research. Despite such innovations, however, the core endeavor of diplomatic history remains the study of the state, which is also a key to its broadening appeal, since considerations of US state power are essential to understanding the world internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Zeiler (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1447">'''Extrusion detection''' or '''outbound intrusion detection''' is a branch of [[intrusion detection]] aimed at developing mechanisms to identify successful and unsuccessful attempts to use the resources of a [[computer system]] to compromise other systems. Extrusion detection techniques focus primarily on the analysis of system activity and outbound traffic in order to detect malicious users, [[malware]] or network traffic that may pose a threat to the security of neighboring systems.

While intrusion detection is mostly concerned about the identification of incoming attacks (intrusion attempts), extrusion detection systems try to prevent attacks from being launched in the first place. They implement monitoring controls at leaf nodes of the network—rather than concentrating them at choke points, e.g., [[router (computing)|router]]s—in order to distribute the inspection workload and to take advantage of the visibility a system has of its own state. The ultimate goal of extrusion detection is to identify attack attempts launched from an already compromised system in order to prevent them from reaching their target, hereby containing the impact of the threat.

'''FamilyVoice Australia''' is an Australian conservative Christian organisation. It was known as '''Festival of Light Australia''' from 1973 to 2008. Its stated mission was to be "a Christian ministry to the nation, promoting true family values in the light of the wisdom of God". The name was changed to FamilyVoice Australia on 1 July 2008 in order to eliminate confusion with the many other festivals or groups around the world called "Festival of Light" or "Festival of Lights". Key activities of FamilyVoice Australia are providing information to supporters, churches and community leaders and lobbying on issues of concern.

==History==
It was founded in [[Adelaide]] in 1972 as the ''Australian Festival of Light and Community Standards Organisation'', with the name and inspiration from United Kingdom's [[Nationwide Festival of Light]] founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It came out of work by the Australian [[Community standards|Community Standards]] Organisation (CSO), which had recently merged with the South Australian Moral Action Committee.&lt;ref name="hilliard"&gt;Hilliard, David and John Warhurst. "Festival of Light". ''Current Affairs Bulletin'', February 1974, p. 14-18&lt;/ref&gt; Moral Action Committee members included Reverend Lance Shilton, Rector of [[Holy Trinity Church, Adelaide|Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Adelaide]] and later Anglican Dean of Sydney; Dr John H. Court, then senior lecturer in psychology at [[Flinders University]], and Peter Daniels.&lt;ref name="hilliard" /&gt; South Australian delegates at a CSO meeting in Melbourne in 1972 led the move to hold "a nationwide act of Christian witness, similar to that conducted in Britain last year (Festival of Light)".&lt;ref&gt;Community Standards Organisation, ''SA Branch News Letter'', August 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Lance Shilton then initiated an interdenominational steering committee to establish the Australian Festival of Light at a meeting in Toorak Gardens, Adelaide, in November 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Shilton, Lance. ''Speaking out: a life in urban mission: the autobiography of Lance Shilton''. Centre for the Study of Australian Christianity, Sydney. 1997, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee appointed Dr Court as chairman; Rev Shilton and Mrs Roslyn Phillips as deputy chairmen, and Peter Daniels as publicity officer.

The Festival of Light was formally launched in Adelaide in June 1973 with a media conference and the release of a new book by Dr Court and SA journalist Helen Caterer, ''Stand Up and Be Counted'',&lt;ref&gt;Court, J.H. with Helen Caterer, (1973), ''Stand Up and Be Counted''. Lutheran Publishing House, Adelaide&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed to motivate readers to defend publicly their Christian faith and values.

Lance Shilton’s network of contacts through the Australian [[Evangelical Alliance]] and the Community Standards Organisation led to the formation of independent branches of Festival of Light (which later included the Community Standards Organisation) in all Australian states.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;Court, J.H., (1975), ''Law, Light and Liberty'', Lutheran Publishing House, Adelaide, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend [[Fred Nile]] accepted leadership of the NSW branch in July 1973, becoming the full-time director in January 1974. Mr Nile greatly increased the organisation’s activity and public profile.&lt;ref name="nile"&gt;Nile, Fred. ''Fred Nile, an autobiography''. Strand Publishing, Sydney. 2001, p 90-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was less active after the mid 1980s, but has undergone reconstitution since 2003.

In 2004 the national body of the former Festival of Light Australia was formed under a new constitution, with a national office in Adelaide and branches in South Australia and Queensland. Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales branches followed in 2005-2007. In 2004 Dr. David Phillips, formerly chairman of the South Australian branch of Festival of Light, became national president of Festival of Light Australia.&lt;ref&gt;"About Us - Team" http://www.fava.org.au/about-us/team/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2008 its name was changed to FamilyVoice Australia in order to avoid ambiguity, especially on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;''VoxPoint''. Festival of Light Australia. August 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr David Phillips remains the national president and is supported by five state officers, a national research officer and a national administrator.

FamilyVoice Australia partnered with the [[Coalition for Marriage (Australia)|Coalition for Marriage]] and other groups opposed to same-sex marriage, in campaigning for a 'No' vote in the 2017 [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey]].

==Responses==
The 1973 Proclamation of Australian Festival of Light reached out to "all people of good will", but most of those who responded had a Christian background. In 1974 Flinders University historians Hilliard and Warhurst noted that supporters of Festival of Light were mainly Protestants of the Evangelical tradition and conservative Catholics and that some other Christians tended to be critical of the organisation's "overconfident presentation of complex moral issues in simple black and white terms".&lt;ref name="hilliard" /&gt; Hilliard and Warhurst said that despite Festival of Light's promotion among churches around [[South Australia]], some clergy were unresponsive and many congregations did not get involved.&lt;ref name="hilliard" /&gt;

Sometimes there was open controversy. A week before the 1973 visit of [[Mary Whitehouse]], students at the [[Adelaide University|University of Adelaide]], [[Flinders University]] and the [[University of South Australia|South Australian Institute of Technology]] (now the University of South Australia) began a "Festival of Fright" campaign against the Australian Festival of Light events, saying, "These latter-day Calvins should be met by as much opposition as freedom-loving people can muster...."&lt;ref name="hilliard" /&gt;

In 1978, South Australian Attorney-General [[Peter Duncan (Australian politician)|Peter Duncan]] criticised the Festival of Light, saying: "I believe there is a desperate need to develop a tolerant society… I don't think this sort of hysteria and prejudging that is generated by the Festival of Light does anything to further this move."&lt;ref&gt;"Duncan Slams Back at Mary W". ''The News''. 1978-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan also spoke out against the 1978 Festival of Light-sponsored visit to Australia by Whitehouse, calling her "an agent of darkness" and an "opponent of freedom."&lt;ref&gt;"Views on Whitehouse 'not necessarily' official". ''The News''. 1978-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on legislation ===
The September 1978 Mary Whitehouse visit was influential in the Festival of Light campaign against X-rated [[pornography]]. On 12 September, following national media coverage of the pornography problem in relation to the Whitehouse tour, Victorian Liberal Premier [[Rupert Hamer]] announced that his government would move to tighten pornography laws, particularly in relation to children.&lt;ref&gt;"Hamer faces cudgels". ''The Age''. Melbourne, 1978-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 1978 at the Whitehouse rally in Adelaide's Rymill Park,&lt;ref&gt;"4000 in step with Mary's morality". ''The Advertiser''. Adelaide, 1978-09-11, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Festival of Light circulated a petition calling for tighter control of pornography, later signed by over 14,000 South Australians.&lt;ref&gt;"Petition wins response". ''Festival Focus''. November 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Petitions: Pornography". ''South Australian House of Assembly Hansard''. 1978-09-12, p. 786; 1978-09-19, p. 967; 1978-10-11, p. 1363.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September, Labor Premier [[Don Dunstan]] delivered a blistering attack on the Festival of Light in the South Australian House of Assembly, calling the petition pamphlet "disgraceful". He said a graph accompanying the petition was "one of the most untruthful pieces of work that I have ever come across" because it showed a rise in South Australian rates of reported rape following a 1974 law allowing the sale of hardcore pornography, compared with Queensland where hardcore pornography was banned and rape reports remained steady. Dunstan said rape convictions should have been used instead of reports, and the graph should have extended beyond 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Dunstan, Don. "Classification of Publications Bill". ''South Australian House of Assembly Hansard''. 1978-09-20, p. 1048.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 27 September, Liberal MP [[Bruce Eastick]] defended the Festival of Light petition and graph, and said part of the Premier’s speech the week before had been a "blatant untruth". Dr Eastick said rape report statistics from South Australia and Queensland after 1975 showed that "it is quite clear that the problem in South Australia is almost four times as serious as that which exists in Queensland".&lt;ref name="eastick"&gt;Eastick, Bruce. "Classification of Publications Bill". ''South Australian House of Assembly Hansard''. 1978-09-27, p. 1215-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal MP Mrs [[Jennifer Cashmore|Jennifer Adamson]] later fully documented the statistics in the Festival of Light petition pamphlet, and listed the academic credentials of the founding chairman Dr John Court.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, Jennifer. "Classification of Publications Bill". ''South Australian House of Assembly Hansard''. 1978-11-14, p. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Eastick also pointed out that a child pornography magazine ''Just Boys'' had been banned in New South Wales but had been classified for unrestricted sale in South Australia "alongside the ''Women's Weekly''".&lt;ref name="eastick"/&gt;

On 28 September, the Dunstan government introduced the Criminal Law (Prohibition of Child Pornography) Bill,&lt;ref name="criminal"&gt;"Criminal Law (Prohibition of Child Pornography Bill)". ''South Australian House of Assembly Hansard''. 1978-09-28, p. 1264.&lt;/ref&gt; which passed both houses of parliament without dissent on 21 November 1978 after opposition amendments tightened its provisions.&lt;ref&gt;''South Australian House of Assembly Hansard''. 1978-11-21, p. 2179&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the bill in an amended form was widely seen as a response to the Festival of Light campaign. Liberal MP Keith Russack noted, "The many signatures on petitions presented to this Parliament is a significant indication of the South Australian public’s concern."&lt;ref&gt;Russack, Keith. "Criminal Law (Prohibition of Child Pornography) Bill". ''South Australian House of Assembly Hansard''. 1978-11-14, p. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Festival of Light hosted many events including visits by overseas speakers such as:
*1973 Mary Whitehouse
The first major event of the Australian Festival of Light was the visit by "Clean-up TV" campaigner Mary Whitehouse to Sydney and Adelaide in October 1973. It was Shilton, while on a trip to Britain in May 1973, who invited Whitehouse to Australia.&lt;ref name="hilliard" /&gt; Whitehouse spoke to overflow crowds in the [[Sydney Town Hall]] and the [[Adelaide Festival Theatre]], and led a march of 10,000 people to Light’s Vision in Adelaide on 14 October 1973, where the Festival of Light Proclamation setting out the breadth of its concerns was read out and endorsed by a total crowd of over 12,000.&lt;ref name="court" /&gt;

Mary Whitehouse later recalled her first visit to Australia as one of the big events of her life. She told her biographer Max Caulfield that because of the intense media interest, "I became better known in Australia in three and a half weeks than I did in Britain in ten years."&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, Max. ''Mary Whitehouse''. A R Mowbray &amp; Co Ltd, Oxford. 1975. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;
*1976 Malcolm Muggeridge
Malcolm Muggeridge’s Australian Festival of Light speaking tour was equally successful in October 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Nile, Fred. ''The Gentle Prophet Pays a Visit: Malcolm Muggeridge in Australia''. Australian Festival of Light, Sydney, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 35,000 people heard his keynote address to the Family Celebration in Sydney’s Hyde Park on 10 October; he spoke to a capacity audience in Adelaide’s Festival Theatre on 14 October and significant crowds in other cities throughout Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="nile"/&gt;
*1978 Mary Whitehouse
Mary Whitehouse successfully toured Australia for a second time in September 1978, amid controversy over UK court action she had initiated against an offensive poem about Jesus published in a homosexual paper.&lt;ref name="nile"/&gt; Student demonstrators picketed her meetings and Brisbane police arrested two youths and five girls who threw strawberry pies at her.&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-porn crusader Mary Whitehouse hit by pies". ''The Advertiser''. 1978-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the protests, large crowds came out in support – including 5000 at an Adelaide march Mary led from Rymill Park to Parliament House on 10 September 800 in Hobart, 1000 in Brisbane, 2000 in Melbourne, 1500 in Perth where she was welcomed by Premier Sir [[Charles Court]], and 4000 in the Sydney Town Hall on 27 September.&lt;ref name="nile 2"&gt;Nile, Fred. ''Fred Nile, An Autobiography''. Strand Publishing, Sydney, 2001. Chapter 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1981 Mother Teresa

{{more footnotes|date=August 2015}}
The '''farmers' movement''' was, in American political history, the general name for a movement between 1867 and 1896. In this movement, there were three periods, popularly known as the [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]], [[Farmers' Alliance|Alliance]] and [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] movements.

==The Grange==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|The Grange]], or Order of the Patrons of Husbandry (the latter official name of the national organization, while the former was the name of local chapters, including a supervisory National Grange at Washington), was a secret order founded in 1867 to advance the social needs and combat the economic backwardness of farm life. It was founded by Oliver H. Kelley, at that time an official working in Washington DC for the Dept. of Agriculture.  He had been sent to Virginia to assess Southern agricultural resources and practices.  He found them to be generally poor, and became determined to found an organization of farmers for the dissemination of information.  As a Government official from the North, he must have received a generally hostile reception, but he was a Mason, and ended by founding his organization on the structure of that order.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to farming practices, it was to provide insurance and benevolent aid to members. He was in correspondence with his niece during the early period and both promoted the equal status of women and the principle of equal pay for equal work. The Grange grew remarkably during the early years: at its peak, its membership rose to approximately 1.5 million. The causes of its growth were much broader than just the financial crisis of 1873; a high tariff, railway freight rates and other grievances were mingled with agricultural troubles like the fall of wheat prices and the increase of mortgages.

The condition of the farmer seemed desperate. The original objects of the Grange were primarily educational, but these were soon overborne by an anti-middleman, co-operative movement. Grange agents bought everything from farm machinery to women's dresses; hundreds of [[grain elevator]]s and cotton and tobacco warehouses were bought, and even steamboat lines; mutual insurance companies were formed and joint-stock stores. Nor was co-operation limited to distributive processes; crop reports were circulated, co-operative dairies multiplied, flour mills were operated, and patents were purchased, that the Grange might manufacture farm machinery.

The outcome in some states was ruin, and the name, Grange, became a reproach. Nevertheless, these efforts in co-operation were exceedingly important both for the results obtained and for their wider significance. Nor could politics be excluded, though officially taboo, for economics must be considered by social idealists, and economics everywhere ran into politics. Thus it was with the railway question.

Railways had been extended into frontier states; there were heavy crops in sparsely settled regions where freight-rates were high, so that given the existing distributive system there were over production and waste; there was notorious stock manipulation and discrimination in rates; and the farmers regarded absentee ownership of railways by New York capitalists much as absentee ownership of land has been regarded in Ireland. The Grange officially disclaimed enmity to railways:  Though the organization did not attack them, the Grangers, through political farmers clubs and the like, did.  In 1867, the Grange began efforts to establish regulation of the railways as common-carriers, by the states. Such laws were known as Granger Laws, and their general principles, endorsed in 1876 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], have become an important chapter in the laws of the land.

In a declaration of principles in 1874 Grangers were declared not to be enemies of railroads, and their cause to stand for no [[communism]] nor [[agrarianism]]. To conservatives, however, cooperation seemed communism, and Grange laws agrarianism; thus, in 1873-1874, the growth of the movement aroused extraordinary interest and much uneasiness. In 1874, the order was reorganized, membership being limited to persons directly interested in the farmers' cause (there had been a millionaire manufacturers Grange on Broadway), and after this there were constant quarrels in the order; moreover, in 1875, the National Grange largely lost control of the state Granges, which discredited the organization by their disastrous co-operation ventures. Thus, by 1876, it had already ceased to be of national political importance.

About 1880, a renaissance began, particularly in the Middle States and New England; this revival was marked by a recurrence to the original social and educational objects. The national Grange and state Granges (in all, or nearly all, of the states) were still active in 1909, especially in the old cultural movement and in such economic movements, notably the improvement of highways as most directly concern the farmers. The initiative and referendum, and other proposals of reform politics in the direction of a democratic advance, also enter in a measure into their propaganda.

==The Alliance==
The '''Alliance''' carried the movement further into economics. The [[Farmers' Alliance|National Farmers Alliance and Industrial Union]], formed in 1889, embraced several originally independent organizations (including [[Agricultural Wheel|The Agricultural Wheel]]) formed from 1873 onwards; it was largely confined to the South and was secret. The [[Farmers' Alliance|National Farmers Alliance]], formed in 1880, went back similarly to 1877, was much smaller, Northern and non-secret. The [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union]] (formed 1888, merged in the above Southern Alliance in 1890) was the second greatest organization. With these three were associated many others, state and national, including an annual, non-partisan, deliberative and advisory [[Farmers National Congress]]. The Alliance movement reached its greatest power about 1890, in which year twelve national farmers organizations were represented in conventions in St Louis, and the six leading ones alone probably had a membership of 5,000,000. As with the Grange, so in the ends and declarations of the whole later movement, concrete remedial legislation for agricultural or economic ills was mingled with principles of vague radical tendency and with lofty idealism. Thus, the [[Farmers' Alliance|Southern Alliance]] in 1890 (the chief platforms were the one at [[Ocala Demands|Ocala, Florida]], and that of 1889 at [[St Louis, Missouri]], in conjunction with the [[Knights of Labor]]) declared its principles to be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) To labour for the education of the agricultural classes in the science of economical government in a strictly non-partisan way, and to bring about a more perfect union of such classes. (2) To demand equal rights to all, and special privileges to none. (3) To endorse the motto: In things essential, unity; in all things, charity. (4) To develop a better state, mentally, morally, socially and financially - - - (6) To suppress personal, local, sectional and national prejudices.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=x |wstitle=Farmers' Movement |volume=10 |pages=181-182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the Southern farmer a chief concrete evil was the [[crop-lien system]], mortgages on their future crops for furnished supplies by which cotton farmers fell into debt to country merchants. In the North the farmer attacked a wide range of capitalistic legislation that hurt him, he believed, for the benefit of other classes, notably legislation sought by railways.
 
Practically all the great organizations demanded the abolition of national banks, the free coinage of silver, a sufficient issue of government paper money, tariff revision, and a secret ballot (the last was soon realized). Only less commonly demanded were an income tax, taxation of evidence of debt, and government loans on lands. All of these were principles of the two great Alliances (the Northern and the Southern), as were also pure food legislation, abolition of landholding by aliens, reclamation of unused or unearned land grants (to railways, e.g.), and either rigid federal regulation of railways and other means of communication or government ownership thereof. The Southern Alliance put in the forefront a subtreasury scheme according to which cheap loans should be made by government from local sub-treasuries on non-perishable farm products (such as grain and cotton) stored in government warehouses; while the Northern Alliance demanded restriction of the liquor traffic and for (a short time) woman suffrage. Still other issues were a modification of the patent laws (e.g., to prevent the purchase of patents to stifle competition), postal currency exchange, the [[eight-hour day]], inequitable taxation, the [[single tax]] on land, trusts, educational qualification for suffrage, direct popular election of federal judges, of senators, and of the president, special-interest lobbying.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==The Populists==
In 1889-1890, with the rapid growth in membership, the political (non-partisan) movement developed astonishing strength; it captured the Republican stronghold of [[Kansas]], brought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to vassalage in [[South Carolina]], revolutionized legislatures even in conservative states like [[Massachusetts]], and seemed likely completely to dominate the South and West. All its work in the South was accomplished within the old-party organizations, but, in 1890, the demand became strong for an independent third party, for which various consolidations since 1887 had prepared the way. By 1892, a large part of the strength of the farmers organizations, with that of various industrial and radical orders, was united in the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] (perhaps more generally known as the Populist Party), which had its beginnings in Kansas in 1890, and received national organization in 1892.

The People's Party emphasized free silver, the income tax, eight-hour day, reclamation of land grants, government ownership of railways, telephones and telegraphs, popular election of federal senators, and the initiative and referendum. In the presidential election of 1892, it cast 1,041,021 votes (in a total of 12,036,089), and elected 22 presidential electors, the first chosen by any third party since 1856. In 1896, the People's Party fused with the Democratic Party in the presidential campaign, and again in 1900. During this period, the greatest part of the People's Party was reabsorbed into the two great parties from which its membership had originally been drawn; in some northern states apparently largely into the Republican ranks, but mainly into the Democratic Party, to which it gave a powerful radical impulse.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Influence==
The Farmers' movement was much misunderstood, abused and ridiculed by the societal forces it challenged. However, it accomplished a vast amount of good. The movement—and especially the Grange, for on most important points the latter movements only followed where it had led—contributed the initial impulse and prepared the way for the establishment of traveling and local rural libraries, reading courses, lyceums, farmers institutes (a steadily increasing influence) and [[rural delivery service|rural free mail delivery]] (inaugurated experimentally in 1896 and adopted as part of the permanent postal system of the country in 1902); for agricultural exhibits and an improved agricultural press; for encouragement to and increased profit from the work of agricultural colleges, the establishment (1885) and great services of the United States Department of Agriculture, -- in short, for an extraordinary lessening of rural isolation and the betterment  of the farmers opportunities; for the irrigation of the semi-arid West, adopted as a national policy in [[Newlands Reclamation Act|1902]], the [[Pure Food and Drug Act|pure-food laws]] of 1906, the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887|interstate-commerce law of 1887]], the railway-rate laws of [[Elkins Act|1903]] and [[Hepburn Act|1906]], even the great [[Department of Commerce and Labor|Bureau of Commerce-and-Labor law]] of 1903, and the [[Anti-trust]] laws of 1903 and later. The Alliance and [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] movements were bottomed on the idea of "ethical gains through legislation."&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

In its local manifestations the whole movement was often marked by eccentric ideas, narrow prejudices and weaknesses in economic reasoning. It is not to be forgotten that owing to the movement of the frontier the United States has always been "at once a developed country and a primitive one. The same political questions have been put to a society advanced in some regions and undeveloped in others. ... On specific political questions each economic area has reflected its peculiar interests" (Prof. F.J. Turner).&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; That this idea must not, however, be over-emphasized, is admirably enforced by observing the great mass of farmer radicalism that has, since about 1896, become an accepted [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] principle over the whole country. The Farmers movement was the beginning of widespread, effective protest against "the menace of privilege" in the United States.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

== History ==
The origins of the caucus lie at the mid-January 2015 Republican congressional retreat in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]. Nine conservative active Republican members of the House began planning a new Congressional caucus separate from the [[Republican Study Committee]] and apart from the [[House Republican Conference]]. The group ultimately became the nine founding members and the first board of directors for the new caucus consisting of Republican Representatives [[Scott Garrett]] of New Jersey, [[Jim Jordan (U.S. politician)|Jim Jordan]] of Ohio, [[John Fleming (American politician)|John Fleming]] of Louisiana, [[Matt Salmon]] of Arizona, [[Justin Amash]] of Michigan, [[Raúl Labrador]] of Idaho, [[Mick Mulvaney]] of South Carolina, [[Ron DeSantis]] of Florida and [[Mark Meadows (North Carolina politician)|Mark Meadows]] of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=French|first1=Lauren|title=9 Republicans launch House Freedom Caucus|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/house-freedom-caucus-conservative-legislation-114593|website=Politico|access-date=December 26, 2016|date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group debated a name for their new caucus eventually settling on "House Freedom Caucus" (HFC) because, according to founding member [[Mick Mulvaney]], "it was so generic and universally awful that we had no reason to be against it." The group of nine founding members in Hershey set as a criterion for new members that they had to be willing to vote against [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[John Boehner]] on legislation that the group opposed.&lt;ref name="housedivided"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lizza|first1=Ryan|title=A House Divided|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/14/a-house-divided|access-date=December 9, 2015|publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the crisis over the funding of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in early 2015, the Caucus offered four plans for resolution, but all were rejected by the Republican leadership. One of the caucus leaders, Labrador of Idaho, said the Caucus will offer an alternative that the most conservative Republican members could support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/conservatives-offer-john-boehner-another-dhs-deal-115684.html#ixzz3TJnOXyH7|title= Conservatives offer John Boehner another DHS deal|last= French|first= Lauren|date= March 3, 2015|website= [[Politico]]|access-date= July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2015|10|25}}&lt;!-- and then what?  was it offered?  what happened then? --&gt;

=== Speaker of the House John Boehner resignation in 2015 ===
The House Freedom Caucus was involved in the resignation of Boehner on September 25, 2015 and the ensuing [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, October 2015|leadership battle for the new Speaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = John Boehner, House Speaker, Will Resign From Congress|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/us/john-boehner-to-resign-from-congress.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = September 25, 2015|access-date = October 23, 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Jennifer|last = Steinhauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Caucus who had voted against Boehner for Speaker felt unfairly punished, accusing him of cutting them off from positions in the [[Republican Study Committee]] and depriving them of key committee assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=Boehner rebels replaced on committee|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/238753-house-panel-replaces-members-after-boehner-rebellion|access-date=June 5, 2017|agency=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Scott|title=The dozen rebels targeted by GOP leaders|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/246337-the-dozen-rebels-targeted-by-gop-leaders|access-date=June 5, 2017|agency=The Hill|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehner found it increasingly difficult to manage House Republicans with the fierce opposition of the Freedom Caucus, and he sparred with House Republican members in 2013 over their willingness to shut down the government in pursuit of goals such as repealing the [[Affordable Care Act]].

After Boehner resigned as speaker, [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], the [[House Majority Leader]], was initially the lead contender to succeed him, but the Freedom Caucus withheld its support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Kevin McCarthy Announces Run for Speaker of the House|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/kevin-mccarthy-announces-run-for-speaker-of-the-house/407779/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, McCarthy withdrew from the race on October 8, 2015, after appearing to suggest that the [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|Benghazi investigation]]'s purpose had been to lower the approval ratings of [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy drops out of race for House speaker|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/08/house-majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-drops-out-of-race-for-house-speaker/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = October 8, 2015|access-date = October 23, 2015|issn = 0190-8286|first = Mike DeBonis, Robert|last = Costa|first2 = Rosalind S.|last2 = Helderman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/oct/07/context-what-kevin-mccarthy-said-about-hillary-cli/|title=In Context: What Kevin McCarthy said about Hillary Clinton and Benghazi|work=PolitiFact|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day as McCarthy's withdrawal, [[Reid Ribble]] resigned from the Freedom Caucus saying he had joined to promote certain policies and could not support the role that it was playing in the leadership race.&lt;ref name=ribble/&gt;

They can tell you everything they’re against. They’re anarchists. They want total chaos. Tear it all down and start over.

=== Rejection of American Health Care Act in 2017 ===
On March 24, 2017, the [[American Health Care Act]] (AHCA), the House Republican bill to repeal and replace the [[Affordable Care Act]], was withdrawn by Republican House Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] because it lacked the votes to pass, due in large part to opposition from Freedom Caucus Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://kfor.com/2017/03/24/breaking-house-republicans-withdraw-health-care-bill/ |title=Breaking: House Republicans withdraw health care bill |date=March 24, 2017 |access-date=March 25, 2017 |agency=CNN Wire |publisher=[[KFOR-TV]] |quote=Freedom Caucus members stood by their ideological objections to a bill they say does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Pettypiece Jennifer Jacobs &amp; Billy House, [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-25/trump-meets-freedom-caucus-and-result-is-legislative-disaster Trump Meets Freedom Caucus and Result Is Legislative Disaster], Bloomberg (March 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Collins, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/24/collapse-obamacare-repeal-plan-puts-freedom-caucus-complicated-spot/99601638/ Collapse of Obamacare repeal plan puts Freedom Caucus in complicated spot], ''USA Today'' (March 24, 2017): "While the bill faced critics from all factions of the party, no group played more of a role in sinking the legislation than the Freedom Caucus."&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, President [[Donald Trump]] publicly criticized the Freedom Caucus and other right-wing groups, such as the [[Club for Growth]] and [[Heritage Action]], that opposed the bill.

'''Gay-friendly''' or '''LGBT-friendly''' are the places, policies, people or institutions that are open and welcoming to [[gay]] people (to include all members of the [[LGBTQ community]]) to create an environment that is supportive of gay people and their relationships, respectful of all people, treat all people equally, and are non-judgmental. This is typically a late 20th-century North American term that is the byproduct of both a gradual implementation of gay rights and acceptance of policies supportive of LGBTQ people in the workplace and in schools, as well as the recognition of gays and lesbians as a distinct consumer group for businesses.

==Places==
[[File:Stockholm Pride 2016 - 3.jpg|thumb|170px|Swedish Prime Minister [[Stefan Löfven]] participated in [[Stockholm Pride]] parade, 30 July 2016]]
Cities that are known worldwide as being gay-friendly include [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[New York City]], [[Sydney]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Melbourne]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Chicago]], [[Brighton]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Montería]], [[London]],  [[Copenhagen]] and [[Berlin]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco/travel-tips-and-articles/76124|title=Top gay-friendly destinations|author=Lonely Planet|date=8 August 2012|work=Lonely Planet|accessdate=22 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328052259/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco/travel-tips-and-articles/76124|archivedate=28 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/taboo-tolerance/the-five-most-improved-places-for-gay-tolerance-932635.html|title=The five most improved places for gay tolerance|date=17 September 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] publishes a list periodically of the gayest cities in America that include cities such as [[Minneapolis]], [[Albuquerque]], [[San Diego]], [[Austin]], and several others based on facts such as their same sex marriage laws, number of same sex couples, and other qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/Print_Issue/Travel/Gayest_Cities_in_America/|title=2014's Gayest Cities in America|date=6 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spartacus International Gay Guide]] publishes the Gay Travel Index, a ranking of gay-friendly countries. Points are added to countries for anti-discrimination legislation, equal marriage, partnership and adoption laws, and LGBT marketing. Meanwhile, points are subtracted for anti-LGBT laws, HIV travel restrictions, religious influence, and prosecution, murders and death sentences to LGBT.

In 2013, the Spartacus Gay Travel Index features a majority of Western European countries in the top 11 (Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Spain), plus Canada, New Zealand and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacusworld.com/gaytravelindex.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom 5 countries are Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Jordan and Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queerty.com/spartacus-ranks-gay-friendly-destinations-swedens-on-top-usa-not-so-much-20130303/ Spartacus Ranks Gay-Friendly Destinations: Sweden’s On Top (USA Not So Much)] - Queerty, 3 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Spartacus also publishes a Gay Travel Index USA, listing the 50 states plus the District of Columbia with the same criteria as the countries ranking. In 2013, the top 5 regions are from the Northeast, whereas the top 10 also includes California, Illinois and Oregon. The bottom 10 states are mainly from the Southeast, except for a few Mountain states (Utah, Idaho and Montana).

==Businesses==

Many businesses now identify as gay-friendly, allowing for a more diversified employee and customer base. The [[Human Rights Campaign]] works to achieve equality for gays, lesbians and other and publishes a list of companies in relation to issues concerning LGBT people. Companies that are noted for gay-friendly work environments include [[Dell Inc.]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Companies such as [[R Family Vacations]], Manspray, Volkswagen, Ginch Gonch and Egotour and numerous others offer niche products and services for gay customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egotour.eu|title=egotour.eu - user reviews, gay travel portal|website=www.egotour.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[LOT Polish Airlines]] sends the message of gay-friendliness by offering travel to major gay destinations with a rainbow flag&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warszawa.gazeta.pl/warszawa/1,34862,15923350,LOT_zaprasza_do_podrozy_do_miejsc_tolerancyjnych_.html#LokKrajTxt|title=Wyborcza.pl|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that LGBT communities tend to favor gay-friendly businesses, even if the cost of a particular product or service is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgelosangeles.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=glbt&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=74392|title=Gay Consumers See Themselves as Tastemakers, Prefer Gay-Friendly Companies, Says Study|work=EDGE Media Network|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''

'''1''' In 2015 Florida explicitly lifted the adoption ban for homosexuals after federal judges ruled it unconstitutional in 2010.

'''2''' In Texas as a result from supreme court ruling from 2003 in the case [[Lawrence v. Texas]] the sodomy law was deemed to contradict the constitution of the USA. The sodomy laws are however still found in the code of law in Texas, although no longer enforced.

'''3''' Despite [[Supreme Court of the United States|supreme court's]] decision on [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], officials of one [[Same-sex marriage in Texas|Texas]] county, [[Irion County, Texas|Irion]], issue marriage licenses but claim they will refuse same-sex couples. None have applied and no legal action has been taken.&lt;ref name="Ballotpedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Local government responses to Obergefell v. Hodges|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Local_government_responses_to_Obergefell_v._Hodges#tab=Texas|website=ballotpedia.org|date=July 1, 2015 – June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4''' Officials in eight [[Same-sex marriage in Alabama|Alabama]] counties no longer issue any marriage licenses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/10/at_least_8_alabama_counties_st.html|title=Eight Alabama counties still refuse to issue marriage licenses despite gay marriage ruling|newspaper=AL.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://altoday.com/archives/17555-two-years-later-7-alabama-counties-still-not-issuing-marriage-licences-sex-couples|title=2yrs later, 7co. still not issuing same-sex marriage licenses|date=2017-06-29|work=Alabama Today|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is being done in accordance with a state law, which in 1961 was created to preserve racial segregation and made it optional for county clerks to issue marriage licenses. Several have chosen to exercise this option since the ''Obergefell'' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/alabama_judges_use_segregation.html#incart_river_home|title=Alabama judges use segregation-era law to avoid gay marriage|newspaper=AL.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes:'''

'''1''' In [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|Northern Ireland]] the legal situation for same-sex adoption is unclear.

'''2''' In [[LGBT rights in Canada|Canada]] the adoption laws vary per province. Same-sex-adoption is however possible countrywide.

'''3''' The Employment Equality Act allows religious-run workplaces exemption from its anti-discrimination provisions in order to protect their ethos.

'''4''' In [[LGBT rights in Germany|Germany]], due to federal government system, there are varying regulations regarding arrival/residence HIV. For example, in Bavaria someone who is HIV-positive can be denied entry. The Federal Constitutional Court has stipulated in several renditions of judgment that the politicians implement the same rights for gay men and lesbians which apply to heterosexuals.

'''5''' In [[LGBT rights in Israel|Israel]] a civil marriage for both homosexual and heterosexual couples is not possible as marriage can only be performed by a Rabbi. This problem does not only apply to gays and lesbians but also heterosexuals belonging to different religious affiliations. There are limited anti-discrimination laws (exception: certain religious groups).

'''6''' The [[LGBT rights in the United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands of the USA]] have the same legal status as Puerto Rico regarding the USA. Here there is also a ban on hate crimes. After the Supreme Court decision pro same sex marriage in the US, there are plans to implement SSM in Puerto Rico too.

'''7''' [[LGBT rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] passed an unclear anti-discrimination law in 2009 in which a ban on discrimination against “sexual expression” is mentioned. There is a reference that “sexual identity” is not meant in this case. It is obvious that an attempt to adhere to the minimum requirements from the EU has been made, in order to be accepted into the EU.

'''8''' As an overseas territory of the Netherlands [[LGBT rights in Sint Maarten|St. Maarten]] recognizes same-sex marriages which are performed in the Netherlands. In St. Maarten itself gay marriage is still not possible, but changes can soon follow. There are no adoption laws.

'''9''' There are regional differences in the laws relating to homosexuals. In addition, the local religion is just as crucial, whether a law is implemented or not.

'''10''' In May 2016 the Parliament of [[LGBT rights in Seychelles|Seychelles]] decided to make homosexuality legal.

'''11''' From [[LGBT rights in Armenia|Armenia]] we received many reports of illegal violence from police against homosexuals.

'''12''' In [[LGBT rights in Honduras|Honduras]] an anti-discrimination law has recently been passed, but in practice it is ignored.

'''13''' In [[LGBT rights in Botswana|Botswana]] is homosexuality practically illegally on the basis of the ban on “unnatural act”, but in the labor law there is still an explicit prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.

'''14''' In [[LGBT rights in Mauritius|Mauritius]], the sodomy law tends to find application with the heterosexual population. The Equal Opportunities Act protects homosexuals against discrimination at work. It is therefore questionable whether homosexuality is classified as illegal or not.

'''15''' Consensual homosexual acts in [[LGBT rights in Peru|Peru]] between adults are legal. An exception applies for members of the military and police, who can be prosecuted with a prison sentence ranging from 60 days to 20 years or suspension from duty.

'''16''' There are reports of a different judicial interpretations of the law on “sex against nature’.

'''17''' In December 2013, the Supreme Court set aside a 2009 verdict by the Delhi High Court that had decriminalized homosexuality. This has turned gay sex into a punishable offence once again and catapulted India back into the legal standpoint of colonial times under the British.

'''18''' At the request of the UNHCR [[LGBT rights in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] has announced that discrimination of homosexuals is constitutionally forbidden. It was further stressed that the anti-sodomy law is not aimed against homosexuals, but applies for all to protect public morals.

'''19''' In [[LGBT rights in Bahrain|Bahrain]] although the paragraph referring to sodomy was abolished in 1976 from the local legal code, gay men can still be punished with imprisonment according to the laws regarding “unmoral” behavior.

'''20''' Police stopped violently the Gay Pride on June 29 th, 2015. This can be considered a de facto ban on the Pride.

'''21''' The Shariah-law in [[LGBT rights in Djibouti|Djibouti]] is often superior to the constitutional laws, so that it could be expected that homosexuality is punishable.

'''22''' In [[LGBT rights in Ghana|Ghana]] there is a ban on unnatural sex. The government recognizes in this a clear ban on homosexuality.

'''23''' In [[LGBT rights in Nigeria|Nigeria]] the death penalty only applies for homosexuals according to the Shariah laws and therefore relates only to Muslims in the north of Nigeria.

'''24''' [[LGBT rights in Iraq|Homosexuality in Iraq]] is formally legal, but police and military track down homosexuals, and reports of murder and rape exist.

'''25''' [[LGBT rights in Vatican City|The Vatican City]] adheres to Italian law, but restrictions are possible if the ecclesiastical law contradicts
Italian law. Therefore, there are conflicting opinions that homosexuality is not illegal or just not happily seen, but tolerated.

'''26''' Shariah laws applies in [[LGBT rights in Somalia|Somalia]] since 2012. There is however contradictory information, since, on the one hand the maximum penalty is up to 3 years in prison, but 2013 a homosexual was stoned to death after a judgment.

A '''government''' or '''state agency''', sometimes an appointed '''commission''', is a permanent or semi-permanent organization in the [[machinery of government]] that is responsible for the oversight and administration of specific functions, such as an [[intelligence agency]]. There is a notable variety of agency types. Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department or [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]], and other types of public body established by [[government]]. The functions of an agency are normally executive in character, since different types of organizations (''such as commissions'') are most often constituted in an advisory role—this distinction is often blurred in practice however.

A government agency may be established by either a national government or a state government within a federal system. ''The term is not normally used for an organization created by the powers of a local government body''. Agencies can be established by legislation or by executive powers. The autonomy, independence and accountability of government agencies also vary widely.

==History==
Early examples of organizations that would now be termed a government agency include the British [[Navy Board]], responsible for ships and supplies, which was established&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of the Royal Navy, Royal Navy Museum, accessed at [http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_naval_history.htm] June 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in 1546 by King Henry VIII and the British [[Commissioner of Bankruptcy (England and Wales)|Commissioners of Bankruptcy]] established&lt;ref&gt;Macleavy, J. and O. Gay (2005) ''The Quango Debate'', House of Commons Library Research Paper 05/30, p. 8 accessed at {{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2005/rp05-030.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619222709/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2005/rp05-030.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1570.

From 1933, the [[New Deal]] saw growth in US federal agencies, the "[[alphabet agencies]]" as they were used to deliver new programs created by legislation, such as the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]].

From the 1980s, as part of [[New Public Management]], several countries including Australia and the United Kingdom developed the use of agencies to improve efficiency in public services.

==Canada==
{{Main|Structure of the Canadian federal government}}

==France==
Administrative law in France refers to ''autorité administrative indépendante'' (AAI) or Independent Administrative Authorities. They tend to be prominent in the following areas of public policy;
* Economic and financial regulation
* Information and communication
* Defence of citizens' rights

Independent Administrative Authorities in France may not be instructed or ordered to take specific actions by government.

==Germany==
{{Main|Federal agency (Germany)}}

==Greece==
{{Main|General Secretariat for Macedonia and Thrace}}

The [[General Secretariat for Macedonia and Thrace]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γενική Γραμματεία Μακεδονίας-Θράκης), previously [[Ministry for Macedonia and Thrace]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Υπουργείο Μακεδονίας-Θράκης) is a government agency of the [[Hellenic Republic]] that is responsible for the [[Administrative regions of Greece|Greek regions]] of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace (Greece)|Thrace]].

==Iceland==
{{Main|Government agencies in Iceland}}

==India==
{{See also|List of Indian government agencies}}

The term ''agency'' in India has several meanings; for example, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet and the parliament]] [[wikt:secretariat|Secretariat]] describes itself&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India at [http://cabsec.nic.in/], accessed June 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  as a "''nodal agency'' for coordination amongst the ministries of the Govt. of India". Most notably as an international feature, what appear to be independent agencies (''or apex agencies'') include some that have active roles for Ministers: such as, the [[National Security Council (India)|National Security Council]], the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]], and the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]], which is chaired [[ex officio]] by the Prime Minister.

==Russian Federation==
Russia has had many government agencies throughout its history. The [[USSR]] had the secretive [[KGB]].
Today, Russian government agencies such as the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]], [[Federal Protective Service of Russia|FSO]], and the [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] use [[Spetsnaz]] or other masked operators for any missions.
Other organizations include [[Kremlin]] and presidential security.

==Sweden ==
{{Main|Government agencies in Sweden}}
The Government agencies in Sweden are state controlled organizations who act independently to carry out the policies of the Swedish Government. The Government Ministries are relatively small and merely policy-making organizations, allowed to control agencies by policy decisions but not by direct orders. This means that while the agencies are subject to decisions made by the Government, Ministers are explicitly prohibited (so called "ministerstyre") from interfering with the day-to-day operation in an agency or the outcome in individual cases as well.

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Executive agency}}
Agencies in the [[United Kingdom]] are either [[executive agency|executive agencies]] answerable to [[political minister|government ministers]] or [[non-departmental public body|non-departmental public bodies]] answerable directly to one of the [[parliament]]s or devolved [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]] of the United Kingdom. They are also commonly known as [[Quango]]s.

Agencies can be created by enabling legislation by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], [[Scottish Parliament]] or the [[National Assembly for Wales]].

Agencies in England usually answer to Westminster or the British Government.  In Scotland they usually answer to the [[Scottish Government]] or the Scottish Parliament and in Wales to the National Assembly for Wales.

Some have remits that cover the entire UK and these organisations are funded by and answer to the British Government.

==United States==
{{Main|List of federal agencies in the United States}}

The [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] and [[President of the United States]] delegate specific authority to government agencies to [[regulation|regulate]] the complex facets of the modern [[US|American]] [[Federal republic|federal state]]. Also, most of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s have created similar government agencies. Each of the 50 states' governments is pretty similar to the national government with most having some form of a senate and house of representatives.
The term "government agency" or "administrative agency" usually applies to one of the '''[[independent agencies of the United States government]]''', which exercise some degree of independence from the President's control. Although the heads of independent agencies are often appointed by the government, they can usually be removed only for cause. The heads of independent agencies work together in groups, such as a commission, board or council. Independent agencies often function as miniature versions of the [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|tripartite]] federal government with the authority to [[legislation|legislate]] (through the issuing, or "promulgation" of [[regulation]]s), to [[adjudication|adjudicate]] disputes, and to [[enforcement|enforce]] agency regulations (through enforcement personnel).  Examples of independent agencies include the [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC), [[Federal Reserve Board]], [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).

A broader definition of the term "government agency" also means the '''[[United States federal executive departments]]''' that include the President's [[United States Cabinet|cabinet-level departments]], and their sub-units. Examples of these agencies include the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which is a bureau of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]].

Most federal agencies are created by Congress through [[statute]]s called "[[enabling act]]s" which define the scope of an agency's authority. Because the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not expressly mention federal agencies (as it does the three branches), some commentators have called agencies the "headless fourth branch" of the federal government. However, most independent agencies are technically part of the executive branch, with a few located in the legislative branch of government. By enacting the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA) in 1946, Congress established some means to oversee government agency action. The APA established uniform [[administrative law]] procedures for a federal agency's promulgation of rules, and adjudication of claims. The APA also sets forth the process for [[judicial review]] of agency action.

The '''Greater New York Conference on Soviet Jewry (GNYCSJ)''' was founded in 1971, as a non-governmental grassroots organization that worked to secure human rights for Jews in the Soviet Union. It served as an umbrella agency for a number of regional organizations of the [[Soviet Jewry Movement|Soviet Jewry movement]].  In the 1980 GNYCSJ was renamed Coalition for Soviet Jewry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/857769728|title=The struggle for Soviet Jewry in American politics : Israel versus the American Jewish establishment|last=1943-|first=Lazin, Frederick A.,|isbn=0739161415|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=857769728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators.

The phones tapped included those of the Prime Minister [[Kostas Karamanlis]] and members of his family, the Mayor of [[Athens]], [[Dora Bakoyannis]], most phones of the top officers at the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the [[Minister for Public Order (Greece)|Ministry for Public Order]], members of the ruling party, ranking members of the opposition [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] party (PASOK), the Hellenic Navy General Staff, the previous Minister of Defense and one phone of a locally hired Greek American employee of the American Embassy. Phones of Athens-based Arab businessmen were also tapped.

Foreign and Greek media have raised [[United States]] intelligence agencies as the main suspects.&lt;ref name = "Galpin"&gt;{{cite web | first = Richard | last = Galpin  | title = Death muddies Greek spy probe | publisher = BBC | date = March 24, 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4838552.stm | accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bryan-Low"&gt;{{cite web | first = Cassell | last = Bryan-Low | title = Vodafone, Ericsson Get Hung Up In Greece's Phone-Tap Scandal | publisher = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = June 21, 2006 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115085571895085969 | accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Agence France Presse|AFP]] reported that one Greek official stated on background that the likely initial penetration occurred during the run-up to the 2004 Athens Olympics, stating: "it is evident that the wiretaps were organized by foreign intelligence agencies, for security reasons related to the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]]."{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The leader of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] socialist opposition [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]] said that the Greek government itself had pointed towards the US as responsible for the wiretaps by giving up the zone of listening range, in which the US embassy was included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Watergrec'': à qui profite l'écoute? | publisher = [[Le Figaro]] | date = February 3, 2006 | language = French | url = http://www.spyworld-actu.com/spip.php?article1492 | accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, after an investigation lasting 10 years, Greek investigators have found conclusive evidence linking the wiretapping to the US Embassy in Athens.&lt;ref name="Intercept"&gt;{{cite web | first = James | last = Bamford  | title = A death in Athens: Did a Rogue NSA Operation Cause the Death of a Greek Telecom Employee? | publisher = The Intercept | date = September 28, 2015 | url = https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/ | accessdate = October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, Greek authorities have issued an arrest warrant for a certain William George Basil, a NSA operative from a Greek immigrant background.&lt;ref name="Intercept"/&gt;

==Exploitation of Vodafone's network==
[[File:Mobile Switching Centre-Ericsson AXE.jpg|thumb|Ericsson AXE]]
The [[Ericsson]] [[Telephone exchange|switches]] used by Vodafone Greece were compromised and unauthorized software was installed that made use of legitimate tapping modules, known as "[[lawful interception]]", while bypassing the normal monitoring and logging that would take place when a legal tap is set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vodafone Greece rogue phone taps: details at last | publisher = Heise Security | date = July 16, 2007 | url = http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Vodafone-Greece-rogue-phone-taps-details-at-last-733244.html | accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This software was eventually found to be installed on four of Vodafone's [[AXE telephone exchange|Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges]].&lt;ref name = "IEEE" /&gt;

In modern mobile telecommunication networks, legal wiretaps, known as [[lawful interception]]s, are performed at the switch. Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges support lawful intercepts via the remote-control equipment subsystem (RES), which carries out the tap, and the interception management system (IMS), software used for initiating addition of the tap to the RES database.  
In a fully operating lawful interception system the RES and IMS both create logs of all numbers being tapped, allowing system administrators to perform audits in order to find unauthorized taps.

To successfully wiretap phone numbers without detection, as the intruders did, a special set of circumstances had to be present. The RES had to be active on the exchange, but the IMS had to be unused. At the time of the illegal wiretaps, Vodafone had not yet purchased the lawful intercept options, meaning the IMS was not present on their systems. However, an earlier exchange software upgrade had included the RES. In addition, the intruders needed to continue to have access to the exchange software to change tapped numbers, without alerting system administrators that the exchange had been modified. Normally, all changes to exchange software would be logged. To get around this, the intruders installed a [[rootkit]] on the exchange, a piece of software that would modify the exchange software on the fly to hide all changes and, in case of an audit, to make the exchange appear as though it had been untouched.

When one of the tapped phones made or received a phone call, the exchange, or switch, sent a duplication of the conversation to one of fourteen anonymous [[prepaid mobile phone]]s.  As these phones are not associated with a contract, retrieving details of their owners is very difficult. About half of the intercepting phones were activated between June and August 2004. The base stations that serviced those phones were in an area near the center of Athens.

==Discovery of illegal taps==

On January 24, 2005, an intruder update of exchange software resulted in customer [[Short message service|text messages]] not being sent. [[Vodafone Greece]] sent firmware dumps of the affected exchanges to [[Ericsson]] for analysis.  On March 4, 2005, Ericsson located the rogue code, 6500 lines of code written in the [[PLEX (programming language)|PLEX programming language]] used by Ericsson AXE switches.&lt;ref name = "IEEE" /&gt;  Writing such sophisticated code in a very esoteric language required a high level of expertise.  Much of Ericsson's software development for AXE had been done by an Athens-based company named Intracom Telecom, so the skills needed to write the rogue software were likely available within Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = John | last = Leyden  | title = Greek mobile wiretap scandal unpicked | publisher = The Register | date = July 11, 2007 | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/11/greek_mobile_wiretap_latest/page2.html | accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2005, Ericsson notified [[Vodafone Greece|Vodafone]] of the existence of rogue wiretaps and software in their systems.  The next day the general manager of the Greek Vodafone branch, George Koronias, asked for the software to be removed and deactivated.  Because the rogue software was removed before law enforcement had an opportunity to investigate, the perpetrators were likely alerted that their software had been found and had ample opportunity to turn off the "shadow" phones to avoid detection.&lt;ref name = "IEEE" /&gt;  According to the head of Greece's intelligence service, Ioannis Korantis: "From the moment that the software was shut down, the string broke that could have lead {{sic}} us to who was behind this."&lt;ref name = "Bryan-Low" /&gt;

On March 9, the Network Planning Manager for Vodafone Greece, [[Kostas Tsalikidis]], was found dead in an apparent suicide. According to several experts questioned by the Greek press, Tsalikidis was a key witness in the investigation of responsibility of the wiretaps. Family and friends believe there are strong indications he was the person who first discovered that highly sophisticated software had been secretly inserted into the Vodafone network.&lt;ref name = "Galpin" /&gt;  Tsalikidis had been planning for a while to quit his Vodafone job but told his fiancée not long before he died that it had become "a matter of life or death" that he leave, says the family's lawyer, Themis Sofos.&lt;ref name = "Bryan-Low" /&gt;  There is speculation that either he committed suicide because of his involvement in the tapping of the phones, or he was murdered because he had discovered, or was about to discover, who the perpetrators were.&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{cite web | authors = Cherry, Steven; Goldstein, Harry | title = An Inside Job | publisher = IEEE Spectrum Magazine | date = July 2007 | url = http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/print/5280 | accessdate = 2007-11-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101075450/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/print/5280 | archive-date = 2008-01-01 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a four-month investigation of his death, Supreme Court prosecutor Dimitris Linos said that the death of Tsalikidis was directly linked to the scandal.  "If there had not been the phone tapping, there would not have been a suicide," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Helena | last = Smith |title = Death of Vodafone engineer linked to Greek Watergate | publisher = The Guardian | date = June 23, 2006 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jun/23/city.mobilephones | accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2007, press reports in Greece quoted the Tsalikidis family attorney, Themistokles Sofos, as saying they had commenced legal action against Vodafone, "suspect[ing] he was poisoned".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | first = Jamie | last = Doward | title = Vodafone faces court case in 'bugging' row | publisher = The Guardian | date = November 24, 2007 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2216638,00.html | accessdate = 2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10 Koronias asked to meet [[Kostas Karamanlis|Prime Minister Karamanlis]] to discuss matters of national security.  At 20:00 on the same day he presented the facts to the Minister of Public Order and the Prime Minister's chief of staff, and on the next day he presented them to the Prime Minister.

A preliminary judicial investigation was carried out, which, due to the complexity of the case, lasted until February 1, 2006. The preliminary investigation did not point out any persons connected with the case. The investigation was hindered by the fact that Vodafone disabled the interception system, and therefore locating the intercepting phones was no longer possible (the phones were apparently switched off), and that Vodafone had incorrectly purged all access logs.  Police rounded up and questioned as suspects persons who called the monitoring phones, but all callers claimed they called these phones because their number was previously used by another person.

[[Ericsson]] has checked their equipment in other markets world-wide and has not found the illegal software installed anywhere else.  "As far as Ericsson knows, this is a unique incident. We have never discovered anything like this before or since." Vodafone spokesman Ben Padovan said.&lt;ref name = "Bryan-Low" /&gt;

==Fallout==

The investigation into the matter was further hampered when Greek law enforcement officials began to make accusations at both Vodafone and Ericsson, which forced experts on the defensive.&lt;ref name ="IEEE" /&gt;

A recent appeal of the main opposition party, [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]], to form an investigating parliamentary committee was rejected by the governing party.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In December 2006 Vodafone Greece was fined [[Euro|€]]76 million by the Communications Privacy Protection Authority, a Greek privacy watchdog group, for the illegal wiretapping of 106 cellphones.  The fine was calculated as €500,000 for each phone that was eavesdropped on, as well as a €15 million fine for impeding their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Timo | last = Poropudas | title = Vodafone fined EUR 76 million in Greece | publisher = Nordic Wireless Watch | date = December 16, 2006 | url = http://nordicwirelesswatch.com/wireless/story.html?story_id=5135 | accessdate = 2007-11-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305022710/http://nordicwirelesswatch.com/wireless/story.html?story_id=5135 | archivedate = March 5, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2007, Vodafone Greece was again fined €19 million by EETT, the national telecommunications regulator, for alleged breach of privacy rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Carr, John |author2=Judge, Elizabeth | title = Phone-tapping scandal in Greece costs Vodafone new €19m fine | publisher = [[The Times]] | date = October 20, 2007 | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/telecoms/article2697766.ece | accessdate = 2007-11-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2011, new evidence emerged indicated the US Embassy in Athens was behind the telephone interceptions. The key evidence of complicity was that out of the 14 anonymous prepaid mobile phones used for the interception, three had been purchased by the same person at the same time as a fourth one. The fourth phone called mobile phones and landlines registered with the US Embassy in Athens. With a sim card registered to the US Embassy, it also called two telephone numbers in Ellicott City and Cantonsville, Maryland, both [[NSA]] [[bedroom communities]].{{explain|date=July 2018}} A criminal investigation was launched,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20130923220646/http://wikileaks-press.org/translation-usa-espionage-against-greece/ Translation: USA Espionage against Greece]", WikiLeaks Press, September 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wikileaks-press.org/translation-courtcase-evidence-usa-espionage-against-greece/Translation: Courtcase Evidence: USA Espionage against Greece]", WikiLeaks Press, September 23, 2013.

==History==
It is located in the [[Griggstown, New Jersey|Griggstown]] section of [[Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey|Franklin Township]], [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]], [[New Jersey]], and was started in 1973 by George Rude with twelve quail on {{convert|2|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref name=tanner&gt;{{cite news |author= Pat Tanner|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Princeton; Birds of Many Feathers  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE3D9103DF931A15751C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon= |quote=Griggstown Quail Farm in Princeton started out in the 1970s with 12 quail; within only a few years it had 12,000 birds and was supplying hundreds a week to haute restaurants in [[New York City]], among them Lutèce and the Four Seasons. For the last 10 years the farm has also been supplying game birds to the country's leading purveyor, D'Artagnan, in Newark. Then, last year, Joan and George Rude, the owners of the farm, opened a retail store so the public could buy the same locally raised, all-natural birds that top-name chefs do. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=February 22, 2004 |accessdate=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time the farm was owned by Peter Josten. George purchased the land from Josten in 1992, the Griggstown Quail Farm grew to over {{convert|75|acre|m2}} of land. In 2007 the farm had about 35,000 pheasants, 70,000 quail, and 150,000 chickens. In season they raise [[Mallard duck]], [[Muscovy duck]], [[Bourbon Red]] turkey, and [[partridge]].&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Rick|last= Nichols|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=On the Side |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-32995057_ITM |quote=Princeton's Griggstown Quail Farm has gotten into the act: Its slow-growing Bourbon Red turkeys range free in outdoor pens, ... |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All the birds are free-range.

{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
'''Halt All Racist Tours''' ('''HART''') was a protest group set up in New Zealand in 1969 to protest against [[rugby union]] tours to and from [[South Africa]].

==Chronology==
Up until 1970, South Africa refused to allow mixed-race sports teams to tour South Africa, and they were not happy about having to play against "natives" in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao67TeA/c16.html|title=In Support of the New Zealand Maori Councils Decision in Favour of the 1970 All Black Tour|last=Magee|first=Eve J.|journal=Te Ao Hou|issue=67|date=July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest movement against the [[1960 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa]] used the slogan "No Maoris, No Tour", but it was unsuccessful at stopping the tour. In 1967, the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] decided to cancel the proposed 1967 tour over the issue.

Trevor Richards, [[Tom Newnham]] and others formed HART in 1969 to protest against the proposed [[1970 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1970 tour]]. The tour went ahead after the South Africans agreed to accept a mixed-race team.

In 1973, HART promised a campaign of civil disruption if the [[Springboks]] toured New Zealand. The [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Prime Minister, [[Norman Kirk]], prohibited the tour. Rugby supporters objected, complaining that politics should not interfere in sport.

The [[All Blacks]] were next due to [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|tour South Africa in 1976]]. Newly elected [[New Zealand National Party|National]] Prime Minister [[Rob Muldoon]] refused to cancel the tour, which went ahead. Subsequently Commonwealth leaders adopted the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] whereby they agreed to discourage sporting contact with South Africa. 21 African nations boycotted the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] in protest against the [[All Black]] tour of South Africa.

HART merged with the National Anti-Apartheid Council in 1980 to become HART: NZAAM (Halt All Racist Tours: New Zealand Anti-Apartheid Movement). After ten years as National Chairperson, Richards was replaced by [[John Minto]].

The high point of protest was around the [[1981 Springbok Tour]] in which thousands of New Zealanders protested, invaded pitches, and were involved in [[civil disobedience]] to stretch police resources. HART was not the leading body in these protests, as broader organisations were set up in each major centre to coordinate protests, but HART members played a leading role in these organisations.

In 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the [[New Zealand High Court]] after [[Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union|two lawyers sued the NZRFU]], claiming such a tour would breach the NZRFU's constitution. An unofficial tour did take place in 1986 by a team including the majority of the All Blacks players selected for the previous year's cancelled tour. These were known as the [[New Zealand Cavaliers]], but often advertised inside the Republic as the All Blacks or alternatively depicted with the [[Silver Fern]]. HART organised nationwide protests, but they were much smaller than the 1981 protests.

HART's reason for existence ended with the [[dismantling of apartheid]] by the South African government. &lt;!--- Anyone know when it was formally wound up? ----&gt;

'''''Hearts of Iron II''''' is a [[Grand strategy wargame|grand strategy computer war game]] for the [[Personal computer|PC]] based upon its predecessor, ''[[Hearts of Iron]]'', which was developed by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]].

It takes place in the period from 1 January 1936 through 30 December 1947 (1964 with the expansion), and allows the player to assume control of any one of over 175 nations of the time and guide its development through the years before, during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was developed by Paradox Interactive and released in 2005. The lead [[game programmer]] was [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]].

A sequel, ''[[Hearts of Iron III]]'', was released in August 2009.

''[[Arsenal of Democracy (video game)|Arsenal of Democracy]]'', a grand strategy wargame based on ''Hearts of Iron II'', was released in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aodgame.com/|title=Welcome to BL-Logic - Arsenal of Democracy|website=aodgame.com|access-date=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iron Cross'', a ''Hearts of Iron II'' expansion, was released on October 7, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?499371-IRON-CROSS-Official-Announcement|title=Iron Croos - Official Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game|Darkest Hour]]'', a stand-alone strategy game based on ''Hearts of Iron II'', was released on April 5, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?533389-Important-pages-DH-fans-including-reviews-dev-diaries-wiki-and-download-links!&amp;p=12316249&amp;viewfull=1#post12316249|title=Important pages DH fans -- including reviews, dev diaries, wiki, and download links!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Hearts of Iron II'' is a [[grand strategy game]]. The player can build land [[Division (military)|divisions]], aircraft [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]], and naval ships/fleets, and combine these into [[corps]] and [[Army|armies]]. The player also has the ability to control the appointment of commanders of forces under their nation's flag or that of controlled nations as well as to control the appointment of individual government [[Political minister|ministers]] and military commanders in key [[General Staff]] positions. The player also has a broader ability to control the heads of state and government; however, this option is only available to democracies and only then through elections, in which the player chooses the winner. Technological research is controlled by the player. All this is on a global scale, with the player simultaneously dealing and interacting with nations across the world. The game can be paused at any point.

=== Playable nations ===
The player can choose to play almost any nation from the time period, apart from some very small states such as [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[Vatican City]] or others (and mods exist that make even these playable). The player can also play as a new nation that gains its independence as the game progresses, but should wait until the nation actually declares independence in the game before it can be played. However, many smaller nations do not have strong tech teams, nor do they possess a strong industrial base.

=== Politics ===
The player is able to manage his nation's foreign and internal policies on the Diplomacy page. The player can declare war, annex territories and make alliances. The player can also alter the [[Social engineering (political science)|social]] and economic policies of their nation using sliders, such as [[Democracy|democratic]] versus [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], [[free market]] versus [[Planned economy|central planning]] and so on. Moving the sliders will result in different bonuses and penalties, allowing for a range of choices and strategies.

On the same page, the player can appoint leaders and ministers, with some exceptions. The [[Head of State]] and [[Head of Government]] can only be changed through moving the [[Left-wing politics|Political Left]] vs. [[Right-wing politics|Political Right]] slider, or through elections and other one-time events.

=== Resource management ===
''Hearts of Iron II'' features nine resources, of which six are conventional resources, and the other three are manpower, industrial capacity and transport capacity.

* [[Energy]], rare materials (e.g. rubber), and [[metal]] are produced by individual provinces and pooled together to power the nation's industry.
* Supplies are consumed by a player's armed forces.
* [[Petroleum|Oil]] is consumed by mechanized or armored units, air units and naval units. (and some infantry with attached units)
* [[Money]] is raised through the production of consumer goods. The amount gained also varies based on government type and policy settings. Money is needed to carry out diplomatic actions, as well as pay research teams.
* Manpower is needed to recruit and reinforce all of a player's armed forces. One unit of Manpower generally represents 1,000 men, as a normal infantry division of 10,000 men requires ten Manpower.
* Each factory in a nation contributes one point of industrial capacity (IC). The total number of factories is known as the Base IC. Several factors, such as difficulty, ministerial appointments, technologies, and resources available can modify this number, producing the actual IC. Each actual IC requires two points of energy, one of metal and half a point of rare materials in order to function.
* Transport capacity (TC) is an abstract number that represents the trucks, trains and river barges which are used to supply a player's armed forces with fuel and supply. TC is a direct function of a player's IC; the player has a TC that is 150% his IC. When the TC used exceeds the available amount, movement, supplies and reinforcements are delayed.

The six conventional resources can be traded with other countries, subject to potential disruption by enemy forces if the routes to the other country are occupied. Trade offers can be made to any other country, even ones with poor diplomatic relations, although allied nations are more willing to accept more favorable trade offers. Manpower, IC and TC are not tradeable.

== Scenarios ==
In the game, a player assumes direct control of a nation at the start of a scenario through 1948. The following scenarios are available:
* The Road to War, beginning on [[New Year's Day]], 1936;
* The Gathering Storm, beginning in September 1938, just before the [[Munich Agreement]]; Added in the v1.2 patch.

* [[Götterdämmerung]], beginning on 20 June 1944, two weeks after the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] landed at [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]].

Added in ''Iron Cross'':
* 1933, beginning on 30 January 1933, when Hitler [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931–1933)|takes power]] in Germany.
* 1934, beginning on 1 October 1934, at the start of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|October revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=499365|title=Paradox Interactive announce Iron Cross and Darkest Hour!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Case Blue|Fall Blau]], the German 1942 summer offensive against the Soviet Union, eventually culminating in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]; Added in the v1.2 patch.

== Warfare ==
''Hearts of Iron II'' is a [[grand strategy]] game. The smallest independent land unit is the [[Division (military)|division]], although [[brigade]]s such as engineers, artillery, or armoured cars can be attached to these. On sea, units are either single [[capital ship]]s or flotillas of small ships such as destroyers. For the air force, the unit is a [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] or Group, depending on nationality. Land divisions include [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[tank]]s. Land brigades include [[Anti-tank|anti-tank guns]], [[Anti-aircraft|anti-aircraft artillery]] and military police.

On the map the player can direct divisions or groups of divisions. Fighting starts when an army starts moving into a defended enemy territory. The invading units do not have to be inside enemy territory to attack. A province is immediately occupied when the invaders arrive there with no opposition left. Because of this, a player can blitz through large swaths of enemy lands with minimal micromanagement. In addition, units who move constantly lose organization and risk losing supply, so poorly executed attempts to blitzkrieg can be stopped. Provinces can be fortified and infrastructure increased to improve combat performance. Structures include radar, and static [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]]. Many fortifications are pre-built, such as the [[Maginot Line]] along the French-German border.

Air units include bombers, fighters and transports. These divisions can, depending on type, engage in tactical or strategic missions. Sea units include transports, [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[battleship]]s, [[cruisers]], [[destroyers]], and [[submarines]]. Each unit has a strength, speed, and effective engagement range.  Naval combats simulate the range between fleets, allowing only units in range to fire. This can make naval combats tactically complex.

== Controversy and censorship ==
Like its predecessor ''[[Hearts of Iron]]'', the game is banned in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The main point of contention seems to be that the game portrays the various [[warlord era|Chinese warlord]]s as independent entities, while according to the PRC government they were nominally part of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] governed by the [[Chinese Nationalist]] government, represented in-game as 'Nationalist China'. Also, the [[Flag of Tibet|Tibetan flag]] used in-game is banned in China. Paradox has stated that it will not reduce the level of historical accuracy in order to appease the [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|PRC censors]].{{citation needed|date=September 2007}}
 
Anachronistically, Germany is represented with the [[flag of the German Empire]] as used by Germany until 1935, and not the [[Flag of Germany#Nazi Germany|Swastika flag]], as was also done in the earlier board game ''[[Axis &amp; Allies]]''. Laws in Germany prohibit the use of the swastika. Additionally, in the German version of the game, pictures of leading Nazi leaders, such as Hitler, Göring, and Himmler were removed and their names subsequently altered, though this is not required under German censorship laws, and is not the case in non-German versions of the game. The game can be easily modified by users to include such graphics, but Paradox disallows discussion of this particular type of modification on their message boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=143285|title=Read This First - Terror bombing, concentration camps &amp; swastikas!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansions ==
=== Doomsday (final version 1.3a [March, 2007]) ===
In November 2005, a stand-alone expansion pack to the game, ''Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday'', was announced and it was released April 4, 2006. It contains everything that was in the original game while highlighting and expanding the period after historical World War II, including a hypothetical [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] between the Soviet Union and the Allies. The expansion pack features among other things a reworked intelligence model (which allows the player to use espionage, sabotage and other things in an "intelligence page" accessible through the main screen), improved AI and a scenario editor.

''Doomsday'' also features some other changes and additions such as:
* Additional graphics such as bomber sprites
* Escort Carriers
* Hospitals that recover manpower losses
* A "do not upgrade" button for divisions
* The option of automating the production sliders
* Submarines have separate stats for convoy raiding and naval combat
* An extended timeframe — the game end date has been changed to 1953
* New technologies to bring the game into the cold war era
* An included scenario editor
* The ability to trade divisions between nations
* The ability to attach escorts while recruiting divisions

=== Armageddon (final version 1.3 beta2 [April, 2009] ===
Another expansion was released in April 2007 in an [[alternate history]] scenario called ''Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon''. It further allows more time and the player has the ability to choose 1964 as the end point. It allows the adding of modules to ships (such as improved radar, fire-control, anti-submarine or anti-aircraft weaponry) and submits two new scenarios for play, as well as an enhanced AI.

''Armageddon'' also features some other changes and additions such as:
* Player can allow or disallow democracies to declare war on the main menu options screen
* Player may choose when the time of play will end, ranging as early as 1940 to as late as 1964
* Player may choose to get the full industrial capacity of an annexed country, or not
* Player may choose to use tech teams of an annexed country or not
* New brigade attachments for ships
* Diplomatic option to refuse expeditionary forces from your allies

=== Iron Cross ===
''Iron Cross'' is an expansion of ''Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon'' released as a digital download on October 7, 2010, developed by [[Irshappa]]. It expands the number of provinces on the map as well as numerous other additions and can also be installed as an expansion of ''[[Arsenal of Democracy (video game)|Arsenal of Democracy]]'' and ''[[Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game|Darkest Hour]]''.

''Iron Cross'' also features some other changes and additions such as:
* Play as one of 200 countries from 1933 to 1964, and interact with real ministers and leaders
* New map with over 4,000 new provinces
* More than 6,000 new events
* New [[tech tree]] featuring 800 technologies, with a realistic research system
* New units and brigades, including special units, infantry regiment, heavy artillery, and more
* New AI offering more options and greater depth
* New scenarios set in 1933 and 1934 as well as old scenarios adapted to ''Iron Cross''
* Compatible with ''Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon, Arsenal of Democracy and Darkest Hour''

== Community mods ==
Several free community [[Mods (computer gaming)|game modifications]] were developed after the releases of ''Heart Of Iron II'', ''Doomsday'' and ''Armageddon''; and with the same as a baseline. A popular mod called kaiserreich was released with positive reviews.

{{voting}}

The term '''issue voting''' describes when [[Voting|voters]] cast their vote in [[election]]s based on [[political issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of an election, issues include "any questions of [[public policy]] which have been or are a matter of controversy and are sources of disagreement between [[political party|political parties]].”&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of issue voting, voters compare  the [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|candidates']] respective [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] against their own in order to decide for whom to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A voter does not need to have an in-depth understanding of every issue and knowledge of how a [[candidate]] stands on every issue, but rather a sense of which candidate they agree with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Voters use many different tactics to rationalize their view on a particular issue. Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Highton, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.&lt;ref&gt;Enelow, 217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 79, 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.&lt;ref&gt;Denver,21-23&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 246&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 104&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.

==History of issue voting==
Prior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 1, 2, 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, "Issue Voting"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 109-102&lt;/ref&gt; Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Nie (1974) 541-591&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Nie 47-73&lt;/ref&gt; This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.

===Rise in issue voting===
In recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
Identifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the "issue voting vs. party voting" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications regarding issue voting==
Many factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 460&lt;/ref&gt; Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

A second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bisnow, 24&lt;/ref&gt; None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.

A third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurred in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.

A fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of issue voting==
While scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.

[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]
*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; The equation “Y = a + bX” is used, where the variable “a” represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, “b” is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, "X" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426-429&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spatial Model attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, 275&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that if someone’s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates’ policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough,199-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other models that follow the idea of “closeness” are called proximity models.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 93, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter’s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 93&lt;/ref&gt; This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niemi,1212&lt;/ref&gt; A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:

::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)

::where "a"=Party 1, and "b"=Party 2

:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The water treatment facility is under construction in the lakeside town of [[Katosi]], in Ntenjeru subcounty, [[Mukono District]], in the [[Buganda|Buganda Region]] of Uganda. Katosi is approximately {{convert|28|km|0}}, by road, south of the town of [[Mukono]], where the district headquarters are located.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web| access-date=26 April 2018 | url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Uganda_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Mukono%2C%20Uganda&amp;toplace=KATOSI%20TRADING%20CENTRE%2C%20Mukono%2C%20Uganda&amp;dt1=ChIJpbAJFLfHfRcRcMWeVCv42t0&amp;dt2=ChIJeaxYDdHtfRcR97tzM9xewwA |title=Distance between Mukono, Uganda and Katosi Trading Centre, Mukono District, Uganda |date=26 April 2018 |author=Globefeed.com |publisher=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is about {{convert|50|km|0}}, by road, south-east of [[Kampala]], the [[capital city]] of Uganda.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Uganda_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Post%20Office%20Building%2C%20Kampala%20Road%2C%20Kampala%2C%20Uganda&amp;toplace=KATOSI%20TRADING%20CENTRE%2C%20Mukono%2C%20Uganda&amp;dt1=ChIJXyfX9IC8fRcRorrkbY-nufI&amp;dt2=ChIJeaxYDdHtfRcR97tzM9xewwA |title=Distance between Post Office Building, Kampala Road, Kampala, Uganda and Katosi Trading Centre, Mukono District, Uganda |access-date=26 April 2018 | date=26 April 2018 |publisher=Globefeed.com | author=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As far back as 2011, the [[Government of Uganda|Uganda government]], through the [[National Water and Sewerage Corporation]] (NWSC), began to make plans to construct a new water treatment facility at Katosi, to augment the facilities at [[Ggaba]] (Ggaba I, II &amp; III), to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding population of Kampala and surrounding [[Districts of Uganda|districts]].&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite web|date=17 April 2011 |url=https://www.water-technology.net/uncategorised/news116532-html/ |title=Uganda to Build $306m Water Treatment Plant in Katosi |access-date=26 April 2018 |publisher=Water-Technology.net | author=Water Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''GKW Consult GmbH'', in association with ''Alliance Consultants Limited'', were contracted by the NWSC to provide consulting services for the preparation of designs for the new Drinking Water Treatment Plant near Katosi. Tendering and supervision of the construction works, are part of this consulting contract.&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gkw-consult.com/en/news/news-message/article/new-major-water-supply-project-in-uganda/ |title=New Major Water Supply Project in Uganda |access-date=26 April 2018 |date=23 June 2016 | 
publisher=GKWConsult.com |location=[[Mannheim]], Germany | author=GKW Consult}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design also includes the evacuation pipeline to a storage reservoir on Nsumba Hill, about {{convert|12|km|0}}, to the north-west.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web 
||url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Uganda_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=KATOSI%20TRADING%20CENTRE%2C%20Mukono%2C%20Uganda&amp;toplace=Bugigi%2C%20Uganda&amp;dt1=ChIJeaxYDdHtfRcR97tzM9xewwA&amp;dt2=ChIJkbiVfeXqfRcR9Kgq4eRno3Y |title=Distance between Katosi Trading Centre, Mukono District, Uganda and Bugigi, Mukono District, Uganda |date=26 April 2018 |publisher=Globefeed.com | author=Globefeed.com |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When completed, the plant is expected to have capacity of {{convert|120000|m3|liters}} of water daily.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; The target population is the estimated 4.5 million people by the year 2025 and 7 million by the year 2040, expected to inhabit the city of Kampala, and its surrounding metropolis.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt;

==Ownership==
The water treatment facility is wholly owned by the [[National Water and Sewerage Corporation]], a government [[parastatal]] company, responsible for provision of [[potable water]] and sewerage services nationwide.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Construction==
The construction of the Katosi Water Treatment Plant is part of a master plan called ''Kampala Water Lake Victoria Water and  Sanitation Project'', which was developed in 2011. The project involves improving water supply and improve sanitation services to all of the 2 million inhabitants of the city of Kampala at that time.&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite web | access-date=26 April 2018 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/blending/kampala-water-lake-victoria-water-and-sanitation-sector-watsan_en | last=European Commission | publisher=[[European Commission]] | date=21 July 2015 | title=Kampala Water - Lake Victoria Water And Sanitation Sector (WATSAN)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of that program, which also involved the improvement of the NWSC Ggaba Water Treatment Plant, called for the construction of a new {{convert|120000|m3|liter}} per day water treatment plant in Katosi, Mukono District, east of Kampala.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;

The feasibility study was conducted by ''BRL Ingenierie SA'', [http://www.igip.org/ IGIP] and [http://www.we-consult.info/ WE Consult]. In June 2016, ''GKW Consult GmbH'' and ''Alliance Consultants Limited'' were selected as consulting engineers. Tenders for the construction contract were advertised in the first quarter of 2017, with bid evaluation expected in May 2017. Work on this project is expectd to conclue in 2020.&lt;ref name="Eight"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=26 April 2018 | url=http://www.jsbmarketresearch.com/construction/nwsc-katosi-water-treatment-plant-uganda-project-profile |title=NWSC Katosi Water Treatment Plant, Uganda: Project Profile |date=31 August 2017 |publisher=JSBMmarketresearch.com |author=JSB Market Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''League of Corinth''', also referred to as the '''Hellenic League''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] Ἑλληνικός  ''Hellenikos'', "pertaining to Greece and Greeks"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%28ellhniko%2Fs Ἑλληνικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Book 16, 64.[3]: «Φίλιππος ἀπὸ τούτων τῶν χρόνων ἀεὶ μᾶλλον αὐξόμενος τὸ τελευταῖον διὰ τὴν εἰς τὸ θεῖον εὐσέβειαν ἡγεμὼν ἀπεδείχθη τῆς '''Ἑλλάδος''' πάσης καὶ μεγίστην βασιλείαν τῶν κατὰ τὴν Εὐρώπην περιεποιήσατο»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The reason Arrian wrote about Alexander: «ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅστις ἄλλος εἷς ἀνὴρ τοσαῦτα ἢ τηλικαῦτα ἔργα κατὰ πλῆθος ἢ μέγεθος '''ἐν Ἕλλησιν''' ἢ βαρβάροις ἀπεδείξατο» Arrian, ''Alexander Anabasis'' [1.12.4.]&lt;/ref&gt;), was a [[federation]] of Greek states created by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Book 16, 89.[3] «διόπερ '''ἐν Κορίνθῳ τοῦ κοινοῦ συνεδρίου''' συναχθέντος διαλεχθεὶς περὶ τοῦ πρὸς Πέρσας πολέμου καὶ μεγάλας ἐλπίδας ὑποθεὶς '''προετρέψατο τοὺς συνέδρους εἰς πόλεμον'''. τέλος δὲ '''τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἑλομένων αὐτὸν στρατηγὸν αὐτοκράτορα τῆς Ἑλλάδος μεγάλας παρασκευὰς ἐποιεῖτο πρὸς τὴν ἐπὶ τοὺς Πέρσας στρατείαν'''...καὶ τὰ μὲν '''περὶ Φίλιππον ἐν τούτοις ἦν'''»&lt;/ref&gt; during the winter of 338 BC/337 BC after the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] and succeeded by [[Alexander the Great]] at 336 BC, to facilitate the use of military forces in the war of Greece against Persia&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Alexander Anabasis'', [4.11.7.] «καὶ ἐγὼ '''τῆς Ἑλλάδος μεμνῆσθαί σε ἀξιῶ, ὦ Ἀλέξανδρε''', ἧς ἕνεκα ὁ πᾶς στόλος σοι ἐγένετο, '''προσθεῖναι τὴν Ἀσίαν τῇ Ἑλλάδι'''»&lt;/ref&gt;. The name 'League of Corinth' was invented by modern historians due to the first council of the League being in Corinth. It was the first time in history that most of the Greek states (with the notable exception of [[Sparta]], which would only later join under Alexander's terms) managed to become part of a single political entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pohlenz|first=Max|title=Freedom in Greek Life and Thought: The History of an Ideal|year=1966|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-0009-4|pages=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUY71_oc4b0C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22league+of+corinth%22+%22hellas%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22league%20of%20corinth%22%20%22hellas%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 346 BC, [[Isocrates]] urged [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] (''Philppus'' oration) to unify [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] against the Persians&lt;ref&gt;Philip [16]: «μέλλω γάρ '''σοι συμβουλεύειν''' προστῆναι τῆς τε τῶν '''Ἑλλήνων''' ὁμονοίας καὶ τῆς '''ἐπὶ τοὺς βαρβάρους στρατείας''': ἔστι δὲ τὸ μὲν πείθειν πρὸς τοὺς '''Ἕλληνας''' συμφέρον, τὸ δὲ βιάζεσθαι πρὸς τοὺς βαρβάρους χρήσιμον. ἡ μὲν οὖν περιβολὴ παντὸς τοῦ λόγου τοιαύτη τίς ἐστιν» [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0144%3Aspeech%3D5%3Asection%3D16]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The League was governed by the [[Hegemon]]&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Book 16, 91.[2]: «ἐπὶ δὲ τούτων '''Φίλιππος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἡγεμὼν ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων καθεσταμένος καὶ τὸν πρὸς Πέρσας πόλεμον''' ἐνστησάμενος Ἄτταλον μὲν καὶ Παρμενίωνα προαπέστειλεν εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν, μέρος τῆς δυνάμεως δοὺς καὶ '''προστάξας ἐλευθεροῦν τὰς Ἑλληνίδας πόλεις'''»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Alexander'' [14.1] «Εἰς δὲ τὸν Ἰσθμὸν '''τῶν Ἑλλήνων συλλεγέντων καὶ ψηφισαμένων''' ἐπὶ Πέρσας '''μετ᾽ Ἀλεξάνδρου στρατεύειν, ἡγεμὼν ἀνηγορεύθη'''»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander’s letter to Darius after the battle of Issus'': «Οι υμέτεροι πρόγονοι ελθόντες '''εις Μακεδονίαν και εις την άλλην Ελλάδα''' κακώς εποίησαν ημάς.

==The League during the Alexandrian campaigns==
The decision for the [[Siege of Thebes|Destruction of Thebes]] as transgressor of the above oath was taken by the council of the League of Corinth by a large majority&lt;ref&gt;Arrian 1.9.9-10, Diodorus Siculus 17.14.1, Justin 11.3.6&lt;/ref&gt;. Beyond the violation of the oath, the council judged that with this way, Thebeans were finally punished after a long time because they betrayed the Greeks during the Persian Wars&lt;ref&gt;Arrian [1.9.7] «ὡς τῆς τε '''ἐν τῷ Μηδικῷ πολέμῳ προδοσίας τῶν Ἑλλήνων''' διὰ μακροῦ ταύτην δίκην ἐκτίσαντας Θηβαίους»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Book 17, 14.[2][3][4]: «τοὺς δὲ '''συνέδρους τῶν Ἑλλήνων''' συναγαγὼν ἐπέτρεψε τῷ '''κοινῷ συνεδρίῳ πῶς χρηστέον τῇ πόλει τῶν Θηβαίων'''. [2] προτεθείσης οὖν βουλῆς τῶν ἀλλοτρίως διακειμένων τοῖς Θηβαίοις τινὲς ἐπεχείρουν συμβουλεύειν ἀπαραιτήτοις τιμωρίαις δεῖν περιβαλεῖν αὐτούς, '''ἀπεδείκνυον δ᾽ αὐτοὺς τὰ τῶν βαρβάρων πεφρονηκότας κατὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων: καὶ γὰρ ἐπὶ Ξέρξου συμμαχοῦντας τοῖς Πέρσαις ἐστρατευκέναι κατὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος''' καὶ μόνους τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὡς εὐεργέτας τιμᾶσθαι παρὰ τοῖς βασιλεῦσι τῶν Περσῶν καὶ πρὸ τῶν βασιλέων τοῖς πρεσβεύουσι τῶν Θηβαίων τίθεσθαι θρόνους. [3] '''πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα τοιαῦτα διελθόντες παρώξυναν τὰς τῶν συνέδρων ψυχὰς κατὰ τῶν Θηβαίων καὶ πέρας ἐψηφίσαντο τὴν μὲν πόλιν κατασκάψαι''', τοὺς δ᾽ αἰχμαλώτους ἀποδόσθαι, τοὺς δὲ φυγάδας τῶν Θηβαίων ἀγωγίμους ὑπάρχειν ἐξ ἁπάσης τῆς Ἑλλάδος καὶ μηδένα τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὑποδέχεσθαι Θηβαῖον. [4] '''ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἀκολούθως τῇ τοῦ συνεδρίου γνώμῃ τὴν μὲν πόλιν κατασκάψας'''»&lt;/ref&gt;. The League is mentioned by [[Arrian]] (I, 16, 7), after the [[Battle of Granicus]] (334 BC). Alexander sent 300 [[panoplies]] to the temple of [[Pallas Athena]] in Athens, with the following inscription. {{cquote|Alexander, son of Philip, and the Hellenes, except the [[Lacedaemonians]], from the barbarians inhabiting Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D7|Anabasis I.16.7]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also, Diodorus Siculus (Βίβλος ΙΖ’ 48.[6]) mentions the Council’s decision in 333 BC, after the [[Battle of Issus]], to send ambassadors to Alexander that will bring the ''Excellence of Greece'' (Golden Wreath)&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Book ΙΖ' 48.[6] «οἱ δὲ σύνεδροι τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐψηφίσαντο πέμψαι πρέσβεις πεντεκαίδεκα '''στέφανον φέροντας χρυσοῦν παρὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἀριστεῖον Ἀλεξάνδρῳ''' καὶ συνησθησομένους τῇ κατὰ Κιλικίαν νίκῃ»&lt;/ref&gt;. During 331 BC after the [[Battle of Megalopolis]], Sparta appealed to Alexander for terms, to which he agreed on condition that the Lacedaemonians now joined the League of Corinth&lt;ref&gt;Savill, Agnes. ''Alexander the Great and his Time'', p. 44 {{ISBN|0-88029-591-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the Asiatic campaign, [[Antipater]] was appointed deputy hegemon of the League&lt;ref&gt;Alexander the Great: a reader By Ian Worthington Page 305  {{ISBN|0-415-29187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;while Alexander personally recommended Athenians to turn their attention to things, in case something happens to him, Athens would take over the power in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Alexander'' [13.1] &amp; [13.2]: «'''Ἀθηναίοις''' δὲ διηλλάγη...ἀλλὰ καὶ προσέχειν ἐκέλευσε τοῖς πράγμασι τὸν νοῦν τὴν πόλιν, ὡς εἴ τι συμβαίη περὶ αὐτὸν, ἄρξουσαν τῆς '''Ἑλλάδος'''»&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The League was dissolved after the [[Lamian War]] (322 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah B. ''Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History'', p. 467 {{ISBN|0-19-509742-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 302 BC [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] and his son [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]] tried to revive the federation against [[Cassander]]. [[Antigonus III Doson]] (king of Macedon from 229 BC to 221 BC) also revived the League against [[Sparta]] during 224 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Trever, Albert Augustus.

The '''March of Peace''' ({{lang-bs|Marš mira}}) is an annual [[peace walk]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]  organized in memory of the victims of the 1995 [[Srebrenica genocide]]. The march gathers thousands of Bosnians and foreigners each year.  The first march was held in 2005, to mark the tenth anniversary of the genocide. The campaign lasts three days, culminating in the participants' arrival to the village [[Donji Potočari|Potočari]], where the [[Srebrenica Genocide Memorial|Srebrenica Genocide Memorial-Cemetery]] is located. The participants arrive a day prior for the mass funeral that occurs for those victims who have been found from the previous year. The search for bodies of the victims is ongoing every year.

==Background==
{{main|Srebrenica genocide}}
The event, which has been organized since 2005, marks the killing of [[Bosniaks]] who survived after the fall of Srebrenica in July 1995 and tried to reach territory controlled by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The ''Peace March'' became an international event, and a large number of people from around the world joined the March. In 2012, there were nearly 8,000 participants.

==Event==
The march usually begins in the village Nezuk by [[Sapna]] on or around 8 July.

In addition to the pedestrian campaigns, support also comes from participants who engaged in [[bicycling|Cycling]] Marathons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_category=167&amp;nav_id=873930|title=Marš mira predvodi Naser Orić|publisher=b92|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis''' was a confrontation between [[Winston Churchill]], newly appointed as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Edward Wood, the Viscount Halifax]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], which took place between 25 and 28 May. Halifax believed that in view of the imminent [[Fall of France]] and the encirclement of British forces at [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]], the U.K. should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement with [[Adolf Hitler]], with the still-neutral Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] brokering the agreement. After apparently considering ending the war on 26 May, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax by calling a meeting of his 25-member Outer [[Churchill war ministry|Cabinet]] two days later, to whom he delivered a passionate speech, saying "If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/churchill_decides_to_fight_on | title=Churchill decides to fight on | work=[[BBC History]] | publisher=BBC | accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing all present that Britain must fight on against Hitler whatever the cost.

==Background==
===Chamberlain falls===

On 8 May, in a vote following the [[Norway Debate]] on the deteriorating UK military situation, [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government survived what amounted to a [[motion of no confidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Eccleshall |editor1-first=Robert |editor2-last=Walker |editor2-first=Graham |title=Biographical dictionary of British prime ministers |date=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415108300 |page=294 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government, with a majority in the House of 213,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mosley |first1=Leonard |title=Backs to the wall; the heroic story of the people of London during World War II. |date=1971 |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780394460802 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; won the vote with a majority of only 81: 33 Conservatives and 5 of their governing allies voted with the opposition, and many other Conservatives abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Self |first1=Robert C. |title=Neville Chamberlain : a biography |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780754656159 |page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill, who had been appointed [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in September 1939, mounted a strong defence of Chamberlain and his Government in the debate, ending his closing speech with these words:

{{quote|At no time in the last war were we in greater peril than we are now, and I urge the House strongly to deal with these matters not in a precipitate vote, ill debated and on a widely discursive field, but in grave time and due time in accordance with the dignity of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hansard | house=House of Commons | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1940/may/08/conduct-of-the-war | title=Conduct of the War | date=8 May 1940 | volume=360 | column_start=1251 | column_end=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the Prime Minister being strongly criticised on both sides of the House and there being a strong desire for national unity, the vote was catastrophic.{{sfn|Jenkins|2002|p=582}}

===Churchill becomes Prime Minister===

At a meeting the next day, also attended by Halifax and Churchill, Chamberlain asked the leader and the deputy leader of the Opposition Labour Party, [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Arthur Greenwood]], if they would serve in a coalition. They replied that it might be possible but only with a different Prime Minister and that before they could give an official answer, they would need the approval of Labour's [[National Executive Committee]], then in [[Bournemouth]] preparing for the annual conference which was to start on the Monday. They were asked to telephone with the result of the consultation by the following afternoon.{{sfn|Jenkins|2002|p=586}}

Churchill's own account of these events, written six years later, is misleading. It describes the events of 9 May as taking place the following day, and the description of Chamberlain attempting to persuade him to agree tacitly to Halifax's appointment as Prime Minister does not quite tally with Halifax's having expressed his reluctance to do so to Chamberlain at a meeting between the two men on the morning of 9 May.{{sfn|Jenkins|2002|p=583}}

The Labour leaders telephoned at 5 pm on 10 May to report that the party would take part in a coalition government but not under Chamberlain's leadership. Accordingly, Chamberlain went to [[Buckingham Palace]] to tender his resignation, recommending [[King George VI]] to ask Churchill to form a government.{{sfn|Jenkins|2002|p=586}}

==Halifax's talks with the Italians==
Churchill was polite about Italy, then still neutral, on 16 May by saying that Britain was "not an enemy of Italy or of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|pp=212–3}}

An intelligence memo, undated but probably 25 May, warned the War Cabinet about the danger of submarine and air attack.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|pp=212–3}} Halifax formulated an appeal to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which stated that Britain "could not accept" terms that jeopardised the independence of the United Kingdom. He hoped that the United States would enter the war to prevent the conquest of Britain or France.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|pp=212–3}}

Halifax met Bastianini later that afternoon. He tried to persuade Italy to stay out of the war although the discussion soon moved from the question of Italian neutrality to that of Italian mediation between the Allies and Germany. He stated that "matters which cause anxiety to Italy must certainly be discussed as part of a general European settlement". That would have included Suez, Gibraltar, Malta, Tunis, Dijbouti, Somaliland, Corfu or perhaps even Kenya or Uganda. Halifax sent an account of this to the British Ambassador in Rome, [[Percy Loraine]].{{sfn|Roberts|1991|pp=212–3}}

Bastianini said that Mussolini's goal was to negotiate a settlement "that would not merely be an armistice, but would protect European peace for the century". Halifax made his willingness clear, but did not commit himself to any course of action: "The purpose of His Majesty's government was the same, and they would never be unwilling to consider any proposal made with authority that gave promise of establishment of a secure and peaceful Europe". [[Gladwyn Jebb]], Private Secretary to [[Alexander Cadogan]], [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], later learned that the interview had gone wrong, as Halifax had made no specific promises.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=216}}

==War Cabinet meetings, 26 May==

The following morning (Sunday 26 May), Halifax gave his report of this conversation to the War Cabinet, first telling the War Cabinet that in his opinion they "had to face the fact that it was not so much now a question of imposing a complete defeat upon Germany but of safeguarding the independence of our own Empire and if possible that of France".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=216}}

The War Cabinet resumed its deliberations later that day at 2&amp;nbsp;pm. Churchill began by describing his meeting with Reynaud, who had stated that the French military situation was hopeless but that he had no intentions of signing a separate peace treaty with Germany; he, however, might be forced to resign and believed that there were others in the French government who would sign such a treaty. Churchill claimed to have told Reynaud that Britain was not prepared "to give in on any account. We would rather go down fighting than be enslaved to Germany". However, Churchill told Reynaud that "we {{em|would}} (emphasis added) try to find some formula on which Mussolini would be approached".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=217}}

Churchill replied, "I would be grateful to get out of our present difficulties on such terms, provided we retained the essentials and the elements of our vital strength, even at the cost of some territory". He said that "if we could get out of this jam by giving up Malta and Gibraltar and some African colonies he would jump at it. But the only safe way was to convince Hitler that he couldn't beat us".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=217}}

Halifax said that such terms "would be refused" but added that he did not think such terms would be likely. Churchill's response was that "Herr Hitler thought that he had the whip hand. The only thing to do was to show him that he could not conquer this country. If, on M. Reynaud's showing, France could not continue, we must part company". At the behest of the War Cabinet, Halifax drew up a memorandum on "Suggested Approaches to Italy".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=218}}

==War Cabinet meetings, 27 May==

The plan to seek a compromise peace was euphemistically referred to as the "Reynaud Plan".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=220}} 
Chamberlain now spoke out in defence of Halifax's peace proposal: "While [it is] agreed that the proposed approach would not serve any useful purpose, [I think] that we ought to go a little further with it, in order to keep the French in a good temper ... our reply should not be a complete refusal." He was against it "at the present time" but thought the situation might change "even in a week".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=220}}

Sinclair, Attlee and Greenwood were against the plan.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=220}}

Halifax now was incensed, going on the offensive and saying to the War Cabinet that he saw:
{{quote|No particular difficulty in taking the line suggested by the Lord President [Chamberlain]. Nevertheless [I am] conscious of certain rather profound differences of points of view which [I] would like to make clear.... [I] could not recognize any resemblance between the action which [I] proposed, and the suggestion that we were suing for terms and following a line which would lead us to disaster. In the discussion the previous day [I] had asked the Prime Minister whether, if he was satisfied that matters vital to the independence of this country were unaffected, he would be prepared to discuss terms. The Prime Minister had said that he would be thankful to get out of our present difficulties on such terms, provided we retain the essentials and the elements of our vital strength, even at the cost of some cession of territory. On the present occasion, however, the Prime Minister seemed to suggest that under no conditions would we contemplate any course except fighting to the finish. The issue was probably academic, since we were unlikely to receive any offer which would not come up against the fundamental conditions which were essential to us. If, however, it was possible to obtain a settlement which did not impair those conditions, [I doubt I] would be able to accept the view now put forward by the Prime Minister.{{fact|date=August 2018}}}}

At Cabinet on 27 May, Churchill was furious at US hints, delivered via the [[List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador]] [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian|Philip Kerr]], that Britain should hand over bases in return for US support (although later in the year, Churchill would [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement|do precisely that]]).{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=219}} Churchill's telegram to the Dominions on 27 May left open the possibility of peace talks later in the year.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=227}}

==Outer Cabinet, 28 May==
Churchill then adjourned the War Cabinet until 7&amp;nbsp;pm so he could attend a previously scheduled meeting with his 25-member Outer Cabinet. "I had not seen many of my colleagues outside the War Cabinet, except individually, since the formation of the Government", said Churchill in his memoirs. The only account of what Churchill said at this critical meeting comes from [[Hugh Dalton]], a member of the Labour Party and the newly appointed Minister of Economic Warfare.
      
Churchill began his remarks by emphasising the seriousness of the military situation, and went on to say:
{{quote|I have thought carefully in these last days whether it was part of my duty to consider entering into negotiations with That Man [Hitler]. But it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out. The Germans would demand our – that would be called disarmament – our naval bases, and much else. We should become a slave state, though a British Government which would be Hitler's puppet would be set up – under [[Oswald Mosley|Mosley]] or some such person. And where should we be at the end of all that? On the other side we have immense reserves and advantages. And I am convinced that every one of you would rise up and tear me down from my place if I were for one moment to contemplate parley or surrender. If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.}}
  
Churchill would later write of the response he received at the conclusion of his remarks:

{{quote|There occurred a demonstration which considered the character of the gathering – twenty-five experienced politicians and Parliament men, who represented all the different points of view, whether right or wrong, before the war – surprised me. Quite a number seemed to jump up from the table and come running to my chair, shouting and patting me on the back. There is no doubt that had I at this juncture faltered at all in the leading of the nation I should have been hurled out of office. I was sure that every Minister was ready to be killed quite soon, and have all his family and possessions destroyed, rather than give in. In this they represented the House of Commons and almost all the people. It fell to me in these coming days and months to express their sentiments on suitable occasions. This I was able to do because they were mine also. There was a white glow, overpowering, sublime, which ran through our Island from end to end.}}
   
Churchill received a standing applause from the Outer Cabinet and thus ensured that the United Kingdom would fight on. When the War Cabinet reconvened at 7&amp;nbsp;pm, Churchill's position was secure. He told the War Cabinet of his earlier meeting, telling them that the Outer Cabinet "had expressed the greatest satisfaction when [I] had told them that there was no chance of our giving up the struggle. [I] did not remember having ever before heard a gathering of persons occupying high places in political life express themselves so emphatically".

Churchill sent a telegram to Reynaud stating that there would be no approach to Mussolini ''at that time'' but still leaving the possibility open.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=225}}

Mussolini had rejected an approach by Roosevelt along the lines suggested by Britain and France.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=223}} On 28 May, it was learned that Italy planned to enter the war on Germany's side, which  happened on 10 June.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=227}}

Halifax later helped to persuade Churchill not to send any more aircraft to France.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=230}} Halifax poured cold water on the Dominions' desire to be receptive to German peace feelers.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=231}} On 19 July 1940 Hitler in a speech put out peace feelers to Britain. However, on 22 July Halifax delivered a speech rejecting the offer. Halifax had little further interest in tentative German peace feelers throughout the year. In 1942 Hitler told Bormann of how Halifax had "declined the hand of peace".{{sfn|Roberts|1991|pp=248–50}}

However, Halifax later damaged his own reputation by lying to the official historian, claiming the talks had just been intended to keep Italy out of the war.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=227}}

The '''Minimum Wage Fairness Act''' ({{USBill|113|s|1737}}) is a bill that would amend the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period.&lt;ref name="1737sum"/&gt; The bill was strongly supported by President [[Barack Obama]] and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.&lt;ref name="ObamaClearChoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CentristRepubs"/&gt;

The bill was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

In the United States workers generally must be paid no less than the statutory [[minimum wage]].  As of July 2009, the federal government mandates a nationwide minimum wage level of $7.25 per hour, while some states and municipalities have set minimum wage levels higher than the federal level, with the highest state minimum wage being $9.47 per hour in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as of January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Washington State Department of Labor and Industries - Minimum Wage |url=http://www.lni.wa.gov/workplacerights/wages/minimum/ |work=lni.wa.gov |accessdate=January 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. About 1.8 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum. Together, these 3.3 million workers with wages at or below the minimum represent, respectively: 1.0% of the population, 1.6% of the labor force, 2.5% of all workers, and 4.3% of hourly workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2013.pdf | work=U.S. Department of Labor | title=Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers: 2013 | accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states already have a state minimum wage higher than the existing federal minimum wage.

The major economic schools of thought - [[Classical economics]], [[Keynesian economics]], and the [[Austrian School]] - disagree about the importance and the effects of the minimum wage. According to a paper written in 2000 by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists agreed that a minimum wage increases [[unemployment]] among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with this statement.&lt;ref name="Fuller and Geide-Stevenson 2003"&gt;Fuller, Dan and Doris Geide-Stevenson (2003): ''Consensus Among Economists: Revisited'', in: Journal of Economic Review, Vol. 34, No. 4, Seite 369-387 [http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/pdffiles/fall03/fuller.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some economic research has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2004/wp2004_21.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Minimum Wage, Restaurant Prices, and Labor Market Structure'', August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, there is no consensus between economists about the effects of minimum wages on youth employment, although empirical evidence suggests that this group is most vulnerable to high minimum wages.&lt;ref name="Ghellab 1998"&gt;Ghellab, Youcef (1998): ''Minimum Wages and Youth Unemployment'', [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] Employment and Training Papers 26 [http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/strat/download/etp26.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, new evidence for workers that were bound by the minimum wage suggests a distinct negative impact on employment and income growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clemens |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Wither |first2=Michael |title=The Minimum Wage and the Great Recession: Evidence of Effects on the Employment and Income Trajectories of Low-Skilled Workers |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 20724 |date=December 2014 |url=https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/clemens2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jardim |first1=Ekaterina |last2=Long |first2=Mark |last3=Plotnick |first3=Robert |last4=Vigdor |first4=Jacob |last5=Wething |first5=Hilary |title=Minimum Wage Increases, Wages, and Low-Wage Employment: Evidence from Seattle |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23532 |date=June 2017 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/11a0/01299c3d88663823611ce30a881fb6e8a7d4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=1737sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 1737 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1737|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minimum Wage Fairness Act would amend the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to: (1) $8.20 an hour beginning on the first day of the sixth month after the enactment of this Act, (2) $9.15 an hour beginning one year after the date of such initial increase, (3) $10.10 an hour beginning two years after such date, and (4) the amount determined by the [[United States Secretary of Labor]] (based on increases in the [[Consumer Price Index]]) beginning three years after such date and annually thereafter.&lt;ref name="1737sum"/&gt;

The bill would increase the [[Minimum wage in the United States|federal minimum wage]] for tipped employees to $3.00 an hour for one year beginning on the first day of the sixth month after the enactment of this Act. The bill would provide a formula for subsequent annual adjustments of the minimum wage for tipped employees until it equals 70% of the wage in effect under FLSA for other employees.&lt;ref name="1737sum"/&gt;

The bill would direct the Secretary of Labor, 60 days before any increase in the minimum wage, to publish it in the [[Federal Register]] and on the [[United States Department of Labor]]'s website.&lt;ref name="1737sum"/&gt;

The bill would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to extend through taxable years beginning before 2017: (1) the increase to $500,000 of the expensing allowance for business assets, including computer software; and (2) the treatment of qualified real property (i.e., leasehold improvement property, restaurant property, and retail improvement property) as depreciable business property.&lt;ref name="1737sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as introduced in the Senate on November 19, 2013. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo1737&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 1737 - CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45210|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 1737 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour, and to adjust the wage annually thereafter to account for [[inflation]]. In addition, the bill would increase the federal minimum cash wage for workers who receive tips by gradually raising that wage until it equals 70 percent of the federal minimum wage for other workers. Finally, S. 1737 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend through 2016 an increased limitation on the amount of investment that firms can immediately deduct from their taxable income—a limitation that mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses.&lt;ref name="cbo1737"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Minimum Wage Fairness Act was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] on November 19, 2013 by [[Tom Harkin|Sen. Tom Harkin (D, IA)]].&lt;ref name=1737allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 1737 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1737/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 2014, Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] announced that the Senate would not vote on the bill until three weeks later after a two-week April recess.&lt;ref name=Reidpunts&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Reid punts on minimum-wage hike|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/202964-reid-punts-on-minimum-wage-hike|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
The delay of the Senate vote on the bill was attributed to Reid's inability to get all members of the Democratic party in the Senate to agree to vote in favor of the bill.&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"/&gt; Senator [[Mark Pryor]] (D-AR) opposed the bill.&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"/&gt; Pryor is up for election in 2014 and is considered "the Senate's most vulnerable incumbent."&lt;ref name=ReidSlip1&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Reid: Minimum wage vote may slip|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/202331-reid-minimum-wage-vote-may-slip|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Tom Carper]] (D-DE) preferred legislation that would have a greater chance of becoming law, such as an increase to only $9 an hour.&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"/&gt; Senator [[Mark Warner]] (D-VA) expressed a willingness to negotiate with Republicans about some of the provisions of the bill, such as the timeline for the phase-in.&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"/&gt; Warner said that any increase needs to be done "in a responsible way."&lt;ref name="ReidSlip1"/&gt;

Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] (D-LA) wanted additional debate on the timeline and the raise for tipped workers.&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"/&gt; Landrieu said that "I do not believe that $10.10 an hour is too high to aspire to, but how quickly we get there and what increments, the tipped wage, how that should be handled, who should get paid the tipped wage, and who shouldn't. There are a lot of questions about that, and some of those discussions are going on."&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"/&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] strongly supported increasing the minimum wage, giving speeches about it urging Congress to take action.&lt;ref name=ObamaClearChoice&gt;{{cite news|last=Sink|first=Justin|title=Obama: Congress has 'clear choice' on minimum wage|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/202475-obama-congress-has-clear-choice-on-minimum-wage|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama argued that "if you pay people well, there's more money in everybody's pockets, and everybody does better."&lt;ref name="ObamaClearChoice"/&gt;

The nonpartisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] said in a report that an "estimate half a million jobs would be lost if lawmakers passed the president's proposal" to increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.&lt;ref name="ObamaClearChoice"/&gt; Spokesman [[Brendan Buck]] for Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]] said in reaction that "the president's plan would increase costs for consumers and eliminate jobs for those who need them the most" so the House would "continue focusing on our plan to protect workers' hours and create jobs, not the president's plan to destroy them."&lt;ref name="ObamaClearChoice"/&gt;

The [[National Retail Federation]] (NRF) opposed the bill, saying that "raising the standard of living for low-skill, low-wage workers is a valid goal," but that "there is clear evidence that mandate wage hikes undermine the job prospects for less skilled and part-time workers."&lt;ref name=TradeGroupsOppose&gt;{{cite news|last=Needham|first=Vicki|title=Trade groups opposing efforts to raise minimum wage|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/economy/202333-trade-groups-opposing-efforts-to-raise-minimum-wage|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade group also argued that this was the "least opportune moment" to increase the minimum wage because employers were still dealing the fallout of changes they needed to make because of the [[Affordable Care Act]] ("Obamacare").&lt;ref name="TradeGroupsOppose"/&gt;

Senate Republican [[Susan Collins]] (R-ME) tried to negotiate a compromise that centrist Republicans could agree to, but was unable to do so.&lt;ref name=CentristRepubs&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Centrist Republicans cool to minimum wage hike compromise|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/202641-centrist-republicans-cool-to-wage-compromise|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Republicans, such as Senators [[Dean Heller]] (R-NV) and [[Rob Portman]] (R-OH), noted that their states already have minimum wages higher than the federally-mandated level and thought that the minimum wage should be left up to the states. Heller said "I think there is a difference between North and South, East and West on what those minimum wages ought to be."&lt;ref name="CentristRepubs"/&gt; Senator [[Mark Kirk]] (R-IL) said he would not vote for the bill or a compromise.&lt;ref name="CentristRepubs"/&gt; Collins' tried to argue that the Congressional Budget Office report predicting 500,000 jobs lost if the minimum wage was increased to $10.10 also said that an increase to $9.00 would only lead to 100,000 jobs lost, but the argument did not seem to persuade her fellow centrists.&lt;ref name="CentristRepubs"/&gt; Collins said "I'm confident that the votes are not there to pass a minimum wage increase up to $10.10 therefore it seems to me to make sense for senators on both sides of the aisle to get together and see if we can come up with a package that would help low-income families with causing the kind of job loss that the Congressional Budget Office has warned against."&lt;ref name="CentristRepubs"/&gt;

The '''National Radical Camp''' ({{lang-pl|Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny, ONR}}) is a [[far-right]] movement in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Gera"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gera|first1=Vanessa|title=Polish far-right march goes global, drawing people from afar|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/poland-march-draws-emboldened-extremists-afar-51058493|website=ABC News|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=12 November 2017|date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been described as [[fascism|fascist]].&lt;ref name="ROP"&gt;{{cite web|title=ROP: in the Myślenice the ONR propagated fascism|url=https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/rpo-w-myslenicach-onr-propagowalo-faszyzm-6037416989926017a|website=Wirtualna Polska|publisher=Polish Press Agency|accessdate=12 November 2017|language=Polish|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dryjanska"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryjańska|first1=Anna|title=Between fascism and Nazism.

The ONR considers itself an ideological descendant of the 1930s-era '''National Radical Camp''', a [[Fascist|fascist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] political movement which existed in the pre-[[World War II]] [[Second Polish Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/11/poland-far-right-independence-centenary|title=Poland's president addresses far right at independence march|author=Christian Davies|date=November 11, 2018|work=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; an illegal Polish [[Third Position|Third Positionist]],&lt;ref&gt;The left and right wing spectrum does not apply to the idea of Fascism, therefore it's technically incorrect to call fascism Right Wing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Third Position]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} [[anti-communist]],&lt;ref name="WIEM"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://213.180.130.202/8927,,,,oboz_narodowo_radykalny,haslo.html?drukuj=1 Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny] [[WIEM Encyklopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nationalism|nationalist]] political party formed on 14 April 1934 mostly by the youth radicals who left the [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] of the [[National Democracy]] movement.&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt;

The '''Falanga National Radical Camp''' ({{lang-pl|Ruch Narodowo Radykalny-Falanga|links=Ruch_Narodowo-Radykalny}}), '''RNR-Falanga''' or '''ONR-Falanga''' colloquially, was a minor Polish [[third position]] political grouping of the 1930s, as was '''National Radical Camp ABC''' ({{lang-pl|Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny ABC}}) or '''ONR-ABC''' for short following the split of the original party in 1934. ''"Falanga"'' is [[Polish language|Polish]] for "[[phalanx]]", ''"ABC"'' refers to a newspaper printed by the organisation at the time.

==First incarnation (1934)==
The party was influenced by the ideas of [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marszał, Maciej: ''Włoski faszyzm w polskiej myśli politycznej i prawnej'', 1922-1939. Wrocław 2007, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It rejected [[parliamentary democracy]] and called for the construction of a "national state," based on the principles of hierarchy, one-person leadership, and elimination of national minorities from public life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945|last2=Wróbel|first2=Piotr|last3=Kozicki|first3=Richard J.|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=978-0-313-26007-0|location=Westport, Conn|pages=379|last1=Lerski|first1=Jerzy J.|authorlink = Jerzy Jan Lerski}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dominated by youth, National Radical Camp was a "more radical, [[Nazism|nazified]]" outgrowth of the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)National-Democratic Party]], an ultranationalist movement that had arose in the 1920.&lt;ref name="Blinkhorn"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fascism and the Right in Europe 1919-1945|name=Martin Blinkhorn|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|edition=2013|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the National Radical Camp was part of broader movement of the Polish right toward radicalization and fascism in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Kallis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genocide and Fascism: The Eliminationist Drive in Fascist Europe|author=Aristotle Kallis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4rJ3ZiC8x4C&amp;pg=PA125|page=125|publisher=Routledge|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virulently [[antisemitic]] and [[eliminationist]], ONR's members were responsible for an increase in anti-semitic violence after 1935.&lt;ref name="Kallis"/&gt;

The party was created on the insistence of former members of the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (''Obóz Wielkiej Polski''),&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt; most notably [[Jan Mosdorf]], [[Tadeusz Gluziński]] and [[Henryk Rossman]].&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt; It supported "class solidarity," [[nationalization]] of foreign and Jewish-owned companies and introduction of [[anti-semitic laws]].&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt; 

The ONR was popular mostly among the students and other groups of urban youth. ONR openly encouraged [[pogrom|anti-Jewish pogroms]], and became the main force in the organization of attacks against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua A. Fishman]] (1974) '' Studies on Polish Jewry, 1919-193'' [[Yivo Institute for Jewish Research]]&lt;/ref&gt; It organized fighting squads, attacked Jews and leftist politicians, destroyed Jewish property, and provoked clashes with the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of its involvement in [[boycott]] of Jewish-owned stores,&lt;ref&gt;Wapiński 1980, 308.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous attacks on left-wing worker demonstrations,&lt;ref&gt;Ajnenkiel 1974, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; the ONR was outlawed after three months of existence, in July 1934.&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt; Several leaders were interned in the [[Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp]], where the organization split into two separate factions: the [[ONR-Falanga]] (''Ruch Narodowo-Radykalny'') led by [[Bolesław Piasecki]], and the [[National Radical Camp ABC|ONR-ABC]] (''Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny'') formed around the ''ABC'' journal and led by [[Henryk Rossman]].&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt; Both organizations were officially illegal.&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt;

===During World War II===
During [[World War II]], both organizations created underground resistance organizations: ONR-ABC was transformed into [[Grupa Szańca]] (''Rampart Group''), whose military arm became the [[Lizard Union (WWII)|Związek Jaszczurczy]] (''Lizard Union''),&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt; while the ONR-Falanga created the [[Konfederacja Narodu]] (''Confederation of the Nation''). They were not supportive of the mainstream [[Polish Underground State]] related to the [[Polish government in exile]].&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt; During the German [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]], many of the former ONR activists belonged to [[National Armed Forces]] resistance groups. After World War II, the forced exile of many ONR members was made permanent by the newly created [[Polish People's Republic]], which branded them [[enemies of the state]].

==Falanga==

===Formation and ideology===
The RNR-Falanga was formed in the spring of 1935 following a split by members of the National Radical Camp held in [[Detention Camp Bereza Kartuska]]. Adopting the name of ''Oboz Narodowo-Radykalny'' (National Radical Camp), it soon became known as ''Falanga'' after the title of its journal (the rival group would also soon be named after its own journal, thus becoming known as National Radical Camp-ABC).&lt;ref name="Blam"&gt;C.P. Blamires, ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-Clio, 2006, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falanga was led by [[Bolesław Piasecki]] and advocated a '[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[totalitarianism]]' inspired by Spanish [[Falangism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. However, although clearly derived from Falangism, it has been argued that their Catholicism was even more central than that of the Spanish group&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-1945'', London: Routledge, 2001, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed their pronouncement that 'God is the highest form of man' recalled the religious fanaticism of [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''A History of Fascism'', pp. 321-2&lt;/ref&gt;  The group is widely considered to have been a [[fascism|fascist]] movement.&lt;ref name="Blam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Davies &amp; D. Lynch, ''The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right'', London: Routledge, 2002. p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland Volume 2: 1795 to the Present'', Columbia University Press, 1982, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Harshly critical of [[capitalism]] and supportive of removing citizenship rights from Poland's [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]]&lt;ref name="Blam"/&gt; it presented itself as the vanguard of the opposition to [[Józef Piłsudski]].&lt;ref name="Blam"/&gt;

===Development===
Largely based in university campuses, the Falanga followed a policy of [[anti-Semitism]] and although it had few members,&lt;ref name="WIEM"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://213.180.130.202/8927,,,,oboz_narodowo_radykalny,haslo.html?drukuj=1 Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny] [[WIEM Encyklopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; from its power bases in schools it attempted to launch attacks on Jewish students and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Borejsza, "East European Perceptions of Italian Fascism", S. U. Larsen, B. Hagtvet &amp; J. P. Myklebust, ''Who Were the Fascists: Social Roots of European Fascism'', Scandinavian University Press, Oslo, 1980, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing activists were also as part of this violent activity.&lt;ref name="Blam"/&gt;

The group soon came under scrutiny from the Polish government. Indeed, unlike similar movements in other European countries who regularly held public rallies, the ONR-Falanga held only two such gatherings, in 1934 and 1937, both of which were quickly broken up by the police.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;

For a time the movement became associated with the [[Camp of National Unity]] ({{lang-pl|Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego}}, ''OZN'') as Colonel [[Adam Koc]], impressed by the organisation of the ONR-Falanga, placed Piasecki in charge of the OZN youth group. Koc called for the creation of a one-party state and hoped to use the youth movement to ensure this although his pronouncements upset many pro-government moderates. As such, Koc was removed from the leadership of the OZN in 1938 and replaced by General [[Stanisław Skwarczyński]] who quickly severed any ties to the RNR-Falanga.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''A History of Fascism'', p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
As a Polish nationalist movement the RNR-Falanga opposed the [[German occupation of Poland]] after the 1939 invasion, and thus was quickly subsumed by the [[Konfederacja Narodu]], a group within the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] that retained certain [[far right]] views.&lt;ref name="Blam"/&gt;

However, following the establishment of a [[Provisional Government of National Unity|communist puppet regime]] in 1945, Piasecki was allowed to lead the [[PAX Association]] ({{lang-pl|Stowarzyszenie PAX}}), a supposedly Catholic organisation that was in fact a front group of the [[NKVD]] which aimed to promote the new communist regime to Poland's Catholics whilst turning them away from the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''God's Playground'', p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABC==
The ''ONR-ABC'' was the second splinter group besides ''Falanga'' founded by [[Henryk Rossman]].

==Modern incarnation (1993)==

===Ideology===
The National Radical Camp has often been described as [[fascism|fascist]].&lt;ref name="ROP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dryjanska"/&gt;

The party flag of the organization was included in the police handbook as an explicitly racist symbol.&lt;ref name="DW1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/poland-racism-on-the-rise/a-36812032|title=Poland: Racism on the rise {{!}} Europe {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 17.12.2016|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Interior (Poland)|Interior Ministry]] subsequently pulled the book from circulation after a complaint from MP [[Adam Andruszkiewicz]].&lt;ref name="DW1" /&gt;

ONR members at a 2008 rally in Myślenice made a [[Roman salute]] before disbanding.

==== Independence Day marches ====
The association has also been known as initiators of marches during the [[National Independence Day]] of Poland. One of them (in Warsaw), as a co-initiative of several different nationalist movements in 2010, evolved in 2012 into one of the biggest events during the day, which now attracts a more diverse community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.radiomaryja.pl/multimedia/transmisja-marszu-niepodleglosci/|title = Transmisja Marszu Niepodległości (Video coverage of the event by a Catholic publisher)|date = 12 November 2014|accessdate = |website = Radiomaryja.pl|publisher = Radio Maryja|last = |first = |language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012 it has been organized by a registered association,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.krs-online.com.pl/stowarzyszenie-marsz-niepodleglosci-krs-720405.html|title = Stowarzyszenie Marsz Niepodległości (The Association [of] The Independence March)|date = |accessdate = November 14, 2014|website =National Court Register |publisher = |last = |first = |language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ONR is still part of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://marszniepodleglosci.pl/|title = Historia Marszu Niepodległości (The history of The Independence March)|date = |accessdate = November 14, 2014|website =Official site of the March of the Independence |publisher = |last = |first = |language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov''' (Никола́й Алекса́ндрович Моро́зов; 7 July 1854, [[Nekouzsky District|Borok]] &amp;ndash; 30 July 1946) was a [[Russia]]n [[revolutionary]] who spent  about 25 years in prison before turning his attention to various fields of [[science]].

== Revolutionary activities ==

The son of a landowner by a serf woman, Morozov was born in the village of [[Nekouzsky District|Borok]] in the [[Yaroslavl Oblast]] of [[Russia]]. He early became interested in politics and was expelled from secondary school when he was accused of subversive activity. (His distribution of a scientific magazine was considered subversive because Russian schools did not teach science.){{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He joined the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]] before departing for [[Geneva]] in 1874.

By 1878, Morozov was a member of ''[[Zemlya i volya]]'' or ''Land and Liberty'' where he co-edited their mouthpiece, ''Land and Liberty'', (with [[Sergei Kravchinsky]]). When the ''Land and Liberty'' group faced an internal crisis over tactics and thus split into two groups in August 1879, Morozov rejected the continued use of [[propaganda]] to bring about social change and, instead, joined the more adventurous of the two factions, and became a leader of this group, ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'', or People's Will.

In 1880 [[Olga Liubatovich]] and Morozov left ''Narodnaya Volya'' and went to live in Geneva and [[London]], where he was introduced to [[Karl Marx]]. While in exile Morozov wrote ''The Terrorist Struggle'', a pamphlet that explained his views how to achieve a democratic society in Russia. He advocated large numbers of small independent terrorist groups and argued that this approach would make it difficult for the police to apprehend the terrorists. It would also help to prevent a small group of leaders gaining power, forming dictatorships after the overthrow of the [[Tsar]].

Morozov returned to Russia in order to distribute ''The Terrorist Struggle''. This led to his arrest soon after arriving. He was then imprisoned in [[Suwałki]]. Liubatovich only just having gone through child birth decided to attempt to rescue Morozov, though her plan did not go well, ending in her arrest leading to Liubatovich being sent to [[Siberia]] in November, 1882.

== Later life and ideas ==
[[File:Шлиссельбуржская крепость.Камера Морозова.jpg|thumb|upright|Morozov's cell at [[Shlisselburg]]]]
Between 1882&amp;ndash;1905 Morozov was imprisoned in [[Peter and Paul fortress]] and in [[Shlisselburg]] for his political activities. At that period he wrote political verse and began intense studies in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[history]]. After being released in 1906, he started to teach chemistry and astronomy at the university of St. Petersburg. In 1907 he was elected into the [[Duma]], but as a former prisoner he was not allowed to take the office. He became a member of many associations for science, including the Russian Aero-club. For the publication of his book ''Songs of the Stars'' in 1910, he became imprisoned for another year.

Many of his ideas were unorthodox and daring. He conjectured that atoms have complicated level structure and may be transformed. In his treatise on the [[periodic table]], Morozov predicted the discovery of inert elements. 

In 1907 Morozow published [[Apocalypse_of_John_%E2%80%93_dated_astronomically|"The Revelation in Storm and Thunder"]] where he produced evidence for his hypotheses
* The Revelation to John  can be [[Apocalypse of John - dated astronomically|dated astronomically]] to 30 September 395.
* The author of the Revelation is identical with [[John Chrysostom]].

After the [[October Revolution]], Morozov took little interest in politics and continued to run the P. S. Lesgaft Institute of Natural Sciences in Petrograd (Leningrad) until his death at the age of 92. Based on the astronomical records (such as the ''[[Almagest]]'') he speculated that much of human history has been falsified. His theories about the chronology of the [[Middle East]] and [[Israel]] before the first century BC later attracted the attention of [[Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko|Anatoly Fomenko]], who based his own [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]] upon them. 

In his declining years, Morozov established a laboratory in his native [[Borok]], north of [[Uglich]], to monitor and study "inland waters". In 1932 he was named an Honorary Member of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ras.ru/win/db/show_per.asp?P=.id-51389.ln-en.dl-.pr-inf.uk-12 Morozov's Biography Page; Russian Academy of Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;  His memorial house in Borok is open to the public. Morozov's grave is close by. The [[asteroid]] [[1210 Morosovia]] is named in his honour.

'''Nir Oz''' ({{lang-he-n|נִיר עֹז, ניר עוז}}, ''lit.'' Meadow of Strength) is a [[kibbutz]] in southern [[Israel]]. It is located in the northwestern [[Negev]] desert between [[Magen, Israel|Magen]] and [[Nirim]],  and covers 20,000 [[dunam]]s. Nir Oz is under the jurisdiction of [[Eshkol Regional Council]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Nir Oz}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

==History==
Founded on 1 October 1955, as a [[Nahal settlement]], it was recognized as a kibbutz two months later.

Due to its proximity to [[Gaza City|Gaza]], Nir Oz farmers often come under Palestinian sniper fire. In 2008, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] asked the kibbutz to harvest its potatoes at night to lower the risk of attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/977240.html The moon works against Nir Oz farmers] Haaretz&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June 2008, a mortar bomb fired from the [[Gaza Strip]] hit the Nirlat paint factory on the kibbutz, killing an employee and wounding four others. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/IsraelUnderAttack/Nir+Oz/ Nir Oz under attack] Prime Minister's Office&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
In addition to agriculture, Nir Oz has a factory for silicon sealant products and an engineering firm. In recent years, Nir Oz has become a major grower of asparagus for export.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1088012.html Digging for white gold] [[Haaretz]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water conservation==
In 1960, Nir Oz introduced a long-term water saving gardening project on {{convert|27|acre|m2}} of kibbutz land. Some 750 drought-resistant plants have been tested. The garden, designed by landscape architect Hayyim Kahanovich, uses only 50% of the water used in the center and north of the country. The project is conducted in cooperation with [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]] and serves as a study and observation site for researchers, gardeners, teachers and students from all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sviva.gov.il/Enviroment/bin/en.jsp?enPage=e_BlankPage&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enDispWhat=Object&amp;enDispWho=Articals^l5322&amp;enZone=Water_Conservation Wise gardening in Kibbutz Nir Oz] Ministry of Environmental Protection&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, akin to [[attorney–client privilege]], offer [[Bank secrecy|banker–client privilege]].]]
A '''non-disclosure agreement''' ('''NDA'''), also known as a '''confidentiality agreement''' ('''CA'''), '''confidential disclosure agreement''' ('''CDA'''), '''proprietary information agreement''' ('''PIA''') or '''secrecy agreement''' ('''SA'''), is a [[law|legal]] [[contract]] between at least two [[party (law)|parties]] that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. The most common forms of these are in [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor–patient confidentiality]] (physician–patient privilege), [[attorney–client privilege]], [[priest–penitent privilege]], and [[Bank secrecy|bank–client confidentiality]] agreements.  

It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or [[trade secret]]s. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information. Like all contracts, they cannot be enforced if the [[Illegal agreement|contracted activities are felonies]]. NDAs are commonly signed when two companies, individuals, or other entities (such as partnerships, societies, etc.) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other's business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship. NDAs can be "mutual", meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided, or they can restrict the use of material by a single party. It is also possible for an employee to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer. In fact, some employment agreements will include a clause restricting employees' use and dissemination of company-owned confidential information. In legal disputes resolved by [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]], the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Clauses in Commercial Contracts – Is it worth the Effort? |date=March 17, 2016 |author=Henry Pharr III |publisher=Real Estate Drill Down |url=https://realestatedrilldown.com/2016/03/17/confidentiality-and-non-disclosure-clauses-in-commercial-contracts-is-it-worth-the-effort/ |quote=[M]ost landlords and tenants are united in interest in not wanting the terms of their settlement publicized in a public forum where they may be misunderstood or misinterpreted as being weak, scared or simply not feeling strongly about their business and their actions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Davies |year=2014 |title=Confidentiality Provisions in Settlement Agreements |publisher=Vann Attorneys |quote=If you've ever signed a settlement agreement resolving some dispute, chances are pretty good it contained a confidentiality provision.

== General types ==
A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may be classified as unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral:

=== Unilateral ===
A unilateral NDA (sometimes  referred to as a one-way NDA) involves two parties where only one party (i.e., the disclosing party) anticipates disclosing certain information to the other party (i.e., the receiving party) and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure for some reason (e.g., maintaining the secrecy necessary to satisfy patent laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
 |url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9405.html
 | title=Understanding Confidentiality Agreements
 | first=David V.
 | last=Radack
 | year=1994
 | work=JOM
 | publisher=[[The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society]]
 | quote=Second, the use of confidentiality agreements can prevent the forfeiture of valuable patent rights
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or legal protection for trade secrets, limiting disclosure of information prior to issuing a press release for a major announcement, or simply ensuring that a receiving party does not use or disclose information without compensating the disclosing party).

=== Bilateral ===
A bilateral NDA (sometimes referred to as a mutual NDA or a two-way NDA) involves two parties where both parties anticipate disclosing information to one another that each intends to protect from further disclosure. This type of NDA is common when businesses are considering some kind of joint venture or merger.

When presented with a unilateral NDA, some parties may insist upon a bilateral NDA, even though they anticipate that only one of the parties will disclose information under the NDA. This approach is intended to incentivize the drafter to make the provisions in the NDA more "fair and balanced" by introducing the possibility that a receiving party could later become a disclosing party or vice versa, which is not an entirely uncommon occurrence.

=== Multilateral ===
A multilateral NDA involves three or more parties where at least one of the parties anticipates disclosing information to the other parties and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure. This type of NDA eliminates the need for separate unilateral or bilateral NDAs between only two parties. E.g., a single multiparty NDA entered into by three parties who each intend to disclose information to the other two parties could be used in place of three separate bilateral NDAs between the first and second parties, second and third parties, and third and first parties.

A multilateral NDA can be advantageous because the parties involved review, execute, and implement just one agreement. However, this advantage can be offset by more complex negotiations that may be required for the parties involved to reach a unanimous consensus on a multilateral agreement.

== Content ==
A non-disclosure agreement can protect any type of information that is not generally known. However, nondisclosure agreements may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources they would not be obligated to keep the information secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-article-a-57763-m-4-sc-25-intellectual_property_using_confidentiality_agreements-i |title=Intellectual Property: Using Confidentiality Agreements |publisher=Yahoo! Small Business |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323220129/http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-article-a-57763-m-4-sc-25-intellectual_property_using_confidentiality_agreements-i |archivedate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the nondisclosure agreement typically only requires the receiving party to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the disclosing party. However, it is sometimes easier to get a receiving party to sign a simple agreement that is shorter, less complex and does not contain safety provisions protecting the receiver.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some common issues addressed in an NDA include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* outlining the parties to the agreement;
* the definition of what is confidential, i.e. the information to be held confidential. Modern NDAs will typically include a [[wikt:laundry list|laundry list]] of types of items which are covered, including unpublished [[patent application]]s, know-how, schema, [[finance|financial]] information, verbal representations, customer lists, vendor lists, business practices/strategies, etc.;
* the disclosure period – information not disclosed during the disclosure period (e.g., one year after the date of the NDA) is not deemed confidential;
* the exclusions from what must be kept confidential. Typically, the restrictions on the disclosure or use of the confidential data will be invalid if
** the recipient had prior knowledge of the materials;
** the recipient gained subsequent knowledge of the materials from another source;
** the materials are generally available to the public; or
** the materials are subject to a [[subpoena]] – although many practitioners regard that fact as a category of permissible disclosure, not as a categorical exclusion from confidentiality (because court-ordered secrecy provisions may apply even in case of a subpoena). In any case, a subpoena would more likely than not override a contract of any sort;
* provisions restricting the transfer of data in violation of laws governing export control and [[national security]];
* the term and conditions (in years) of the confidentiality, i.e. the time period of confidentiality;
* the term (in years) the agreement is binding;
* permission to obtain [[injunction|ex-parte injunctive relief]];
* description of the actions need to be done with the confidential materials upon agreement ending;
* the obligations of the recipient regarding the confidential information, typically including some version of obligations:
** to use the information only for enumerated purposes;
** to disclose it only to persons with a need to know the information for those purposes;
** to use appropriate efforts (not less than reasonable efforts) to keep the information secure. Reasonable efforts is often defined as a standard of care relating to confidential information that is no less rigorous than that which the recipient uses to keep its own similar information secure; and
** to ensure that anyone to whom the information is disclosed further abides by obligations restricting use, restricting disclosure, and ensuring security at least as protective as the agreement; and
* types of permissible disclosure – such as those required by [[law]] or [[court order]] (many NDAs require the receiving party to give the disclosing party prompt notice of any efforts to obtain such disclosure, and possibly to cooperate with any attempt by the disclosing party to seek judicial protection for the relevant confidential information).
* the law and [[jurisdiction]] governing the parties. The parties may choose exclusive jurisdiction of a court of a [[country]].

===Australia===
Deeds of confidentiality and fidelity (also referred to as deeds of confidentiality or confidentiality deeds) are commonly used in [[Australia]]. These documents generally serve the same purpose as and contain provisions similar to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) used elsewhere. However, these documents are legally treated as [[deed]]s and are thus binding, unlike [[contract]]s, without [[consideration]].

===California===
In [[California]], (and some other states), there are some special circumstances relating to non-disclosure agreements and [[non-compete clause]]s. California's courts and legislature have signaled that they generally value an employee's mobility and entrepreneurship more highly than they do protectionist doctrine.&lt;ref name="Hurd1"&gt;{{cite web

Non-disclosure agreements have become very important in light of India's burgeoning outsourcing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=7 June 2005 |last1=Zhang|first1=Jacqueline|title=When Small Companies Offshore (with non-disclosure form) |url=https://sourcingmag.com/when-small-companies-offshore-with-non-disclosure-form/ |publisher=Sourcingmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, an NDA must be stamped to be a valid enforceable document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aishwarya|first1=Srishti|title=What is Non-Disclosure Agreement?|url=https://blog.ipleaders.in/what-is-non-disclosure-agreement/ |publisher=iPleaders|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Non compete and non disclosure agreement- Although it is part of service agreement but if it is not part of service agreement a non compete agreement should be signed, so that the employee may not be able to disclose or compete your information to other people.
# Criminal breach of trust complaint-Under the Indian penal code a criminal breach of trust complaint can be lodged against an employee, i.e. under IPC 406, if he has stolen the information and disclosed it to your competitor.This is also the provisions which will help you to prevent your trade secrets.
# Protection under the copyright act-if the information stolen is protected under the copyright act, such as software and databases are covered under section 63 of the copyright act, and civil proceedings are also maintainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lexspeak.in/2016/06/what-to-do-when-employee-stole-your-clients/|title=WHAT TO DO WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS TRYING TO STEAL YOUR CLIENT? - Lexspeak|date=2016-06-28|work=Lexspeak|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31097">'''Non-human electoral candidates''' have been found in a number of countries. Often, the candidacies are a means of casting a [[protest vote]] or [[satire|satirizing]] the political system. Other times it is simply done for entertainment value.

Electoral regulations may explicitly require candidates to be human (or equivalent wording), or may require candidates to do things which animals cannot reasonably do (such as sign their name legibly on a legal form); most constituencies require candidates to be of the age of a legal adult, which eliminates many animals whose life expectancy is usually too short to ever qualify. On some occasions, however, animals have been accepted as candidates, and have even won office.

These revised maps made [[Whangamomona]], NZ part of the [[Manawatu-Wanganui]] Region.

At every Republic Day, they vote to either keep the seating President or to vote in a new one. Since 1999, they have had Billy Gumboot the Goat (1999–2001) and Tai the Poodle (2003–2004), the latest being Murt "Murtle the Turtle" Kennard (2005–2015).

Ewing said the candidacy "sought to draw more attention to the mayoral race, better educate voters about their choices and encourage residents to demand more of elected officials."  Giggles attracted many online fans, while the "other candidates for mayor were less amused."  The write-in campaign was cancelled after state officials fixed the mistake and allowed four candidates' names to appear on the ballot, and the race had become "No longer an even playing field" for Giggles.

==Folklore and pop culture==
The notion of animals being elected to office has often been the subject of parody and folklore.

In 1817 [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s novel ''[[Melincourt (novel)|Melincourt]]'' featured an orangutan as a parliamentary candidate.

In 1951 cartoon ''[[Ballot Box Bunny]]'', [[Bugs Bunny]] ran for the office of mayor against [[Yosemite Sam]]. Both lost to a "dark horse candidate": a mare.

In 1972, American singer [[Tom T. Hall]] had a hit with a recording entitled "The Monkey That Became President" which considered a scenario in which said animal was elected to office.

In 1976, [[Marvel Comics]] announced that their character [[Howard the Duck]] would run in that year's [[United States presidential election, 1976|election for the U.S. presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sean |last=Howe |title=Marvel Comics: The Untold Story |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=2012 |isbn=9780061992100 |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Black Mirror]]'' episode "[[The Waldo Moment]]" explores the concept of a cartoon character electoral candidate. Several news reports, including one by [[Chris Cillizza]], political reporter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', compared the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Campaign|2016 Donald Trump political campaign]] to the episode;&lt;ref name="WP-20150908"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cillizza |first=Chris |authorlink= Chris Cillizza |title=Donald Trump's troll game of Jeb Bush: A+ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/08/donald-trumps-troll-game-of-jeb-bush-a/ |date=8 September 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=24 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DC-20150807"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Keefe |first=Meghan |title=Why You Must Watch 'Black Mirror': "The Waldo Moment" This Weekend |url=http://decider.com/2015/08/07/black-mirror-the-waldo-effect-2016-presidential-race/ |date=7 August 2015 |work=Decider |accessdate=24 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; later, in September 2016, episode writer Charlie Brooker also compared the Trump campaign to ''The Waldo Moment'' and predicted Trump would win the 2016 election.&lt;ref name="DB-20160913"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yamato |first=Jen |title='Black Mirror' Creator Predicts Trump Will Be President: 'I Find It F*cking Terrifying'

'''Peacemakers''' are individuals and organizations involved in [[peacemaking]], often in countries affected by [[war]], violent conflict, and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Conflict management capabilities of peace-brokering international organizations, 1945–2010: A new dataset|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894215572757|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|volume=33|pages=198-223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They engage in processes such as [[negotiation]], [[mediation]], [[conciliation]], and [[arbitration]] – drawing on [[international law]] and norms.&lt;!-- [http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/peacemaking/] --&gt;  The objective is to move a violent conflict into non-violent dialogue, where differences are settled through conflict transformation processes or through the work of representative political institutions.

[[Peacemaking]] can occur at different levels, sometimes referred to as 'tracks'.  "High level" (governmental and international) peacemaking, involving direct talks between the leaders of conflicting parties, is sometimes thus referred to as Track 1.  Tracks 2 and 3 are said to involve dialogue at 'lower' levels—often unofficially between groups, parties, and stakeholders to a violent conflict—as well as efforts to avoid violence by addressing its causes and deleterious results.&lt;!-- [http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/track1_diplomacy/]--&gt; '''Peacemakers''' may be active in all three tracks, or in what is sometimes called [[multi-track diplomacy]].

== Nobel Peace laureates ==
{{main|Nobel Peace Prize|List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates}}
The most prominent (and sometimes most controversial) peacemakers are the Nobel Peace laureates.  96 individuals and 20 organizations have been awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] since 1901 as a recognition of their remarkable contributions to peace.

The '''Popular Democratic Movement''' ('''PDM'''), formerly the '''Democratic Turnhalle Alliance''' and '''DTA of Namibia''',  is an amalgamation of political parties in Namibia, registered as one singular party for representation purposes. In coalition with the [[United Democratic Front (Namibia)|United Democratic Front]], it formed the official opposition in Parliament until the [[Namibian general election, 2009|parliamentary elections]] in 2009. The party currently holds five seats in the [[National Assembly (Namibia)|Namibian National Assembly]]. [[McHenry Venaani]] is president of the PDM.

The PDM is an associate member of the [[International Democrat Union]], a transnational grouping of national political parties generally identified with political conservatism.

==History==
The party was formed as the ''Democratic Turnhalle Alliance'' (DTA) in November 1977 as a result of the [[Turnhalle Constitutional Conference]] held in [[Windhoek]] from 1975 to 1977 as a counterbalance and main opposition to the [[South West Africa People's Organization]] (SWAPO).&lt;ref name=DTA&gt;{{cite web

Both conference and DTA were named after the [[Turnhalle (Windhoek)|Turnhalle building]] (German, old [[Turners]] hall) in Windhoek where the conference was held.&lt;ref name=KD77&gt;{{cite web

The DTA won the [[South-West African legislative election, 1978|1978 South West African legislative election]] by a landslide, claiming 41 of the 50 seats. This was largely due to "widespread intimidation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okoth|first=Assa|title=A History of Africa: African nationalism and the de-colonisation process [1915–1995]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suMvEWjK-OcC&amp;pg=PA195|volume=2|year=2006|publisher=East African Publishers|isbn=9966253580|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the presence of South African troops, particularly in the north of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 18 January 1983 South Africa accepted the dissolution of both the legislative and the executive body without elections being scheduled, and again assumed full administrative authority over South West Africa.{{sfn|NDI|1989|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''prescription drug''' (also '''prescription medication''' or '''prescription medicine''') is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] that legally requires a [[medical prescription]] to be dispensed. In contrast, [[over-the-counter drug]]s can be obtained without a prescription. The reason for this difference in [[controlled substance|substance control]] is the potential scope of misuse, from [[drug abuse]] to [[practicing without a license|practicing medicine without a license]] and without sufficient education. Different jurisdictions have different definitions of what constitutes a prescription drug.

"Rx" (℞) is often used as a short form for prescription drug in North America - a contraction of the Latin word "''recipe''" (an imperative form of "recipere") meaning "take".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Gregory R.|title=Perseus 4.0 (Perseus Hopper)|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=recipere&amp;la=la|work=Perseus 4.0 (Perseus Hopper)|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription drugs are often dispensed together with a [[monograph]] (in Europe, a Patient Information Leaflet or PIL) that gives detailed information about the drug.

The use of prescription drugs has been increasing since the 1960s. In the U.S., 88% of older adults (62–85 years) use at least 1 prescription drug, while 36% take at least 5 prescription medicines concurrently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qato|first=Dima M.|last2=Wilder|first2=Jocelyn|last3=Schumm|first3=L.

==Regulation==
===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons]] (SUSMP) governs the manufacture and supply of drugs with several categories:&lt;ref name="Home Office Poisons"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.tga.gov.au/industry/scheduling-poisons-standard.htm
 | title = The Poisons Standard (the SUSMP)
 | publisher = [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]
 | date = 
 | accessdate = 17 September 2011
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Schedule 1 &amp;ndash; Defunct
* Schedule 2 &amp;ndash; Pharmacy Medicine
* Schedule 3 &amp;ndash; Pharmacist-Only Medicine
* Schedule 4 &amp;ndash; Prescription-Only Medicine/Prescription Animal Remedy
* Schedule 5 &amp;ndash; Caution
* Schedule 6 &amp;ndash; Poison
* Schedule 7 &amp;ndash; Dangerous Poison
* Schedule 8 &amp;ndash; Controlled Drug (Possession without authority illegal)
* Schedule 9 &amp;ndash; Prohibited Substance
* Unscheduled Substances

Like in the UK, the patient visits a [[health practitioner]], (doctor, nurse, dentist, podiatrist, etc.,), who may prescribe the drug.

Many prescriptions issued by health practitioners in Australia are covered by the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]], a scheme that provides subsidised prescription drugs to residents of Australia to ensure that all Australians have affordable and reliable access to a wide range of necessary medicines. When purchasing a drug under the PBS, the consumer pays no more than the patient co-payment contribution, which, as of January 1, 2018, is [[Australian dollar|A$]]39.50 for general patients. Those covered by government entitlements (low-income earners, welfare recipients, Health Care Card holders, etc.) and or under the [[Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (RPBS) have a reduced co-payment, which is $6.40 in 2018. The co-payments are compulsory and can be discounted by pharmacies up to a maximum of [[Australian dollar|A$]]1.00 at cost to the pharmacy.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Medicines Act 1968]] and the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/1830/made Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997] contain regulations that cover the supply of sale, use, prescribing and production of medicines. There are three categories of medicine:&lt;ref name="HPC "&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/medicinesandprescribing/ | title = About Registration: Medicines and Prescribing | publisher = [[Health and Care Professions Council]] | accessdate = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prescription-only medicines ('''POM'''), which may be dispensed (sold in the case of a private prescription) by a pharmacist if they are prescribed by a prescriber
* Pharmacy medicines ('''P'''), which may be sold by a pharmacist without a prescription
* General sales list ('''GSL''') medicines, which may be sold without a prescription in any shop

The possession of a prescription-only medicine without a prescription is legal unless it is covered by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].&lt;ref name="Home Office Laws"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/other-laws/ |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100419081707/http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/other-laws/ | title = Other drug laws | publisher = [[Home Office]] | archivedate = 19 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient visits a [[physician|medical practitioner]] or [[dentist]], who may prescribe drugs and certain other medical items, such as blood glucose-testing equipment for [[diabetic]]s. Also, qualified and experienced nurses and pharmacists may be independent prescribers. Both may prescribe all POMs (including controlled drugs), but may not prescribe Schedule 1 controlled drugs, and 3 listed controlled drugs for the treatment of addiction; which is similar to doctors, who require a special license from the Home Office to prescribe schedule 1 drugs. Schedule 1 drugs have little or no medical benefit, hence their limitations on prescribing. [[District nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s have had limited prescribing rights since the mid-1990s; until then, prescriptions for dressings and simple medicines had to be signed by a doctor. Once issued, a prescription is taken by the patient to a pharmacy, which dispenses the medicine.

Most prescriptions are [[NHS prescription]]s, subject to a standard charge that is unrelated to what is dispensed. The [[NHS]] prescription fee was increased to £8.80 per item in [[National Health Service (England)|England]] on 1 April 2018;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prescription costs|url=http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Prescriptioncosts.aspx |publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; prescriptions are free of charge if prescribed and dispensed in [[NHS Scotland|Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7127997.stm | title = Staged end to prescription charge | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 5 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NHS Wales|Wales]] and [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[NI] Prescription charges |url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/health-and-well-being/health-services/doctors-dentists-and-other-health-services/prescription-charges.htm |publisher=NI Direct |accessdate=12 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829090132/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/health-and-well-being/health-services/doctors-dentists-and-other-health-services/prescription-charges.htm |archivedate=29 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for some patients in England, such as inpatients, children, those over 60s or with certain medical conditions, and claimants of certain benefits.&lt;ref name="NHS Choices help"&gt;{{cite web |title= NHS in England - help with health costs |url= http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/Prescriptioncosts.aspx |website= nhs.uk |id= NHS Choices |publisher= NHS |accessdate= 15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pharmacy charges the NHS the actual cost of the medicine, which may vary from a few pence to hundreds of pounds.&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patient can consolidate prescription charges by using a prescription payment certificate (informally a "season ticket"), effectively capping costs at £29.10 per quarter or £104.00 per year.&lt;ref name="NHS Choices help"/&gt;

Outside the NHS, [[private prescription]]s are issued by private medical practitioner and sometimes under the NHS for medicines that are not covered by the NHS.&lt;ref name="BMA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BMA 2" /&gt; A patient pays the pharmacy the normal price for medicine prescribed outside the NHS.

Survey results published by [[Ipsos MORI]] in 2008 found that around 800,000 people in England were not collecting prescriptions or getting them dispensed because of the cost, the same as in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/151/Prescription-Costs-A-Barrier-To-Healthcare.aspx Ipsos MORI:Prescription Costs A Barrier To Healthcare, 27 February 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}
In the United States, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] defines what substances require a prescription for them to be dispensed by a pharmacy. The federal government authorizes physicians, psychiatrists, [[physician assistant]]s, [[nurse practitioner]]s and other [[advanced practice nurse]]s, veterinarians, dentists, and optometrists to prescribe any controlled substance. They are then issued unique [[Drug Enforcement Act]] numbers; many other mental and physical health technicians, including basic-level [[registered nurse]]s, [[medical assistant]]s, emergency medical technicians, most psychologists, and social workers, for example, do not have the authority to prescribe any controlled substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/440315
 | title = US Nurse Practitioner Prescribing Law: A State-by-State Summary 
 | publisher = Medscape Nurses
 | date = 2 November 2010
 | accessdate = 26 November 2010
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA) was enacted into law by the [[US Congress]] of the United States in 1970. It is the federal drug law that regulates manufacture, importation, possession, use, and distribution of certain substances. The legislation classes substances into five schedules, with varying qualifications for each schedule.

The safety and the effectiveness of prescription drugs in the US are regulated by the 1987 [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA)]]. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is charged with implementing the law.

Misuse or abuse of prescription drugs can lead to adverse drug events, including those due to dangerous drug interactions. According to one study, as many as 15% of older American adults are at risk of potential major interactions between drugs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The package insert for a prescription drug contains information about the intended effect of the drug and how it works in the body. It also contains information about side effects, how a patient should take the drug, and cautions for its use, including warnings about allergies.

As a general rule, ''[[over-the-counter drug]]s'' (OTC) are used to treat a condition that does not need care from a healthcare professional if have been proven to meet higher safety standards for self-medication by patients. Often, a lower strength of a drug will be approved for OTC use, but higher strengths require a prescription to be obtained; a notable case is [[ibuprofen]], which has been widely available as an OTC [[analgesic|pain killer]] since the mid-1980s, but it is available by prescription in doses up to four times the OTC dose for severe pain that is not adequately controlled by the OTC strength.

[[Herbal medicine|Herbal preparations]], [[amino acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]], and other [[food supplement]]s are regulated by the FDA as [[dietary supplements]]. Because specific health claims cannot be made, the consumer must make informed decisions when purchasing such products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=GC |last2=O'Connor |first2=AB |last3=Stafford |first3=RS |title=Enhancing prescription drug innovation and adoption |journal= Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=154 |pages=833–837 |year=2011 |pmid=21690598|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-154-12-201106210-00012|issue=12 |pmc=4049188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By law, American pharmacies operated by "membership clubs" such as [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]]  must allow non-members to use their pharmacy services and may not charge more for these services than they charge as their members.&lt;ref name="SavingAdvice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strain|first1=Jeffrey|title=Can I Use the Costco Pharmacy Without a Membership?|url=https://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2015/02/02/1032625_can-i-use-the-costco-pharmacy-without-a-membership.html|website=SavingAdvice.com|accessdate=28 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403090900/http://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2015/02/02/1032625_can-i-use-the-costco-pharmacy-without-a-membership.html|archivedate=3 April 2016|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians may legally prescribe drugs for uses other than those specified in the FDA approval, known as [[off-label use]]. Drug companies, however, are prohibited from marketing their drugs for off-label uses.

Large US retailers that operate pharmacies and pharmacy chains use inexpensive generic drugs as a way to attract customers into stores. Several chains, including Walmart, Kroger (including subsidiaries such as Dillons), Target, and others, offer $4 monthly prescriptions on select generic drugs as a customer draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many prescription drugs are commonly abused, particularly those marketed as [[analgesic]]s, including [[fentanyl]] (Duragesic), [[hydrocodone]] (Vicodin), [[oxycodone]] (OxyContin), [[oxymorphone]] (Opana), [[propoxyphene]] (Darvon), [[hydromorphone]] (Dilaudid), [[meperidine]] (Demerol), and [[diphenoxylate]] (Lomotil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/prescription-drugs-cold-medicines |title=Prescription Drugs &amp; Cold Medicines |website=www.drugabuse.gov |publisher=National Institute of Health |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescription painkillers have been found to be extremely addictive, and unintentional poisoning deaths in the United States have skyrocketed since the 1990s according to the [[National Safety Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Injury Facts|last=|first=|publisher=National Safety Council|year=2017|isbn=978-0-87912-357-4|location=|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriber education guidelines as well as patient education, [[prescription drug monitoring program]]s and regulation of pain clinics are regulatory tactics which have been used to curtail opioid use and misuse.&lt;ref&gt;National Safety Council (2017).

==Expiration date==
The expiration date, required in several countries, specifies the date up to which the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. In the United States, expiration dates are determined by regulations established by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm124787.htm  | title = Questions and Answers on Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Guidance Practices, Level 2 Guidance - Records and Reports | publisher = [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FDA advises consumers not to use products after their expiration dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm251658.htm | title = Expiration Dates Matter | publisher = [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] |date=14 July 2015 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The results showed that about 85% of them were safe and effective as far as 15 years past their expiration date.{{medcn|date=July 2014}} Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions—notably [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]], [[insulin]], some liquid antibiotics; outdated [[tetracyclines]] can cause [[Fanconi syndrome]]—most expired drugs are probably effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The expiration date is the final day that the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a medication. Drug expiration dates exist on most medication labels, including prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) and dietary (herbal) supplements. U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are required by law to place expiration dates on prescription products prior to marketing. For legal and liability reasons, manufacturers will not make recommendations about the stability of drugs past the original expiration date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/article/drug-expiration-dates.html |title=Drug Expiration Dates - Are They Still Safe to Take? |publisher=drugs.com |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
[[Prices of prescription drugs|Prices for prescription drugs]] vary widely around the world.&lt;ref name="HHPCosts"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/themes/drug.html]. Frontline. Posted April 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prescription costs]] for [[biosimilar]] and [[generic drugs]] are usually less than brand names, but the cost is different from one pharmacy to another.&lt;ref name=HHP&gt;[http://www.healthtalk.umn.edu/2013/03/29/new-report-prescription-drug-prices-can-vary-widely/]. University of Minnesota. March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescription drug prices including generic prices  are rising faster than the average rate of inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wdrugs.com Prescription drug costs]&lt;/ref&gt; To subsidize prescription drug costs, some patients have decided to buy medicine online.&lt;ref name="WZZM13"&gt;[http://www.wzzm13.com/news/investigations/13-on-your-side/the-canadian-remedy-how-to-save-hundreds-on-prescription-drugs/407942367]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generics undergo strict scrutiny to meet the equal efficacy, safety, dosage, strength, stability, and quality of brand name drugs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/questionsanswers/ucm100100.htm|title=Questions &amp; Answers - Generic Drugs: Questions &amp; Answers|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generics are developed after the brand name has already been established, and so generic drug approval in many aspects has a shortened approval process because it replicates the brand name drug.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Brand name drugs cost more due to time, money, and resources that drug companies invest in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in order to repeat research clinical trials that the FDA requires for the drug to remain in the market.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/GenericDrugs/ucm167991.htm|title=Generic Drugs - Generic Drug Facts|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because drug companies have to invest more in research costs to do this, brand name drug prices are much higher when sold to consumers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When the patent expires for a brand name drug, generic versions of that drug are produced by other companies and are sold for lower price. By switching to generic prescription drugs, patients can save significant amounts of money: e.g. one study by the [[FDA]] showed an example with more than 50% savings of a patient's overall costs of their prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm134205.htm|title=Resources for You - Savings From Generic Drugs Purchased at Retail Pharmacies|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drug cost containment strategies in the US ==
In the United States there are many resources available to patients to lower the costs of medication. These include copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. The [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]] is another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cost Sharing Out of Pocket Costs |url=https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/cost-sharing/out-of-pocket-costs/index.html |website=Medicaid.gov |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Generic drug program lowers amount of money patient has to pay when picking up their prescription at the pharmacy and as their name implies they only cover generic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Generic Drug Facts |url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/GenericDrugs/ucm167991.htm |website=FDA |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-pay assistance programs are program to help patient lower costs of specialty medications: i.e. medications that are on restricted formulary, limited distribution, and with no generics available. These medications can include drugs for HIV, hepatitis C, and multiple sclerosis. Patient Assistance Program Center ([http://www.rxassist.org/providers/resources RxAssist]) has a list of foundations that provide co-pay assistance programs. It is important to note that co-pay assistance programs are for the under-insured patients. Patients without insurance are not eligible for this resource, however they may be eligible for patient assistance programs.

Patient assistance programs are funded by the manufacturer of the medication. Patients can often apply to these programs through the manufacturer's website. This type of assistance program is one of the few options for the uninsured patient.

The out of pocket costs for patients enrolled in co-pay assistance or patient assistance programs are $0. It is a major resource to help lower costs of medications – however, many providers and patients are not aware of the resources.

In [[international relations]], '''public diplomacy''' or '''people's diplomacy''', broadly speaking, is the communication with and dissemination of [[propaganda]] to the general public of foreign nations to establish a dialogue designed to inform and influence. As the international order has changed over the 20th century, so has the practice of public diplomacy. Its practitioners use a variety of instruments and methods ranging from personal contact and media interviews to the Internet and educational exchanges.

== Background and definitions==

In his essay "'Public Diplomacy' Before Gullion: The Evolution of a Phrase," [[Nicholas J. Cull]] of the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] writes, "The earliest use of the phrase 'public diplomacy' to surface is actually not American at all but in a leader piece from the [[London Times]] in January 1856. It is used merely as a synonym for civility in a piece criticizing the posturing of President [[Franklin Pierce]]." Cull writes that Edmund Gullion, dean of the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]] and a distinguished retired foreign service officer, "was the first to use the phrase in its modern meaning."&lt;ref name=Cull2006&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/060418_public_diplomacy_before_gullion_the_evolution_of_a_phrase|title= 'Public Diplomacy' Before Gullion: The Evolution of a Phrase|last1= Cull|first1= Nicholas|date= Apr 18, 2006|website= USCPublicDiplomacy|publisher= University of Southern California|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Gullion founded the Edward R. Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy, and Cull writes "An early Murrow Center brochure provided a convenient summary of Gullion's concept":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy... deals with the influence of public attitudes on the formation and execution of foreign policies. It encompasses dimensions of international relations beyond traditional diplomacy; the cultivation by governments of public opinion in other countries; the interaction of private groups and interests in one country with another; the reporting of foreign affairs and its impact on policy; communication between those whose job is communication, as diplomats and foreign correspondents; and the process of intercultural communications.&lt;ref name=Cull2006/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over time, the concept and definition has evolved by various practitioners

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most important roles public diplomacy will have to play for the United States in the current international environment will be less grand-strategic and more operational than during the Cold War. Support of national policy in military contingencies is one such role, and probably the most important.&lt;br/&gt;
— Carnes Lord (former Deputy Director USIA), Professor of Statecraft and Civilization, October 1998&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://fletcher.tufts.edu/murrow/pd/definitions.html The Edward R. Murrow Center - The Fletcher School - Tufts University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617004930/http://fletcher.tufts.edu/murrow/pd/definitions.html |date=2010-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public diplomacy – effectively communicating with publics around the globe – to understand, value and even emulate America's vision and ideas; historically one of America's most effective weapons of outreach, persuasion and policy.&lt;br /&gt;
— Jill A. Schuker (former Senior Director for Public Affairs at the National Security Council) July 2004&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy's 21st century trend is dominated by fractal globalization, preemptive military invasion, information and communication technologies that shrink time and distance, and the rise of global non-state actors (terror networks, bloggers) that challenge state-driven policy and discourse on the subject.&lt;br/&gt;
— (Nancy Snow, ''Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy'', ''2009'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy may be defined, simply, as the conduct of international relations by governments through public communications media and through dealings with a wide range of nongovernmental entities (political parties, corporations, trade associations, labor unions, educational institutions, religious organizations, ethnic groups, and so on including influential individuals) for the purpose of influencing the politics and actions of other governments.&lt;br/&gt;

— Alan K. Henrikson, Professor of Diplomatic History, April 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public diplomacy that traditionally represents actions of governments to influence overseas publics within the foreign policy process has expanded today – by accident and design – beyond the realm of governments to include the media, multinational corporations, NGO's and faith-based organizations as active participants in the field. &lt;br/&gt;
— Crocker Snow Jr., Acting Director Edward R. Murrow Center, May 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"PUBLIC DIPLOMACY refers to government-sponsored programs intended to inform or influence public opinion in other countries; its chief instruments are publications, motion pictures, cultural exchanges, radio and television." (U.S. Department of State, Dictionary of International Relations Terms, 1987, p. 85)&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.publicdiplomacy.org/1.htm Public diplomacy - what it is and is not&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The United States Information Agency (USIA), which was the main government agency in charge of Public Diplomacy until it merged with the Department of State in 1999, described it as:

Public diplomacy seeks to promote the national interest and the [[national security of the United States]] through understanding, informing, and influencing foreign publics and broadening dialogue between American citizens and institutions and their counterparts abroad.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For The Planning Group for Integration of USIA into the Dept. of State (June 20, 1997), public diplomacy is defined as follows: "Public Diplomacy seeks to promote the national interest of the United States through understanding, informing and influencing foreign audiences."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Hans N. Tuch, author of Communicating With the World (St. Martin's Press, NY, 1990), public diplomacy is defined as: 
"Official government efforts to shape the communications environment overseas in which American foreign policy is played out, in order to reduce the degree to which misperceptions and misunderstandings complicate relations between the U.S. and other nations."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Standard [[diplomacy]] might be described as the ways in which government leaders communicate with each other at the highest levels, the elite diplomacy we are all familiar with. Public diplomacy, by contrast focuses on the ways in which a country (or multi-lateral organization such as the United Nations) communicates with citizens in other societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscpublicdiplomacy.org USC Center on Public Diplomacy]&lt;/ref&gt;  A country may be acting deliberately or inadvertently, and through both official and private individuals and institutions. Effective public diplomacy starts from the premise that dialogue, rather than a sales pitch, is often central to achieving the goals of foreign policy: public diplomacy must be seen as a two-way street. Furthermore, public diplomacy activities often present many differing views as represented by private American individuals and organizations in addition to official U.S. Government views.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.publicdiplomacy.org/1.htm#traditional Public diplomacy - what it is and is not&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional diplomacy actively engages one government with another government. In traditional diplomacy, U.S. Embassy officials represent the U.S. Government in a host country primarily by maintaining relations and conducting official USG business with the officials of the host government whereas public diplomacy primarily engages many diverse non-government elements of a society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Film, television, music, sports, video games and other social/cultural activities are seen by public diplomacy advocates as enormously important avenues for otherwise diverse citizens to understand each other and integral to the international cultural understanding, which they state is a key goal of modern public diplomacy strategy. It involves not only shaping the message(s) that a country wishes to present abroad, but also analyzing and understanding the ways that the message is interpreted by diverse societies and developing the tools of listening and conversation as well as the tools of persuasion.

One of the most successful initiatives which embodies the principles of effective public diplomacy is the creation by international treaty in the 1950s of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] which later became the [[European Union]]. Its original purpose after [[World War II]] was to tie the economies of Europe together so much that war would be impossible. Supporters of European integration see it as having achieved both this goal and the extra benefit of catalysing greater international understanding as European countries did more business together and the ties among member states' citizens increased.  Opponents of European integration are leery of a loss of national [[sovereignty]] and greater centralization of power.

Public diplomacy has been an essential element of American foreign policy for decades.  It was an important tool in influencing public opinion during the [[Cold War]] with the former [[Soviet Union]].  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the term has come back into vogue as the United States government works to improve their reputation abroad, particularly in the Middle East and among those in the Islamic world.  Numerous panels, including those sponsored by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], have evaluated American efforts in public diplomacy since [[9/11]] and have written reports recommending that the United States take various actions to improve the effectiveness of their public diplomacy.

The [[United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy]] was established in the late 1940s to evaluate American public diplomacy effort.  The Commission is a seven-member bipartisan board whose members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate.  William Hybl is the current chair, and other members include former Ambassadors [[Lyndon Olson]] and [[Penne Percy Korth Peacock]], as well as [[Jay T. Snyder|Jay Snyder]], [[John E. Osborn]] and Lezlee Westine.

This traditional concept is expanded on with the idea of adopting what is called "population-centric foreign affairs" within which foreign populations assume a central component of foreign policy.  Since people, not just states, are of global importance in a world where technology and migration increasingly face everyone, an entire new door of policy is opened.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisisproject.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812235523/http://crisisproject.org/ |date=2008-08-12 }} Transnational Crisis Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
There are many methods and instruments that are used in public diplomacy. [[Nicholas J.

The '''Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries between Peru and Ecuador''', or '''Rio Protocol''' for short, was an international agreement signed in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on January 29, 1942, by the foreign ministers of [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]], with the participation of the [[United States]], Brazil, [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]] as guarantors. The Protocol was intended to finally resolve the long-running [[History of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute|territorial dispute]] between the two countries, and brought about the official end of the [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War]] of 1941-1942. Nevertheless, the Protocol was incomplete, and war broke out between Peru and Ecuador twice more, in 1981 and in 1995, before the signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration which brought final resolution to the dispute.

==History==

In May 1941, as tensions at the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border mounted and war was imminent, the governments of the United States, Brazil, and Argentina offered their services in aiding in the mediation of the dispute. Their efforts failed to prevent the outbreak of hostilities on July 23, 1941, but the diplomatic intervention led to a definitive cease-fire being put into place on July 31. Despite this, limited [[skirmish]]es continued to occur through the months of August and September in the Ecuadorian provinces of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]] and [[Loja Province|Loja]], as well as in the Amazonian lands. Ecuador accused Peru of continuing its advances into the highland province of [[Azuay Province|Azuay]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

On October 2, with military observers from the three mediating countries serving as witnesses, Ecuador and Peru signed the '''Talara Accord''', which created a demilitarized zone inside the provinces of El Oro and Loja, pending the signing of a definitive [[peace treaty]]. Diplomatic efforts continued, with the mediating countries being joined by Chile.

With its recent entry into [[World War II]], the United States was eager to present a united American continent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} At the third Pan-American Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the United States encouraged a settlement between the two countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

On January 29, 1942, on the final day of the third Pan-American Summit, held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Peru, [[Julio Tobar Donoso]] and [[Alfredo Solf y Muro]], signed a "Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries", known as the '''Rio de Janeiro Protocol'''. The observers from the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile co-signed the document, becoming "Guarantors of the Protocol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks27/appndx1_27.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122235546/http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks27/appndx1_27.html |archivedate=2005-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rio Protocol was subsequently ratified by each country's congress on February 26, 1942.

By the terms of the Protocol, Ecuador agreed to withdraw its long-standing claim for rights to direct land access to the [[Marañon River|Marañon]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] rivers; Peru agreed to withdraw Peruvian military forces from Ecuadorian territory. An area of {{convert|200,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of hitherto disputed territory in the Maynas region of the Amazonian basin was awarded to Peru, which had been established to be the ''de facto'' possessor of the land since the end of the 19th century. The ''status quo'' line defined in the 1936 Lima Accord was used as the basis for the definitive border line; the previous border recognized current possessions, but not [[sovereignty]]. Relative to the 1936 line, Ecuador ceded 18,552&amp;nbsp;km² of previously possessed territory to Peru, while Peru ceded 5,072&amp;nbsp;km² of previously possessed territory to Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Julio Tobar Donoso, ''La Invasión Peruana y el Protocolo de Rio. Antecedentes y Explicación Histórica''. Quito, Banco Central del Ecuador, 1982 (1st Ed. 1945). P. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, the Ecuadorian government alleged that the Protocol was invalid, because it had been signed under [[coercion]] while foreign troops were stationed on Ecuadorian soil.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This stance was modified by subsequent governments, but was never officially reverted until the resolution of the dispute in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The intended goal of the Rio Protocol was not fulfilled until the signing of the '''Itamaraty Peace Declaration''' in 1995. Between the signing of the two treaties, the [[Paquisha Incident]] and the [[Cenepa War]] rekindled the dispute.

'''PROTOCOL OF PEACE, FRIENDSHIP, AND BOUNDARIES BETWEEN PERU AND ECUADOR''' 

The Governments of Peru and Ecuador, desiring to settle the boundary dispute which, over a long period of time, has separated them, and taking into consideration the offer that was made to them by the Governments of the United States of America, of the Argentine Republic, of the United States of Brazil, and of Chile, of their friendly services to seek a prompt and honorable solution to the program, and moved by the American spirit that prevails in the Third Consultative Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics, have resolved to conclude a protocol of peace, friendship, and boundaries in the presence of the representatives of those four friendly Governments. To this end, the following plenipotentiaries take part: 

For the Republic of Peru, Doctor Alfredo Solf y Muro, Minister of Foreign Affairs; and 

For the Republic of Ecuador, Doctor Julio Tobar Donoso, Minister of Foreign Affairs; 

Who, after having exhibited the respective full powers of the parties, and            having found them in good and due form, agree to the signing of the following protocol:

'''ARTICLE VII''' 

Any doubt or disagreement that may arise in the execution of this protocol shall be settled by the parties concerned, with the assistance of the representatives of the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, in the shortest possible time.

'''ARTICLE IX''' 

It is understood that the line above described shall be accepted by Peru and Ecuador for the demarcation of the boundary between the two countries, by technical experts, on the grounds.

'''Situationist prank''' is a term used in the [[mass media]] to label a distinctive tactic by the [[Situationist International]], consisting of setting up a subversive&lt;ref name="KnabbSanguinetti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt; political prank, hoax or stunt;&lt;ref name="Marrone05"/&gt; In the terminology of the Situationist International, stunts and media pranks are very similar to ''situations''.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlin, Jennifer A. (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=32vZVme29CcC&amp;pg=PA240 ''Critical pedagogies of consumption''] p.240 quote: {{quotation|Through artistic interventions, hoaxes, tactical media pranks, or what  the SI called "situations," culture jammers direct public attention ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franks, Benjamin (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HqvaAAAAMAAJ ''Rebel alliances: the means and ends of contemporary British anarchisms''] p.315 {{quotation|Stunts are very similar to situations but have an additional characteristic, namely that the imaginative interaction is aimed at the mainstream media, the intention being that they broadcast the prank to a wider public}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[détournement]]'' technique, that is "turning expressions of the capitalist system against itself,"&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt; was the essential element of a situationist prank.&lt;ref name="Marrone05"/&gt; The Situationist tactic of using ''détournement'' for subversive pranks is such a distinctive and influential aspect of the Situationist International, that they are sometimes labeled as a group of political ''pranksters''.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;

===Notre-Dame Affair on National TV===
{{main|Notre-Dame Affair}}
One of the earliest Situationist pranks,&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"&gt;Holt (2010) p.252&lt;/ref&gt; '''The Notre-Dame Affair''' was an intervention performed by members of the radical wing of the [[Lettrist]] movement ([[Michel Mourre]], [[Serge Berna]], Ghislain Desnoyers de Marbaix and Jean Rullier), on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1950, at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris, while the mass was aired live on National TV. Michel Mourre, dressed in the habit of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monk]] and backed by his co-conspirators, chose a quiet moment in the Easter High Mass to climb to the rostrum and declaim before the whole congregation a blasphemous anti-sermon on the death of God, penned by Serge Berna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ snarkout: to have done with the judgment of god&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031113002215/http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |date=2003-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=8 miro renzaglia - COSTRUIRE L'UNITA' D'AREA/2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=311 miro renzaglia - SITUAZIONISMO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strasbourg scandal===

{{main|On the Poverty of Student Life}}
Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five "Pro-situs", Situationist-influenced students had infiltrated the University of Strasbourg's [[Student activity center|student union]] in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities.&lt;ref name=tmrg&gt;{{cite book | last = Plant | first = Sadie | title = The Most Radical Gesture | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-415-06222-5 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vague&gt;{{cite book | last = Vague | first = Tom  | title = Anarchy in the Uk: the Angry Brigade | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-873176-98-8 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first action was to form an "anarchist appreciation society" called The Society for the Rehabilitation for Karl Marx and Ravachol; next they appropriated union funds to [[Flyposting|flypost]] "Return of the Durruti Column", [[Andre Bertrand]]'s ''[[detournement|détourned]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; They then invited the Situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and ''On the Poverty of Student Life'', written by Tunisian Situationist [[Mustapha/Omar Khayati]] was the result.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt;

The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the [[academic year]]. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt;

===Sanguinetti's ''Report'' to save capitalism===
By 1972, [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]] and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of Situationist International. Working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled ''Rapporto veridico sulle ultime opportunità di salvare il capitalismo in Italia'' ([[English language|Eng]]: ''Veritable Report on the Last Chances to Save Capitalism in Italy''), which (inspired by [[Bruno Bauer]]) purported to be the cynical writing of "Censor", a powerful [[industrialist]]. The pamphlet argues that the ruling class of Italy supported the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other mass slaughter, for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from communist claims. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals.

==Legacy==
The situationist tactic of a détournement-based hoax was notoriously used in February 1977 by the Sex Pistols, who played [[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|their version of "God Save the Queen"]] while sailing down the [[River Thames]] past the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] to mock the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] river procession in honor of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name="Marrone05"&gt;Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p.45, quote: 
{{quotation|[...] gioco al complotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al ''detournement'' -- inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk -- che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, Malcom McClaren, a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scatenò, con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece e' stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p.40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale ''mainstream''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression '''situationist prankster''' has been later established as a typical label used on those who perform [[media prank]]s or [[publicity stunt]]s, as in the cases of ''[[The KLF]]'',&lt;ref name="Vincentelli04"&gt;Vincentelli, Elisabeth (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yoCV0eaetb0C ''ABBA gold'']&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[K Foundation]]'',&lt;ref name="Fortnight335-345"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=edhnAAAAMAAJ Fortnight, Issues 335-345] p.349&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genesis P-Orridge]],&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C The rough guide to rock edited by Peter Buckley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harun Farocki]],&lt;ref name="Elsaesser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OHBrp2_W2ccC Harun Farocki: working on the sightlines By Thomas Elsaesser] p.106&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref name="Gimarc94p47"&gt;[[George Gimarc]] (1994) [http://www.gimarc.com/PUNK_DIARY.html ''Punk Diary 1970-1979''], p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sabin99p182"&gt;Sabin, Roger (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pnb1g3oIzTIC ''Punk rock: so what? : the cultural legacy of punk''], p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

A growth of campaigns using tactics such as the [[Flash Mob]] or [[Subvertising]] in recent years can be traced to situationist pranks. These tactics, notable in stunts by [[The Yes Men]], campaigns by [[Green Peace]], and guerilla art by [[Banksy]], have been characterised by their appropriation of establishment symbols, shifting the intended purpose of public (now private) space, or creating bizarre reality hacks that merely remix the cultural context, as opposed to providing something entirely surreal.&lt;ref name="New Statesman"&gt;New Statesman (2013) [http://newstatesman.com/culture/2013/05/spectacle-disintegration ''The Spectacle of Disintegration'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some surreal pranks continue to exist in more subversive movements, such as the Alley concept,&lt;ref name="Alley concept"&gt;Alley Concept (2013) [http://alleyconcept.tumblr.com "Alley Concept"]&lt;/ref&gt; and are traceable to situationist pranks in their deliberate constructions of surreal situations that juxtapose the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]] thereby aiming to reawaken authentic desires and liberate everyday life.

The concept forms the primary genre on popular Australian television series "The Chaser's War on Everything." Worldwide media attention followed their successful entry into the G20 Summit held in Sydney, Australia - September 2007. The group formed a motorcade with a Bin Laden-esque character inside a limousine flying flags of a non-existent country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvH3YQGQwLM The Chaser's war on Everything - APEC Motorcade]  Sep 12, 2007 - Chas dressed as Osama bin Laden the Chasers drive a disguised Canadian motorcade ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domains==

The standards were listed under seven headings or "domains", three of which focused on "[[Healthcare in England#Patient experience|patient experience]]":

#[[Patient safety|Safety]]
#Clinical and [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]]
#Governance (both [[clinical governance]] and [[corporate governance]])
#Patient focus
#Accessible and responsive care
#Care environment and amenities
#[[Public health]]

==Standards==

The standards were divided into 24 core and 13 developmental standards.  Compliance with the core standards had always been mandatory but the approach taken by the Department of Health and Healthcare Commission with respect to the developmental standards varied.&lt;ref name="AHC"/&gt;

'''''The Doha Debates''''' are a forum for free speech in [[Qatar]] and tackle the region's most controversial and topical issues. They are sponsored by [[Qatar Foundation]] and their broadcasting rights are sold to [[BBC World News]] where they are aired monthly, eight times a year.  The debates entered into their eighth series in October 2011.

In addition to BBC World News the Doha Debates are broadcast on [[MHz Networks]] and [[Thirteen (television station)]] in the USA, [[GEO TV]] in Pakistan, [[TV BiH]] in Bosnia and Hertzegovina and the [[Real News Network]] in Canada and the USA. The total potential global audience for the Debates is over 350 million.

==Qatar Foundation==
The Doha Debates are hosted and funded by the [[Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development]] - a private, chartered, non-profit organization, founded in 1995 and chaired by [[Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned]]. The Doha Debates supported the creation of [[QatarDebate]], an independent student debating organization for Qatar, in 2007.

==Format==
The Doha Debates are chaired by the award-winning, former BBC correspondent and interviewer [[Tim Sebastian]], who founded them in 2004 and secured their editorial independence. No government, official body or broadcaster has any control over what is said at the sessions or who is invited. Televised eight times a year by BBC World News, the debates are based on a centuries-old format, refined by the famous [[Oxford Union]]. They focus on a single, controversial motion, with two speakers for and against. Once they have outlined their arguments, each speaker is questioned by the chairman and the discussion is then opened up to the audience for argument and a final electronic vote.

==Specials==
The Doha Debates have become the Middle East’s forum of choice for many prominent statesmen. Special events – which feature Q&amp;A sessions with a single guest – have attracted such names as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Mohamed El  Baradei]], [[Shimon Peres]], [[Amre Moussa]],  [[Ayad Allawi]], and [[Mahmoud Zahar]].

==Local and international audience==
Two thirds of the local audience are students, from a wide range of Arab and Islamic countries. In several debates they have adopted radical and unexpected positions. Clear majorities have stated that Muslims are failing to combat extremism and that the Palestinians risk becoming their own worst enemy. Internationally, the debates have attracted wide attention. BBC World News is seen by nearly 300 million viewers, across 200 countries. The website – www.thedohadebates.com - now receives more than a million hits a month.

==Past motions==
The Debates confront head-on the sensitive topics of the region: torture, terrorism and suicide bombings, political turmoil and human rights. Past motions have questioned whether it was time to talk to [[Al Qaeda]]; whether [[Hezbollah]] had the right to fight a war on [[Lebanon]]’s behalf; and whether the pro-Israel lobby was successfully stifling criticism of the country’s actions.

The '''Unification movement''' or '''Unificationism''', also called the '''Unification Church''' ('''UC'''), is a worldwide [[new religious movement]]. Its members are colloquially called "[[Moonie (nickname)|Moonie]]s". It was officially founded under the name [[Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity]] (HSA-UWC) in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], in 1954, by [[Sun Myung Moon]], a [[Korea]]n religious leader also known for his business ventures and engagement in social and political causes.&lt;ref name= Barker2012&gt;[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/03/my-take-moons-death-marks-end-of-an-era/ Moon's death marks end of an era], [[Eileen Barker]], [[CNN]], 2012-9-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Introvigne|first1=Massimo|title=The Unification Church: Studies in Contemporary Religion|date=2000-10-15|publisher=Signature Books|isbn=1560851457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Prophets and Protons: New Religious Movements and Science in Late Twentieth-Century America'', Benjamin E.

The beliefs of the movement are based on Moon's book ''Divine Principle'', which claims to incorporate [[Christian]] teachings but differs on many points including its view of [[Jesus]]&lt;ref name="Sontag102"&gt;{{cite book | last =Sontag  | first =Fredrick   | title =Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church  | publisher =Abingdon  | year =1977  | pages =102–105 | isbn =0-687-40622-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its introduction of the concept of "indemnity."&lt;ref&gt;Daske, D. and Ashcraft, W. 2005, ''New Religious Movements'', New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-0702-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unification movement ceremonies include unique [[funeral]]&lt;ref&gt;The Advent of Sun Myung Moon: The Origins, Beliefs and Practices of the Unification Church,  [[George Chryssides]], Springer, Apr 5, 1991, 247 pages, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wedding]] ceremonies.&lt;ref name=nrti/&gt;

==Terminology==
{{main|Moonie (nickname)}}

On February 25, 1920, Sun Myung Moon was born Mun Yong-myeong in modern-day Sangsa-ri (上思里), Deogun-myon, Jeongju-gun, [[North Pyongan|North P'yŏng'an]] [[Provinces of Korea|Province]], at a time when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Japanese rule]].

Unification Church members believe that [[Jesus]] appeared to Mun Yong-myong (his birth name) on [[Easter Day]] in 1936, and asked him to accomplish the work left unfinished after his crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt; https://belvederefamily.com/ &lt;/ref&gt; After a period of prayer and consideration, Moon accepted the mission, later changing his name to Mun Son-myong (Moon Sun-myung or Sun Myung Moon).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513174704/http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm |date=2008-05-13 }} The Unification Church Studies in Contemporary Religion, Massimo Introvigne, 2000, Signature Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1943, Moon married Sun Kil Choi.&lt;ref name="sigbooks"&gt;[http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm The Unification Church: Studies in Contemporary Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513174704/http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm |date=2008-05-13 }} Massimo Introvigne, Signature Books, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moon's teachings, called the ''[[Divine Principle]]'', were first published as ''Wonli Wonbon'' (원리 원본, "Original Text of the Divine Principle") in 1945. The earliest manuscript was lost in [[North Korea]] during the [[Korean War]]. A second, expanded version, ''Wonli Hesol (원리 해설)'', or ''Explanation of the Divine Principle'', was published in 1957. Its most propagated text, ''Exposition of the Divine Principle'', was published in 1966. Moon built his first church as a refugee in [[Pusan]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

==={{Anchor|Controversy}}Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (1954–1994)===
Moon founded  the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC) in [[Seoul]] on May 1, 1954. It expanded rapidly in South Korea and by the end of 1955 had 30 centers throughout the nation.&lt;ref name= Barker2012/&gt; The HSA-UWC expanded throughout the world with most members living in South Korea, [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], and other nations in [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Email Us |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0903/breaking1.html |title='Moonies' founder dies, aged 92 - The Irish Times - Mon, Sep 03, 2012 |publisher=The Irish Times |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Barker2012/&gt;  

In 1958, Moon sent missionaries to Japan, and in 1959, to America. Missionary work took place in Washington, DC, New York, and [[California]]. It found success in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], where the HSA-UWC expanded in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[San Francisco]].  By 1971, the [[Unification Church of the United States|HSA-UWC in the US]] had about 500 members.  By 1973, it had some presence in all 50 states and a few thousand members.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In the 1970s, American HSA-UWC members were noted for their enthusiasm and dedication, which often included raising money for UC projects on so-called "mobile fundraising teams".&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, Massimo, 2000, ''The Unification Church Studies in Contemporary Religion'', Signature Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}}, [http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513174704/http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm |date=2008-05-13 }} pages 12 – 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910836,00.html Moon-struck], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 15, 1973, "The core members—most in their 20s, many of them converts from other spiritual, psychological or political trips—display a dogged devotion that makes even Jehovah's Witnesses look like backsliders. They are enthusiastic capitalists who rise at dawn to hit the streets with wares to exchange for "donations": flowers, votive light candles, even peanuts. Last year, when Master Moon moved his international headquarters to Tarrytown, N.Y., members sold candles across the U.S. for seven weeks to meet the down payment of $300,000 on an $850,000 estate".&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSA-UWC also sent missionaries to Europe. They entered [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 and remained underground until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/14/news/14iht-czech.t.html "Czechs, Now 'Naively' Seeking Direction, See Dangers in Cults"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 14, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Unification movement activity in South America began in the 1970s with missionary work. Later, the HSA-UWC made large investments in civic organizations and business projects, including an international newspaper.&lt;ref name="NYT1996"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/24/world/unification-church-gains-respect-in-latin-america.html "Unification Church Gains Respect in Latin America"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in the 1990s, the HSA-UWC expanded in [[Russia]] and other former communist nations. [[Hak Ja Han]], Moon's wife, made a radio broadcast to the nation from the [[State Kremlin Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909181622/http://www.greenleft.org.au/1997/276/16821 The Moonies in Moscow: a second coming?], ''[[Green Left Weekly]]'', May 28, 1997. "With the dismantling of the Soviet Union in 1991, Moon's anticommunism lost much of its camouflage value. There was, however, the compensating possibility of being able to expand his operations into Russia&amp;nbsp;– both with the bible, and with business. One of Moon's schemes in Russia during the early 1990s was reportedly to rent Red Square for a mass wedding ceremony of the type practised by his sect in many cities around the world, in which scores and perhaps hundreds of couples&amp;nbsp;– selected for one another by UC leaders, and introduced only a few days previously --are married simultaneously. This plan came to nothing. The most that was achieved was that Moon's wife was allowed to broadcast from the stage of the Kremlin Palace of Congresses".&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1994, the HSA-UWC had about 5,000 members in Russia.&lt;ref name="A Less Secular Approach"&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=7351 A Less Secular Approach], ''The Saint Petersburg Times'', June 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 Russian students had been sent to USA to participate in 40-day workshops.&lt;ref name="schmemann1993"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/28/world/religion-returns-to-russia-with-a-vengeance.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |work=The New York Times |first=Serge |last=Schmemann |title=Religion Returns to Russia, With a Vengeance |date=July 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moon moved to the United States in 1971, although he remained a citizen of the Republic of Korea. In the 1970s, he gave a series of public speeches in the United States, including one in [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City in 1974; two in 1976 in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in New York City; and one on the grounds of the [[Washington Monument]] in Washington, DC, where he spoke on "God's Hope for America" to 300,000 people. In 1975, the HSA-UWC held one of the [[list of largest peaceful gatherings in history|largest peaceful gatherings in history]], with 1.2 million people in [[Yeouido]], South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=ihttT5K7AtD34QSR_8y_Ag&amp;hl=ru&amp;id=8t-9yx3oG4kC&amp;dq=%22washington+monument%22+%22sun+myung+moon%22+OR+%22unification+church%22&amp;ots=5et89YYwpE&amp;q=yoido+rally#v=snippet&amp;q=yoido%20rally&amp;f=false |title=Lifestyle: Conversations with Members of Unification Church&amp;nbsp;– "Quebedeaux, Richard"&amp;nbsp;– Google Книги |publisher=Books.google.kg |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a tenfold increase in membership "during the years 1972-74, the Unification Church emerged as a national movement in America."&lt;ref&gt; Michael L. Mickler, ''A History Of The Unification Church In America, 1959–74 -- Emergence of a National Movement'' https://www.tparents.org/library/unification/books/huca/Huca-06.htm &lt;/ref&gt; The movement held in New York the first of a series of conferences on "Unified Science," with such famous scholars as [[Nicholas Kurti]] and [[W.V.O. Quine]], bought the Belvedere estate at Tarrytown, NY &lt;ref&gt; http://www.thebelvedereestate.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; and held there an "International Training Session" for disaffected students attracted from overseas, including [[John Waite]] who later broadcast on BBC Radio his memories of the event.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b00s08g6 &lt;/ref&gt;

Assisted by an organization called the Freedom Leadership Foundation Rev. Moon was introduced in 1973 to such American public figures as Senators [[Edward Kennedy]], [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Strom Thurmond]] and [[James L. Buckley|James Buckley]], and to [[Nguyen Van Thieu]], President of South Vietnam.  More publicity attended mass weddings ([[Blessing ceremony of the Unification Church]]) first conducted in the US in 1982.  Participants later included [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Emmanuel Milingo]], an archbishop of the [[Catholic church]].

In the 1970s the Unification movement, along with some other new religious movements, became a target of the [[anti-cult movement]].  On the basis of theories that have not gained acceptance in mainline social science,&lt;ref name=BarkerAReview&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barker, Eileen |year=1986 |title=Religious Movements: Cult and Anti-Cult Since Jonestown |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=12 |pages=329–346 |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.12.080186.001553}}&lt;/ref&gt; "anti-cult" activists accused the movement of having [[brainwashing|"brainwashed"]] its members.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Christoper|title=The Rev Sun Myung Moon obituary Korean founder of the Unification church – the Moonies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/rev-sun-myung-moon|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 September 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, members reported that they were kidnapped and forcibly "deprogrammed" by those who wanted to pull them out of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010/148871.htm Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2010 Report.November 17, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Moon was convicted in the United States of filing false federal [[income tax]] returns and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]: see [[United States v. Sun Myung Moon]]. He served 13 months of the sentence at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/profit.htm Moon's Japanese Profits Bolster Efforts in U.S.] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-6-35.0.html The Unification Church Aims a Major Public Relations Effort at Christian Leaders] ''[[Christianity Today]]'', April 19, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was protested as a case of [[selective prosecution]] and a threat to [[religious freedom]] by, among others, [[Jerry Falwell]], head of [[Moral Majority]], [[Joseph Lowery]], head of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], [[Harvey Cox]] a Professor of Divinity at [[Harvard]], and [[Eugene McCarthy]], United States Senator and former Democratic Party presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1984/10/11/moons-financial-rise-and-fall-pbab/?dsq=48682316#comment-48682316 Moon's financial rise and fall],''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', October 11, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, Massimo, 2000, ''The Unification Church Studies in Contemporary Religion'', Signature Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}}, [http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513174704/http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1980s Moon instructed HSA-UWC members to take part in a program called "Home Church" in which they reached out to neighbors and community members through public service.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Hickey (politician)|Patrick Hickey]] ''Tahoe Boy: A journey back home'' John, Maryland, Seven Locks Press (May 15, 2009) {{ISBN|0-9822293-6-4}} {{ISBN|978-0-9822293-6-1}} pages 163-168&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991 Moon announced that Um members should return to their hometowns and undertake apostolic work there. Massimo Introvigne, a scholar of [[new religious movement]]s, said that this confirmed that full-time membership is no longer considered crucial to movement members.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (1994– )===
[[File: Logo of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification.jpg|thumb|right|200px|FFWPU logo]]
On May 1, 1994 (the 40th anniversary of the founding of the HSA-UWC), Moon declared that the era of the HSA-UWC had ended and inaugurated a new organization: the [[Family Federation for World Peace and Unification]] (FFWPU) would include HSA-UWC members and members of other religious organizations working toward common goals, especially on issues of sexual morality and reconciliation between people of different religions, nations, and races.

== Beliefs ==
The Unification movement is among the minority of new religious movements who have introduced their own unique [[religious text]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]], 2011, ''The Message and the Book'', UK, [[Atlantic Books]], page 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Divine Principle'' or ''Exposition of the Divine Principle'' ({{korean|hangul=원리강론|rr=Weolli Gangnon}}) is the main [[theology|theological]] textbook of the movement. It was co-written by Moon and early disciple Hyo Won'eu and first published in 1966. A translation entitled ''Divine Principle'' was published in English in 1973.

The ''Divine Principle'' lays out the core of UC theology, and is held by its believers to have the status of holy scripture. Following the format of [[systematic theology]], it includes (1) [[God]]'s purpose in creating human beings, (2) the [[fall of man]], and (3) restoration – the process through history by which God is working to remove the ill effects of the fall and restore humanity back to the relationship and position that God originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1978/v35-2-article3.htm Korean Moon: Waxing of Waning?], Leo Sandon Jr., ''Theology Today'', Vol 35, No 2, July 1978, "The movement's official doctrinal statement, and a part of the revelation, is the Divine Principle. Both an oral tradition and a written one and published in several versions, Divine Principle is the Completed Testament. The Rev. Moon claims to have come not to destroy or abrogate the Old and New Testaments, but to fulfill them-to "complete" them. To his Moonist followers, the Rev. Moon is primarily "true father," probably the Messiah, and only secondarily a theologian. In an effort to systematize Moon's teachings, several members of the Unification Church in Korea have put together a developing theological system in Divine Principle which is impressive in its imaginative nature, coherence, and consistency, if not in its Christian orthodoxy. As the most complete expression of Moonist teachings to date, Divine Principle is the basic text of the Unification Church.4 The two major divisions of the system are the doctrines of Creation and Restoration. There are many subsets to these major divisions, but Creation and Restoration are the foci for the Moonist theological system."&lt;/ref&gt;

===View of Jesus===
[[Jesus]] has a great importance in the teachings of the Unification movement, although its view of him differs from that of [[Nicene Christianity]].  Central to Unification teachings is the concept that [[fall of man|fallen humanity]] can be restored to [[God]] only through Jesus the [[Messiah]], who comes as a new [[Adam]] to become the new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, through whom mankind can be reborn into God's family. According to the ''Divine Principle'', Jesus of Nazareth is this Christ.&lt;ref name="Sontag102"&gt;{{cite book | last =Sontag  | first =Fredrick   | title =Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church  | publisher =Abingdon  | year =1977  | pages =102–105 | isbn =0-687-40622-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 Unification theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] wrote:
{{quote|Unification theology teaches that Jesus came to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth. As St. Paul wrote, Jesus was to be the new Adam restoring the lost garden of Eden. For this purpose he chose twelve apostles, symbolizing the original twelve tribes of Israel, and sent out seventy disciples, symbolizing all the nations of the world. Like John the Baptist, Jesus proclaimed that the long-awaited kingdom of heaven was at hand (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus was appointed God's earthly representative in order to subjugate Satan, cleanse men of original sin and free them from the power of evil. Christ's mission involved liberation from sin and raising mankind to the perfection stage. His purpose was to bring about the kingdom of heaven in our world with the help of men filled with divine truth and love. Jesus' goal was to restore the garden of Eden, a place of joy and beauty in which true families of perfected parents would dwell with God in a full relationship of reciprocal love.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Young Oon, 1980, [http://www.religious.org/ucbooks/UTheol/toc.htm Unification Theology], Barrytown, NY: [[Unification Theological Seminary]], Library of Congress Cataloging number 80-52872&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Unification movement view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians. In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of the [[divinity of Christ]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].  They add: "Moon makes all men equal in 'divinity' to Jesus, thereby striking a blow at the uniqueness of Christ." &lt;ref&gt;Walter Ralston Martin, Ravi K. Zacharias, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House, 2003, {{ISBN|0764228218}}  pages 368-370&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Divine Principle'' responds to this criticism  by saying:
{{quote|There is no greater value than that of a person who has realized the ideal of creation. This is the value of Jesus, who surely attained the highest imaginable value. The conventional Christian belief in Jesus' divinity is well founded because, as a perfect human being, Jesus is totally one with God. To assert that Jesus is none other than a man who has completed the purpose of creation does not degrade the value of Jesus in the least.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.net/dp96/dp96-1-7.html#Chap7 Divine Principle], Chapter 7, Section 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unificationist theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] wrote and some members of the Unification movement believe that [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] was the father of Jesus based on the work of, English [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] in the [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] tradition, [[Leslie Weatherhead]].&lt;ref name = "USArmy"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Department of the Army|authorlink=United States Department of the Army|title=Religious Requirements and Practices: A Handbook for Chaplains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gDQfnMUI6gC|date=October 2001|publisher=The Minerva Group, Inc.|isbn=978-0-89875-607-4|pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sontag102"&gt;{{cite book | last =Sontag  | first =Fredrick   | title =Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church  | publisher =Abingdon  | year =1977  | pages =102–105 | isbn =0-687-40622-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Weatherhead, L.D.|title=The Christian Agnostic|pages=59–63|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=England|year=1965|url=http://DLMcN.com/weatherhead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement'' by Ruth A. Tucker 1989 {{ISBN|0-310-25937-1}} pages 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indemnity===
Indemnity, in the context of Unification [[theology]], is a part of the process by which human beings and the world are restored to God's ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Daske, D. and Ashcraft, W. 2005, ''New Religious Movements'', New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-0702-5}} "To restart the process toward perfection, God has sent messiahs to earth who could restore the true state of humanity's relationship with God. Before that can happen, however, humans must perform good deeds that cancel the bad effects of sin. Unificationists call this "indemnity". Showing love and devotion to one's fellow humans, especially within families, helps pay this indemnity." p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, J. 1995, ''Unification Church'', Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Press, {{ISBN|0-310-70381-6}} "The doctrine of indemnity. Indemnity is that which people do to restore themselves to God's kingdom. [[Young Oon Kim]] describes it this way: 'We atone for our sins through specific acts of penance.' Kwang-Yol Yoo, a Unification teacher, even goes so far as to say that by following the ''Divine Principle'', "man's perfection must be accomplished by his own effort without God's help." God does most of the work, but people must still do their part in order to achieve God's plan of salvation: 'Five percent is only to say that man's responsibility is extremely small compared to God's.' "p35 "The doctrine of indemnity is not biblical. 'In simple language.' states Ruth Tucker, 'indemnity is salvation by works.' Bob Larson makes a distinction between Moon's doctrine and biblical theology, saying, 'Moon's doctrine of sinless perfection by "indemnity [forgiveness of sin by works on Moon's behalf], which can apply even to deceased ancestors, is a denial of the salvation by grace offering through Jesus Christ.' 'Farewell,' said John Calvin. 'to the dream of those who think up a righteousness flowing together out of faith and works.'" p40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.net/misc/powerdp.html THE POWER OF THE PRINCIPLE: WHENCE IT CAME; WHERE IT WENT] Richard Quebedeaux, "Rev. Moon calls such a mode of living, such a lifestyle, "restoration through indemnity." With indemnity viewed as a persistent pattern of behavior, not as a mere doctrine to be affirmed or a rational list of rules, God's ideal for human relationships is "restored" through restitution. Restitution-in the sense of a "natural law"-assuages resentment, because it is the means by which the powerful and enfranchised give the people who feel downtrodden and powerless what they believe is rightly theirs. Indemnity means that 'I'm here for you.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/edp-restoration.html%23Part2&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:34:40 ''Exposition of the Divine Principle'' 1996 Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of indemnity is explained at the start of the second half of the ''Divine Principle'', "Introduction to Restoration":
{{quote|What, then, is the meaning of restoration through indemnity? When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called indemnity. .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill indemnity conditions is called the providence of restoration through indemnity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Exposition of the Divine Principle''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Divine Principle'' goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The [[Bible|biblical]] verse "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth" (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. [[Faith]], [[baptism]], and the [[eucharist]] are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. [[Abraham]]'s attempted sacrifice of his son [[Isaac]] (Gen. 22:1-18) and the [[Israelites]]' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under [[Moses]] (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The ''Divine Principle'' then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a "just and righteous" God to work through mankind. [[Jesus]]' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and [[Christianity]]'s history of [[martyr]]dom are mentioned as examples of this.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The ''Divine Principle'' then states that human beings, not God or the [[angel]]s, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, J. I., 1995, Unification Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Publishing House {{ISBN|0-310-70381-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daske and Ashcraft"&gt;Daske and Ashcraft&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 scholars Daske and Ashcraft explained the concept of indemnity:
{{quote|To restart the process toward perfection, God has sent messiahs to earth who could restore the true state of humanity's relationship with God. Before that can happen, however, humans must perform good deeds that cancel the bad effects of sin. Unificationists call this 'indemnity'. Showing love and devotion to one's fellow humans, especially within families, helps pay this indemnity.&lt;ref&gt;Daske, D. and Ashcraft, W. 2005, New Religious Movements, New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0814707025}} p142.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other Christian commentators have criticized the concept of indemnity as being contrary to the Christian doctrine of ''[[sola fide]]''. Radio and television evangelist [[Bob Larson]] said, "Moon's doctrine of sinless perfection by 'indemnity', which can apply even to deceased ancestors, is a denial of the salvation by grace offering through Jesus Christ." Christian historian Ruth Tucker said: "In simple language indemnity is salvation by works."&lt;ref name=Yamamoto&gt;Yamamoto, J. I., 1995, ''Unification Church'', Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Publishing House {{ISBN|0-310-70381-6}} ([http://www.zondervan.com/media/samples/pdf/0310703816_samptxt.pdf Excerpt:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210024144/http://www.zondervan.com/media/samples/pdf/0310703816_samptxt.pdf |date=2012-02-10 }})&lt;br /&gt;"1.

:b. It is used as a theological training center, where members are prepared to be leaders and theologians in the UC.
:c. Moon's seminary, however, has not only attracted a respectable faculty (many of whom are not members of the UC), but it also has graduated many students (who are members of the UC) who have been accepted into doctoral programs at institutions such as Harvard and Yale."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daske and Ashcraft"/&gt; Donald Tingle and Richard Fordyce, ministers with the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] who debated two Unification Church theologians in 1977, wrote: "In short, indemnity is anything you want to make it, since you establish the conditions. The zeal and enthusiasm of the Unification Church members is not so much based on love for God as it is compulsion to indemnify one's own sins."&lt;ref&gt;Tingle, D. and Fordyce, R. 1979, The Phases and Faces of the Moon: A Critical Examination of the Unification Church and Its Principles, Hicksville, New York: Exposition Press p53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
The relationship of the Unification movement and science has often been noted, by the news media and by scholars of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gx42u7cGkYQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22systematic+theology%22+%22Divine+Principle%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kRViZyi1_R&amp;sig=jKoyebPPgMZfsDalf9KQ8isc9Bk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA10,M1 Mary Farrell Bednarowski, 1995, ''New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America'', Indiana University Press, pp.9-10] {{ISBN|0-253-20952-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Divine Principle'' calls for the unification of science and religion: "Religion and science, each in their own spheres, have been the methods of searching for truth in order to conquer ignorance and attain knowledge. Eventually, the way of religion and the way of science should be integrated and their problems resolved in one united undertaking; the two aspects of truth, internal and external, should develop in full consonance."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/DivinePrinciple-intro.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:34:22 Divine Principle, Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funerals===
A Unification funeral (or ''seungwha'') is a [[funeral]] ceremony for the purpose of aiding the deceased person's transition to the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] and to celebrate his or her life among family and friends.&lt;ref name ="Selig"&gt;Selig, William, 2012, ''The Seunghwa Ministry of the Unification Church'', [[Unification Theological Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Kwak"&gt;[[Chung Hwan Kwak|Kwak Chung-wan]], 1985, ''The Tradition'', [[Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity]] (Unification Church), Chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theological basis====
Unification movement scholars writing on the church's funeral customs cite the ''Divine Principle'' which says: "Man, upon his death, after his life in the visible world, goes to the invisible world in a spiritual body, having taken off his 'clothes of flesh' (Job 10:11), and lives there forever."  They also note that family and other human relationships continue after death.&lt;ref name ="Selig"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Kwak"/&gt;  The Unification movement does not uphold belief in [[reincarnation]] or [[Damnation|eternal damnation]].  Unification theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] writes: 
:"You and I are going to live forever. What does immortality signify? We are thinking animals and loving creatures. Those two faculties show our kinship to the eternal God. They make us part of the infinite spirit world. We will think and we will love forever.  Thus, our wisdom will continually grow and our love can be enriched more and more. This is what Swedenborg taught. There will be no sharp break between life here and life hereafter. What we start here continues in quality and expands infinitely. The ever living God creates each of us to have fellowship with Him forever."&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;[[Young Oon Kim|Kim Young-oon]], 1980, ''Unification Theology'', Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funeral Ceremony====
The seungwha ceremony was introduced by Sun Myung Moon in 1984, at the time of the death of his son [[Heung Jin Moon]]. Members who had died prior to this were given traditional Christian funerals. When the new and more distinct format was ordained, the official church newspaper reported:
:"The use of the Chinese character meaning 'Seung Hwa' is new and unique to this ceremony and is not commonly used. The character for 'seung' means 'ascending, elevation'. The character 'hwa' has meanings of 'harmony and peace.' The use of 'seung hwa' was first instructed by Father at this time."&lt;ref name ="Kwak"/&gt;

The ceremony itself consists of three parts: The Gwi Hwan Ceremony (or "returning to joy"), a farewell prayer service held by family members and close friends; the Seung Hwa Ceremony, (or "ascension and harmony"), a public ceremony celebrating the person's life featuring songs, testimonies, and an address most often by a church pastor; and the Won Jeun Ceremony (or "returning home/to the palace"), the burial service.  It is emphasized that the ceremony should have a joyful atmosphere since it is a celebration of the person's life and his or her transition to the spirit world.  White and light colored clothing, rather than the traditional black, is worn by participants.&lt;ref name ="Kwak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Selig"/&gt;

The body is buried in the person's holy robe, with a copy of the ''Divine Principle'', and the coffin draped with the Unification flag.&lt;ref&gt;The Advent of Sun Myung Moon: The Origins, Beliefs and Practices of the Unification Church,  [[George Chryssides]], Springer, Apr 5, 1991, 247 pages, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cremation]] is discouraged in the Unification movement, although it is sometimes practiced especially in [[Japan]] where it is required by law. Unification [[cemeteries]], or sections of existing facilities, have been established in [[South Korea]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Selig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, Mark, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people_and_places/religion_and_ethics/newsid_8875000/8875076.stm Moonies burial site to go ahead],

===Blessing ceremony and views on sex and family===
{{Main|Blessing ceremony of the Unification Church}}
[[File:TPblessing ceremony.jpg|thumb|250px|Rev. and Mrs. Moon preside over a mass blessing ceremony in 2010]]
The Unification movement is well known for its wedding or wedding vow renewal ceremony. It is given to engaged or married couples. Through it, members believe, the couple is removed from the lineage of sinful humanity and engrafted into God's sinless lineage. The Blessing ceremony was first held in 1961 for 36 couples in Seoul, South Korea by the Moons shortly after their own marriage in 1960. All the couples were members of the church. Rev. Moon matched all of the couples except 12 who were already married to each other before joining the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dci.dk/?artikel=388 |title=Duddy, Neil ''Interview: Dr. Mose Durst'' |access-date=2007-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015615/http://www.dci.dk/?artikel=388 |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moon's practice of matching couples was very unusual in both Christian tradition and in modern Western culture and attracted much attention and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The men and women entered a large room, where Moon began matching couples by pointing at them."[http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/sides-moon-marriages-article-1.267920 NY Daily News]  "In the Unification tradition, romantic liaisons are forbidden until the members are deemed by Mr. Moon to be spiritually ready to be matched at a huge gathering where he points future spouses out to one another. His followers believe that his decisions are based on his ability to discern their suitability and see their future descendants. Many are matched with people of other races and nationalities, in keeping with Mr. Moon's ideal of unifying all races and nations in the Unification Church.  Though some couples are matched immediately before the mass wedding ceremonies, which are held every two or three years, most have long engagements during which they are typically posted in different cities or even continents, and get to know one another through letters."[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/nyregion/look-life-after-mass-marriage-for-2075-couples-give-take-200-10-years-together.html?pagewanted=all The New York Times] "Many were personally matched by Moon, who taught that romantic love led to sexual promiscuity, mismatched couples and dysfunctional societies. Moon's preference for cross-cultural marriages also meant that couples often shared no common language."[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/moonies-mass-wedding-south-korea-unification-church-hak-ja-han-sun-myung-moon Manchester Guardian]  "Moon's death Sept. 2 and funeral Saturday signaled the end of the random pairings that helped make Moon's Unification Church famous — and infamous — a generation ago."

It led to some strange pairs such as a 71-year-old African Catholic archbishop who wed a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist. In 1988 Moon entered the Guinness Book of Records when he married 6,516 identically dressed couples at Seoul's Olympic Stadium. Moonie newly-weds were forbidden to sleep together for 40 days to prove their marriage was on a higher plane. They then had to consummate their marriage in a three-day ritual with the sexual positions stipulated by their leader."[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-the-sinister-moonie-cult-how-1301689 Daily Mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Blessing ceremonies were larger in scale but followed the same pattern. All participants were HSA-UWC members and Moon matched most of the couples. In 1982 the first large scale Blessing (of 2,000 couples) outside of Korea took place in Madison Square Garden, New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/01/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-wedding-day-for-4000.html |work=The New York Times |title=NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Wedding Day for 4,000 |date=July 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Moon matched 2,500 Korean members with Japanese members for a Blessing ceremony held in Korea, partly in order to promote unity between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=3&amp;news=2&amp;newspaper=39 Marriage by the numbers; Moon presides as 6,500 couples wed in S.

Mary Farrell Bednarowski says that marriage is "really the only [[sacrament]]" in the Unification movement. Unificationists therefore view singleness as "not a state to be sought or cultivated" but as preparation for marriage.  Pre-marital celibacy and marital faithfulness are emphasized.&lt;ref name=nrti&gt;{{cite book|last=Bednarowski|first=Mary Farrell|title=New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America|isbn=0-253-20952-8|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=1995|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gx42u7cGkYQC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22unification+church%22+sexuality&amp;output=html|accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents may be taught to "abstain from intimate relations for a specified time after marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Religious Movements in the Twenty-first Century|page=320|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WW-XcDe-IMEC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=%22unification+church%22+sexuality&amp;output=html|accessdate=28 December 2008|last=Lucas|first=Phillip Charles|author2=Thomas Robbins |year=2004|isbn=0-415-96577-2|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The church does not give its marriage blessing to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml Unification Church pres sees smaller mass weddings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322013906/http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml |date=2009-03-22 }}, [[The Monitor (Uganda)]], 30 December 2008, "Moon said the church does not give its wedding blessing to same sex couples.”&lt;/ref&gt;  
Moon has emphasized the similarity between Unification views of sexuality and evangelical Christianity, "reaching out to conservative Christians in this country in the last few years by emphasizing shared goals like support for sexual abstinence outside of marriage, and opposition to homosexuality."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=35,000 Couples Are Invited To a Blessing by Rev.

===Esotericism===
The Unification movement is sometimes said to be [[esotericism|esoteric]] in that it keeps some of its doctrines secret from nonmembers,&lt;ref&gt;Evangelical-Unification Dialogue (Conference series – Unification Theological Seminary; no. 3) Richard Quebedeaux, Rodney Sawatsky, Paragon House, 1979, {{ISBN|093289402X}}, pages 77-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Sontag]],1977, ''Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church'', [[Abingdon Press]], {{ISBN|0687406226}}, page 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Louis Horowitz]], 1978, ''Science, Sin, and Scholarship: The Politics of Reverend Moon and the Unification Church'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0262081008}}, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; a practice that is sometimes called "heavenly deception."&lt;ref&gt;''The A to Z of New Religious Movements'', George D. Chryssides
Scarecrow Press, 2006, page 155&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, critics Tingle and Fordyce commented: "How different the openness of Christianity is to the attitude of Reverend Moon and his followers who are often reluctant to reveal to the public many of their basic doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;Tingle, D. and Fordyce, R. 1979, The Phases and Faces of the Moon: A Critical Examination of the Unification Church and Its Principles, Hicksville, New York: Exposition Press {{ISBN|0682492647}}, p20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, many Unification texts that were formerly regarded as esoteric have been posted on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification's official websites.&lt;ref&gt;George D.

==Scholarly studies==
In the early 1960s [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with HSA-UWC [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American members and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships. Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled "The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes", and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

He added that he did not want to be considered an [[apologist]] but a close look at HSA-UWC's [[theology]] is important: "They raise some incredibly interesting issues."&lt;ref name="Moon: an objective look at his theology"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Se4PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OI0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7264,3898196&amp;dq=frederick-sontag Moon: an objective look at his theology], ''[[Boca Raton News]]'', 1977-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

People were free to leave, and leave they did. Barker's extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to be Moonie's most effective means of “brainwashing”), fewer than 25% joined the group formore than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later. With failure rates exceeding 99.5%, it comes as no surprise that full-time Moonie membership in the U.S. never exceeded a few thousand. And this was one of the most New Religious Movements of the era!"&lt;/ref&gt; Australian psychologist Len Oakes and British psychiatry professor [[Anthony Storr]], who have written rather critically about [[cult]]s, [[guru]]s, [[new religious movement]]s, and their leaders have praised ''The Making of a Moonie''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Len "By far the best study of the conversion process is Eileen Barker's The Making of a Moonie [...]" from ''Prophetic Charisma: The Psychology of Revolutionary Religious Personalities'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-8156-0398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Storr, Anthony Dr. ''Feet of clay: a study of gurus'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-684-83495-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given the Distinguished Book Award for 1985 by the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssrweb.org/PastWinners.cfm Past Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nkN0WHJc?url=http://www.sssrweb.org/PastWinners.cfm |date=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, scholars with [[American Psychological Association]] rejected the hypotheses of those who accused [[new religious movements]] (such as the HSA-UWC) of brainwashing and [[coercive persuasion]], stating that those "conclusions...cannot be said to be scientific in any meaningful sense".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/molko_brief.htm APA Brief in the Molko Case], from CESNUR website, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 [[Irving Louis Horowitz]], sociologist, questioned the relationship between the HSA-UWC and scholars whom it paid to conduct research on its behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=Stephen|author2=Theresa Krebs |title=Academic Compromise in the Social Scientific Study of Alternative Religions|journal=Nova Religio|year=1998|volume=2|issue=1|pages=44–54|doi=10.1525/nr.1998.2.1.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations and differences with other religions==

===Judaism===

The relationship between the Unification movement and [[Judaism]] has been marked by controversy. In 1976 the [[American Jewish Committee]] released a report by Rabbi A. James Rudin  which stated that ''Divine Principle'' contained "pejorative language, stereotyped imagery, and accusations of [[collective guilt|collective sin and guilt]]."&lt;ref name=Rudin&gt;Rudin, A. James, 1978 [http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/7A46.PDF A View of the Unification Church], [[American Jewish Committee]] Archives&lt;/ref&gt; In a news conference presented by the AJC and representatives of Catholic and Protestant churches, panelists stated that the text "contained over 125 anti-Jewish references." They noted Moon's public then-recent condemnation of "antisemitic and anti-Christian attitudes", and called upon him to make a "comprehensive and systematic removal" of antisemitic and anti-Christian references in the ''Divine Principle'' as a demonstration of good faith.&lt;ref name="ajcarchives.org"&gt;[http://www.ajcarchives.org/ajc_data/files/7a37.pdf Sun Myung Moon Is Criticized by Religious Leaders; Jewish Patrons Enraged], David F. White, ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 29, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the HSA-UWC issued a rebuttal to the report, stating that it was neither comprehensive nor reconciliatory, but rather had a "hateful tone" and was filled with "sweeping denunciations." It denied that the ''Divine Principle'' teaches antisemitism and gave detailed responses to 17 specific allegations contained in the AJC's report, stating that allegations were distortions of teaching and obscuration of real passage content or that the passages were accurate summaries of Jewish scripture or New Testament passages.&lt;ref name="Response to A. James Rudin's Report"&gt;[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/7A44.PDF Response to A. James Rudin's Report], Unification Church Department of Public Affairs, Daniel C. Holdgeiwe, Johnny Sonneborn, March 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Mose Durst]], then the president of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] and himself a convert from Judaism,&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"&gt;{{cite news | title =Religion: Sun Myung Moon's Goodwill Blitz | work =[[Time Magazine]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966889,00.html | date =April 22, 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the Jewish community had been "hateful" in its response to the growth of the Unification movement, and placed blame both on the community's "insecurity" and on Unification Church members' "youthful zeal and ignorance."  Rudin, then the national interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee, said that Durst's remarks were inaccurate and unfair and that "hateful is a harsh word to use."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Unification Church seen as persecuted", ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', September 15, 1984, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;   In the same year Durst wrote in his [[autobiography]]: "Our relations with the Jewish community have been the most painful to me personally. I say this with a heavy heart, since I was raised in the Jewish faith and am proud of my heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/library/unification/books/tbns/TBNS-09.htm To Bigotry, No Sanction], Mose Durst, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 movement leaders Peter Ross and [[Andrew Wilson (academic)|Andrew Wilson]] issued "Guidelines for Members of The Unification Church in Relations with the Jewish People" which stated: "In the past there have been serious misunderstandings between Judaism and the Unification Church. In order to clarify these difficulties and guide Unification Church members in their relations with Jews, the Unification Church suggests the following guidelines."&lt;ref name="tparents.org"&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Publications/Other-Pub/Uc-jewsh.htm Guidelines for Members of The Unification Church in Relations with the Jewish People], Peter Ross and Andrew Wilson, March 15, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream Christianity===

The relationship between the Unification movement and mainstream Christianity has been marked by conflict and disagreement, as well as by cooperation at times.

From its beginning the Unification movement has claimed to be Christian and has tried to promote its teachings to mainstream Christian churches and organizations.  The Unification Church in South Korea was labeled as [[Heresy|heretical]] by Protestant churches in South Korea, including Moon's own [[Presbyterian Church]]. In the United States the church was rejected by ecumenical organizations as being non-Christian. The main objections against it were theological, especially because of the Unification Church's addition of material to the [[Bible]] and for its rejection of a literal [[Second Coming]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name="chryssides2003"&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2003/vil2003_chryssides.htm Unifying or Dividing?

The ''Divine Principle'' includes new interpretations of the Bible not found in [[mainstream Christian]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Google books listing"/&gt; From its beginning, the Unification movement claimed to be Christian and promoted its teachings to mainstream Christian churches and organizations. The HSA-UWC in Korea was labeled as [[heresy|heretical]] by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in South Korea, including Moon's own Presbyterian Church.

Protestant Christian commentators have also criticized Unification teachings as contrary to the Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola fide]]''.&lt;ref name="Daske, D 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, J. 1995, ''Unification Church'', Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Press, {{ISBN|0-310-70381-6}} p40&lt;/ref&gt; In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of [[Christology]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the movement's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ralston Martin, Ravi K.

In 1974 Moon founded the [[Unification Theological Seminary]], in [[Barrytown, New York]], partly in order to improve relations of the movement with other churches.  Professors from other denominations, including a [[Methodist]] minister, a [[Presbyterian]], and a [[Catholic priest|Roman Catholic priest]], as well as a [[rabbi]], were hired to teach religious studies to the students, who were being trained as leaders in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, J.

The Unification Theological Seminary
:a. The Unification Church has a seminary in Barrytown, New York called The Unification Theological Seminary.
:b. It is used as a theological training center, where members are prepared to be leaders and theologians in the church.
:c. Since many people regard Moon as a cult leader, there is a false impression that this seminary is academically weak.

Moon's seminary, however, has not only attracted a respectable faculty (many of whom are not members of his church), but it also has graduated many students (who are members of his church) who have been accepted into doctoral programs at institutions such as Harvard and Yale."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1978/v35-2-article3.htm Korean Moon: Waxing or Waning] Leo Sandon Jr. ''Theology Today'', July 1978, "The Unification Church purchased the estate and now administers a growing seminary where approximately 110 Moonies engage in a two-year curriculum which includes biblical studies, church history, philosophy, theology, religious education, and which leads to a Master of Religious Education degree."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1978/v35-1-criticscorner3.htm Dialogue with the Moonies] Rodney Sawatsky, ''Theology Today'', April 1978.

In 1977, Unification member [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]], who later became well known as the author of the popular [[Intelligent Design]] book ''[[Icons of Evolution]]'', defended Unification theology against what he said were unfair criticisms by the [[National Council of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Talks/Antal/Antal_nccc.htm New Hope for Dialogue with National Council of Churches of Christ], Chris Antal, February, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; That same year [[Frederick Sontag]], a professor of philosophy at [[Pomona College]] and a minister in the [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-frederick-sontag20-2009jun20,0,6245632.story Frederick E.

In 1982, Moon was imprisoned in the [[United States]] after being found guilty by a jury of willfully filing false Federal [[income tax]] returns and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. (See: [[United States vs. Sun Myung Moon]])  HSA-UWC members launched a public-relations campaign. Booklets, letters and videotapes were mailed to approximately 300,000 Christian leaders in the United States. Many of them signed petitions protesting the government's case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-6-35.0.html  The Unification Church Aims a Major Public Relations Effort at Christian Leaders] [[Christianity Today]] April 19, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the American Christian leaders who spoke out in defense of Moon were conservative [[Jerry Falwell]], head of [[Moral Majority]], and liberal [[Joseph Lowery]], head of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]].&lt;ref name="signaturebooks.com"/&gt; The [[American Baptist Church|American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A]], the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus]], and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference filed briefs in support of Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Raspberry, William, "Did Unpopular Moonie Get a Fair Trial?", ''[[The Washington Post]]'',  April 19, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s the Unification movement sent thousands of American ministers from other churches on trips to Japan and South Korea to inform them about Unification teachings. At least one minister was dismissed by his congregation for taking part.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/25/us/clear-lake-journal-congregation-dismisses-its-minister-over-trip.html Clear Lake Journal; Congregation Dismisses Its Minister Over Trip], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 25, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994 the church had about 5,000 members in Russia and came under criticism from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="A Less Secular Approach"/&gt;  In 1997, the Russian government passed a law requiring the movement and other non-Russian religions to register their congregations and submit to tight controls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080208.wsects08/BNStory/International/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20080208.wsects08 Russian unorthodox] [[The Globe and Mail]] February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the Unification movement related organization the [[Women's Federation for World Peace]] indirectly contributed $3.5 million to help Baptist [[Liberty University]] which at that time was in financial difficulty. This was reported in the United States news media as an example of closer relationships between the movement and conservative Christian congregations.&lt;ref name="Washington Post-flux"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/main.htm|title=A Church in Flux Is Flush With Cash|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 23, 1997|first= Marc|last= Fisher|accessdate = 2007-11-14}} "Also in 1995, the Women's Federation made another donation that illustrates how Moon supports fellow conservatives. It gave a $3.5 million grant to the [[Christian Heritage Foundation]], which later bought a large portion of Liberty University's debt, rescuing the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Lynchburg, Va., religious school from the brink of bankruptcy."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Unification movement came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church when Catholic archbishop [[Emmanuel Milingo]] and Maria Sung, a 43-year-old [[Korea]]n acupuncturist, married in a [[Blessing ceremony]], presided over by Rev. and Mrs. Moon. Following his marriage the Archbishop was called to the Vatican by [[Pope John Paul II]], where he was asked not to see his wife anymore, and to move to a Capuchin monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2001/moon_july25.htm Archbishop rejects Vatican ultimatum]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sung went on a hunger strike to protest their separation.

The campaign was begun in the belief that the cross is a reminder of Jesus' pain and has been a source of division between people of different faiths. The campaign included a burial ceremony for the cross and a crown to be put in its place. The [[American Clergy Leadership Conference]] (ACLC), an interfaith group founded by Moon, spearheaded the effort, calling the cross a symbol of oppression and superiority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050421164204/http://www.familyfed.org/board/uboard.asp?id=ffwpu_news&amp;skin=board_urim_simple&amp;color=eng&amp;page=42&amp;u_no=185 Rome and Israel Pilgrim Tour – Burying of the Cross].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
The relationship between the Unification movement and [[Islam]] has often been noted, both by scholars and the news media. The ''Divine Principle'' lists the [[Muslim world]] as one of the world's four major divisions (the others being [[East Asia]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Christendom]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.net/dp96/dp96-1-3.html#Chap3 Exposition of the Divine Principle 1996 Translation Chapter 3 Eschatology and Human History], accessed September 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, [[Louis Farrakhan]], the leader of the [[Nation of Islam]], a [[Islam in the United States|Black Muslim]] organization, served as a coofficiator at a Blessing Ceremony presided over by Moon and Han.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/moon_1199.htm From the Unification Church to the Unification Movement, 1994–1999: Five Years of Dramatic Changes] Massimo Introvigne, [[Center for Studies on New Religions]] "The ceremony in Washington, D.C., included six "co-officiators" from other faiths, including controversial minister Louis Farrakhan from the Nation of Islam. The Blessing ceremony in Seoul on February 7, 1999 also featured seven co-officiators including Orthodox Rabbi Virgil Kranz (Chairman of the American Jewish Assembly), controversial Catholic Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo and the General Superintendent of the Church of God in Christ (a large African American Pentecostal denomination), Rev. T.L. Barrett."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the Church and the Nation of Islam co-sponsored the [[Million Family March]], a rally in Washington, D.C., to celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Unification movement support for [[Islamist]] [[anti-communists]] came to public attention in 1987 when church member [[Lee Shapiro]] was killed in [[Afghanistan]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] while filming a documentary.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_n2132_v88/ai_6536321/pg_29 Afghanistan: eight years of Soviet occupation], [[United States Department of State]], March 1988, The campaign to target foreign journalists had more tragic results. Two American filmmakers, Lee Shapiro and Jim Lindelof, were apparently killed by a regime attack while traveling with the mujahidin. In 1986, Lindelof had been named paramedic of the year for his efforts training Afghan medical workers. In response to protests, Kabul stated it could not "guarantee the security of foreign subjects" who enter illegally, whose presence it views as "evidence" of "external interference."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 Americans killed in ambush"&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=glp&amp;search=lee%20shapiro%20afghanistan&amp;img=\\na0041\6800035\56050638_clean.html 2 Americans killed in ambush], ''Pacific Stars and Stripes'', October 29, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance group they were traveling with reported that they had been ambushed by military forces of the [[Soviet Union]] or the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan government]]. However, the details have been questioned, partly because of the poor reputation of the group's leader, [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1987/1028/oed.html Two US journalists reported killed in Afghanistan; details murky], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', October 28, 1987 "Two American journalists are believed dead in northwest Afghanistan, diplomatic and resistance forces say here. Filmmaker Lee Shapiro and his soundman, Jim Lindalos, both of New York, were killed Oct. 11, reportedly in a Soviet or Afghan government ambush, according to United States consular officials. However, the resistance group that accompanied the film team has a poor reputation among most informed observers, and doubts have arisen over whether the two Americans did indeed die in an Afghan government or Soviet attack."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert, ''Soldiers of God : With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan,'' New York : Vintage Departures, 2001, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'' (which is critical of United States and Israeli policies), praised the Unification movement owned newspaper, ''[[The Washington Times]]''  and the ''Times''{{'}} sister publication ''[[News World Communications|The Middle East Times]]'' (along with ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' owned by the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]]) for their objective and informative coverage of Islam and the [[Middle East]], while criticizing the ''Times'' generally pro-Israel editorial policy.  The ''Report'' suggested that these newspapers, being owned by religious organizations, were less influenced by pro-Israel pressure groups in the United States.&lt;ref name="wrmea.com"/&gt;

In 1997, [[Louis Farrakhan]], the leader of [[The Nation of Islam]], served as  a "co-officiator" at a [[Blessing ceremony of the Unification Church|blessing ceremony]] presided over by [[Sun Myung Moon]] and Hak Ja Han.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/moon_1199.htm From the Unification Church to the Unification Movement, 1994-1999: Five Years of Dramatic Changes] Massimo Introvigne, [[Center for Studies on New Religions]] "The ceremony in Washington, D.C., included six "co-officiators" from other faiths, including controversial minister Louis Farrakhan from the Nation of Islam.

==Political activism==
In the 1940s, Moon cooperated with [[Communist Party]] members in the [[Korean independence movement]] against [[Imperial Japan]]. However, after the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), he became an outspoken anti-communist.&lt;ref name="moon-peace"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moon |first=Sun Myung |title=As a Peace-Loving Global Citizen |publisher=Gimm-Young Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=0-7166-0299-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he founded the [[Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation]], a [[public diplomacy]] agency which promoted the interests of South Korea and sponsored Radio Free Asia. Former [[U.S. President]]s [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and [[Richard Nixon]] were honorary presidents or directors at various times.&lt;ref name="Korean denies influence peddling"&gt;{{cite web|title=Korean denies influence peddling|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19761102&amp;id=y6kzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yjgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3422,903462|publisher=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Moon predicted the decline of [[communism]], based on the teachings of the ''[[Divine Principle]]'': "After 7,000 biblical years—6,000 years of restoration history plus the millennium, the time of completion—communism will fall in its 70th year. Here is the meaning of the year 1978. Communism, begun in 1917, could maintain itself approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the border line and afterward communism will decline; in the 70th year it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore, now is the time for people who are studying communism to abandon it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Books/sm-gww/GWW-07.htm The Way of Restoration], (April, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he called for an "automatic theocracy" to replace communism and solve "every political and economic situation in every field."&lt;ref&gt;''Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church'', [[Frederick Sontag]], [[Abingdon Press]], Jan 1, 1977, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Moon asked members in the [[United States]] to support President [[Richard Nixon]] during the [[Watergate scandal]] when Nixon was being pressured to resign his office. They prayed and fasted in support of Nixon for three days in front of the [[United States Capitol]], under the motto: "Forgive, Love and Unite." On February 1, 1974, Nixon publicly thanked them for their support and officially received Moon. This brought the movement into widespread public and media attention.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, Massimo, 2000, ''The Unification Church Studies in Contemporary Religion'', Signature Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}}, [http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm excerpt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030429161208/http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm |date=2003-04-29 }} page 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, church president [[Neil Albert Salonen]] met with Senator [[Bob Dole]] to defend the HSA–UWC against charges made by its critics, including parents of some members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7hIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cOUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3636,2969007&amp;hl=en Dole meeting with Moon aide called cordial], ''Lawrence Journal-World'', February 24, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Moon established [[News World Communications]], an international news media conglomerate which publishes ''[[The Washington Times]]'' newspaper in [[Washington D.C.]] and newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America, partly in order to promote political [[conservatism]]. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "...the ''Times'' was established by Moon to combat [[communism]] and be a conservative alternative to what he perceived as the liberal bias of The Washington Post."&lt;ref name="Washington Post-ghosts"&gt;{{cite news |first= Frank|last=Ahrens |title=Moon Speech Raises Old Ghosts as the Times Turns 20|date= May 23, 2002|work=Washington Post |url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A60061-2002May22 |pages = |accessdate = 2009-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bo Hi Pak]], called Moon's "right-hand man", was the founding president and the founding chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="Washington Times Corporation 1992"&gt;Pak was founding president of the Washington Times Corporation (1982-1992), and founding chairman of the board.

In 1977, the [[Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations]], of the [[United States House of Representatives]], found that the [[South Korea]]n intelligence agency, the [[KCIA]], had used the movement to gain political influence with the United States and that some members had worked as volunteers in Congressional offices. Together they founded the Korean Cultural Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization which acted as a [[public diplomacy]] campaign for the [[Republic of Korea]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AabywLOknbsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=fraser+kcia#v=onepage&amp;q=fraser%20kcia&amp;f=false Spiritual warfare: the politics of the Christian right], [[Sara Diamond]], 1989, [[Pluto Press]], Page 58&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on the Unification Church's campaign in support of Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f7ITAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6935,979096&amp;dq=fraser+korea Ex-aide of Moon Faces Citation for Contempt], [[Associated Press]], ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'', August 5, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, members founded [[CAUSA International]], an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] educational organization based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;"Moon's 'Cause' Takes Aim At Communism in Americas." ''[[The Washington Post]]''. August 28, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, it was active in 21 countries.

"Another church political arm, Causa International, which preaches a philosophy it calls "God-ism," has been spending millions of dollars on expense-paid seminars and conferences for Senate staffers, Hispanic Americans and conservative activists. It also has contributed $500,000 to finance an anticommunist lobbying campaign headed by John T. (Terry) Dolan, chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC)."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, CAUSA International sponsored the documentary film ''[[Nicaragua Was Our Home]]'', about the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] Indians of [[Nicaragua]] and their persecution at the hands of the Nicaraguan government. It was filmed and produced by USA-UWC member [[Lee Shapiro]], who later died while filming with anti-Soviet forces during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5D9173BF93AA15754C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print New York Times review.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/3245 How to Read the Reagan Administration: The Miskito Case]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1555 Public TV Tilts Toward Conservatives], [[Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40717F738590C7B8EDDA90994DF484D81 2 Americans Reported Killed In an Ambush in Afghanistan] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1987-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, some American members joined a public protest against the [[Soviet Union]] over its shooting down of [[Korean Airlines Flight 007]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/29/PK2812ETF2.DTL] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', September 3, 1983 "For a second day, the Soviet Consulate in Pacific Heights was the scene of emotional protests against the shooting down of a Korean Air Lines jumbo jet. About 300 people held demonstration yesterday morning. Among them were members of the Unification Church, or "Moonies," whose founder is the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the controversial South Korean who has melded a fierce anti-communism into his ideology. Eldridge Cleaver, the onetime black radical who recently has had ties with the Moonies, spoke at the rally. Many pickets carried signs accusing the Soviet Union of murdering the 269 passengers and crew aboard the airliner. In another development, San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli filed a $109 billion lawsuit against the Soviet Union on behalf of the 269 victims."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the HSA–UWC founded the Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy, a [[Washington D.C.]] [[think tank]] that underwrites conservative-oriented research and seminars at [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Chicago]], and other institutions.&lt;ref name="Church Spends Millions On Its Image"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/image.htm Church Spends Millions On Its Image], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 1984-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, member [[Dan Fefferman]] founded the International Coalition for Religious Freedom in [[Virginia]], which is active in protesting what it considers to be threats to [[religious freedom]] by governmental agencies.&lt;ref name="Ribadeneira-ire"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ribadeneira |first=Diego |title=Ire at school Star of David ruling unites ACLU, Pat Robertson |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=B2 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=August 21, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1985, seven years before the [[fall of Soviet Union]], the [[Professors World Peace Academy]], an organization founded by Moon, sponsored a conference in [[Geneva]] to debate the theme "The situation in the world after the fall of the communist empire."&lt;ref name="goliath.ecnext.com"&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-14440148/Projections-about-a-post-Soviet.html Projections about a post-Soviet world-twenty-five years later.] // Goliath Business News&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1990, Moon visited the [[Soviet Union]] and met with President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Moon expressed support for the political and economic transformations underway in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the movement was expanding into formerly communist nations.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D61F39F937A25752C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 EVOLUTION IN EUROPE; New Flock for Moon Church: The Changing Soviet Student] from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he met with [[Kim Il Sung]], the North Korean President, to discuss ways to achieve peace on the [[Korean peninsula]], as well as on [[international relations]], tourism, and other topics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/world/asia/15moon.html At Time of Change for Rev.

Whether or not Netanyahu is personally acquainted with Moon is unclear, though there is no doubt that he has established close friendships with several staff members on The Washington Times, whose editorial policy is rabidly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and pro-Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the former U.S. President [[George H. W.

In 2000, Moon founded the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (WANGO), which describes itself as "a global organization whose mission is to serve its member organizations, strengthen and encourage the non-governmental sector as a whole, increase public understanding of the non-governmental community, and provide the mechanism and support needed for [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]] to connect, partner, and multiply their contributions to solve humanity's basic problems."

In 2003, Korean FFWPU members started a [[political party]] in [[South Korea]]. It was named "The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home." In an inauguration declaration, the new party said it would focus on preparing for the [[Korean reunification|reunification]] of South and [[North Korea]] by educating the public about God and peace. A church official said that similar political parties would be started in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="iol.co.za"/&gt;

====Women's Federation for World Peace====
[[File:Wfwpmark.gif|thumb|right|200px|WFWP logo]]
The [[Women's Federation for World Peace]] was founded in 1992 by Hak Ja Han.  Its stated purpose is to encourage women to work more actively in promoting peace in their communities and greater society. It has members in 143 countries.&lt;ref name="kansas"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  | title =Moon's wife to speak in Lawrence  | work =[[The Kansas City Star]]  | page =E10  | publisher =The Kansas City Star Co.  | date =June 19, 1993  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eventworks"&gt;{{cite news | last =Cuda  | first =Amanda  | title =Event works for understanding through friendships  | work =[[Connecticut Post]]  | page =Section: Womanwise  | date =December 28, 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wifetospeak"&gt;{{cite news  |  last =Peterson  | first =Thair    | title =Bridging the Interracial Gap  | work =[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]  | page =A3  | date =March 21, 1998  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Han has traveled the world speaking at conventions on the WFWP's behalf.&lt;ref name="bainbridge"&gt;{{cite book | last =Bainbridge  | first =William Sims   | authorlink =William Sims Bainbridge  | title =The Sociology of Religious Movements | publisher =Routledge | year =1997  | pages =203–205  | isbn = 0-415-91202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 the WFWP held a conference in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] at which the keynote speaker was former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Dan Quayle]]'s wife [[Marilyn Tucker Quayle]], and in a speech at the event Han spoke positively of Mrs. Quayle's humanitarian work.&lt;ref name="shupe 2"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Shupe  | first =Anson D.   |author2=Bronislaw Misztal   | title =Religion, mobilization, and social action  | publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group  | year =1998  | pages =211, 213  | isbn =0-275-95625-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Han traveled to 20 cities in the United States promoting the WFWP,&lt;ref name="bonham" /&gt; as well as to 12 countries.&lt;ref name="kansas" /&gt; At an event in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] she told attendants: "If a family is not centered on God's ideal of love, there will be conflict among the members of that family. Without God's love as an absolute center, such a family will ultimately break down. A nation of such families will also decline."&lt;ref name="bonham"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Bonham  | first =Nicole A.   | title =Moon's Wife Urges Utah Women To Unite Family Against Corruption  | work =[[The Deseret News]]  | page =A8  | publisher =Deseret News Publishing Company  | date =June 5, 1993   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1993 speeches in the United States focused on increasing violence in the U.S., and the degradation of the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Graham  | first =Jennifer  | title =Rev.

In 1995 the WFWP generated controversy when it indirectly contributed $3.5 million to help [[Liberty University]], which at that time was in financial difficulty. This was reported in the United States news media as an example of closer relationships between the Unification Church and conservative Christian congregations.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 1997"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/main.htm|title=A Church in Flux Is Flush With Cash|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 23, 1997|first= Marc |last= Fisher|accessdate = 2007-11-14}} "Also in 1995, the Women's Federation made another donation that illustrates how Moon supports fellow conservatives. It gave a $3.5 million grant to the [[Christian Heritage Foundation]], which later bought a large portion of Liberty University's debt, rescuing the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Lynchburg, Va., religious school from the brink of bankruptcy."&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year former United States president [[George H. W. Bush]] spoke at several WFWP meetings in Japan,&lt;ref name="bouza" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff  | title = Moon Brings Message of Family Love - Touring Evangelist Sees Cure For World Problems  | work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date = September 19, 1995  | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1995/9509190030.asp  | accessdate =2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and at a related conference in [[Washington D.C.]]. There he was quoted by ''The New York Times'' as saying: "If as president I could have done one thing to have helped the country more it would have been to do a better job in finding a way, either through speaking out or through raising a moral standard, to strengthen the American family."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/15/style/chronicle-770195.html Chronicle], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in Japan drew protests from Japanese people who were wary of unorthodox religious groups. Bush's spokesperson Jane Becker stated "We were satisfied that there was not a connection with the Unification Church, and based on the information we were given we felt comfortable speaking to this group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Sullivan  | first =Kevin    |author2=Mary Jordan   | title =Moon Group Paying Bush For Speeches - Foes of Church Criticize Japan Tour  | work =[[The Washington Post]]  | page =A25  | publisher =[[The Washington Post Company]]  | date =September 6, 1995  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  50,000 people attended Bush's speech in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Goldsmith | first =Steven | title =Moon Brings Message of Family Love - Touring Evangelist Sees Cure For World Problems | work =[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | page =B1 | date =September 19, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the talks was "[[family values]]".&lt;ref name="bouza"&gt;{{cite book | last =Bouza | first =Tony | authorlink =Tony Bouza | title =The Decline And Fall Of The American Empire: Corruption, Decadence, And The American Dream | publisher = | page =187 | isbn =0-306-45407-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the half-hour speech, Bush said "what really counts is faith, family and friends".

In 1999 the WFWP sponsored a conference in [[Malaysia]] in which religious and government leaders spoke on the need to strengthen education and support families, as well as the need for peace and understanding between ethnic and racial groups in the nations.&lt;ref&gt;"Catering to Emerging Needs of Families", ''[[New Straits Times]]'', 1999-4-16&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 it co-sponsored, along with the Unification  Church affiliated organization the Universal Peace Federation and the government of [[Taiwan]], a conference in [[Taipei]] calling for Taiwan's greater participation in world affairs independent of the [[People's Republic of China]].

====Service for Peace====
''Service For Peace (SFP)'' is a non-profit organization, founded in 2002 by the [[Unification Church]] leader [[Sun Myung Moon]], to give opportunities to young people who wish to better themselves and their communities. As of April 2007, the organization had established chapters in North America, Central America, Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania. SFP is active in communities and statewide. Colleges have recruited Service for Peace Campus Corps to benefit their fellow peers as well as the communities around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our history |url=http://www.serviceforpeace.org/index.php/2013-09-24-15-50-07/2013-09-24-15-53-42|website=Service For Peace|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wetzstein |first1=Cheryl|title=Rev.

The '''World United Formosans for Independence''' ({{zh|t=臺灣獨立建國聯盟}}), also known as '''WUFI''', is an organization promoting [[Taiwan independence]].  It was established in 1970 by like-minded organizations in [[Canada]], the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Japan]], [[Europe]], and [[Taiwan]].  Its aim is to establish a Republic of Taiwan.

Pro-independence activist [[Ng Chiau-tong]], who served as the Chairman of the WUFI from 1995 until 2011, died in office from complications of surgery on 17 November 2011.&lt;ref name=taipeitimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Wang |title=Pioneer of Taiwan independence dies |url=http://taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/11/18/2003518581|work=[[Taipei Times]] |date=2011-11-18 |accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
