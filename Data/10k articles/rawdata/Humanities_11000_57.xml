      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2373">''' Agnès Cabrol''' (2 July 1964 in [[Avignon]]-  January 2007 in [[Gordes]], [[Vaucluse]]) was a French Egyptologist.

She graduated from the [[Ecole du Louvre]] in 1987, having studied under [[Christiane Ziegler]], [[Claude Traunecker]], and [[Guillemette Andreu]]. After graduation from the [[University of Paris IV]], she went on an exhibition in 1991 of the Theban region of the [[New Kingdom]] of Egypt, under the direction Professor [[Nicolas Grimal]].  For the Franco-Egyptian Centre for the Study of Karnak (CFEETK), at [[Karnak]] she collected epigraphic data and made numerous archaeological observations.  She also examined the Tomb of [[Khabekhenet]] with [[Claude Traunecker]].&lt;ref name="Josephson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Jack A.|title=Offerings to the Discerning Eye: An Egyptological Medley in Honor of Jack A.

[[Robyn Adams Gillam]] notes the work that Cabrol contributed to in the understanding of the temples of the New Kingdom, and her attention to political and religious symbolism.&lt;ref name="Gillam2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillam|first=Robyn Adams|title=Performance and drama in ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nRxAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-3404-2|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabrol obtained a phD from the [[University of Lille III]] in 1995, under the direction of Professor [[Dominique Valbelle]], and joined the faculty as a lecturer.

Cabrol became an expert on [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and was the author of numerous books and papers, notably ''Amenhotep III: le Magnifique'' (2000),&lt;ref name="Mieroop2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mieroop|first=Marc Van De|title=A History of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acT0GQfclFkC&amp;pg=PA371|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=19 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5919-0|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Les voies procesionelles de Thèbes'' (2001), and ''Regards sur l'orientalisme et l'égyptologie'' (2006).

The stories describe how she defies traditional gender hierarchies and the rules and expectations for female behaviour. She drinks exorbitant amounts of liquor and dominates men who challenge her authority.

The '''Antinous Farnese''' is a specific marble sculptural representation of [[Antinous]], named after its one-time owners the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] family.  It was once displayed at the entrance to the Carracci Gallery in the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in Rome, from which it was taken to Naples to the Royal Borbonic Museum (Reale Museo Borbonico), now the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]] (a replica was put in place in the Palazzo in the 1970s).

The mission of the '''Bay Area Holocaust Oral History Project''' (BAHOHP) is to gather oral life histories of [[Holocaust survivors]], liberators, rescuers, and eyewitnesses. The project is developing and maintaining a catalogue database for public use. Their goal is to provide students,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.scu.edu/news/releases/release.cfm?month=1100&amp;story=holocaust Santa Clara University Press Releases - SCU Remembers the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; scholars,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; resource centers on the world, and the general public access to their archives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/index.htm Bay Area Holocaust Oral History Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224115831/http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/index.htm |date=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/weblinks/index.php?content=oral_history USHMM Research ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223162841/http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/weblinks/index.php?content=oral_history |date=February 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK,{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/sound-archive/ohlinks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202210205/http://www.bl.uk/collections/sound-archive/ohlinks.html |archivedate=2007-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BAHOHP seeks to counteract [[Holocaust denial]], and believes that the alarming upsurge of [[hate crimes]] and [[Toleration|intolerance]] makes the need to record these stories all the more urgent. The Oral History Project regards recorded personal testimony as a powerful [[antidote]] for Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ucsb.edu/projects/holocaust/Research/VariousPapers/MonizDeniers034.htm S. Moniz: Holocaust Denial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

BAHOHP recently merged with the [[Holocaust Center of Northern California]] (HCNC) to form a single organization under the HCNC name.  This new organization creates a central resource in Northern California for Holocaust education and remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcnc.org/oralhistory/announcement.html Holocaust Center of Northern California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The collection ==
Lani Silver and R. Ruth Linden* founded the Holocaust Media Project, predecessor of the Bay Area Holocaust Oral History Project, in 1983.  They co-directed the project until 1985. Silver was executive director from 1985 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odu.edu/webroot/orgs/IA/university_news.nsf/articles/04232004082700AM Old Dominion University News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the project has been headed by Anne Grenn Saldinger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/volnteer.htm BAHOHP: About us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226174728/http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/volnteer.htm |date=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the project has some 1700 audio and video recordings of survivors, witnesses and children of survivors.  In addition, the collection contains close to a thousand transcripts and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/archive.htm BAHOHP: About us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403045712/http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/archive.htm |date=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interviews==
BAHOHP gathers a complete life story of the interviewee, focusing on details surrounding the Holocaust. The questions will vary according to the specific experiences of each individual.  The interviewer has an advanced degree in psychology or social work and experience conducting survivor interviews.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/methods.htm BAHOHP: About us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404181951/http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/methods.htm |date=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BAHOHP keeps a copy of each tape and sends the master and a duplicate copy to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington, D.C. In addition, the interviewee is given a copy of his or her interview at the conclusion of the taping.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; R.

BAHOHP has agreed to record the memories of SPK, AK, and Warsaw Uprising veterans.

Although currently a [[Theravada]] Buddhism flourishing country, the [[Mahayana]] cult of worshipping '''Bodhisattva statues''' has existed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]]. Archaeological evidences show that [[Bodhisattva]] cult had existed as a secondary cult inferior to worship of [[Buddha]] during the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sanath Dharmabandu|title=චිත්‍ර හා මූර්ති කලාව|publisher=M.

==History==
During the middle [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]], [[Bodhisattva]] cult became very popular in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=වෙහෙරගල අව‍ලෝකිතේශ්වර බෝධිසත්ත්ව මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period, [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Buddhism]] was predominantly flourished with [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravāda]] Buddhist ideas. Later, [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] aspects were developed. In the [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, [[Bodhisattva]]s were worshipped with a major significance. During the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] it is mentioned that, [[Mahasena of Anuradhapura|King Mahāsēna]] had built Bodhisattva images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura|King Dhatusena]] (459–477 CE) had built a statue of [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nandadeva Wijesekara|title=පැරණි සිංහල ප්‍රතිමා ශිල්පය|publisher=M.

Gunasena and Company Ltd. |date=1997|chapter=සොයාගැනීම්වල ඉතිහාසය|isbn=9789553061812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several inscriptions mentioning [[Avalokitesvara]] has found from the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During 7th–10th centuries AD, [[Mahayana]] Buddhism had spread along the [[Sri Lanka]]n territory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is evidenced by many surviving Bodhisattva statues and carvings belonging to the period. It is mentioned that King [[Dappula I of Anuradhapura]] had built a 15 cubits-high [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ruhuna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This image is believed to be the recently restored [[Dambegoda Bodhisattva statue]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is an evidence for the strong Maitreya cult in ancient Sri Lanka.

[[Bhuvanaikabahu IV of Gampola|King Bhuwanekabāhu IV]] of [[Kingdom of Gampola|Gampola]] has built Maitreya and [[Natha (Buddhist deity)|Nātha]] (Avalokitesvara) statues in [[Lankatilaka Vihara]]. It is mentioned that King [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy|Kirti Sri Rajasinghe]] had built a [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ridi Viharaya]]. ''Dambulu Viahara thudapatha'', a text dated to1780 CE mentions about some Maitreya and Nātha images of the temple. These images can be seen flanking the standing Buddha near the central entrance of [[Dambulla cave temple]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types== 
Both male and female [[Bodhisattva]] images has found from [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Avalokitesvara]] images play a significant role among the statuary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also various statues of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]], the wife of Avalokitesvara has found. It is assumed that cult of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]] may have been popular in ancient Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=තාරා දෙවඟන මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of [[Maitreya]] are also common. Statues of Bodhisattvas [[Vajrapani]] and [[Manjushri]] has found in Sri Lanka.

[[Bronze]], stone and [[ivory]] has used as the medium to create Bodhisattva images.

==Examples==

The [[Veheragala Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva]], currently displayed at [[Colombo National Museum]], is considered as the finest Bodhisattva image ever found in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This [[bronze]] statue belonging to [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] is delicately designed.

A '''boilerplate clause''' is a [[legal English]] term that is used in conjunction with [[contract law]]. When forming contracts, parties to the contract often use templates or forms with boilerplate clauses ([[boilerplate text|boilerplate language]], used as standard language). Such clauses refers to the standardised clauses in contracts, and they are to be found towards the end of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Berezowski, Jak czytać i rozumieć angielskie umowy? Warsaw 2014, page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Including boilerplate clauses is the process by which parties to the contract may better define their relationship and the will to provide certainty if terms in the contract are ever disputed. Boilerplate clauses are standard contractual terms that are routinely included in many contracts.&lt;ref&gt;International Commercial Agreements: An Edinburgh Law Guide: An Edinburgh Law Guide, Michala Meiselles
Edinburgh University Press - page 336&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common clause types are listed below:

==Assignment clause== 
An assignment clause is based on prohibiting or permitting a complete transfer or rights under the contract to another party.

'''An example:'''
 Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under the Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.

The transfer may be prohibited or permitted entirely or in part. The example of permitting assignment under specified circumstances is:

'''An example:'''
The hulls and freight clauses contain a similar "assignment clause" which states that no assignment is binding unless a dated notice of assignment, signed by the assured is endorsed on the policy and the policy is produced before payment of claim or return of premium.&lt;ref&gt;Insurance Law in the United Kingdom,John Birds,Kluwer Law International, 2010 - p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Assignment (law)}}

==''Force majeure'' clause== 
A ''[[force majeure]]'' clause is designed to protect against failures to perform contractual obligations caused by unavoidable events beyond a party’s control, such as natural disasters. ''Force majeure'' clauses are primarily used to identify circumstances in which performance of contract may be forgiven&lt;ref&gt;International Commercial Agreements: A Primer on Drafting, Negotiating, and Resolving Disputes, William F. Fox
Kluwer Law International, 2009 - p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An example:'''
 GUMBER &amp; PARTNERS SOLICITORS shall in no event be responsible for any delay or failure in performance resulting from circumstances beyond its reasonable control.

{{see also|Force majeure}}

== Arbitration clause == 
A specific boilerplate clause which is stated to forgo taking any dispute that may arise to court. Parties to the contract are to refer the dispute to an arbitrator to reach out-of-court settlement.

'''An example:''' 
 In the event a dispute shall arise between the parties hereto, it is hereby agreed that the dispute shall be referred to International Chamber of Commerce and settled by three arbitrators. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding.

{{see also|Arbitration}}

== Severability clause == 
Severability clause provides that in the event of one or more provisions of the contract are determined to be unenforceable, the rest of the contract remains in force.

'''An example:''' 
 This Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If for any reason any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, then (a) such term or provision will be interpreted, construed, or reformed to the extent reasonably required to render the same valid, enforceable, and consistent with the original intent underlying such provision; (b) such term or provision will remain in effect to the extent that it is not invalid or unenforceable; and (c) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement.”

'''Ceramic art''' is art made from [[ceramic]] materials, including [[clay]]. It may take forms including [[art ware]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. Ceramic art is one of [[the arts]], particularly the [[visual arts]]. Of these, it is one of the [[plastic arts]]. While some ceramics are considered [[fine art]], as pottery or sculpture, some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]] or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects.  Ceramics may also be considered [[Artefact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]].  Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people.  In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture and decorate the art ware.  Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Pottery Manufacturers and Collectors |url=http://www.artpotterymanufacturers.com/Welcome.html |accessdate=5 January 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602012550/http://artpotterymanufacturers.com/Welcome.html |archivedate=2 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]].

The word "ceramics" comes from the Greek ''keramikos'' (κεραμικος), meaning "pottery", which in turn comes from ''keramos'' (κεραμος) meaning "potter's clay".&lt;ref&gt;''The Webster Encyclopedic Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;  Most traditional ceramic products were made from [[clay]] (or clay mixed with other materials), shaped and subjected to heat, and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way. In modern ceramic engineering usage, ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tesserae]]''.

There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the [[Nok culture|Nok]] in Africa over 2,000 years ago.  Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese]], [[Crete|Cretan]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Persian pottery|Persian]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Japan]]ese, and [[Korea]]n cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures.

Elements of ceramic art, upon which different degrees of emphasis have been placed at different times, are the shape of the object, its decoration by painting, carving and other methods, and the glazing found on most ceramics.

{{Main article|Earthenware|Stoneware|Porcelain|Bone china}}

Different types of [[clay]], when used with different [[mineral]]s and firing conditions, are used to produce earthenware, stoneware, porcelain and bone china (fine china).
* [[Earthenware]] is [[pottery]] that has not been fired to [[Vitrification#In ceramics|vitrification]] and is thus permeable to water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176172/earthenware "Earthenware"] Britannica online&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of pottery have been made from it from the earliest times, and until the 18th century it was the most common type of pottery outside the far East. Earthenware is often made from clay, [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]].  [[Terracotta]], a type of [[earthenware]], is a [[clay]]-based unglazed or glazed [[ceramic]],&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Terracotta"&lt;/ref&gt; where the fired body is porous.&lt;ref&gt;'Diagnosis Of Terra-Cotta Glaze Spalling.' S.E. Thomasen, C.L. Searls. ''Masonry: Materials, Design, Construction and Maintenance''. ASTM STP 992 Philadelphia, USA, 1988. American Society for Testing &amp; Materials.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Colour Degradation In A Terra Cotta Glaze' H.J. Lee, W.M. Carty, J.Gill. ''Ceram.Eng.Sci.Proc.'' 21, No.2, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;45–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'High-lead glaze compositions and alterations: example of byzantine tiles.' A. Bouquillon. C. Pouthas.

F.Singer, S.S.Singer. Chapman &amp; Hall. 1971. Quote: "The lighter pieces that are glazed may also be termed 'terracotta.'&lt;/ref&gt;  Its uses include vessels (notably [[flower pot]]s), water and waste water pipes, bricks, and surface embellishment in [[building construction]].  Terracotta has been a common medium for ceramic art ([[#Terracotta (artworks)|see below]]).
* [[Stoneware]] is a [[Vitrification#In ceramics|vitreous]] or semi-vitreous [[ceramic]] made primarily from stoneware clay or non-[[refractory]] fire clay.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Terminology of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products: ASTM Standard C242''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoneware is fired at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=temps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigceramicstore.com/info/ceramics/tips/tip90_temp_fire_clay.html|title=What Temperature Should I Fire My Clay To?|author=|date=|work=bigceramicstore.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitrified or not, it is nonporous;{{sfn|Dodd|1994}} it may or may not be glazed.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/art/Wedgwood-ware Jasperware is unglazed stoneware]&lt;/ref&gt;  One widely recognised definition is from the [[Combined Nomenclature]] of the European Communities, a European industry standard states "Stoneware, which, though dense, impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point, differs from [[porcelain]] because it is more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], and normally only partially vitrified. It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous. It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture, and is normally glazed."{{sfn|Dodd|1994}}
* [[Porcelain]] is a [[ceramic]] material made by heating materials, generally including [[kaolin]], in a [[kiln]] to temperatures between {{convert|1200|and|1400|°C|°F|-2}}. The toughness, strength and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of [[pottery]], arises mainly from [[vitrification]] and the formation of the mineral [[mullite]] within the body at these high temperatures.  [[Properties]] associated with porcelain include low [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]; considerable [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[white]]ness, [[Translucent|translucency]] and [[resonance]]; and a high resistance to chemical attack and [[thermal shock]].  Porcelain has been described as being "completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant". However, the term ''porcelain'' lacks a universal definition and has "been applied in a very unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds which have only certain surface-qualities in common".&lt;ref&gt;Definition in ''The Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities'' defines, Burton, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bone china]] (fine china) is a type of [[soft-paste porcelain]] that is composed of [[bone ash]], [[feldspar|feldspathic material]], and [[kaolin]]. It has been defined as ''ware with a translucent body'' containing a minimum of 30% of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate.{{sfn|Dodd|1994}}  Developed by English potter [[Josiah Spode]], bone china is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency,&lt;ref name="Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir p29-32"&gt;Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir. "Bone China from Turkey" Ceramics Technical; May2005, Issue 20, p&amp;nbsp;29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and very high mechanical strength and chip resistance.&lt;ref name="Trading Places 2009, p.35,37" /&gt; Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain.&lt;ref name="Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir p29-32" /&gt;  Like [[stoneware]] it is [[vitrified]], but is translucent due to differing mineral properties.&lt;ref&gt;What is China? [http://noritakechina.com/what-is-china As with stoneware, the body becomes vitrified; which means the body fuses, becomes nonabsorbent, and very strong. Unlike stoneware, china becomes very white and translucent.]&lt;/ref&gt;  From its initial development and up to the later part of the twentieth century, bone china was almost exclusively an English product, with production being effectively localised in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].&lt;ref name="Trading Places 2009, p.35,37"&gt;'Trading Places.'

In the UK, references to "china" or "porcelain" can refer to bone china, and "English porcelain" has been used as a term for it, both in the UK and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold (ed), ''The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts'', p. 130, 1975, OUP, {{ISBN|0-19-866113-4}}; Faulkner, Charles H., "The Ramseys at Swan Pond: The Archaeology and History of an East Tennessee Farm'', p.96, 2008, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2008, {{ISBN|1-57233-609-9}}, 9781572336094; Lawrence, Susan, "Archaeologies of the British: Explorations of Identity in the United Kingdom and Its Colonies 1600–1945", p. 196, 2013, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-136-80192-8}}, 781136801921&lt;/ref&gt;  Fine china is not necessarily bone china, and is a term used to refer to ware which does not contain bone ash.{{sfn|Dodd|1994}}

{{Main article|China painting}}

China painting, or porcelain painting is the decoration of glazed [[porcelain]] objects such as plates, bowls, vases or statues. The body of the object may be [[hard-paste porcelain]], developed in China in the 7th or 8th century, or [[soft-paste porcelain]] (often [[bone china]]), developed in 18th-century Europe. The broader term ceramic painting includes painted decoration on [[lead-glazed earthenware]] such as [[creamware]] or [[tin-glazed pottery]] such as [[maiolica]] or [[faience]].  Typically the body is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous [[Biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]]. [[Underglaze]] decoration may then be applied, followed by [[ceramic glaze]], which is fired so it bonds to the body. The glazed porcelain may then be decorated with [[overglaze]] painting and fired again at a lower temperature to bond the paint with the glaze. Decoration may be applied by brush or by [[stencil]]ing, [[transfer printing]], [[lithography]] and [[screen printing]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Florence (1883). China painting. Cassell.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slipware ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Slipware}}

Slipware is a type of [[pottery]] identified by its primary decorating process where [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] is placed onto the leather-hard clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing.  Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of [[clay]]s and other minerals such as [[quartz]], [[feldspar]] and [[mica]].  A coating of white or coloured slip, known as an engobe, can be applied to the article to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect. Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours. [[Sgraffito]] involves scratching through a layer of coloured [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath. Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state.  One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration. This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture.&lt;ref&gt;Eden, Victoria and Michael. (1999) ''Slipware, Contemporary Approaches.''

=== Terra sigillata ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Terra sigillata}}

In sharp contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term ''terra sigillata'' refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, 'terra sigillata' describes only a  watery refined slip used to facilitate the [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ing of raw clay surfaces and used to promote carbon smoke effects, in both [[Pit fired pottery|primitive]] low temperature firing techniques and unglazed alternative western-style [[Raku ware|Raku]] firing techniques. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] ceramic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Garbsch, Jochen, Terra Sigillata.

=== Studio pottery ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Studio pottery}}

[[Studio pottery]] is [[pottery]] made by amateur or professional [[artist]]s or artisans working alone or in small groups, making unique items or short runs. Typically, all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves.{{sfn|Cooper|2010}}  Studio pottery includes functional wares such as [[tableware]], [[Cookware and bakeware|cookware]] and non-functional wares such as [[sculpture]].  Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium. Much studio pottery is [[tableware]] or [[cookware]] but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional or sculptural items.  Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists, [[ceramist]]s or simply artists. Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world.

=== Tile ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Tile}}
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, carreaux lustrés - Kairouan's Great Mosque, luster tiles.jpg|thumb|Upper part of the [[mihrab]] decorated with lusterware tiles (dating from the 9th century) in the '''[[Mosque of Uqba]]''' also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan, [[Tunisia]]]]
[[File:Tile, late 19th-early 20th century, X1047.7.jpg|thumb|Tile, Hopi Pueblo (Native American), late 19th–early 20th century]]

A [[tile]] is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, showers, or other objects such as tabletops. Alternatively, [[tile]] can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a "tile" is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.

Tiles are often used to form wall [[Tile mural|murals]] and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.

=== Figurines ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
[[File:Franz Anton Bustelli Liebesgruppe 1756-1.jpg|thumb|Group with lovers, modelled by [[Franz Anton Bustelli]], [[Nymphenburg porcelain]], 1756]]
{{Main article|Figurine}}

A [[figurine]] (a diminutive form of the word ''figure'') is a statuette that represents a human, [[deity]], mythical creature, or [[animal figurines|animal]]. Figurines may be realistic or [[iconic]], depending on the skill and intention of the creator. The earliest were made of stone or clay.  In ancient Greece, many figurines were made from terracotta (see [[Greek terracotta figurines]]). Modern versions are made of ceramic, metal, glass, wood and plastic.

Figurines and [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] are sometimes used in [[board game]]s, such as [[chess]], and tabletop [[role playing game]]s. Old figurines have been used to discount some historical theories, such as the [[origins of chess]].

=== Tableware ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Tableware}}

[[Tableware]] is the dishes or dishware used for setting a table, serving food and dining. It includes [[cutlery]], [[List of glassware|glassware]], serving dishes and other useful items for practical as well as decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=Bloomfield&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Linda|title=Contemporary tableware|date=2013|publisher=A. &amp; C.

Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-6692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes, bowls and cups may be made of ceramic, while cutlery is typically made from metal, and glassware is often made from glass or other non-ceramic materials.  The quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners, [[cuisine]] and occasion. For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates. Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.&lt;ref name=venable /&gt;

=== Terracotta (artworks) ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
In addition to being a material, "terracotta" also refers to items made out of this material. In [[archaeology]] and [[art history]], "terracotta" is often used to describe objects such as statures, and figurines not made on a [[potter's wheel]].  A prime example is the [[Terracotta Army]], a collection of man-sized [[terracotta]] sculptures depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]]. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210{{ndash}}209{{nbsp}}BCE and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.&lt;ref name=Portal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Portal|first1=Jane|title=The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02697-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French sculptor [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]] made many terracotta pieces, but possibly the most famous is [[The Abduction of Hippodameia]] depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day. American architect [[Louis Sullivan]] is well known for his elaborate [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed terracotta]] ornamentation, designs that would have been impossible to execute in any other medium. Terracotta and tile were used extensively in the town buildings of Victorian [[Birmingham]], England.

== History ==
There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the [[Nok culture|Nok]] in Africa over 2,000 years ago.  Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese]], [[Crete|Cretan]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Persian pottery|Persian]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Japan]]ese, and [[Korea]]n cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures.

Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the [[Russian Far East]], providing several from 20,000{{ndash}}10,000{{nbsp}}BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects.&lt;ref name="'Oldest pottery' found in China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8077168.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Science &amp; Environment – 'Oldest pottery' found in China|author=|date=|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boaretto"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boaretto, E. |year=2009 |title=Radiocarbon dating of charcoal and bone collagen associated with early pottery at Yuchanyan Cave, Hunan Province, China |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=24 |pages=9537–9538| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/06/01/0900539106.abstract |doi=10.1073/pnas.0900539106 |displayauthors=1 |last2=Wu|first2=X.|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.9595B |last3=Yuan |first3=J. |last4=Bar-Yosef |first4=O. |last5=Chu |first5=V. |last6=Pan |first6=Y. |last7=Liu |first7=K. |last8=Cohen |first8=D. |last9=Jiao |first9=T. |last10=Li |first10=S. |last11=Gu |first11=H. |last12=Goldberg |first12=P. |last13=Weiner |first13=S. |pmid=19487667 |pmc=2689310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Xianrendong Cave]] in [[Jiangxi]] province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000  years ago.&lt;ref name="Boston.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery|title=Harvard, BU researchers find evidence of 20,000-year-old pottery|publisher=Boston.com|access-date=2 January 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102041017/http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery|archive-date=2 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanglin, Douglas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/06/pottery-found-in-from-china-cave-confirmed-as-worlds-oldest/1#.UDiyGtZlRv0|title=Pottery found in China cave confirmed as world's oldest|author=Stanglin, Douglas|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts believe the first true porcelain was made in the [[Province (China)|province]] of [[Zhejiang]] in [[China]] during the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han]] period.  [[Sherd|Shards]] recovered from archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from {{convert|1260|to|1300|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="He Li 1996"&gt;He Li, (1996). ''Chinese Ceramics. The New Standard Guide''. Thames and Hudson, London. {{ISBN|0-500-23727-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 1000 BCE, the so-called "porcelaneous wares" or "proto-porcelain wares" were made using at least some [[kaolin]] fired at high temperatures. The dividing line between the two and ''true porcelain wares'' is not a clear one. Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] (206{{ndash}}BCE{{snds}}220{{nbsp}}CE).&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;Temple, Robert K.G. (2007). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention'' (3rd edition). London: André Deutsch, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–6. {{ISBN|978-0-233-00202-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive [[Chinese porcelain]] were imported into Europe.  From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including [[Soft-paste porcelain|soft-paste]] and the [[Medici porcelain]] made in [[Florence]]. None was successful until a recipe for [[hard-paste porcelain]] was devised at the [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] factory in [[Dresden]] in 1710. Within a few years, porcelain factories sprung up at [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory|Nymphenburg]] in [[Bavaria]] (1754) and [[Capodimonte porcelain|Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]] (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler.

=== Prehistoric pottery ===
[[File:Frieze-group-3-example1.jpg|thumb|left|Vessel from [[Mesopotamia]], late [[Ubaid period]] (4,500{{ndash}}4,000{{nbsp}}BCE)]]

Early pots were made by what is known as the "coiling" method, which worked the clay into a long string that wound to form a shape that later made smooth walls.  The [[potter's wheel]] was probably invented in [[Mesopotamia]] by the 4th millennium BCE, but spread across nearly all Eurasia and much of Africa, though it remained unknown in the [[New World]] until the arrival of Europeans.  Decoration of the clay by incising and painting is found very widely, and was initially geometric, but often included figurative designs from very early on.

So important is pottery to the archaeology of prehistoric cultures that many are known by names taken from their distinctive, and often very fine, pottery, such as the [[Linear Pottery culture]], [[Beaker culture]], [[Globular Amphora culture]], [[Corded Ware culture]] and [[Funnelbeaker culture]], to take examples only from [[Neolithic Europe]] (approximately 7000{{ndash}}1800{{nbsp}}BCE).

Ceramic art has generated many styles from its own tradition, but is often closely related to contemporary sculpture and metalwork.  Many times in its history styles from the usually more prestigious and expensive art of metalworking have been copied in ceramics.  This can be seen in early Chinese ceramics, such as pottery and ceramic-wares of the Shang Dynasty, in Ancient Roman and Iranian pottery, and [[Rococo]] European styles, copying contemporary silverware shapes.  A common use of ceramics is for "pots" - containers such as bowls, vases and [[amphorae]], as well as other tableware, but figurines have been very widely made.

The earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BCE.  Glazed and coloured bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] ({{circa|575{{nbsp}}BCE}}), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere.  Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].  The tradition continued, and after the Islamic conquest of Persia coloured and often painted glazed bricks or tiles became an important element in [[Persian architecture]], and from there spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[İznik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Using the [[lusterware]] technology, one of the finest examples of medieval Islamic use of ceramics as wall decoration can be seen in the [[Mosque of Uqba]] also known as the Great Mosque of kairouan (in [[Tunisia]]), the upper part of the [[mihrab]] wall is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862-863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szNMwUFyjbkC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=luster+kairouan+gold&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K-wbT4X0EZKBhQexuuTfDA&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=luster%20kairouan%20gold&amp;f=false Catherine Hess, Linda Komaroff and George Saliba (2004), ''The arts of fire: Islamic influences on glass and ceramics of the Italian Renaissance'', Getty Publications, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en|title=Qantara – Mihrāb of the Great Mosque of Kairouan|author=|date=|work=qantara-med.org|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184012/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmitted via Islamic Spain, a new tradition of [[Azulejo]]s developed in Spain and especially [[Portugal]], which by the [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white.  [[Delftware]] tiles, typically with a painted design covering only one (rather small) tile, were ubiquitous in the Netherlands and widely exported over Northern Europe from the 16th century on.  Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2792293957101026524 Porcelain Room, Aranjuez] Comprehensive but shaky video {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate tiled stoves were a feature of rooms of the middle and upper-classes in Northern Europe from the 17th to 19th centuries.

There are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly coloured [[zellige]] tiles of [[Morocco]].  With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.

=== East Asia ===
Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the [[Russian Far East]], providing several from between 20,000 and 10,000 BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects.&lt;ref name="'Oldest pottery' found in China" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boaretto" /&gt;  [[Xianrendong Cave]] in [[Jiangxi]] province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000  years ago.&lt;ref name="Boston.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanglin, Douglas" /&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
Recent archaeological excavations at [[Angkor Borei]] (in southern Cambodia) have recovered a large number of ceramics, some of which probably date back to the prehistoric period. Most of the pottery, however, dates to the pre-Angkorian period and consists mainly of pinkish terracotta pots which were either hand-made or thrown on a wheel, and then decorated with incised patterns.

Glazed wares first appear in the archaeological record at the end of the 9th century at the Roluos temple group in the Angkor region, where green-glazed pot shards have been found. A brown glaze became popular at the beginning of the 11th century and brown-glazed wares have been found in abundance at Khmer sites in northeast Thailand. Decorating pottery with animal forms was a popular style from the 11th to 13th century. Archaeological excavations in the [[Angkor]] region have revealed that towards the end of Angkor period production of indigenous pottery declined while there was a dramatic increase in Chinese ceramic imports.

Direct evidence of the shapes of vessels is provided by scenes depicted on bas-reliefs at Khmer temples, which also offer insight into domestic and ritualistic uses of the wares. The wide range of utilitarian shapes suggest the Khmers used ceramics in their daily life for cooking, food preservation, carrying and storing liquids, as containers for medicinal herbs, perfumes and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambodiamuseum.info/en_khmer_art_history.html|title=Contact Support|author=|date=|work=cambodiamuseum.info|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celadon]] was first made in China, and then exported to various parts of Asia and Europe.

There is [[Chinese porcelain]] from the late [[Eastern Han]] period (100{{ndash}}200{{nbsp}}CE), the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220{{ndash}}280{{nbsp}}CE), the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220{{ndash}}589{{nbsp}}CE), and thereafter.  China in particular has had a continuous history of large-scale production, with the Imperial factories usually producing the best work.  The [[Tang Dynasty]] (618 to 906{{nbsp}}CE) is especially noted for [[grave goods]] figures of humans, animals and model houses, boats and other goods, excavated (usually illegally) from graves in large numbers.

The Imperial porcelain of the [[Culture of the Song Dynasty|Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), featuring very subtle decoration shallowly carved by knife in the clay, is regarded by many authorities as the peak of [[Chinese ceramics]], though the large and more exuberantly painted ceramics of the [[Chinese ceramics#Ming dynasty, 1368–1644|Ming Dynasty]] (1368{{ndash}}1644) have a wider reputation.

Chinese emperors gave ceramics as diplomatic gifts on a lavish scale, and the presence of Chinese ceramics no doubt aided the development of related traditions of ceramics in Japan and [[Korean pottery and porcelain|Korea]] in particular.

The earliest Japanese pottery was made around the 11th millennium BCE.  [[Jōmon]] ware emerged in the 6th millennium BCE and the plainer [[Yayoi]] style in about the 4th century BCE.  This early pottery was soft earthenware, fired at low temperatures. The potter's wheel and a [[Anagama kiln|kiln]] capable of reaching higher temperatures and firing stoneware appeared in the 3rd or 4th centuries CE, probably brought from China via the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kofu/hd_kofu.htm] "Although the roots of Sueki reach back to ancient China, its direct precursor is the grayware of the Three Kingdoms period in Korea."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, official kilns in Japan produced simple, green [[lead-glazed earthenware]].  Unglazed stoneware was used as funerary jars, storage jars and kitchen pots up to the 17th century.  Some of the kilns improved their methodsmil {{clarify|date=July 2014}} From the 11th to the 16th century, Japan imported much porcelain from China and some from Korea. The Japanese overlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s attempts to conquer China in the 1590s were dubbed the "Ceramic Wars" [citation needed]  the emigration of Korean potters appeared to be a major cause. One of these potters, [[Yi Sam-pyeong]], discovered the raw material of porcelain in Arita and produced first true porcelain in Japan.

In the 17th century, conditions in China drove some of its potters into Japan, bringing with them the knowledge to make refined porcelain. From the mid-century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] began to import Japanese porcelain into Europe.  At this time, [[Kakiemon]] wares were produced at the factories of [[Arita, Saga|Arita]], which had much in common with the Chinese [[Famille Verte]] style. The superb quality of its [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] decoration was highly prized in the West and widely imitated by the major European porcelain manufacturers.  In 1971 it was declared an important "intangible cultural treasure" by the [[Japanese government]].

In the 20th century, interest in the art of the village potter was revived by the [[Mingei]] folk movement led by potters [[Shoji Hamada]], Kawai Kajiro and others. They studied traditional methods in order to preserve native wares that were in danger of disappearing. Modern masters use ancient methods to bring pottery and porcelain to new heights of achievement at [[Shiga]], [[Iga, Mie|Iga]], [[Karatsu]], [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], and [[Bizen, Okayama|Bizen]]. A few outstanding potters were designated living cultural treasures (''mukei bunkazai'' 無形文化財).   In the old capital of [[Kyoto]], the [[Raku ware|Raku]] family continued to produce the rough [[Chawan|tea bowls]] that had so delighted connoisseurs. At [[Mino Province|Mino]], potters continued to reconstruct the classic formulas of Momoyama-era Seto-type tea wares of Mino, such as [[Oribe ware]]. By the 1990s many master potters worked away from ancient kilns and made classic wares in all parts of Japan.

Korean pottery has had a continuous tradition since simple [[earthenware]] from about 8000 BCE. Styles have generally been a distinctive variant of Chinese, and later Japanese, developments.  The ceramics of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392) and early [[Joseon white porcelain]] of the following dynasty are generally regarded as the finest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection: Korean Art|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/korean.asp|website=Freer/Sackler|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was developed by the Islamic potters, the first examples found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating from about the 8th century.  The Islamic world had contact with China, and increasingly adapted many Chinese decorative motifs.  Persian wares gradually relaxed Islamic restrictions on figurative ornament, and painted figuratives scenes became very important.

The [[albarello]] form, a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs, was first made in the Islamic Middle East. It was brought to Italy by [[Hispano-Moresque]] traders; the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century.

[[Iznik pottery]], made in western [[Anatolia]], is highly decorated ceramics whose heyday was the late 16th century under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans.  Iznik vessels were originally made in imitation of [[Chinese porcelain]], which was highly prized. Under [[Süleyman the Magnificent]] (1520–66), demand for Iznik wares increased.  After the conquest of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans started a programme of building, which used large quantities of Iznik tiles. The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] in Istanbul (built 1609–16) alone contains 20,000 tiles and tiles were used extensively in the [[Topkapi Palace]] (commenced 1459).  As a result of this demand, tiles dominated the output of the Iznik potteries.

==== Early figurines ====

The earliest known ceramic objects are the [[Gravettian]] figurines from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, such as those discovered at Dolní Věstonice in the modern-day [[Czech Republic]]. The [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]] (Věstonická Venuše in Czech) is a statuette of a nude female figure dating from some time from 29,000{{ndash}}25,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi359.htm|title=No. 359: The Dolni Vestonice Ceramics|author=|date=|work=uh.edu|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was made by moulding and then firing a mixture of clay and powdered bone.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Stringer. ''Homo Britannicus'', Alan Lane, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9795-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar objects in various media found throughout Europe and Asia and dating from the Upper Paleolithic period have also been called [[Venus figurines]]. Scholars are not agreed as to their purpose or cultural significance.

Glazed [[Egyptian faience]] dates to the third millennium BCE), with painted but unglazed [[ancient Egyptian pottery|pottery]] used even earlier during the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] [[Naqada culture]]. [[Faience]] became sophisticated and produced on a large scale, using moulds as well modelling, and later also throwing on the wheel. Several methods of glazing were developed, but colours remained largely limited to a range in the blue-green spectrum.

On the Greek [[island]] of [[Santorini]] are some of the earliest finds created by the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]] dating to the third millennium BCE, with the original settlement at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] dating to the fourth millennium BCE;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-to-santorini.com/place.php?place_id=40|title=Archaeological site of akrotiri Santorini Greece|author=|date=|work=travel-to-santorini.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  excavation work continues at the principal [[archaeological]] site of Akrotiri.  Some of the excavated homes contain huge ceramic storage jars known as ''[[pithoi]]''.

Ancient [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] ceramics are renowned for their figurative painting, especially in the [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] and [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] styles.  Moulded [[Greek terracotta figurines]], especially [[Tanagra figurine|those from Tanagra]], were small figures, often religious but later including many of everyday genre figures, apparently used purely for decoration.

[[Ancient Roman pottery]], such as [[Samian ware]], was rarely as fine, and largely copied shapes from metalwork, but was produced in enormous quantities, and is found all over Europe and the Middle East, and beyond. [[Monte Testaccio]] is a [[mound|waste mound]] in Rome made almost entirely of broken [[amphorae]] used for transporting and storing liquids and other products.  Few vessels of great artistic interest have survived, but there are very many small figures, often incorporated into oil lamps or similar objects, and often with religious or erotic themes (or both together – a Roman speciality).  The Romans generally did not leave grave goods, the best source of ancient pottery, but even so they do not seem to have had much in the way of luxury pottery, unlike [[Roman glass]], which the elite used with gold or silver  tableware.  The more expensive pottery tended to use relief decoration, often moulded, rather than paint.  Especially in the Eastern Empire, local traditions continued, hybridizing with Roman styles to varying extents.

[[tin-glazing|Tin-glazed]] pottery, or faience, originated in [[Iraq]] in the 9th century, from where it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching [[Italy]] in the [[Renaissance]], [[Holland]] in the 16th century and [[England]], [[France]] and other European countries shortly after.  Important regional styles in Europe include: [[Hispano-Moresque]], [[maiolica]], [[Delftware]], and [[English Delftware]]. By the [[High Middle Ages]] the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of [[Al-Andaluz]] was the most sophisticated pottery being produced in Europe, with elaborate decoration. It introduced tin-glazing to Europe, which was developed in the [[Italian Renaissance]] in maiolica. Tin-glazed pottery was taken up in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries, the potters making household, decorative pieces and tiles in vast numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin Glazed Pottery'', Faber and Faber, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; usually with [[Blue and white porcelain|blue painting on a white ground]].  Dutch potters took tin-glazed pottery  to the British Isles, where it was made between about 1550 and 1800. In France, tin-glaze was begun in 1690 at [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]] in Brittany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faience-de-quimper.com/histquim_en.html Faience-de-quimper.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413214248/http://www.faience-de-quimper.com/histquim_en.html |date=13 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed in [[Rouen]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Lunéville]]. The development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as [[Creamware]] by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Porcelain#European porcelain|porcelain]], reduced the demand for Delftware, faience and majolica. Today, tin oxide usage in glazes finds limited use in conjunction with other, lower cost opacifying agents, although it is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters,&lt;ref&gt;'Ceramic Glazes.'

{{further information|Porcelain#European porcelain}}

Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive [[Chinese porcelain]] were imported into Europe.  From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including [[Soft-paste porcelain|soft-paste]] and the [[Medici porcelain]] made in [[Florence]]. In 1712, many of the elaborate Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets were revealed throughout Europe by the French Jesuit father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles and soon published in the ''Lettres édifiantes et curieuses de Chine par des missionnaires jésuites''&lt;ref&gt;Baghdiantz McAbe, Ina (2008).

Cambridge University Press, p. 36-7. {{ISBN|0-521-83833-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After much experimentation, a recipe for [[hard-paste porcelain]] was devised at the [[Meissen porcelain]] factory in [[Dresden]] soon after 1710, and was on sale by 1713. Within a few decades, porcelain factories sprung up at [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory|Nymphenburg]] in [[Bavaria]] (1754) and [[Capodimonte porcelain|Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]] (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler.

[[Soft-paste porcelain]] was made at [[Rouen]] in the 1680s, but the first important production was at [[Saint-Cloud porcelain|St.Cloud]], letters-patent being granted in 1702.  The [[Duc de Bourbon]] established a soft-paste factory, the [[Chantilly porcelain]], in the grounds of his [[Château de Chantilly]] in 1730; a soft-paste factory was opened at [[Mennecy]]; and the [[Vincennes]] factory was set up by workers from Chantilly in 1740, moving to larger premises at Sèvres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://manufacturedesevres.culture.gouv.fr/site.php?type=P&amp;id=20 | title=The 18th Century: The Rise and Success | work=Manufacture nationale de Sèvres | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124110833/http://manufacturedesevres.culture.gouv.fr/site.php?type=P&amp;id=20 | archive-date=24 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sevr/hd_sevr.htm|title=Sèvres Porcelain in the Nineteenth Century|author=|date=|work=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1756.

In 1749 a patent was taken out on the first [[bone china]], subsequently perfected by [[Josiah Spode]].  The main English porcelain makers in the 18th century were at [[Chelsea porcelain factory|Chelsea]],  [[Bow porcelain factory|Bow]],  St James's, [[Bristol porcelain|Bristol]],  [[Royal Crown Derby|Derby]]  and [[Lowestoft#Lowestoft porcelain|Lowestoft]].

Porcelain was ideally suited to the energetic [[Rococo]] curves of the day.  The products of these early decades of European porcelain are generally the most highly regarded, and expensive.  The Meissen modeler [[Johann Joachim Kaendler]] and [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] of Nymphenburg are perhaps the most outstanding ceramic artists of the period.  Like other leading modelers, they trained as sculptors and produced models from which moulds were taken.

By the end of the 18th century owning porcelain tableware and decorative objects had become obligatory among the prosperous middle-classes of Europe, and there were factories in most countries, many of which are still producing.  As well as tableware, early European porcelain revived the taste for purely decorative figures of people or animals, which had also been a feature of several ancient cultures, often as [[grave goods]].  These were still being produced in China as [[blanc de Chine]] religious figures, many of which had reached Europe.  European figures were almost entirely secular, and soon brightly and brilliantly painted, often in groups with a modelled setting, and a strong narrative element (see picture).

==== Wedgwood and the North Staffordshire Potteries ====
[[File:Philbrook - Wedgewood (2)crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[Wedgwood]] urn in [[jasperware]], {{circa|1820}}]]

From the 17th century, [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in North Staffordshire emerged as a major centre of pottery making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/sot/five.htm|title=all about Stoke-on-Trent in 5 minutes...|author=|date=|work=thepotteries.org|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Important contributions to the development of the industry were made by the firms of [[Wedgwood]], [[Spode]], [[Royal Doulton]] and [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]].

The local presence of abundant supplies of coal and suitable clay for earthenware production led to the early but at first limited development of the local pottery industry. The construction of the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] allowed the easy transportation of [[Kaolinite|china clay]] from [[Cornwall]] together with other materials and facilitated the production of [[creamware]] and [[bone china]].  Other production centres had a lead in the production of high quality wares but the preeminence of North Staffordshire was brought about by methodical and detailed research and a willingness to experiment carried out over many years, initially by one man, Josiah Wedgwood.  His lead was followed by other local potters, scientists and engineers.

Wedgwood is credited with the [[industrial process|industrialization]] of the manufacture of [[pottery]].  His work was of very high quality: when visiting his workshop, if he saw an offending vessel that failed to meet with his standards, he would smash it with his stick, exclaiming, "This will not do for Josiah Wedgwood!" He was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market.  His matt finish [[jasperware]] in two colours was highly suitable for the [[Neoclassicism]] of the end of the century, imitating the effects of Ancient Roman [[engraved gem|carved gemstone]] [[cameo (carving)|cameos]] like the [[Gemma Augustea]], or the [[cameo glass]] [[Portland Vase]], of which Wedgwood produced copies.

He also is credited with perfecting [[transfer-printing]], first developed in England about 1750. By the end of the century this had largely replaced hand-painting for complex designs, except at the luxury end of the market, and the vast majority of the world's decorated pottery uses versions of the technique to the present day.The perfecting of underglaze transfer printing is widely credited to Josiah Spode the first. The process had been  used as a development from the processes used in book printing, and early paper quality made a very refined detail in the design incapable of reproduction, so early print patterns were rather lacking in subtltey of tonal variation. The development of machine made thinner printing papers around 1804 allowed the engravers to use a much wider variety of tonal techniques which became capable of being reproduced on the ware, much more successfully.

Far from perfecting underglaze print Wedgwood was persuaded by his painters not to adopt underglaze printing until it became evident that Mr Spode was taking away his business through competitive pricing for a much more heavily decorated high quality product.

Stoke-on-Trent's supremacy in pottery manufacture nurtured and attracted a large number of ceramic artists including [[Clarice Cliff]], [[Susie Cooper]], [[Lorna Bailey]], [[Charlotte Rhead]], [[Frederick Hurten Rhead]] and [[Jabez Vodrey]].

==== Studio pottery in Britain ====
[[Studio pottery]] is made by artists working alone or in small groups, producing unique items or short runs, typically with all stages of manufacture carried out by one individual.{{sfn|Cooper|2010}} It is represented by potters all over the world but has strong roots in Britain, with potters such as [[Bernard Leach]], [[William Staite Murray]], [[Dora Billington]], [[Lucie Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]]. Bernard Leach (1887–1979) established a style of pottery influenced by Far-Eastern and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to [[stoneware]] fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns.  This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th-century.  The Austrian refugee Lucie Rie (1902–1995) has been regarded as essentially a [[modernist]] who experimented with new glaze effects on often brightly coloured bowls and bottles.  [[Hans Coper]] (1920–1981) produced non-functional, sculptural and unglazed pieces.  After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the [[Festival of Britain]].  The simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos.  Several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom, and this style of studio pottery remained popular into the nineteen-seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Harrod, Tanya, "From A Potter's Book to The Maker's Eye: British Studio Ceramics 1940–1982", in ''The Harrow Connection'', Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Fritsch]] (1940-) took up ceramics working under [[Hans Coper]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] (1968–1971). Fritsch was one of a group of outstanding ceramicists who emerged from the Royal College of Art at that time. Fritschs' ceramic vessels broke away from traditional methods and she developed a hand built flattened coil technique in stoneware smoothed and refined into accurately profiled forms. They are then hand painted with dry matt slips, in colours unusual for ceramics.

{{Main article|Native American pottery}}

The people in North, Central, and South America continents had a wide variety of pottery traditions before Europeans arrived. The oldest ceramics known in the [[Americas]]{{nsmdns}}made from 5,000 to 6,000 years ago{{nsmdns}}are found in the Andean region, along the Pacific coast of [[Ecuador]]  at [[Valdivia Culture|Valdivia]] and Puerto Hormiga, and in the San Jacinto Valley of [[Colombia]]; objects from 3,800 to 4,000 years old have been discovered in [[Peru]]. Some archaeologists believe that ceramics know-how found its way by sea to [[Mesoamerica]], the second great cradle of civilization in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, Art Review Museum of American Indian's 'Born of Clay' Explores Culture Through Ceramics By GRACE GLUECK, Published: 1 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-developed styles found in the central and southern [[Andes]] are the ceramics found near the ceremonial site at [[Chavín culture|Chavín]] de Huántar (800{{ndash}}400{{nbsp}}BCE) and [[Cupisnique]] (1000{{ndash}}400{{nbsp}}BCE).  During the same period, another culture developed on the southern coast of Peru, in the area called [[Paracas culture|Paracas]]. The Paracas culture (600{{ndash}}100{{nbsp}}BCE) produced marvelous works of embossed ceramic finished with a thick oil applied after firing. This colorful tradition in ceramics and textiles was followed by the [[Nazca culture]] (1{{ndash}}600{{nbsp}}CE), whose potters developed improved techniques for preparing clay and for decorating objects, using fine brushes to paint sophisticated motifs. In the early stage of [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] ceramics, potters painted realistic characters and landscapes.

The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] cultures (1{{ndash}}800{{nbsp}}CE) that flourished on the northern coast of modern Peru produced modelled clay sculptures and effigies decorated with fine lines of red on a beige background.  Their pottery stands out for its [[Huaco (pottery)|huacos]] portrait vases, in which human faces are shown expressing different emotions{{nsmdns}}happiness, sadness, anger, melancholy{{nsmdns}}as well for its complicated drawings of wars, human sacrifices, and celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Born of Clay – Ceramic from the National Museum of the American Indian, 2005 Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] were relative latecomers to ceramic development, as their ceramic arts flourished in the [[Maya Classic Period]], or the 2nd to 10th century.  One important site in southern [[Belize]] is known as [[Lubaantun]], that boasts particularly detailed and prolific works.  As evidence of the extent to which these ceramic art works were prized, many specimens traced to Lubaantun have been found at distant Maya sites in [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, ''Comparison of Mayan sites in southern and western Belize'', Lumina Technologies (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the current Maya people of Lubaantun continue to hand produce copies of many of the original designs found at Lubaantun.

In the United States, the oldest pottery dates to 2500{{nbsp}}BCE.  It has been found in the [[Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and some slightly older along the [[Savannah River]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=FTU&gt;{{cite news |title= The Mocama: New name for an old people|first= Matt|last= Soergel|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= 18 October 2009 |url= http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2009-10-18/story/the_mocama_new_name_for_an_old_people|accessdate= 12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hopi]] in Northern Arizona and several other [[Puebloan peoples]] including the [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]], [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], and [[Zuni people|Zuñi]] people (all in the [[Southwestern United States]]) are renowned for painted pottery in several different styles. [[Nampeyo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/gallery.shtml A Nampeyo Showcase] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924105844/http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/gallery.shtml |date=24 September 2015 }}, a display of some of Nampeyo's work&lt;/ref&gt; and her relatives created pottery that became highly sought after beginning in the early 20th century.  Pueblo tribes in the state of [[New Mexico]] have styles distinctive to each of the various pueblos (villages). They include [[Santa Clara Pueblo]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[Hopi]] Pueblos, [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]], [[Acoma Pueblo]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]] Pueblo, amongst others. Some of the renowned artists of Pueblo pottery include: [[Nampeyo]], Elva Nampeyo, and [[Dextra Quotskuyva]] of the Hopi; [[Leonidas Tapia]] of San Juan Pueblo; and [[Maria Martinez]] and [[Julian Martinez]] of San Ildefonso Pueblo. In the early 20th century Martinez and her husband Julian rediscovered the method of creating traditional San Ildefonso Pueblo Black-on Black [[pottery]].

==== Mexican ceramics ====
[[File:TalaveraTrayMAPDF.JPG|thumb|[[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]] serving tray]]

[[Mexican ceramics]] are an ancient tradition. [[Precolumbian]] potters built up their wares with pinching, coiling, or hammer-an-anvil methods and, instead of using glaze, burnished their pots.

==== Studio pottery in the United States ====
{{see also|Category:American potters|Face jug}}

There is a strong tradition of studio artists working in ceramics in the United States. It had a period of growth in the 1960s and continues to present times. Many  fine art, craft, and contemporary art museums have pieces in their permanent collections. [[Beatrice Wood]] was an American artist and studio potter located in [[Ojai, California]]. She developed a unique form of luster-glaze technique, and was active from the 1930s to her death in 1998 at 105 years old. [[Robert Arneson]] created larger sculptural work, in an abstracted representational style. There are ceramics arts departments at many colleges, universities, and fine arts institutes in the [[United States]].

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Pottery in Sub-Saharan Africa is traditionally made by coiling and is fired at low temperature.  The figurines of the ancient [[Nok culture]], whose function remains unclear, are an example of high-quality figural work, found in many cultures, such as [[Benin art|the Benin of Nigeria]].

In the Aïr Region of [[Niger]] (West Africa) (Haour 2003) pottery dating from around 10,000 BCE was excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-4425-0_8911 | title= Ceramics in Africa | author= Olivier P. Gosselain | accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ladi Kwali]], a [[Nigeria]]n [[pottery|potter]] who worked in the [[Gwari]] tradition, made large pots decorated with incised patterns. Her work is an interesting hybrid of traditional African with western [[studio pottery]].  [[Magdalene Odundo]] is a [[Kenya]]n-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Studio pottery|studio potter]] whose ceramics are hand built and burnished.

== Ceramics museums and museum collections ==&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Ceramics museum}}

A [[ceramics museum]] is a [[museum]] wholly or largely devoted to [[ceramic]]s, normally ceramic artworks, whose collections may include [[glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] as well, but will usually concentrate on [[pottery]], including [[porcelain]]. Most national ceramics collections are in a more general museum covering all [[the arts]], or just the [[decorative arts]], but there are a number of specialized ceramics museums, some concentrating on the production of just one country, region or manufacturer.  Others have international collections, which may concentrate on ceramics from Europe or East Asia, or have global coverage.

In Asian and Islamic countries ceramics are usually a strong feature of general and national museums.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Also most specialist [[archaeological]] museums, in all countries, have large ceramics collections, as pottery is the commonest type of [[archaeological artifact]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://greekarchaeology.osu.edu/arch-edu/analysis "Archaeological Analysis"], Ohio State Archeological excavations in Greece&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these are broken [[sherd|shards]] however.

Outstanding major ceramics collections in general museums include [[Collections of the Palace Museum#Ceramics|The Palace Museum, Beijing]], with 340,000 pieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2009-02/16/content_322071.htm|title=Palace Museum Opens Its New Porcelain Hall|author=|date=|work=chinaculture.org|accessdate=19 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200546/http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2009-02/16/content_322071.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei city]], Taiwan (25,000 pieces);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/about/objects.htm|title=國立故宮全球資訊網-訊息頁|author=|date=|work=npm.gov.tw|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; both are mostly derived from the Chinese Imperial collection, and are almost entirely of pieces from China.  In London, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (over 75,000 pieces, mostly after 1400 CE) and [[British Museum]] (mostly before 1400 CE) have very strong international collections.  The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC (12,000, all East Asian&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 403&lt;/ref&gt;) have perhaps the best of the many fine collections in the large city museums of the United States. The [[Corning Museum of Glass]], in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], has more than 45,000 glass objects.

'''Charles Wycliffe Goodwin''' (1817–1878) was an English [[Egyptologist]], [[bible]] scholar, [[lawyer]] and [[judge]].  His last judicial position was as Acting [[Chief Judge]] of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]].

==Early life==

Goodwin was born in 1817 in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]].   He studied at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]] and graduated, in 1838, 6th Classic and senior optime in Mathematics.   He became a [[fellow]] of the College.  He was called to the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1843.  He lost his fellowship of St Catharine's in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Douglas, Gunboat Justice, Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Interests==
The first [[papyrus]] publication has been credited to Goodwin, who published for the [[Cambridge Antiquarian Society]], one of the [[Papyri Graecae Magicae]] V, translated into English with commentary in 1853.&lt;ref name="Betz"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans Dieter Betz|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3684249.html|year=1992|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 he wrote one of the articles in ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'', to which he was the only lay contributor, writing alongside such great theologians as [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]] and [[Henry Bristow Wilson]].

In a speech, "The Growth and Nature of Egyptology: an inaugural lecture" by [[Stephen Ranulph Kingdon Glanville]],&lt;ref&gt;Published by Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Glanville said of Goodwin:

"By the time Goodwin left Cambridge, he was a first class Greek scholar, an accomplished Hebraist, and an authority on Anglo-Saxon with valuable editions of new texts to his credit.  He also had a considerably knowledge of natural history, especially geology.  In London, where his practice was not large, he wrote music and art criticism; was for a time editor of ''[[Literary Gazette]]''; was the only layman among the seven contributors to the much talked of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' (1860); and, because of his Greek and Hebrew scholarship, was frequently consulted by the Revisers of the [[New Testament]].  But throughout his life, his main interest, begun when he was at school was in the elucidation of Ancient Egyptian and Coptic texts, more especially those Egyptian texts written in the cursive script called [[hieratic]].

In London, he spent much of his time in the [[British Museum]], copying papyri.  He was in close touch with [[Samuel Birch]], then Keeper of the Oriental Department and was constantly exchanging information by correspondence with other leading Egyptologists of his day."

==Appointment as Judge in China and Japan==

Goodwin was appointed Assistant [[Judge]] of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] in 1865 on the founding of the court. Sir [[Edmund Grimani Hornby|Edmund Hornby]] was appointed the [[Chief Judge]]. The [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] exercised jurisdiction over British Subjects in China and Japan pursuant to [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] rights granted under treaties with China and Japan.  The Court was also an appellate court from British [[consular court]]s in China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Douglas, Gunboat Justice, Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodwin served as assistant judge to Sir [[Edmund Grimani Hornby|Edmund Hornby]].  Goodwin was based in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] until 1874.  In that year he moved to [[Yokohama]] where he was based until early 1877 when he returned to Shanghai.  Goodwin became [[Acting (law)|Acting]] [[Chief Judge]] in 1876 after Edmund Hornby retired.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Office List 1878, p103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Goodwin died in [[Shanghai]] in 1878.  He was buried in the Shanghai Cemetery in Shanghai.  The Shanghai Cemetery was later renamed the Pahsienjao Cemetery (八仙桥公墓).  It is now Huaihai Park ([[:zh:淮海公園|淮海公園]]).&lt;ref&gt;North China Herald, 24 Jan 1878 pp81-2&lt;/ref&gt;

A [http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/egypt-cairo-egyptian-museum-marble-bust-of-the-news-photo/122226357 bust of Goodwin] was placed as part of the memorial to [[Auguste-Edouard Mariette]] at [[Cairo Museum]].

The '''[[crystal skull]]s''' are a number of [[human skull]] [[hardstone carving]]s made of clear or milky [[quartz]] rock,  known in art history as "rock crystal". They are often claimed to be [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n artifacts by their alleged finders, however, none of the specimens made available for scientific study have been authenticated as pre-Columbian in origin.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum (n.d.-b), Jenkins (2004, p.217), Sax ''et al.'' (2008), Smith (2005), Walsh (1997; 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some claims presented in an assortment of popularizing literature, legends of crystal skulls with mystical powers do not figure in genuine Mesoamerican or other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mythologies and spiritual accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred (2000, ''passim.''); Jenkins (2004, pp.218–219). In this latter work, [[Philip Jenkins]], former Distinguished Professor of History and Religious Studies and latterly an endowed Professor of Humanities at [[Pennsylvania State University|PSU]], writes that crystal skulls are among the more obvious of examples where the association with Native spirituality is a "historically recent" and "artificial" synthesis. These are "products of a generation of creative spiritual entrepreneurs" that do not "[represent] the practice of any historical community".&lt;/ref&gt;

The skulls are often claimed to exhibit [[paranormal]] phenomena by some members of the [[New Age]] movement, and have often been portrayed as such in [[fiction]]. Crystal skulls have been a popular subject appearing in numerous [[sci-fi]] [[television series]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[Stargate SG-1 (season 3)|''Stargate SG-1'' season 3]] episode #65, "Crystal Skull".&lt;/ref&gt; novels,&lt;ref&gt;See for example the ''Indiana Jones'' novels by Max McCoy (1995, 1996, 1997, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the video game [[Legend of the Crystal Skull]] and [[Illusion of Gaia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was born in 1936 in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] to a middle-class African-American family. His father John Henry Lewis, Sr. had graduated from [[Morris Brown College]] in Atlanta, and went on to [[Yale Divinity School]], becoming its first African-American graduate. He also earned an M.A. in [[sociology]] from the [[University of Chicago]]. He became principal of [[Dunbar Junior and Senior High School and Junior College]] in Little Rock.  Lewis' mother taught high school math in the school.

While the family lived in Little Rock, the young Lewis attended parochial school.  Lewis attended Wilberforce Preparatory School and [[Xenia High School]] after his father became Dean of the Theological School at [[Wilberforce University]] in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]].

When the family moved to [[Atlanta]] after his father became President of Morris Brown College, Lewis attended [[Booker T. Washington High School (Atlanta, Georgia)|Booker T. Washington High School]] in his junior year. He gained early admission at age fifteen to [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1956.

[[File:Eleonora Eduard1.jpg| thumb|[[Eleanor of Castile]], Queen Consort of England 1272–90.]]
The '''Eleanor crosses''' were a series of twelve lavishly decorated stone monuments  topped with tall crosses, of which three survive nearly intact, in a line down part of the east of England. [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] had the crosses erected between 1291 and 1294 in memory of his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], marking the nightly resting-places along the route taken when her body was transported to London. Several artists worked on the crosses, as the "Expense Rolls" of the Crown show, with some of the work being divided between the main figures, sent from London, and the framework, made locally. "Alexander of Abingdon" and "William of Ireland", both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, were apparently the leading sculptors of figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cockerill|first1=Sara|title=Eleanor of Castile: The Shadow Queen|date=2014|publisher=Amberley|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===The procession===
[[File:Lincoln 171.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Eleanor's viscera in the Angel Choir at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].]]
{{Main|Eleanor of Castile}}
Upon her death in 1290 at [[Harby, Nottinghamshire|Harby]], near the city of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], the body of Queen Eleanor was carried to Lincoln where she was embalmed, probably either at the [[Gilbertine]] [[St. Catherines, Lincoln#St. Catherine's|priory of St Catherine, Lincoln]] in the south of Lincoln, or at the priory of the Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powrie|first1=Jean|title=Eleanor of Castile|date=1990|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Organ (anatomy)|viscera]], less her heart, were sent to the Angel Choir of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] for burial, where they still rest.  Her body was then sent to London, taking 12 days to reach [[Westminster Abbey]].  The crosses were erected at the places where her funeral procession stopped overnight.

At Westminster she was buried at the feet of her father-in-law King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. Her heart travelled with the body and was buried in the abbey church at the London Dominicans' priory at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], along with that of her young son [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester]].

===Reasons for construction===
A similar event had taken place in France for the body of King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1271, although his [[memorial cross]]es, unlike Eleanor's, were erected in part as a manifesto for [[canonisation]]; Edward had probably seen similar memorial crosses in France and elsewhere in Europe during his travels.  They were at least in part intended as [[cenotaph]]s to provoke [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from passers-by and pilgrims&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of St Albans''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The twelve places==
The only three crosses still standing are those at Geddington, Hardingstone, just outside Northampton, and Waltham Cross, although remnants of the lost ones can also be seen at other sites.

[[File:QueenEleanorCross.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The Northampton Cross]]
[[File:NorthamptonPlaque.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Plaque recording the history of the Northampton Cross]]

===Lincoln===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The only remaining piece of the [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] Eleanor cross is in the grounds of [[Lincoln Castle]]. The cross originally stood at [[St. Catherines, Lincoln|St Catherine's]], an area at the end of Lincoln's High Street.

===Grantham===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|54|37|N|00|38|25|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No part survives of the [[Grantham]] Cross in [[Lincolnshire]], though the records of the 18th-century antiquary, [[William Stukeley]], suggest that it featured Eleanor's coats of arms.

===Stamford===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|39|22|N|00|29|37|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Only a small marble fragment survives of the [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] Cross in [[Lincolnshire]], a carved rose excavated by [[William Stukeley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/letters/Overwhelming-evidence-on-site-of.3242452.jp ''Stamford Mercury'' "Overwhelming evidence on site of Eleanor cross"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the closure of [[Stamford Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/stamfordmuseum Stamford Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the carved fragment is displayed in the Discover Stamford area at the town's library. Stukeley's sketch of the top portion of the Stamford Cross, which suggests that it stylistically resembled the Geddington Cross, is preserved in his diaries in the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. &lt;br/&gt;See below for the modern monument erected by the [[Smith of Derby Group]].

===Geddington===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|26|15|N|00|41|07|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Still standing, the [[Geddington]] Cross in [[Northamptonshire]] is the best-preserved of the three survivors. It is unique among the surviving crosses in having a triangular plan, and a taller and more slender profile with a lower tier entirely covered with rosette [[diapering]], instead of the arch-and-gable motif with tracery which appears on both the others; and canopied statues surmounted by a slender hexagonal pinnacle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConProperty.57 English Heritage: Geddington's Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardingstone, Northampton===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|13|02|N|00|53|50|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Northampton cross in [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]] is still standing at the edge of [[Delapré Abbey]], on the side of the A508 leading out of Northampton, just north of the junction with the A45; the King stayed nearby at [[Northampton Castle]]. This cross was begun in 1291 by John of Battle. He worked with [[William of Ireland]] to carve the statues: William was paid £3 6s. 8d. per figure.

The cross is octagonal in shape and set upon some steps: the present ones are replacements. It is built in three tiers and originally had a crowning terminal, possibly a cross. It is not known when this became lost.&lt;ref&gt;''The Buildings of England – Northamptonshire''. N [[Pevsner]] (Second edition). {{ISBN|0-300-09632-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local anecdote says that it was knocked off by a low-flying aircraft from a nearby airfield in the Second World War. However the records show that the cross had been lost by 1460 - there is mention of a "headless cross" at the site from where [[Thomas Bourchier (bishop)|Thomas Bourchier]], the Archbishop of Canterbury watched [[Margaret of Anjou]]'s flight following the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/victoriahistoryo03adki#page/2/mode/2up Adkins, W.R.D., ed. ''The Victoria History of the County of Northampton''. -vol iii, p3 (1906)]&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement cross was installed in the first restoration of 1713, but was replaced by the picturesque broken shaft which is seen today by a further restoration in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salzman|first1=L.F.|title=A History of the County of Northamptonshire Vol 4|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66362|website=British History Online|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cross is referred to in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain|Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain]]'', in his report on the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675, "...a townsman being at Queen's Cross upon a hill on the south side of the town, about two miles ({{convert|2|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) off, saw the fire at one end of the town then newly begun, and that before he could get to the town it was burning at the remotest end, opposite where he first saw it."

Its bottom tier features open books.  These probably included painted inscriptions of Eleanor's biography and of prayers for her soul to be said by viewers, now lost.

===Stony Stratford===
&lt;small&gt;(plaque at {{Coord|52|03|32|N|00|51|24|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

The [[Stony Stratford]] Cross in [[Buckinghamshire]] stood at the lower end of the town, towards the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]], on [[Watling Street]] (now the High Street), although its exact location is hotly debated. It is said to have been of a tall elegant design (perhaps similar to that at Geddington); it was destroyed during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] by the Parliamentarians. The base survived for some time, but any trace has vanished. This commemorative plaque on the wall of 157 High Street is all that is now visible, and reads:

"Near this spot stood the Cross erected by King Edward the I to mark the place in Stony Stratford where the body of Queen Eleanor rested on its way from Harby in Nottinghamshire to Westminster Abbey in 1290"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/mkm/stonystratford/docs/eleanor.html Stony Stratford's Eleanor Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woburn===
&lt;small&gt;(approximately at {{Coord|51|59|20|N|00|37|10|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

Work on the [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] Cross in [[Bedfordshire]] started in 1292, later than most of the others. A great part of the work was done by one Ralph de Chichester. No part survives. The precise location is unknown.

===Dunstable===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|53|10|N|00|31|16|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

Eleanor's coffin was guarded by Canons in [[Dunstable Priory]] whilst local people mourned at the crossroads in [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]], the location where the original cross was then constructed. A shopping precinct in High Street North now contains a modern cross statue in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;

===St Albans===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|45|04|N|00|20|26|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The [[St Albans]] Cross in [[Hertfordshire]] was erected in the Market Place at a cost of £100. It stood for many years in front of the fifteenth-century [[Clock Tower, St Albans|Clock Tower]] in the High Street (opposite the Waxhouse Gateway entrance to the [[St Albans Cathedral|Abbey]]), and was demolished in the early eighteenth century due to neglect, and replaced by the town pump. A fountain was erected in its stead in 1874, which was subsequently relocated to Victoria Place.

===Waltham (now Waltham Cross)===
[[File:Waltham Cross.JPG|thumb|The Eleanor Cross at Waltham Cross:  Erected  in 1294 and still intact.]]
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|41|09|N|00|01|59|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The [[Waltham Cross]] monument in [[Hertfordshire]] was constructed in co-operation between an architect and a sculptor: Roger of Crundale, who was the senior royal mason, and Master [[Alexander of Abingdon]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/stories/sadrei_eleanorcross.html Image of the cross at Waltham.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still standing, although it has been restored on several occasions, and the original statues of Eleanor were replaced by replicas during the last major restoration in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#post-271 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002090538/http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#post-271 |date=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original statues were kept for some years at Cheshunt Public Library; but they were removed, possibly in the 1980s, to the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]. A photograph on the Lowewood Museum website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#attachment_273 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002090538/http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#attachment_273 |date=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows one of the original statues in front of a staircase at the library.

===Westcheap (now Cheapside)===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|30|51|N|00|05|41|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Fragments of the [[Cheapside]] Cross in the [[City of London]] are held by the [[Museum of London]], but although a number of drawings of the cross – and of its destruction – survive, they post-date an extensive restoration, or even rebuilding, under [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], and thus provide no safe indication of how the original looked.  It is likely, however, that it was similar to the Waltham and Hardingstone Crosses, but even more ornate and boasting some marble facings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cockerill|first1=Sara|title=Eleanor of Castile: The Shadow Queen|date=2014|publisher=Amberley|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cheapside Cross was demolished in May 1643 under an ordinance from the Parliamentary Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, led by [[Robert Harley (1579-1656)|Sir Robert Harley]]. The cross was the third incarnation of the monument, which had been reconstructed and refurbished several times in the preceding three centuries, in which time it had enjoyed the protection of various monarchs and the Mayor and Corporation of London.

Matters came to a head during the years running up to the [[English Civil War]], when the cross was seen to encompass the doctrinal debates of the period. To puritanical reformers, it was identified with '[[Dagon]]', the ancient god of the Philistines, and was seen as the embodiment of Royal Catholic tradition. At least one riot was fought in its shadow as opponents of the cross descended upon it to pull it down, and supporters rallied to stop them.

After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had fled London to raise an army at the start of the Civil War, the destruction of the cross was almost the first order of business for Harley's commission. Though less well known than the Charing Cross, the downfall of the Cheapside Cross is one of the most interesting and arguably important examples of [[iconoclasm]] in English history.

Fragments of this cross are displayed in the [[Museum of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander, Binski|title=Age of Chivalry|year=1987|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charing (now Charing Cross)===
[[File:Charing Cross railway station.jpg|right|thumb|The Victorian-era replacement for the Eleanor Cross, in the [[Charing Cross railway station]] forecourt]]
[[File:2005-07-10 - United Kingdom - England - London - Charing Cross - Eleanor cross.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of the Victorian cross]]

&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|30|26|N|00|07|39|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

The cross at [[Charing Cross]] in [[Westminster]], in what was then the [[Royal Mews]], was the most expensive, built of marble in co-operation between an architect, Richard of Crundale, who was the senior royal mason, and a sculptor, Master [[Alexander of Abingdon]].

According to [[folk etymology]], the name Charing derives from French ''{{lang|fr|chère reine}}'' (dear queen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eleanor Crosses|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/medieval/People/147014/|work=Eleanor of Castille|publisher=[[Museum of London]]|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name probably came from the Anglo-Saxon word ''{{lang|ang|ċerring}}'', meaning a bend, as it stands on the outside of a 90-degree bend in the River Thames (see [[Charing]] in Kent). The original cross stood at the top of [[Whitehall]] on the south side of [[Trafalgar Square]], but was destroyed on the orders of Parliament in 1647 during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], and was replaced by an equestrian statue of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1675 following the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]]. This point in Trafalgar Square is regarded as the official centre of London in legislation and when measuring distances from London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/08/15/charingcross_feature.shtml Where Is The Centre Of London?] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replicas and imitations==
During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries several replica Eleanor Crosses were erected, including at [[Ilam, Staffordshire|Ilam]] in Staffordshire, [[Walkden]] in Lancashire, and the [[Eleanor Cross, Sledmere]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].

The most substantial of these is in London, outside Charing Cross railway station. Erected in 1865, a few hundred yards to the east of the original site of the Eleanor Cross, on the [[Strand, London|Strand]], it is not a faithful copy, being more ornate than the original. It stands {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and was commissioned by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] Company for their newly opened Charing Cross Hotel. The new cross was designed by the architect of the hotel, [[Edward Middleton Barry|E. M. Barry]], who is best known for his work on [[Covent Garden]]. It was constructed by [[Thomas Earp (sculptor)|Thomas Earp]] of Lambeth from [[Portland stone]], [[Mansfield]] stone (a fine sandstone) and [[Aberdeen granite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/7219.aspx "Charing Cross"]. Network Rail. Retrieved 22 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored to a substantial extent between October 2009 and July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10911029|title=Renovated Eleanor's Cross in Charing Cross unveiled|date=9 August 2010|work=News London|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Queen Victoria Monument, Birkenhead]] [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], Merseyside, unveiled in 1905, is in the form of an Eleanor cross. The Ilam cross was built in 1840 by Jesse Watts Russell of [[Ilam Hall]] to commemorate his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thornber.net/staffs/html/ilam.html Ilam photograph]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Glastonbury Market Cross]] resembles an Eleanor cross.

The start of the 21st century was marked in Stamford by erecting a modern monument inspired by the lost Cross. It stands in Sheepmarket, rather than at the original location. The carved detail is based on the fragment in Stamford Museum.

[[File:End papers.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Endpapers of the original run of books in the [[Everyman's Library]], 1906, based on the art of [[William Morris]]'s Kelmscott Press.]]
The '''endpapers''' or '''end-papers''' of a [[book]] (also known as '''endsheets''') are the pages that consist of a double-size sheet folded, with one half pasted against an inside cover (the pastedown), and the other serving as the first free page (the free endpaper or flyleaf). Thus, the front endpapers precede the [[title page]] and the text, whereas the back endpapers follow the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prucha  |first1=Francis |date= 1996|title=Livia Appel and the Art of Copyediting: A Personal Memoir  |journal= The Wisconsin Magazine of History  |volume= 4|issue= 4|pages=376-377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Booksellers sometimes refer to the front endpaper as FEP.  

Before mass printing in the 20th century it was common for the endpapers of books to have  [[paper marbling]].  Sometimes the endpapers are used for [[Map|maps]] or other relevant information. They are the traditional place to put [[bookplate]]s, or an owner's inscription.

{{As of|2010}}, there are many styles of endsheets or endpapers that are specifically designed for use with different bindings. For example, endsheets reinforced with cloth are used in [[Bookbinding#Stitched or sewn binding|sewn bindings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbsbind.com/endsheets/endsheets_for_side_sewing.php |title=Endsheets For Side Sewing - LBS - Bookbinding, On-Demand &amp; Packaging Materials |publisher=Lbsbind.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cloth holds the stitches and prevents the paper from perforating and tearing.

Other styles are designed for use with [[Perfect binding|perfect binders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbsbind.com/endsheets/endsheets_for_perfect_binding.php |title=Endsheets For Perfect Binding - easily create a hardcover book |publisher=Lbsbind.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined and Universal Endsheets are loaded into the cover feeder of an automatic perfect binder and attached – instead of the soft cover – automatically producing a book block reinforced from head to tail. The Folded Tabbed End sheet is collated with the text pages, milled and bound along with the book block.

There are also many styles of endpapers that are engineered to meet textbook standards and [[library binding]] standards as well as endsheets for conservation and book repair.

      <comment>/* Syllogism where the audience supplies a premise */I replaced with the correct word. The previous author was looking for the word “axiom”.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">An '''enthymeme''' ({{lang-el|ἐνθύμημα}}, ''enthumēma'') is a rhetorical [[syllogism]] (a three-part deductive [[Logical argument|argument]]) used in oratorical practice. Originally theorized by [[Aristotle]], there are four types of enthymeme, at least two of which are described in Aristotle's work.&lt;ref name="Benoit1982"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Benoit
  | first = William
  | authorlink = 
  | title = The Most Important Passage in Aristotle's Rhetoric
  | journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly
  | volume = 12
  | issue = 1
  | pages = 2-9
  | date = Winter 1982
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle referred to the enthymeme as "the body of proof", "the strongest of rhetorical proofs...a kind of syllogism" (''Rhetoric'' I.I.3,11). He considered it to be one of two kinds of proof, the other of which was the [[paradeigma]]. Maxims, Aristotle thought to be a derivative of enthymemes. (''Rhetoric'' II.XX.1)

== Syllogism with an unstated premise ==
The first type of enthymeme is a truncated syllogism, or a syllogism with an unstated premise. 

Here is an example of an enthymeme derived from a syllogism through truncation (shortening) of the syllogism:
*"'''[[Socrates]] is mortal because he's human'''."

:The complete ''formal'' syllogism would be the classic:

::All humans are mortal. (major premise – unstated)
::Socrates is human. ([[minor premise]] – stated)
::Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion – stated)

While syllogisms lay out all of their premises and conclusion explicitly, these kinds of enthymemes keep at least one of the premises or the conclusion unstated.

== Syllogism based on signs == 

In the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle argues that some enthymemes are derived from syllogisms that are based on signs (''semeia'') instead of absolute facts. In this context, signs are "things [that] are so closely related that the presence or absence of one indicates the presence or absence of the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speaking.pitt.edu/student/public-speaking/reasoning.html|title=Reasoning|date=2008-08-21|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are given below. 

*"'''He is ill, since he has a cough.'''"
*"'''Since she has a child, she has given birth.'''"

In the examples, 'having a cough' and 'having a child' are signs of illness and giving birth respectively. In both cases the enthymeme is only probably true because there are other sources of coughs and children besides pathogens and parturition respectively, such as allergies and adoption.

== Syllogism where the audience supplies a premise ==

The third kind of enthymeme consists of a syllogism with a missing premise that is supplied by the audience as an unstated assumption. In the words of rhetorician William Benoit, the missing premise is: "assumed by rhetor when inventing and by audience when understanding the argument."&lt;ref name="Benoit1987"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Benoit
  | first = William
  | authorlink = 
  | title = On Aristotle's Example
  | journal = Philosophy and Rhetoric
  | volume = 20
  | issue = 4
  | pages = 261-267
  | date = 1987
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this kind of enthymeme is as follows: 
*"'''''[[Candide]]'' is a typical French novel; therefore it is vulgar.'''"

In this case, the missing term of the syllogism is "French novels are vulgar" and might be an assumption held by an audience that would make sense of the enthymematic argument. Such unstated premises can also rise to the level of axioms (statements so commonly accepted as to be thought universally true).

== Visual enthymemes ==

Another kind of enthymeme is the visual enthymeme. Scholars have argued that words are not the only form of expression that can be understood to form enthymematic arguments. Pictures can also function as enthymemes because they require the audience to help construct their meaning.&lt;ref name="Smith2007"&gt;{{cite journal

  | date = 2001
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism == 

Some scholars argue that our understanding of the enthymeme has evolved over time and is no longer representative of the enthymeme as originally conceived by Aristotle. This is obviously true of the visual enthymeme, only conceived in the early twenty-first century and may also be true of the enthymeme as truncated syllogism. Carol Poster argues that this later interpretation of the enthymeme was invented by British rhetoricians such as [[Richard Whately]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Poster2003"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War''''', also titled '''''Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War''''', is an [[autobiographical]] book by [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] about his experiences during the [[Cuban Revolution]] (1956–1958) to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]].

First published in 1963, it was the compilation of a series of articles by Guevara that had originally appeared in ''Verde Olivo'', a weekly publication of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces (MINFAR).

The 2008 biopic [[Che (2008 film)|''Che'']] starring [[Benicio del Toro]] is based partly on this book.

==Translations==
The book was translated into English in 1968 as ''Reminiscences of the Revolutionary War'', retranslated in 1986 as ''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War'', and again in 2005 as ''Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War''.

{{dictdef}}
An '''era''' is a span of time defined for the purposes of [[chronology]] or [[historiography]], as in the [[regnal era]]s in the history of a given monarchy, a [[calendar era]] used for a given [[calendar]], or the [[geological era]]s defined for the [[history of Earth]].

Comparable terms are [[Epoch (disambiguation)|epoch]], [[age (geology)|age]], [[Periodization|period]], [[saeculum]], [[aeon]] (Greek ''aion'') and   Sanskrit [[yuga]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|era}}
The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''aera'' "an era or epoch from which time is reckoned," probably identical to Latin ''æra'' "counters used for calculation," plural of ''æs'' "brass, money".
 
The Latin word use in chronology seems to have begun in 5th century [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain, where it appears in the ''History'' of [[Isidore of Seville]], and in later texts. The [[Spanish era]] is calculated from 38 BC, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. [[indiction]]) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the [[Battle of Actium]], which occurred in 31 BC. 

Like epoch, "era" in English originally meant "the starting point of an age"; the meaning "system of chronological notation" is c.1646; that of "historical period" is 1741.

==Use in chronology==
In [[chronology]], an '''era''' is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of [[time]]. A '''[[calendar era]]''' indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific [[epoch (reference date)|reference date (epoch)]], which often marks the origin of a political state or [[cosmology]], dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in ''[[Victorian era]]''.

===Geological era===
{{main|Era (geology)}}
In large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where ''[[Era (geology)|geologic era]]'' refers to well-defined time spans. 
The next-larger division of geologic time is the [[aeon|eon]]. The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon is subdivided into eras.&lt;ref&gt;Short, N.M. (2009). [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html "Geologic Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418090602/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html |date=2005-04-18 }} in [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ''Remote Sensing Tutorial''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027181013/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2009-10-27 }}. [[NASA]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for "before present").

The older [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] eons are also divided into eras.

===Cosmological era===
For periods in the  [[history of the universe]], the term "[[Epoch (cosmology)|epoch]]" is typically preferred, but "era" is used e.g. of the "[[Stelliferous Era]]".

===Calendar eras===
{{main|Calendar era}}
Calendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. [[Anno mundi]] ("year of the world") refers to a group of calendar eras based on a [[Dating creation|calculation of the age of the world]], assuming it was created as described in the [[Book of Genesis]].  In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012.  In the Western church [[Anno Domini]] (=AD = CE), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant. 

The [[Islamic calendar]], which also has variants, counts years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or emigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], which occurred in 622 CE. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH ("After Hijra").

For a time ranging from 1872 to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Japanese used the imperial year system (''kōki''), counting from the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan which occurred in 660 BC.

Many [[Buddhist calendar]]s count from the death of the [[Buddha]], which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545-543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as "BE" for "Buddhist Era"; 2000 CE was 2543 BE in the [[Thai solar calendar]].

Other calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the [[Seleucid era]] and the Ancient Roman ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' ("AUC"), counting from the foundation of the city.

===Regnal eras===
{{main|Regnal year}}
The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.  The use of [[regnal year]]s is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures.  Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]]).  In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.
 
In [[East Asia]], each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:

*[[Chinese era name|Chinese eras]]
*[[Japanese era name|Japanese era]]
*[[Korean era name|Korean eras]]
*[[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese eras]]

A similar practice survived in the [[United Kingdom]] until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but [[Acts of Parliament]] were dated according to the years of the reign of the current [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], so that "61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37" refers to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] passed in the session of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

===Historiography===
"Era" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the [[Roman era]], [[Elizabethan era]], [[Victorian era]], etc.
Use of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include [[Soviet era]], and "[[:Category:History of European art music|musical eras]]" in the history of modern [[popular music]], such as the "[[Big Band|Big Band era]]", "[[Disco era]]", etc.

'''[[Female genital mutilation]]''' (FGM), also known as female circumcision or female genital cutting, includes any procedure involving the removal or injury of part or all of external female genitalia for non medical reasons.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the practice is most common in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, FGM is also widespread in immigrant communities and metropolitan areas in the United States, and was performed by doctors regularly until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Howard|last2=Stupp|first2=Paul|last3=Okoroh|first3=Ekwutosi|last4=Besera|first4=Ghenet|last5=Goodman|first5=David|last6=Danel|first6=Isabella|date=2016|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States: Updated Estimates of Women and Girls at Risk, 2012|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=131|issue=2|pages=340–347|issn=0033-3549|pmc=4765983|pmid=26957669|doi=10.1177/003335491613100218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mpinga|first=Emmanuel Kabengele|last2=Macias|first2=Aurélie|last3=Hasselgard-Rowe|first3=Jennifer|last4=Kandala|first4=Ngianga-Bakwin|last5=Félicien|first5=Tshimungu Kandolo|last6=Verloo|first6=Henk|last7=Bukonda|first7=Ngoyi K.

There are four main types of FGM, distinguished by the [[World Health Organization]] by their severity.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Natascha|date=2015-03-04|title=Female Genital Cutting and Long-Term Health Consequences – Nationally Representative Estimates across 13 Countries|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2014.976620|journal=The Journal of Development Studies|volume=51|issue=3|pages=226–246|doi=10.1080/00220388.2014.976620|issn=0022-0388}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clitoridectomy]], type 1, describes the partial or total removal of the [[clitoris]], and includes circumcision, removal of just the clitoral hood, and clitoridectomy, or removal of the entire clitoral glans and hood.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Type 2, excision, involves the partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora, with or without the additional removal of the labia majora.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Type 3, [[infibulation]], is the most severe type of FGM. It describes the narrowing of the vaginal opening through creation of a seal, by cutting and repositioning the labia minora or labia majora.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Type 4 describes any other type of harmful non-medical procedures performed on female genitalia, including cutting, burning, and scraping.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

In the United States, FGM is most common in immigrant communities and in major metropolitan areas. Data on the prevalence of FGM in the United States was first collected in 1990, using census information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; CDC reports using information from the early 2010-2013 have shown a decrease in FGM in the United States, although growing levels of immigration cause numbers to appear higher.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to its prevalence in immigrant communities in the US, FGM was considered a standard medical procedure in America for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webber|first=Sara|last2=Schonfeld|first2=Toby L.|date=2003-06-27|title=Cutting History, Cutting Culture: Female Circumcision in the United States|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/44151|journal=The American Journal of Bioethics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=65–66|issn=1536-0075|doi=10.1162/152651603766436324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians performed surgeries of varying invasiveness to treat a number of diagnoses, including hysteria, depression, [[nymphomania]], and [[frigidity]]. The medicalization of FGM in the United States allowed these practices to continue until the end of the 20th century, with some procedures covered by [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance]] until 1977.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LViJROLfEGQC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Watson,+M.+(2005).+Female+circumcision+from+Africa+to+the+Americas:+Slavery+to+the+present.+The+Social+Sciences+Journal,+42,+421-437.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5Gef12-62c&amp;sig=uz-GJ4WiI0PbMHNfye21Le7jzzo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq_-eUm4jXAhWs5IMKHaTSB3gQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Watson,%20M.%20(2005).%20Female%20circumcision%20from%20Africa%20to%20the%20Americas:%20Slavery%20to%20the%20present.%20The%20Social%20Sciences%20Journal,%2042,%20421-437.&amp;f=false|title=Women in Developing Countries: A Reference Handbook|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598844252|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

With the passage of the Female Genital Mutilation Act in 1996, performing FGM on anyone under age 18 became a felony in the United States.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This law was eventually struck down as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2018/11/20/judge-dismisses-key-count-genital-mutilation-case/2066855002/&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, 26 states have made specific laws that prohibit FGM as of 2017.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The US has also participated in several UN resolutions that advocate for the eradication of FGM, including the UN's 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[File:FGM in Africa.svg|thumb|Prevalence of FGM in African countries]]

==Prevalence==
The current prevalence of FGM in the US is uncertain. In early 2014, [[Equality Now]] campaigned with survivor and activist [[Jaha Dukureh]], Representatives [[Joseph Crowley]] (D-NY) and [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-TX), and [[The Guardian]] to petition the Obama Administration to conduct a new prevalence study into the current state of FGM in the U.S. as the first step towards its elimination.&lt;ref name="equalitynow.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/EN_FAQ_FGM_in_US.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210111516/http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/EN_FAQ_FGM_in_US.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the first report on FGM in the United States was developed using data from the 1990 census.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Howard|last2=Stupp|first2=Paul|last3=Okoroh|first3=Ekwutosi|last4=Besera|first4=Ghenet|last5=Goodman|first5=David|last6=Danel|first6=Isabella|date=2016|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States: Updated Estimates of Women and Girls at Risk, 2012|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=131|issue=2|pages=340–347|issn=0033-3549|pmc=4765983|pmid=26957669|doi=10.1177/003335491613100218}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that 168,000 girls and women were at risk, with 48,000 under 18.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Howard|last2=Stupp|first2=Paul|last3=Okoroh|first3=Ekwutosi|last4=Besera|first4=Ghenet|last5=Goodman|first5=David|last6=Danel|first6=Isabella|date=2016|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States: Updated Estimates of Women and Girls at Risk, 2012|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=131|issue=2|pages=340–347|issn=0033-3549|pmc=4765983|pmid=26957669|doi=10.1177/003335491613100218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the African Women's Health Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the PRC revamped these numbers with information from recent surveys and the 2000 U.S. census.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They reported 227,887 girls and women at risk in United States, with 62,519 under 18. This increase can be attributed to increases in total immigration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] released a report compiled with data from 2010-2013. The CDC report estimated 513,000 girls and women in the United States were either victims of FGM or at risk of FGM, with ⅓ under age 18.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2015/us-fgmc.aspx|title=Women and Girls at Risk of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The marked increase in the number of girls and women at risk of FGM in the United States was attributed to an increase in the total number of immigrants from countries where FGM is most common, not an increase in the frequency of the practice.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Howard|last2=Stupp|first2=Paul|last3=Okoroh|first3=Ekwutosi|last4=Besera|first4=Ghenet|last5=Goodman|first5=David|last6=Danel|first6=Isabella|date=2016|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States: Updated Estimates of Women and Girls at Risk, 2012|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=131|issue=2|pages=340–347|doi=10.1177/003335491613100218|issn=0033-3549|pmc=4765983|pmid=26957669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the women at risk, 60% are from 8 states: California, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. Additionally, 40% of those reported are concentrated in 5 major metropolitan areas: New York, Washington, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Los Angeles, and Seattle. 55% of the women are from Egypt, Somalia, or Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These three "sending countries" have a high prevalence of FGM as well as high numbers of U.S. immigrants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The report used information from US census reports and the [[American Community Survey]] (2012) to identify the number of immigrants from countries where FGM is most prevalent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Medicalization ===
During the 19th century, FGM was frequently performed by doctors as a treatment for many sexual and psychological conditions. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the clitoris was considered the center of female sexuality.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; In addition, Victorian concepts of female sexuality resulted in a widely-held belief that women were less sexual than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.uk.com/brownlibrary/GRONE.htm#_ednref18|title=Nymphomania: The Historical Construction of Female Sexuality|website=www.brown.uk.com|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female sexuality was typically thought of only within the constructs of heterosexual marriage, and behaviors that strayed from this schema, such as masturbation, were deemed symptomatic, and often resulted in operation on the clitoris.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Degler|first=Carl N.|date=1974|title=What Ought To Be and What Was: Women's Sexuality in the Nineteenth Century|jstor=1851777|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=79|issue=5|pages=1467–1490|doi=10.2307/1851777}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Depending on the symptoms and diagnosis, physicians performed four different procedures of varying invasiveness on women.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Doctors would either remove the smegma surrounding the clitoris, lacerate adhesions restricting the clitoris, or remove the clitoral hood altogether (female circumcision).&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In the most extreme cases, doctors would perform a clitoridectomy, removing the clitoris entirely.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Reflex neurosis was a common diagnosis in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Characterized by excessive nervous stimulation, this condition could often manifest in an overstimulation of the clitoris that women would attempt to quell with masturbation.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Women diagnosed with reflex neurosis were often circumcised in an effort to remove the irritant.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

From the 1880s to 1950s, excision was often performed to prevent and treat lesbianism, masturbation, depression, hysteria, and nymphomania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Mary Ann|date=2005-01-01|title=Female circumcision from Africa to the Americas: Slavery to the present|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362331905000522|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=42|issue=3|pages=421–437|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2005.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Studd|first=John|last2=Schwenkhagen|first2=Anneliese|date=2009-06-20|title=The historical response to female sexuality|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512209000681|journal=Maturitas|series=Female sexual dysfunctions in the office|volume=63|issue=2|pages=107–111|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.02.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures continued well into the 1970s, and were covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance until 1977.&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt;

Dr. [[James_C._Burt|James Burt]], a physician from Ohio, performed a so-called "surgery of love" on over 170 women throughout the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnsdotter|first=Sara|title=Projected Cultural Histories of the Cutting of Female Genitalia: A Poor Reflection as in a Mirror|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02757206.2012.649270?needAccess=true|journal=History and Anthropology|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=91–114|doi=10.1080/02757206.2012.649270|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the nonconsensual procedure, Burt would cut around, move, and reshape the clitoris of women who had been admitted for other operations.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; This continued well into the 1970s, when a former coworker served witness to several of Burt's victims, and he was fired and cast out of the medical community.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;[[File:Teaching communities about FGM-C (12345176104).jpg|thumb|Tools used in education and community outreach.]]

==Legislative framework==

=== Federal and state policy ===
As of July 2017, 26 states had passed legislation making FGM illegal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/182161/24-states-have-no-laws-against-female-genital-mutilation-heres-why-that-needs-to-change#.lOv4d3Fn7|title=24 US states still have no laws against female genital mutilation. Yes, you read that right.|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these states passed legislation that made it illegal to perform FGM on anyone, while federal law only protects those under 18.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; On November 21st 2018, federal court considering the first legal challenge to the statute found the law unconstitutional, greatly diminishing the chances of it being used by federal prosecutors around the country. The law was deemed unconstitutional because it exceeds the commerce clause. The main reason is that FGM is not part of interstate commercial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/health/fgm-female-genital-mutilation-law.html|title=Federal Ban on Female Genital Mutilation Ruled Unconstitutional by Judge|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing FGM on anyone under the age of 18 became a felony in the United States with the passage of the Female Genital Mutilation Act in 1996.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/116|title=18 U.S. Code § 116 - Female genital mutilation|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was introduced by former congresswoman [[Pat Schroeder]] in October 1993.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ann|first=James, Mary|date=2013|title=Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation: The Female Genital Mutilation Act of 1993, H.R. 3247|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bglj/vol9/iss1/11|journal=Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Justice|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.15779/z38dk2f|issn=1933-1045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonard|first=Lori|date=2000-03-01|title=Interpreting Female Genital Cutting: Moving beyond the Impasse|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10532528.2000.10559787|journal=Annual Review of Sex Research|volume=11|issue=1|pages=158–190|doi=10.1080/10532528.2000.10559787|issn=1053-2528}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Female Genital Mutilation Act includes education and community outreach programs that provide information about the physical and emotional harm caused by FGM.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1996|title=Female Genital Mutilation Outlawed In United States|jstor=29733347|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=313|issue=7065|pages=1103–1103|doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7065.1103a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to community outreach programs, the U.S. Congress also required the Department of Health and Human services to provide information for medical students about treatment recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Carol R|last2=Jackson|first2=J Carey|date=August 1997|title=Female "Circumcision"|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=12|issue=8|pages=491–499|doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.1997.00088.x|issn=0884-8734|pmc=1497147|pmid=9276655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education policy was also included in the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/FR/HTML/FR/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-42380/0-0-0-42398/0-0-0-44422.html|title=Notice of Implementation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 Pertaining to Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) [63 FR 13433] [FR 20-98] {{!}} USCIS|website=www.uscis.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IIRARA mandated that visa recipients from 28 high-risk countries receive culturally appropriate information on the personal and legal repercussions of FGM in the United States at or before the time of entry.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44548936|title=Female genital mutilation : a guide to laws and policies worldwide|date=2000|publisher=Zed Books|others=Rahman, Anika., Toubia, Nahid., Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy., RAINBO (Organization)|isbn=9781856497732|location=London|oclc=44548936}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act specifically prohibited the practice of "vacation cutting", the transport of a girl outside of the United States with the intention of performing FGM.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Howard|last2=Stupp|first2=Paul|last3=Okoroh|first3=Ekwutosi|last4=Besera|first4=Ghenet|last5=Goodman|first5=David|last6=Danel|first6=Isabella|date=2016|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States: Updated Estimates of Women and Girls at Risk, 2012|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=131|issue=2|pages=340–347|issn=0033-3549|pmc=4765983|pmid=26957669|doi=10.1177/003335491613100218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International policy ===
In addition to policies within the U.S., FGM has been condemned by international organizations and bodies that the U.S. is a part of. The UN's 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] both include statements against the practice of FGM.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm|title=General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child: A Feminist Landmark|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol3/iss1/3/|journal=William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law|volume=3|pages=51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)]] required participating State parties to work to "abolish customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1990, CEDAW's General Recommendation 14 included many suggested actions for participating State parties to eradicate FGM, including the collection of data on the prevalence of FGM, education and outreach programs to prevent and discourage FGM, incorporating information on the eradication of FGM into public health programs, and encouraging politicians and public figures to speak out against FGM.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1999, CEDAW's General Recommendation recommended that participating State parties enact laws to prohibit FGM.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 2007, the [[United Nations Children's Emergency Fund|United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF)]] and the [[United Nations Population Fund|United Nations Population Fund (UNPF)]] created a joint UN initiative with the goal of ending FGM within a generation.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; In 2015, the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]] included the end of practices that prevent gender equality, including FGM.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

=== Prosecutions ===
The first conviction of FGM in the US occurred in 2006. [[Khalid Adem]], an Ethiopian American, was both the first person prosecuted and first person convicted for FGM in the United States. Adem, an Ethiopian immigrant, circumcised his two-year-old daughter with a pair of scissors. He was found guilty of [[aggravated battery]] and [[cruelty to children]] by the State of Georgia, which had no specific law on FGM at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6108516.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-01-georgia_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Georgia successfully passed a law criminalizing FGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-5/article-2/16-5-27|title=2010 Georgia Code ::  TITLE 16 - CRIMES AND OFFENSES ::  CHAPTER 5 - CRIMES AGAINST THE PERSON ::  ARTICLE 2 - ASSAULT AND BATTERY ::  § 16-5-27 - Female genital mutilation|work=Justia Law|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Jumana Nagarwala, a doctor working at the [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in Detroit, was charged with allegedly performing FGM at the Burhani Medical Clinic in Livonia, Michigan.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/mied/319679/16-0.html|title=United States of America v.

====Federal prohibition ruled unconstitutional====
On November 20, 2018, the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge [[Bernard A. Friedman]], ruled that the federal Female Genital Mutilation Act of 1996 was unconstitutional. The defendants had argued successfully that the practice does not pertain to the [[Commerce Clause]] under which the [[federal law]] was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tresa |last=Baldas |title=Judge Dismisses Female Genital Mutilation Charges in Historic Case |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/11/20/female-genital-mutilation-michigan/1991712002/ |work=Detroit Free Press |date=November 20, 2018 |access-date=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asylum ===
In 1996, [[Matter of Kasinga|Fauziya Kasinga]] was granted political asylum by the United States Board of Immigration Appeals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Kasinga, a 19-year-old member of the Tchamba-Kunsuntu tribe of Togo, was granted asylum on the grounds that she would be at risk of FGM if she returned to her arranged marriage in Togo.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This set a precedent in U.S. immigration law because it was the first time FGM was accepted as a form of persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Dugger, Celia W.

==Controversy==

=== American Academy of Pediatrics ===
In 2010, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] came under fire for advising doctors to consider offering patients the option of "a ritual nick as a possible compromise to avoid greater harm"&lt;ref name="UK colleges criticise US advice on female genital mutilation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kmietowkz|first1=Zosia|title=UK colleges criticise US advice on female genital mutilation|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|date=22 May 2010|volume=340|page=1103|jstor=40702226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy stated that although harmful genital mutilation is illegal in the United States, physicians could consider this option in countries where FGM is more widely practiced. This advice appeared in a journal section entitled "Education of patients and parents".&lt;ref name="UK colleges criticise US advice on female genital mutilation" /&gt; After facing backlash from medical institutions worldwide, the AAP retracted their statement. The organization also subsequently clarified in a statement released in May 2010 that it "opposes all types of female genital cutting" and "counsels its members not to perform such procedures".&lt;ref name="Ritual Genital Cutting of Female Minors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ritual Genital Cutting of Female Minors|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/125/5/1088.full|publisher=Pediatrics|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frutillar''' is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] located in southern [[Chile]] in the [[Los Lagos Region]]. The bay of Frutillar is placed on the banks of [[Lake Llanquihue]], the largest lake entirely within Chile. Frutillar is known as the "City of Music".

==History==
After a period of clearing up the land, the city of Frutillar was founded by German settlers in 1856, among them Christian Winkler, Wilhelm Kaschel, Heinrich Kuschel, Theodor Niklitshek, Christian Nannig and Adams Schmidt.

[[Vicente Perez Rosales]] on a later expedition towards the south of [[Valdivia]] changed the course of the incoming colony to Lake Llanquihue. Rosales was searching for more land for the German settlers, south of Valdivia, as many sailing ships were arriving to the port of Valdivia from Germany sent by Bernardo Philippi under the official colonisation program of Southern Chile. This program was granted by President Manuel Bulnes and executed by president of Chile [[Manuel Montt]] naming officially Vicente Perez Rosales the head of the German colonisation of Llanquihue, as a continuation of the initial efforts done by Bernard Philippi.  

Rosales, reached the lake through the dense wild forest and climbed to [[Osorno Volcano]] and at the height of 2,000 meters he was able to see the ocean to the south  where he saw sailing ships navigating. It was the chilotes from [[Chiloe]] that had been sailing in the inner waters of [[Puerto Montt]] since 1550 and came mainly from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] Spain, which has very similar climate conditions. He immediately informed this issue to the port of Valdivia and thus, from there on, the settlers started their incoming through [[Puerto Montt]] and travelled by land to [[Puerto Varas]] where other ships would sail the shores of lake Llanquihue to Frutillar and [[Puerto Octay]]. 

A quote of the time illustrates the discovery of lake Llanquihue during its first sighting by Philippi  "The water of this lake is as clear as that of Geneva in Switzerland, its surface is about seven leagues long and one league wide, so I could not distinguish the opposite bank. On one hand, it has the snowy Alps, the Andes Mountain that rises from its eastern banks of a volcano covered with snow up to half of its height and goes into its waters." Bernardo Philippi 1842  This illustrates the period when Philippi discovers [[Lake Llanquihue]]  and its similarity with [[Lake Geneva]] in Switzerland. This information was given to the German settler in order to describe them the beauty of the region. It took over 10 years to be able to bring  all the settlers from Germany to Chile and establish the first colonisation program in [[Lake Llanquihue]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{ISBN|978-956-310-774-6}} Patagonia Chilena&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Bernhard Eunom Philippi]] did its discovery in 1842, when he was exploring the region with the [[Chilean army]], he brought the idea to the [[Chilean government]] that the Southern Region of Chile would be best developed by bringing German Settlers that were having a hard time in Germany with the industrial revolution and had plans to migrate to [[United States|America]]. This opportunity to attract German families to immigrate to Chile had to be done. The combined effort of Bernhard Eunom Philippi with Vicente Perez Rosales, made the colonisation a reality and proved to be a success, as the region later was very well developed in agricultural and forestry, with European technology. Also [[Germany|German]] [[school]]s proved to be the best in the Southern region of Chile.

== Local Attractions ==
The German Museum, Teatro del Lago, Cofradia Nautica de Frutillar and Patagonia Virgin are today's  main attractions in Frutillar.

'''The German Museum''': The museum opens daily and it is located in the centre of the bay of Frutillar, one of the most beautiful touristic villages of [[Lake Llanquihue]]. The German Colony that arrived to the city in 1856 built their houses, water mill, warehouse and gardens to live there; the descendents of these settlers decided to leave these buildings for a museum that shows the way they lived. It is composed of a garden, the machine warehouse, the water mill to grind the seeds, and the main house that is located uphill with a great view to the Lake.

'''[[Teatro del Lago]]''': Offers concerts all year round and is located in the main coastal road of the bay. The theatre is considered the largest in the country and the best acoustic theatre ever built in South America. Every year the musical festival traditionally conducts a continuous 2 week concert, called Musical Festival or “Semanas Musicales” this takes place at the end of January and the first week of February in the theatre. This cultural activity brings thousand of visitors every year. [[File:1406646072 captura de pantalla 2014 07 29 a las 110245-1000x621.png|thumb|Teatro del lago|201x201px]]
[[File:865392r.jpg|left|frameless|206x206px]]

'''Cofradia Nautica de Frutillar - Yacht Club''': Is the lake's largest and best equipped yacht club located in the bay 400&amp;nbsp;m south of Teatro del Lago, along the coastal road of Frutillar Bay.  The Club has activity all year; and promotes sailing in all categories. The yacht Club was established in 1986. There are 3 sailing schools in the bay that have been founded and promoted by “Cofradia”, also during the spring and summer the yacht club makes Regattas on the Bay and around the lake. 

'''Patagonia Virgin''': Is a new urban development that will have hotels, commerce, restaurants, golf course Nicklaus, apartments and houses, as well as trekking, polo and tennis. The village, which is at the foot of Patagonia Virgin, will have over 40 stores, shops and restaurants with wild forest and views to all four volcanoes accessing lake Llanquihue through the Frutillar Bay. It is located 200&amp;nbsp;m south of Cofradia yacht club.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''GEOS-3''', or Geodynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite 3, or GEOS-C, was the third and final satellite as part of NASA's Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite/Geodynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite program (NGSP)&lt;ref&gt;Henriksen, S. W. (ed) (1977) [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19780003602.pdf National Geodetic Satellite Program], NASA SP-365&lt;/ref&gt; to better understand and test satellite tracking systems.&lt;ref name=eoportal&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA - GEOS Program|url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/g/geos-nasa|publisher=eoPortal Directory|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For GEOS missions 1 and 2, GEOS stands for Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite; this was changed to Geodynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite for GEOS-3.&lt;ref name=eoportal /&gt;

== Introduction ==
The satellite mission was designed to further an understanding of the earth’s gravitational field, size and shape of the terrestrial geoid, deep ocean tides, sea state, current structure, crustal structure, solid earth dynamics, and remote sensing technology.&lt;ref name=jgr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanley|first=H. R.|title=The GEOS 3 Project|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=30 July  1979|pages=3779–3783|doi=10.1029/JB084iB08p03779|volume=84|bibcode=1979JGR....84.3779S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Rosenburg at NASA Headquarters initiated the GEOS-3 project in 1970.&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt; The project was to serve as a stepping stone between the GEOS program and the emerging NASA Earth and Ocean Physics Application Program.&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt; GEOS-1 and GEOS-2 had provided useful information about the structure of the earth’s gravitational field, but new technology was deemed necessary to gain a further understanding.&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt;  The project was initially cancelled due to budgetary concerns after an initial 1-year study, but was re-instated in late 1971.&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt;  The satellite was launched in April 9, 1975 and remained operational until late July 1979.&lt;ref name=jpl&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOS-3|url=http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/GEOS-3|publisher=JPL|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instruments ==
The following is a list of instruments/systems that were on board or part of the GEOS-3 satellite, including a description of their general purpose:&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ilrs&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOS 3|url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/satellite_missions/past_missions/geos_general.html|publisher=International Laser Ranging Service|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Radar Altimeter (ALT) - A multimode radar system with the ability to provide precise satellite-to-ocean surface height measurements.  The radar system provided global and intensive data gathering modes, which could provide height precision measurements at 50&amp;nbsp;cm and 20&amp;nbsp;cm respectively.
* Retroreflector Array (RRA) - An array of retroreflectors. These allow a ground-based laser to provide range information.
* Doppler System - A system of dual frequency space borne doppler beacons at 162 and 324&amp;nbsp;MHz and a ground-based receiver station.  This system was used to measure the effects of first-order ionospheric refraction and make corrections to the Doppler frequency.
* S-band Tracking System - A tracking system which had three modes of operations for satellite to satellite tracking, ground-station tracking, and direct unified S-band.
* C-band System - A system of two C-band radar transponders used to  better understand the accuracies of the gravimetric and geometric measurements. The system also supported the altimeter and C-band calibration.
* Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) - The SST experiment consisted of, the ground-based ATS ranging system, the wideband communication transponder on the ATS-6 geosynchronous spacecraft, and the ranging transponder on the LEO satellite.

== Impacts on the scientific community ==
The GEOS-3 mission provided data that furthered scientific understanding in various fields.  The ocean height data set from this mission provided the first comprehensive coverage in most areas of the world’s ocean’s, providing a better understanding of the Ocean Geoid.&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt;  Ocean height also provided information about quasi-stationary departures from the geoid, for events like currents, eddies, storm surges, etc.&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt;  The return waveform data was used to better understand the sea state at a level that was comparable to buoy-collected data.&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt;  An unexpected result was the ability to use waveform data to derive surface wind speed, and the ability to maintain track over terrain and ice&lt;ref name="jgr" /&gt;
Altimeter data from GEOS-3 has been utilized by many gravity models, including GEM-T3, JGM-1 and JGM-2 &lt;ref name="jpl"/&gt;

The '''Gaels of Scotland''' or, simply '''Gaels''', ({{lang-gd|Na Gàidheil}}) are an [[ethnolinguistic group]] found in [[Scotland]] - including the land of their origins, the [[Scottish Highlands]] ({{lang-gd|A' [[Gàidhealtachd]]}}) - and in the [[diaspora]] of Scotland within the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moffat |last2=Wilson |first1=Alistair |first2=James |date=2017 |title=The Scots: A Genetic Journey |publisher=Birrlin |chapter=Northwards }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaels|The Gaels]] as an ethno-linguistic group can also be found in [[Ireland]] and the [[Isle of Mann]]

== Gaelic ==
Within Scotland the term '''Gaelic''' most often refers to the [[Scots Gaelic]] language ({{lang-gd|Gàidhlig}}); however, it can also refer to the broader linguistic [[Goidelic]] group of [[Gaels]] – analogous with [[Hispanic]] (or [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]]) – that comprises the inhabitants the nations of [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]] and the [[Isle of Man]] ({{lang-gd|cànanan Goidhealach}}). In Ireland the term is pronounced slightly differently.

[[File:Dalriada.png|right|thumb|200px|Satellite image of Scotland and Ireland showing the approximate greatest extent of Dál Riata (shaded). The mountainous spine (Druim Alban) which separates the east and west coasts of Scotland can be seen.]]

== History ==
The Scots Gaels derive from the overkingdom of [[Dál Riata]], which generated various explanations of its origins, including a [[foundation myth]] of an invasion from Ireland and a more recent archaeological and linguistic analysis that points to a pre-existing maritime province united by the sea and isolated from the rest of Scotland by the mountainous ridge called the ''Druim Alban''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cscs.academicblogs.co.uk/how-british-is-scotland-archaeological-origins-of-scotland/|publisher=[[Centre for Scottish and Celtic Studies]]|title=How British is Scotland? Archaeological Origins of Scotland|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ewancampbell"&gt;Campbell, Ewan. "[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/scotsirish.htm Were the Scots Irish?]" in ''Antiquity'' No. 75 (2001). pp. 285–292.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological evidence relates to Ireland while the linguistic evidence relates to Scotland, absent any evidence of conflict either in that exchange or in the erasing of pre-existing culture within that exchange.{{clarify|date=November 2017}} The cultural exchange includes passage of the M222 genotype within Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotland's DNA: Tartan export |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/scotland-s-dna-who-do-you-think-you-are-part-4-1-1503458|newspaper=The Scotsman |date=3 March 2011 |access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Britain 500 CE.png|thumb|Sub-Roman Britain]]
The ethnolinguistic group expanded with the creation of the [[Kingdom of Alba]], subsuming within it the previously [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]]-speaking [[Picts]].

A similar pattern of expansion into the Brittonic [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and the [[Kingdom of Galloway]] occurred - although the latter had previously been subsumed into the [[Norse-Gael]] Irish Sea and Scottish Sea{{clarify|date=November 2017}} regions created at the same time the [[Vikings]] cut off the islands of [[Argyll]] and the [[Hebrides]] from the Kingdom of Alba. [[Galwegian Gaelic]] survived until 1760, whilst Strathclyde's transition is less well documented despite linguistic certainty that it became a Gaelic language region.

The assimilation of Strathclyde into what then become known as the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] - Scots (deriving from [[Scoti]]) becoming a [[demonym]] for [[Dál Riata]] - marks the highpoint of the Scots Gaels in Scotland, as the adjacent [[Anglo-Saxon]] dominated region of the previously Brittonic [[Lothian]] gradually exported an Anglo-Saxon language that became known as the [[Scots language]] into Scotland when it too accepted the superiority of the Scots Gael Kingship.

The expansion of the Scots Gael Kingship ended as such with the beginnings of the [[Scoto-Norman]] [[Royal House]] period that gradually - and with no deep personal connection to the origins of the Kingship in [[Dál Riata]] or the Kingdom of Alba - lost Scots Gaelic as its tongue. However, the Kingship eventually united the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of [[England]].

The [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] - [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] divide that henceforth took root meant survival of the [[Scots Gaelic]] language and a reemergence of Gaelic identity - where previously it was broadly [[Scottish national identity|Scottish]] - as Scotland's Kingship took the Anglo-Saxon derived [[Scots language]] as its tongue. [[Mary Queen of Scots]] was the last monarch who ruled with the historically given title ''of Scots'' that linked the monarchy with the ethnolinguistic group, while her grandfather [[James IV]] was the last known Gaelic language monarch.

With the culturally devastating [[Highland Clearances]], the spread of the Scots Gael diaspora into the region of the former British Empire has meant that Scots Gaelic is currently a transatlantic language (see [[Canadian Gaelic]]) while the diaspora covered a much wider area. In the early 21st century, the descendants of the Highland diaspora far outnumber the population in Scotland.

It is locally known as the site where the bodies of two Christian saints, Epictet and Astion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ro.orthodoxwiki.org/Epictet_%C8%99i_Astion_din_Halmyris |title=Epictet și Astion din Halmyris |accessdate=July 10, 2015 &lt;!-- 12:59 pm --&gt;  |publisher=OrthodoxWiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; were uncovered between 2001 and 2004.
 
==History of the Site==

Despite the creation of several Greek colonies along the Romanian Black Sea coast during the 7th century BC, no corresponding Greek structural remains have been found nearby Halmyris. The region was inhabited during the Second [[Iron Age]] by the [[Getae]] or [[Dacians]] as is evident by the discovery of several cremation burials within a possible [[Necropolis|necropolis]] that dates to the 4th-2nd centuries BC. 
While the first Roman occupation of the site seems to have been in the form of a turf-and-timber fort constructed during the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] period, the first stone [[Castra|castrum]] at Halmyris was built during the reign of the emperor [[Trajan]].  Although the original layout of the Trajanic fort is largely covered by later reconstructive phases, the plan seems to have been indicative of the 'typical' 2nd century layout of a Roman fort, composed of a rectangular defensive wall, rectangular towers and a gate in the middle of each of the walls.  The placement of the fort was strategically deliberate as it lay not only along the course of the [[Danube River]] but also at the very mouth of the Black Sea.  Early connections to the Roman fleet and its maritime activities at Halmyris are confirmed from epigraphic evidence mentioning the existence of a 'mariner's village' or ''vicus classicorum'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Zahariade and Alexandrescu, 2012, 37)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, a significant alteration of the defenses took place during the [[Tetrarchy]] period.  The new layout of the fort walls consisted of an irregular polygon bolstered by 15 towers and at least two well-defended gateways in the north and the west. Structures found within the fort include numerous [[barracks]], a private [[thermae]] or bathhouse and  a [[basilica]].  However, in the winter of 384/5, the Danube froze, allowing the foreign tribes to the north to cross and sack Halmyris.  A series of earthquakes in the 4th century and later that altered the course of the Danube led to the silting up of Halmyris' harbor and decreased its economic and strategic importance.  The final period of occupation seems to correspond with the reconstruction of the fort by the emperor [[Justinian]] which included the building of a monumental entrance way in the northeast wall of the fort.  Additionally, Halmyris became the site of one of the major bishoprics in the province as well as being named as one of the fifteen most important towns in the province of Scythia. 

Halmyris was the most easterly point of the Danubian border in Roman times and probably served as a supply centre for the fleet; early Roman inscriptions inform us of the existence of a "mariner's village"—''vicus classicorum''. During the late Roman period two units of the military fleet—''Classis in Plateypegiis'' and ''Musculi Schytici'' (which had little ships, suited for the Danube Delta) may have been hosted by this city.

As for religious life, we know that in 290 AD, during the persecutions ordered by [[Diocletian]], [[July 7 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|Saint Epictetus]] and Astion suffered martyrdom at Halmyris.

* Halmyris served as a depot for supplies, colonization and cultural exchange in the region for 1,100 years. It was occupied from the Iron Age to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]].
* The original fort was made of timber and turf, but as the fort gained importance and a regular garrison was established along the Danube, the fort was rebuilt in stone.
* Early in the fort's history, the Goths and Huns from the North crossed the Danube and conquered the fort. It was later re-captured by the Romans.
* In the early 4th century, the Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] added a basilica.
* A series of earthquakes altered the course of the Danube and the fort became more removed from the river. Halmyris gradually lost its importance and was abandoned.

==Current activities==
* The fort is being excavated by Dr. Mihail Zahariade and Dr. John Karavas.
* Current areas of excavation include the military barracks, northwestern towers and harbor installations.

An '''interlanguage''' is an [[idiolect]] that has been developed by a learner of a [[second language]] (or L2) which preserves some features of their [[first language]] (or L1), and can also overgeneralize some L2 writing and speaking rules. These two characteristics of an interlanguage result in the system's unique linguistic organization.

An interlanguage is [[idiosyncratic]]ally based on the learners' experiences with the L2. It can "[[Interlanguage fossilization|fossilize]]", or cease developing, in any of its developmental stages. The interlanguage rules are claimed to be shaped by several factors, including L1-transfer, previous learning strategies, strategies of L2 acquisition (i.e., simplification), L2 [[Communication strategies in second-language acquisition|communication strategies]] (i.e., circumlocution), and overgeneralization of L2 language patterns.

Interlanguage is based on the theory that there is a dormant psychological framework in the human brain that is activated when one attempts to learn a second language. Interlanguage theory is often credited to [[Larry Selinker]], who coined the terms "interlanguage" and "fossilization." [[Uriel Weinreich]] is credited with providing the foundational information that was the basis of Selinker's research. Selinker (1972) noted that in a given situation, the utterances produced by a learner are different from those [[native speaker]]s would produce had they attempted to convey the same meaning. This comparison suggests the existence of a separate linguistic system. This system can be observed when studying the utterances of the learner who attempts to produce meaning in their L2 speech; it is not seen when that same learner performs form-focused tasks, such as oral drills in a classroom.

Interlanguage can be variable across different contexts; for example, it may be more accurate, complex and fluent in one domain than in another.

To study the psychological processes involved one can compare the interlanguage utterances of the learner with two things:
#Utterances in the native language (L1) to convey the same message produced by the learner. 
#Utterances in the target language (L2) to convey the same message, produced by a native speaker of that language.

It is possible to apply an interlanguage perspective to a learner's underlying knowledge of the target language sound system (interlanguage [[phonology]]), grammar (morphology and syntax), vocabulary (lexicon), and language-use norms found among learners (interlanguage [[pragmatics]]).

By describing the ways in which learner language conforms to universal linguistic norms, interlanguage research has contributed greatly to our understanding of [[linguistic universals]] in [[second-language acquisition]].

== Background ==

Before the interlanguage hypothesis rose to prominence, the principal theory of second-language (L2) development was [[contrastive analysis]]. This theory assumed that learners' errors were caused by the difference between their L1 and L2. This approach was deficit-focused, in the sense that speech errors were thought to arise randomly and should be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Key Concepts in Second Language Acquisition|last = Loewen, Shawn;|first = Reinders, Hayo|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-230-23018-7|location = New York|pages = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further assumption followed that a sufficiently thorough analysis of the differences between learners' first and second languages could predict all of the difficulties they would face.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} This assumption was not based in rigorous analysis of learner language but rather was often anecdotal, and researchers' claims were prone to [[confirmation bias]].{{sfn|Tarone|2006}}

[[Robert Lado]] (1957) held that the claims of contrastive analysis should be viewed as hypothetical unless and until they were based on systematic analyses of learner speech data.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} Around this time, second-language acquisition research shifted from hypotheses of language learning and the development of language-teaching materials to the systematic analysis of learner speech and writing with the practice of [[Error analysis (linguistics)|error analysis]].{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} Although this was initially done to validate the claims of contrastive analysis, researchers found that many learner behaviours could not be easily explained by transfer from learners' L1 to their L2.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}}

The idea that language learners' linguistic systems were different from both their L1 and L2 was developed independently at around the same time by several different researchers.{{sfn|Tarone|2006}} William Nemser called it an ''approximative system'' and [[Pit Corder]] called it ''transitional competence''.

== Variability ==
Interlanguage is claimed to be a language in its own right. Learner language [[Variation (linguistics)|varies]] much more than native-speaker language. Selinker noted that in a given situation the utterances produced by the learner are different from those native speakers would produce had they attempted to convey the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Selinker|first1=L|title=Interlanguage|journal=International Review of Applied Linguistics|date=1972|volume=10|pages=209–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison reveals a separate linguistic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarone|first1=E|contribution=Interlanguage|editor-last=Berns|editor-first=Margie|title=The concise encyclopedia of applied linguistics|date=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-08-096502-4|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlanguage can be observed to be variable across different contexts. For example, it may be more accurate, complex and fluent in one discourse domain than in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kasper|first1=Gabriele,|last2=Blum-Kulka|first2=Shoshana, eds.|title=Interlanguage pragmatics|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506602-2|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variability is observed when comparing the utterances of the learner in conversation to form-focused tasks, such as memory-based oral drills in a classroom. Spontaneous conversation is more likely to involve the use of interlanguage. A learner may produce a target-like variant (e.g. 'I don't') in one context and a non-target like variant (e.g. 'me no') in another. Scholars from different traditions have taken opposing views on the importance of this phenomenon. Those who bring a [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] perspective to second-language acquisition typically regard variability as nothing more than performance errors, and not worthy of systematic inquiry. On the other hand, those who approach it from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] or [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] orientation view variability as an inherent feature of the learner's interlanguage. In these approaches, a learner's preference for one linguistic variant over another can depend on social (contextual) variables such as the status or role of the person the learner is speaking to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kasper|first1=Gabriele|last2=Blum-Kulka|first2=Shoshana, eds.|title=Interlanguage pragmatics|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506602-2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preference can also be based on linguistic variables such as the phonological environment or neighboring features marked for formality or informality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fasold|first1=R|last2=Preston|first2=D|chapter=The psycholinguistic unity of inherent variability: Old Occam whips out his razor|pages=45–69|editor1-last=Bayley|editor1-first=R|editor2-last=Lucas|editor2-first=C|date=2007|title=Sociolinguistic Variation: Theory, methods, and applications|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variability in learner language distinguishes between "free variation", which has not been shown to be systematically related to accompanying linguistic or social features, and "systematic variation", which has.

=== Free variation ===

Free variation in the use of a language feature is usually taken as a sign that it has not been fully acquired. The learner is still trying to figure out what rules govern the use of alternate forms. This type of variability seems to be most common among beginning learners, and may be entirely absent among the more advanced.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Systematic variation ===

Systematic variation is brought about by changes in the linguistic, psychological, and social context. Linguistic factors are usually extremely local. For example, in earlier stages of acquisition, a learner will often display systematic constraints on their ability to use the correct tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Walt|contribution=Systematic variability in second-language tense marking|editor-last=Eisenstein|editor-first=Miriam R.|title=The dynamic interlanguage: Empirical studies in second-language variation|date=1989|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0-306-43174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may say "Last year we travel to the ocean" rather than "Last year we travelled to the ocean." They also tend to make more mistakes when the word following a [[grammatical tense|tensed]] word begins with a consonant (e.g., burned bacon). But they will show higher accuracy when the word following the tensed word begins with a nonconsonant (e.g., burned eggs).

=== Other factors ===

Social factors may include a change in register or the familiarity of interlocutors. In accordance with [[communication accommodation theory]], learners may adapt their speech to either converge with, or diverge from, their interlocutor's usage. For example, they may deliberately choose to address a non-target form like "me no" to an English teacher in order to assert identity with a non-mainstream ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rampton|first1=Ben|title=Crossing : Language &amp; Ethnicity among Adolescents.|date=2005|publisher=St Jerome Pub.|location=Manchester|isbn=9781900650779|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important psychological factor is usually regarded as attention to form, which is related to planning time. The more time that learners have to plan, the more target-like their production may be. Thus, literate learners may produce much more target-like forms in a writing task for which they have 30 minutes to plan, than in conversation where they must produce language with almost no planning at all. The impact of alphabetic literacy level on an L2 learner's ability to pay attention to form is as yet unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarone|first1=Elaine|last2=Bigelow|first2=Martha|last3=Hansen|first3=Kit|title=Literacy and second language oracy|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-442300-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Affective factors|Affective factors]] also play an important role in systematic variation. For example, learners in a stressful situation (such as a formal exam) may produce fewer target-like forms than they would in a comfortable setting. This clearly interacts with social factors, and attitudes toward the interlocutor and topic also play important roles.

== Stages of development ==

Individuals learning a second language may not always hear spoken L2 words as separate units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altarriba|first1=Jeanette|last2=Heredia|first2=Roberto R., eds.|title=An introduction to bilingualism : principles and practies|date=2008|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some words might blend together and become a single unit in the learner's L2 system. The blended words are called "prefabricated patterns" or "chunks". These chunks are often not immediately obvious to the learner or anyone that listens to them speak, but may be noticed as the learner's L2 system becomes more developed and they use the chunk in a context where it does not apply. For example, if an English learner hears sentences beginning with "do you", they may associate it with being an indicator of a question but not as two separate words. To them, the word is "doyou". They may happen to say "What do you doing?" instead of "What are you doing?" Eventually the learner will learn to break the chunk up in to its component words and use them correctly.

When learners experience significant restructuring in their L2 systems, they sometimes show a U-shaped learning pattern. For instance, a group of English language learners moved, over time, from accurate usage of the "-ing" present progressive morpheme, to incorrectly omitting it, and finally, back to correct usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lightbown|first1=P|contribution=Exploring relationships between developmental and instructional sequences in L2 acquisition|editor-last1=Seliger|editor-first1=H|editor-last2=Long|editor-first2=M.H.|title=Classroom oriented research in second language acquisition|date=1983|publisher=Newbury House|location=Rowley (MA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the period of incorrect usage is seen as a learning regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altarriba|first1=Jeanette|last2=Heredia|first2=Roberto R., eds.|title=An introduction to bilingualism : principles and practies|date=2008|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8058-5135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is likely that when the learners first acquired the new "-ing" morpheme or "chunk", they were not aware of all of the rules that apply to its use. As their knowledge of tense in English expanded, this disrupted their correct usage of the morpheme. They eventually returned to correct usage when they gained greater understanding of the tense rules in English. These data provide evidence that the learners were initially producing output based on rote memory of individual words containing the present progressive "-ing" morpheme. However, in the second stage their systems contained the rule that they should use the bare infinitive form to express present action, without a separate rule for the use of "-ing". Finally, they learned the rule for appropriate use of "-ing".

The "chunking" method enables a learner to practice speaking their L2 before they correctly break the chunk up in to its component parts. According to interlanguage theory, this seeming progression and regression of language learning is an important and positive manifestation of the learner's developing understanding of the grammar of the target language.

== Fossilization ==
{{Main|Interlanguage fossilization}}
An interlanguage can fossilize, or cease developing, in any of its developmental stages. Fossilization is the process of 'freezing' of the transition between the L1 and L2, and is regarded as the final stage of interlanguage development. It can occur even in motivated learners who are continuously exposed to their L2 or have adequate learning support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Han|first1=ZhaoHong|title=Fossilization in adult second language acquisition|date=2004|publisher=Multilingual Matters|location=Clevedon|isbn=1-85359-686-8|pages=12–24|edition=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for this phenomenon may be due to complacency or inability to overcome the obstacles to acquiring native proficiency in the L2. Fossilization occurs often in adult language learners. It can also occur when a learner succeeds in conveying messages with their current L2 knowledge. The need to correct the form/structure is therefore not present. The learner fossilizes the form instead of correcting it.

== Linguistic universals ==
Research on [[universal grammar]] (UG) has had a significant effect on [[second-language acquisition]] (SLA) theory. In particular, scholarship in the interlanguage tradition has sought to show that learner languages conform to UG at all stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=VanPatten|first1=Bill|last2=Williams|first2=Jessica|title=Theories in second language acquisition : an introduction|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-82421-7|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlanguage UG differs from native UG in that interlanguage UGs vary greatly in mental representations from one L2 user to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=VanPatten|first1=Bill|last2=Williams|first2=Jessica|title=Theories in second language acquisition : an introduction|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-82421-7|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variability arises from differing relative influences on the interlanguage UG, such as existing L1 knowledge and UG constraints. An example of a UG constraint is an "[[locality (linguistics)#Wh-island constraint|island constraint]]," where the ''wh''-phrase in a question has a finite number of possible positions. Island constraints are based on the concept that there are certain syntactical domains within a sentence that act as phrase boundaries. It is theorized that the same constraints that act on a native UG are also often present in an interlanguage UG.

== Versus creoles and pidgins ==

The concept of interlanguage is closely related to other types of language, especially [[creole language|creoles]] and [[pidgin]]s. Each of these languages has its own grammar and phonology. The difference is mostly one of variability, as a learner's interlanguage is spoken only by the learner and changes frequently as they become more proficient in the language. In contrast, creoles and pidgins are generally the product of groups of people in contact with another language, and therefore may be more stable.

The '''International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences''' ('''IUPPS''')  is a [[learned society]], linked through the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]] to [[UNESCO]], and concerned with the study of [[prehistory]] and [[protohistory]]. In the words of its [[Constitution (corporate)|constitution]]:

:''The UISPP is committed to promote prehistoric and protohistoric studies by the organisation of international [[congress]]es and of large-scale [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] of international significance; by sponsoring [[Academic publishing|scholarly publications]] of international scope as well as [[Academic conference|conferences]] and other learned meetings; and in general by advancing research by the co-operation and mutual understanding among scholars from all countries''.

== Origins ==

The origins of the IUPPS lie in an 1865 meeting of the Società Italiana di Scienze Naturali ({{lang-en|Italian Society of Natural Science}}) that led to the creation of the ''Congrès paléoethnologique international'' (CPI; {{lang-en|International Paleoethnologic Congress}}). The first meeting of the CPI was held in 1866 and in 1867 the name was changed to ''Congrès international d'anthropologie et d'archéologie préhistoriques'' (CIAAP; International Congress of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archaeology).

A permanent council of the CIAAP was founded in 1880, and in 1930 a merger with the ''Institut International d'Anthropologie'' led to the creation of the ''Congrès international des Sciences préhistoriques et protohistoriques'' (CISPP). In 1954, the permanent council decided to affiliate the CISPP with a member organisation of UNESCO, the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences. This required a change of name, and the CISPP became the ''International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences'' (IUPPS) in order to gain access to UNESCO funds.

UISPP became a member of the Unesco associate International Council of Philosophy and Human Sciences, since September 29th, 1955. As an international association of scholars, its aim is the collaboration of scholars from all countries through initiatives that may contribute for the advancement of prehistoric and protohistoric sciences, based on full academic freedom and refusing any sort of discrimination based on race, philosophical or ideological judgement, ethnic or geographic affiliation, nationality, sex, language or other, since discrimination is, by definition, the negation of the scientific approach. It also rejects any attempts of fictional rewriting of the past or of negationism, and it doesn’t exclude any bona fide scholar from its scientific activities.

== Executive Committee ==

The executive committee of UISPP serves the purpose of maintaining the traditions of the UISPP and follows the development of the activities within the UISPP. It works in collaboration with the bureau, when asked, to represent the UISPP and to follow up the activities of the scientific commissions.
The executive committee follows up the progress of the organization of the world congress, does only intervene in the organization of it when unexpected events appear or when important delays in the program proposed by the organizing institution are noted.
It is composed by the Board (President, Secretary-General, Treasurer, Vice-President, Deputy Secretary-General) and the Presidents of all International Scientific Commissions of UISPP.

== Scientific Commissions ==

The general assembly decides of the creation of scientific commissions, after advice of the executive committee. Their objective is to promote and coordinate internationally research in a specific or specialized domain of the prehistoric and protohistoric sciences between each world congress. The commissions are grouped into six larger domains. This list is not limited.
- Historiography, methods and theories (history of archaeology, theories and methods in archaeology, various methods used in the archaeology and related to sciences, natural sciences, applied sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, economic sciences, etc.),
- Culture, economy and environments (specific periods, diachronic themes, regional peculiarities),
- Cultures and economy,
- Archaeology of specific environments (deserts, mountains, volcanic areas, coastal areas, islands, etc.),
- Art and culture (all forms of artistic expression during prehistory and protohistory, including parietal art and mobile art),
- Archaeology and societies (interaction between archaeology and current society, including strategies for heritage management or for scientific research, and questions of the public). 

The principal activities of a scientific commission are:
The setting up of an annual meeting of the commission, to elaborate an activity program for the next year and accept the report of the previous meeting,
The dispersion of an electronic newsletter, at least once a year, for the members of the commission, with copy to the secretary general and with a list of all the members of the commission, as well as their corresponding email and postal address,
The organization of scientific activities (colloquia, conferences, sessions, thematic schools) during each UISPP world congress and at least once in between; these activities are published.

The Eleventh congress should have been held in 1986 at Southampton, but the decision of the British organising committee, led by [[Peter Ucko]], to exclude South African and [[Namibia]]n delegates, despite they were opposed to apartheid, led to the foundation of the [[World Archaeological Congress]] and the delay of the IUPPS congress until 1987. Whereas the majoriy of UISPP members rejected the split as a divide of researchers and an opportunist move, writing in 1987, Peter Ucko still described the IUPPS as,

:a dinosaur which continues to seek to manipulate the world situation according to its archaic Western European preconceptions about what is relevant and important and what is not. It does so by devices such as the imposition of white rules  and regulations which no one bothers to explain and by the manipulation of bureaucratic procedures.

UISPP lamented this approach and kept its activity. Since 2005 relations between UISPP and WAC were resumed. Despite initial divides, UISPP remained focused in prehistoric and protohistoric research, while WAC evolved primarily into political committed approaches, the two organisations having therefore different scopes.

The XVIII world Congress of UISPP will be held in Paris, June 2018. It will have as a major topic "Adaptation and sustainability of prehistoric and protohistoric societies confronted to climate change". This major congress will be articulated with the current refoundation of Humanities that is being led by the International Council for the Philosophy and Human Sciences (that includes UISPP) and UNESCO. As for each worldwide UISPP congress, the congress is opened to any other sessions, independently of the above general theme, which could be proposed during the general call for sessions.

[[Image:Kelashin stele 60613-94103.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A depiction of the Kelashin Stele from the early 20th century]]

The '''Kelashin Stele''' (also '''Kelishin''', '''Keli-Shin''') (From [[Kurdish Language]]: Blue Stone) found in [[Kelashin]], [[Iraq]], bears an important [[Urartian language|Urartian]]-[[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] bilingual text dating to c. 800 BC, first described by [[Friedrich Eduard Schulz]] in 1827. Part of Schulz's notes were lost when he was killed by [[Kurd]]ish "bandits", and later expeditions were either prevented by weather conditions or Kurdish brigands, so that a copy ([[latex]] [[squeeze (copying method)|squeeze]]) of the inscription could only be made in 1951 by G. Cameron, and again in 1976 by an Italian party under heavy military protection.

The inscription describes the acquisition of the city of [[Musasir]] (Ardini) by the Urartian king [[Ishpuinis of Urartu|Ishpuini]].

'''Llafur''' (''Labour'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) – the full name of which is '''Llafur: The Welsh People's History Society''' – was founded in 1970 as ''Llafur: the Society for the Study of Welsh Labour History'' to promote the study of the history of the working people of [[Wales]]. Its main activities are the publication of the journal ''Llafur'' and a number of individual books. The Society also organises regular day schools and events to engage a wider audience with Welsh People's History. 

Llafur has several stated aims.&lt;ref name="Llafur aim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Llafur's aims|url=http://www.llafur.org/indexe.htm|work=Llafur: Welsh People's History Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Our aims include the following:
* bringing together those interested in the history of the working class and its organisations, unions, co-operative societies or political bodies
* publishing an annual journal - Llafur
* promoting people’s history by working with other groups and organisations
* encouraging, helping, organising and developing such interest throughout the labour movement in Wales

''Llafur: the journal of the Society for the Study of Welsh Labour History'' is published in annual parts (four parts to a volume) and contains scholarly articles and book reviews relating to labour and [[people's history]]. The journal is included in the [[National Library of Wales#Welsh Journals Online|Welsh Journals Online]] project at the [[National Library of Wales]].

'''Marco Gonzalez''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site located near the southern tip of [[Ambergris Caye]] off the coast of [[Belize]]. It was first recorded in 1984 by Drs. [[Elizabeth Graham (academic)|Elizabeth Graham]] and [[David Pendergast]], and was named by them after their local guide.

The existence of the site, which is located approximately {{convert|8|km|mi}} south of [[San Pedro Town|San Pedro]], had been known to the town's inhabitants for many years, as had most of the other sites that dot the island. The site was excavated by Drs. Graham and Pendergast between 1984 and 1994.

==Topography==
The ruins are about {{convert|185|by|355|m|ft}} in size, and are easily visible from the air flying into San Pedro town. The low-lying area around the site is predominated by red (''Rhizophora mangle'') and black (''Avicennia nitida'') [[mangroves]]. The site itself is covered by white mangrove (''Laguncularia racemosa''), [[gumbo-limbo]] (''Bursera simaruba''), [[Cameraria (plant)|white poisonwood]] (''Cameraria belizensis''), [[Acoelorraphe wrightii|silver palmettos]] (''Thrinax sp.''), [[Sabal palmetto|cabbage palms]] (''Roystonea oleracea'') and a variety of shrubbery. It is roughly {{convert|3.6|m|ft}} above sea level, slightly higher than the surrounding swamps due to accumulated [[anthrosol]], soil composed primarily of artefacts (e.g., pottery, tools), conch and other shells, building remains and other debris resulting from millennia of human habitation. The presence of artefacts beneath the mangal swamps indicates that the site was once larger than what is now exposed.

Surrounded by thick jungle, access to the site is difficult, especially during and immediately after the rainy season. The trails leading there have become increasingly overgrown and visitors are rare.

==Ruins==
{{Maya civilization}}
{{further|Maya architecture}}
There are at least 49 distinct structures and walls within the mapped area of the site. The structures at the northern end appear to be arranged around [[plaza]]s, while elsewhere the building plan appears less formal. All of the structures are relatively low platforms, ranging in height from {{convert|30|cm|in}} to {{convert|4.2|m|ft}}. There are none of the [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] typical of other Mayan sites in this region.

Building foundations are composed mainly of blocks of [[Pleistocene]] [[limestone]] that was most likely quarried from local sources. Other building materials include the [[queen conch]] ''Strombus gigas'' as well as other shells. Crude [[plaster]] floors were found in some structures, and evidence suggests that many of the habitations were of pole-and-thatch-roof design.

The site is littered with enormous amounts of broken [[Maya ceramics|pottery]], as well as conch shells, chert tools and human bones. There is considerable evidence of excessive [[looting]].

==History==
{{further|Mesoamerican chronology}}
The excavations conducted by Graham and Pendergast in 1989 indicate that initial occupation of the site occurred about 2,100 years ago, during the late [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] period. From then, the site appears to have been continuously inhabited until roughly 1500 CE, at which time it was abruptly abandoned. The peak period of occupation at the site was during the Postclassic period, from about 1200 to 1400 CE.

The Maya inhabitants are believed to have been predominantly fisherfolk and later, during the late [[Classic Maya collapse|Classic period]] (from about 800–500 CE), involved in intensive [[salt production]]. Evidence suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of Marco Gonzalez [[Trade in Maya civilization|traded]] extensively with other Maya sites. The abundant [[pottery]] that litters the site is made from mixtures of clay and quartz; since there is no available source of these materials on Ambergris Caye, they (or perhaps even the pots themselves) must have been brought to the site from overseas. Other artefacts at the site, such as chert and flint tools and other granite artefacts, minor jade and obsidian, were also obviously imported from elsewhere since the materials have no natural source anywhere on Ambergris Caye. The site's setting on the tip of the island may have given it a strategic position on maritime trade routes that existed at the time.

===Theories on abandonment===
In 1993, a geological history of southern Ambergris Caye and the Marco Gonzalez area was published by R.K. Dunn and S.J. Mazzullo, which provides a theory as to why the site was abruptly abandoned around 500 years ago. A representative cross-section of the site revealed evidence that, between roughly 2000 and 1000 years ago, the coastal geography changed from open, shallow sea to mangal swampland.

Rapid rising in sea levels caused by the melting of the last Pleistocene glaciers caused the geography of the coastal area around Marco Gonzalez to change. As sea levels rose, the coastline shifted to shelter the surrounding area from currents, allowing mangrove swamps to completely surround the site. Eventually, the encroachment of the surrounding jungle and swamplands made the site inhospitable, and the Maya abandoned it.

The discovery of artefacts below present sea level, and beneath the mangrove peats, indicated that the habitable area of the site was much larger in the past than now; and subsequently that the inhabitants moved to progressively higher ground as sea level rose and the swamps encroached upon them.

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

'''Marxist philosophy'''  or  '''Marxist theory''' are works in [[philosophy]] that are strongly influenced by [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Historical materialism|materialist]] approach to [[theory]], or works written by [[Marxist]]s. Marxist philosophy may be broadly divided into [[Western Marxism]], which drew out of various sources, and the official [[philosophy in the Soviet Union]], which enforced a rigid reading of Marx called [[dialectical materialism]], in particular during the 1930s.
Marxist philosophy is not a strictly defined sub-field of philosophy, because the diverse influence of Marxist theory has extended into fields as varied as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[theoretical psychology]] and [[philosophy of science]], as well as its obvious influence on [[political philosophy]] and the [[philosophy of history]]. The key characteristics of Marxism in philosophy are its materialism and its commitment to political practice as the end goal of all thought.

Marxist theorist [[Louis Althusser]], for example, defined philosophy as "[[class struggle]] in theory", thus radically separating himself from those who claimed philosophers could adopt a "[[God's eye view]]" as a purely neutral judge.

==Marxism and philosophy==
The philosopher [[Étienne Balibar]] wrote in 1996 that "there is no Marxist philosophy and there never will be; on the other hand, Marx is more important for philosophy than ever before."&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Balibar]], 1993. ''La philosophie de Marx'', [[La Découverte]], Repères (English edition, ''The Philosophy of Marx''. Verso, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; So even the existence of Marxist philosophy is debatable (the answer may depend on what is meant by "philosophy," a complicated question in itself). Balibar's remark is intended to explain the significance of the final line of [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] 11 ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), which can be read as an epitaph for philosophy: "The philosophers have only ''interpreted'' the world, in various ways; the point is to ''change'' it".

If this claim (which Marx originally intended as a criticism of [[German Idealism]] and the more moderate [[Young Hegelian]]s) is still more or less the case in the 21st century, as many [[Marxist]]s {{Who|date=May 2011}} would claim, then Marxist theory is in fact the practical continuation of the philosophical tradition, while much of philosophy is still politically irrelevant. Many critics{{Who|date=May 2011}}, both philosophers outside Marxism and some Marxist philosophers, feel that this is too quick a dismissal of the post-Marxian philosophical tradition.

Much sophisticated and important thought has taken place after the writing of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]; much or perhaps even all of it has been influenced, subtly or overtly, by Marxism. Simply dismissing all philosophy as sophistry might condemn Marxism to a simplistic [[empiricism]] or [[economism]], crippling it in practice and making it comically simplistic at the level of theory.

Nonetheless, the force of Marx's opposition to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and to any "philosophy" divorced from [[politics|political]] practice remains powerful even to a contemporary reader. Marxist and Marx-influenced 20th century theory, such as (to name a few random examples) the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|critical theory of the Frankfurt School]], the political writing of [[Antonio Gramsci]], and the [[neo-Marxism]] of [[Fredric Jameson]], must take Marx's condemnation of philosophy into account, but many such thinkers also feel a strong need to remedy the perceived theoretical problems with [[orthodox Marxism]].

Such problems might include a too-simple [[economic determinism]], an untenable theory of [[ideology]] as "[[false consciousness]]," or a simplistic model of state power rather than [[hegemony]]. So Marxist philosophy must continue to take account of advances in the theory of politics developed after Marx, but it must also be wary of a descent into [[theoreticism]] or the temptations of [[idealism]].

Étienne Balibar claimed that if one philosopher could be called a "Marxist philosopher", that one would doubtlessly be [[Louis Althusser]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Althusser proposed a 'new definition' of philosophy as "class struggle in theory"... marxism had proper signification (and original "problematic") ''only'' insofar as it was the theory of ''the'' tendency towards communism, and ''in view'' of its realization. The criteria of acceptation or rejectal of a 'marxist' proposition was always the same, whether it was presented as 'epistemological' or as 'philosophical': it was in the act of rendering intelligible a ''communist policy'', or not." (''Ecrits pour Althusser'', 1991, p.98). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, "Althusser never ceased to put in question the ''images of communism'' that Marxist theory and ideology carried on: but he did it in the name of communism itself." Althusser thus criticized the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionist]] image which made of communism an ultimate stage of history, as well as the apocalyptic images which made it a "society of transparence", "without contradiction" nor ideology. Balibar observes that, in the end, Althusser enjoined the most sober definition of communism, exposed by Marx in ''[[The German Ideology]]'': ''Communism is "not a state of the future, but the real movement which destroys the existing state of being.".''

== The Philosophy of Marx ==
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was an important figure in the development of Marxism.]]

There are endless interpretations of the "philosophy of Marx", from the interior of the Marxist movement as well as in its exterior. Although some have separated Marx's works between a "[[young Marx]]" (in particular the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'') and a "mature Marx" or also by separating it into purely philosophical works, economics works and political and historical interventions, Étienne Balibar (1993) has pointed out that Marx's works can be divided into "economic works" (''[[Das Kapital]]'', 1867), "philosophical works" and "historical works" (''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', the 1871 ''[[The Civil War in France|Civil War in France]]'' which concerned the [[Paris Commune]] and acclaimed it as the first "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", etc.)

Marx's philosophy is thus inextricably linked to his [[critique of political economy]] and to his historical interventions in the [[workers' movement]], such as the 1875 ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'' or ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', written with Engels (who was observing the [[Chartist movement]]) a year before the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Both after the defeat of the French socialist movement during [[French coup of 1851|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 1851 coup]] and then after the crushing of the 1871 Paris Commune, Marx's thought transformed itself.

Marxism's philosophical roots were thus commonly explained as derived from three sources: English [[political economy]], French [[republicanism]] and [[Radicalization|radicalism]], and German idealist philosophy. Although this "three sources" model is an oversimplification, it still has some measure of truth.

On the other hand, [[Costanzo Preve]] (1990) has assigned four "masters" to Marx: [[Epicurus]] (to whom he dedicated his thesis, ''Difference of natural philosophy between [[Democritus]] and Epicurus'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of [[liberty]]; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], from which come his idea of [[egalitarian]] [[democracy]]; [[Adam Smith]], from whom came the idea that the grounds of [[property]] is [[Manual labour|labour]]; and finally [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

"Vulgar Marxism" (or codified [[dialectical materialism]]) was seen as little other than a variety of [[economic determinism]], with the alleged determination of the [[ideology|ideological]] [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] by the economical [[infrastructure]]. This [[positivism|positivist]] reading, which mostly based itself on Engels' latter writings in an attempt to theorize "[[scientific socialism]]" (an expression coined by Engels) has been challenged by Marxist theorists, such as Lukacs, Gramsci, Althusser or, more recently, Étienne Balibar.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Hegel ===
{{See also|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel}}
Marx developed a comprehensive, theoretical understanding of political reality early in his intellectual and activist career by means of a critical adoption and radicalization of the categories of 18th and 19th century German Idealist thought.  Of particular importance is Hegel's appropriation of Aristotle's organicist and essentialist categories in the light of Kant's transcendental turn.&lt;ref name="Meikle"&gt;Meikle, ''Essentialism in the Thought of Karl Marx'', Open Court Publishing Company (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

Marx builds on four contributions Hegel makes to our philosophical understanding.  They are: (1) the replacement of mechanism and atomism with Aristotelean categories of organicism and essentialism, (2) the idea that world history progresses through stages, (3) the difference between natural and historical (dialectical) change, and (4) the idea that dialectical change proceeds through contradictions in the thing itself.

'''(1) Aristotelian Organicism and Essentialism'''

(a) Hegel adopts the position that chance is not the basis of phenomena and that events are governed by laws.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|31}}  Some have falsely attributed to Hegel the position that phenomena are governed by transcendent, supersensible ideas that ground them.  On the contrary, Hegel argues for the organic unity between universal and particular.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|31}}  Particulars are not mere token types of universals; rather, they relate to each other as a part relates to a whole.  This latter has import for Marx's own conception of law and necessity.

(b) In rejecting the idea that laws merely describe or independently ground phenomena, Hegel revives the Aristotlean position that law or principle is something implicit in a thing, a potentiality which is not actual but which is in the process of becoming actual.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|31}} This means that if we want to know the principle governing something, we have to observe its typical life-process and figure out its characteristic behavior.  Observing an acorn on its own, we can never deduce that it is an oak tree.  To figure out what the acorn is - and also what the oak tree is - we have to observe the line of development from one to the other.

(c) The phenomena of history arise from a whole with an essence which undergoes transformation of form and which has an end or telos.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} For Hegel, the essence of humanity is freedom, and the telos of that essence is the actualization of that freedom.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Like Aristotle, Hegel believes the essence of a thing is revealed in the entire, typical process of development of that thing.  Looked at purely formally, human society has a natural line of development in accordance with its essence just like any other living thing.  This process of development appears as a succession of stages of world history.

'''(2) The Stages of World History'''

Human history passes through several stages, in each of which is materialized a higher level of human consciousness of freedom.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Each stage also has its own principle or law according to which it develops and lives in accordance with this freedom.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Yet the law is not free-standing.  It is delivered by means of the actions of men which spring from their needs, passions, and interests.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Teleology, according to Hegel, is not opposed to the efficient causation provided by passion; on the contrary, the latter is the vehicle realizing the former.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Hegel consistently lays more stress on passion than on the more historically specifiable interests of men.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Marx will reverse this priority.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

'''(3) The Difference Between Natural and Historical Change'''

Hegel distinguishes as Aristotle did not between the application of organic, essentialist categories to the realm of human history and the realm of organic nature.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|33}} According to Hegel, human history strives toward perfectibility, but nature does not.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Marx deepens and expands this idea into the claim that humankind itself can adapt society to its own purposes rather than adapting themselves to it.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

Natural and historical change, according to Hegel, have two different kinds of essences.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Organic natural entities develop through a straightforward process, relatively simple to comprehend at least in outline.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Historical development, however, is a more complex process.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} Its specific difference is its "dialectical" character.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The process of natural development occurs in a relatively straight line from the germ to the fully realized being and back to the germ again.  Some accident from the outside might come along to interrupt this process of development, but if left to its own devices, it proceeds in a relatively straightforward manner.

Society's historical development is internally more complex.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The transaction from potentiality to actuality is mediated by consciousness and will.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The essence realized in the development of human society is freedom, but freedom is precisely that ability to negate the smooth line of development and go off in novel, hitherto unforeseen directions.  As humankind's essence reveals itself, that revelation is at the same time the subversion of itself.  Spirit is constantly at war with itself.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} This appears as the contradictions constituting the essence of Spirit.

'''(4) Contradiction'''

In the development of a natural thing, there is by and large no contradiction between the process of development and the way that development must appear.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} So the transition from an acorn, to an oak, to an acorn again occurs in a relatively uninterrupted flow of the acorn back to itself again.  When change in the essence takes place, as it does in the process of evolution, we can understand the change mostly in mechanical terms using principles of genetics and natural selection.

The historical process, however, never attempts to preserve an essence in the first place.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} Rather, it develops an essence through successive forms.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} This means that at any moment on the path of historical change, there is a contradiction between what exists and what is in the process of coming-to-be.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} The realization of a natural thing like a tree is a process that by and large points back toward itself: every step of the process takes place in order to reproduce the genus.  In the historical process, however, what exists, what is actual, is imperfect.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|37}} It is inimical to the potential.  What is trying to come into existence - freedom - inherently negates everything preceding it and everything existing, since no actual existing human institution can possibly embody pure human freedom.  So the actual is both itself and its opposite (as potential).&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|37}} And this potential (freedom) is never inert but constantly exerts an impulse toward change.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

=== The rupture with German Idealism and the Young Hegelians ===
{{Main|German Idealism|Young Hegelians}}
Marx did not study directly with Hegel, but after Hegel died Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself. However, Marx and Engels came to disagree with Bruno Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic. Having achieved his thesis on the ''Difference of natural philosophy between [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]]'' in 1841, the young Marx progressively broke away with the [[Prussia]]n [[university]] and its teachings impregnated by German Idealism ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and Hegel).

Along with Engels, who observed the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he cut away with the environment in which he grew up and encountered the [[proletariat]] in France and Germany. He then wrote a scathing criticism of the Young Hegelians in two books, ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1845), and ''The German Ideology'' (1845), in which he criticized not only Bauer but also [[Max Stirner]]'s ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), considered as one of the founding book of [[individualist anarchism]]. Max Stirner claimed that all ideals were inherently [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienating]], and that replacing God with Humanity, as did [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] in ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), was not sufficient. According to Stirner, any ideals, God, Humanity, the [[nationalism|Nation]], or even the [[Revolution]] alienated the "Ego". Marx also criticized [[Proudhon]], who had become famous with his cry "[[Property is theft!]]", in ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1845).

Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German Idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head," in his own view of his role, by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas, instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]").

But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic, as Stirner himself had pointed out, and explained that the alienation described by the Young Hegelians was in fact the result of the structure of the economy itself. Furthermore, he [[Marx's theory of human nature|criticized Feuerbach's conception of human nature]] in his sixth thesis on Feuerbach as an abstract "kind" which incarnated itself in each singular individual: "Feuerbach resolves the essence of [[religion]] into the essence of man (''menschliche Wesen'', human nature). But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations."

Thereupon, instead of founding itself on the singular, concrete individual [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], as did classic philosophy, including [[contractualism]] ([[Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Rousseau]]) but also [[political economy]], Marx began with the totality of social relations: labour, language and all which constitute our human existence. He claimed that [[individualism]] was the result of [[commodity fetishism]] or alienation. Some critics have claimed that meant that Marx enforced a strict [[social determinism]] which destroyed the possibility of [[free will]].

==== Criticisms of the "human rights" ====
In the same way, following [[Gracchus Babeuf|Babeuf]], considered as one of the founder of communism during the [[French Revolution]], he criticized the 1789 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as a "bourgeois declaration" of the rights of the "egoistic individual", ultimately based on the "right to private property", which [[economism]] deduced from its own implicit "philosophy of the subject", which asserts the preeminence of an individual and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] subject over social relations. On the other hand, Marx also criticized [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s [[utilitarianism]].

Alongside [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]], Marx thus takes a place amongst the 19th century philosophers who criticized this pre-eminence of the subject and its [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/durkheim/ ; See section on "The Individual and Society."&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Marx saw [[consciousness as political]]. According to Marx, the recognition of these individual rights was the result of the universal extension of market relations to all of society and to all of the world, first through the [[primitive accumulation of capital]] (including the first period of European [[colonialism]]) and then through the [[globalization]] of the capitalist sphere. Such individual rights were the symmetric of the "right for the labourer" to "freely" sell his [[labor force]] on the marketplace through juridical contracts, and worked in the same time as an ideological means to discompose the collective grouping of producers required by the [[Industrial Revolution]]: thus, in the same time that the Industrial Era requires masses to concentrate themselves in [[factory|factories]] and in [[urbanization|cities]], the individualist, "bourgeois" ideology separated themselves as competing [[homo economicus]].

Marx's critique of the ideology of the human rights thus departs from the [[counterrevolutionary]] critique by [[Edmund Burke]], who dismissed the "rights of Man" in favour of the "rights of the individual": it is not grounded on an opposition to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] and [[humanism|humanist]] project on behalf of the right of [[tradition]], as in Burke's case, but rather on the claim that the ideology of economism and the ideology of the human rights are the reverse sides of the same coin. However, as Étienne Balibar  puts it, "the accent put on those contradictions can not not ring out on the signification of 'human rights', since these therefore appears ''both'' as the language in which [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] masks itself and as the one in which the exploited class struggle express itself: more than a truth or an illusion, it is therefore a ''stake''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Balibar]], ''The Philosophy of Marx'', 1993, p.74 original edition&lt;/ref&gt; ''Das Kapital'' ironizes on the "pompous catalogue of the human rights" in comparison to the "modest ''Magna Charta'' of a day work limited by law":
{{quote|The creation of a normal working-day is, therefore, the product of a protracted civil war, more or less dissembled, between the capitalist class and the working-class... It must be acknowledged that our labourer comes out of the process of production other than he entered. In the market he stood as owner of the commodity "labour-power" face to face with other owners of commodities, dealer against dealer. The contract by which he sold to the capitalist his labour-power proved, so to say, in black and white that he disposed of himself freely. The bargain concluded, it is discovered that he was no "free agent," that the time for which he is free to sell his labour-power is the time for which he is forced to sell it, that in fact the vampire will not lose its hold on him "so long as there is a muscle, a nerve, a drop of blood to be exploited." For "protection" against "the serpent of their agonies," the labourers must put their heads together, and, as a class, compel the passing of a law, an all-powerful social barrier that shall prevent the very workers from selling, by voluntary contract with capital, themselves and their families into slavery and death. In place of the pompous catalogue of the "inalienable rights of man" comes the modest Magna Charta of a legally limited working-day, which shall make clear "when the time which the worker sells is ended, and when his own begins.'' Quantum mutatus ab illo!''[How changed from what he/it was!]"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm#S7 chapter X, section 7]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
But the communist revolution does not end with the negation of individual liberty and equality ("[[collectivism]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] argued that Marx represented exacerbated [[individualism]] instead of [[holism]] as the popular interpretation of Marxism as "collectivism" would have it&lt;/ref&gt;), but with the "negation of the negation": "individual property" in the capitalist regime is in fact the "expropriation of the immediate producers." "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor... The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm chapter XXXII, section 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticisms of Feuerbach ====
{{Main|Ludwig Feuerbach|Marx's theory of alienation}}
What distinguished Marx from Feuerbach was his view of Feuerbach's [[humanism]] as excessively abstract, and so no less ahistorical and idealist than what it purported to replace, namely the reified notion of God found in institutional Christianity that legitimized the repressive power of the Prussian state. Instead, Marx aspired to give [[ontological]] priority to what he called the "real life process" of real human beings, as he and Engels said in ''The German Ideology'' (1846):

&lt;blockquote&gt;In direct contrast to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, in his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), in which the young Marx broke with Feuerbach's idealism, he writes that "the philosophers have only described the world, in various ways, the point is to change it," and his materialist approach allows for and empowers such change. This opposition between various subjective interpretations given by philosophers, which may be, in a sense, compared with ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' designed to legitimize the current state of affairs, and effective transformation of the world through ''[[praxis (process)|praxis]]'', which combines theory and practice in a materialist way, is what distinguish "Marxist philosophers" with the rest of philosophers.

Indeed, Marx's break with German Idealism involves a new definition of philosophy; Louis Althusser, founder of "[[Structural Marxism]]" in the 1960s, would define it as "[[class struggle]] in theory". Marx's movement away from university philosophy and towards the [[workers' movement]] is thus inextricably linked to his rupture with his earlier writings, which pushed Marxist commentators to speak of a "young Marx" and a "mature Marx", although the nature of this cut poses problems.

A year before the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Marx and Engels thus wrote ''The Communist Manifesto'', which was prepared to an imminent revolution, and ended with the famous cry: "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]". However, Marx's thought changed again following [[Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[French coup of December 1851|December 2, 1851 coup]], which put an end to the [[French Second Republic]] and created the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] which would last until the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]].

Marx thereby modified his theory of alienation exposed in the ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' and would later arrive to his theory of [[commodity fetishism]], exposed in the first chapter of the first book of ''Das Kapital'' (1867). This abandonment of the early theory of alienation would be amply discussed, and several Marxist theorists, including [[Marxist humanist]]s such as the [[Praxis School]], would return to it. Others, such as Althusser, would claim that the "[[Louis Althusser#The 'Epistemological Break'|epistemological break]]" between the "young Marx" and the "mature Marx" was such that no comparisons could be done between both works, marking a shift to a "scientific theory" of society.

In 1844-5, when Marx was starting to settle his account with Hegel and the Young Hegelians in his writings, he critiqued the Young Hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique of the state and civil society as paramount. Indeed, in 1844, by the look of Marx's writings in that period (most famous of which is the "[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]", a text that most explicitly elaborated his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]), Marx's thinking could have taken at least three possible courses: the study of law, religion, and the state; the study of natural philosophy; and the study of [[political economy]].

He chose the last as the predominant focus of his studies for the rest of his life, largely on account of his previous experience as the editor of the newspaper ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' on whose pages he fought for freedom of expression against Prussian censorship and made a rather idealist, legal defense for the Moselle peasants' customary [[commons|right of collecting wood]] in the forest (this right was at the point of being criminalized and privatized by the state). It was Marx's inability to penetrate beneath the legal and polemical surface of the latter issue to its materialist, economic, and social roots that prompted him to critically study political economy.

==== Historical materialism ====
{{Main|Historical materialism|Dialectical materialism}}
Marx summarized the materialistic aspect of his theory of history, otherwise known as [[historical materialism]] (this term was coined by Engels and popularised by [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Georgi Plekhanov]]), in the 1859 preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely [[relations of production]] appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material [[forces of production]]. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The [[mode of production]] of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this brief popularization of his ideas, Marx emphasized that social development sprang from the inherent contradictions within material life and the social [[base and superstructure|superstructure]]. This notion is often understood as a simple historical narrative: primitive communism had developed into slave states. Slave states had developed into feudal societies. Those societies in turn became capitalist states, and those states would be overthrown by the self-conscious portion of their working-class, or proletariat, creating the conditions for socialism and, ultimately, a higher form of communism than that with which the whole process began. Marx illustrated his ideas most prominently by the development of capitalism from [[feudalism]], and by the prediction of the development of socialism from [[capitalism]].

The base-superstructure and [[stadial history|stadialist]] formulations in the 1859 preface took on canonical status in the subsequent development of orthodox Marxism, in particular in [[dialectical materialism]] (''diamat'', as it was [[philosophy in the Soviet Union|known in the Soviet Union]]). They also gave way to a vulgar Marxism as plain [[economic determinism]] (or [[economism]]), which has been criticized by various [[Marxist theorists]]. "Vulgar Marxism" was seen as little other than a variety of [[economic determinism]], with the alleged determination of the [[ideology|ideological]] [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] by the economical [[infrastructure]]. However, this [[positivism|positivist]] reading, which mostly based itself on Engels' latter writings in an attempt to theorize "[[scientific socialism]]" (an expression coined by Engels) has been challenged by Marxist theorists, such as Antonio Gramsci or Althusser.

Some believe that Marx regarded them merely as a shorthand summary of his huge ongoing work-in-progress (which was only published posthumously over a hundred years later as ''[[Grundrisse]]''). These sprawling, voluminous notebooks that Marx put together for his research on political economy, particularly those materials associated with the study of "primitive communism" and pre-capitalist communal production, in fact, show a more radical turning "Hegel on his head" than heretofore acknowledged by most mainstream Marxists and Marxiologists.

In lieu of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] belief in historical progress and stages espoused by [[Hegel]] (often in a [[racism|racist]], [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] manner, as in his ''Lectures on the Philosophy of History''), Marx pursues in these research notes a decidedly empirical approach to analyzing historical changes and different modes of production, emphasizing without forcing them into a [[teleology|teleological]] paradigm the rich varieties of communal productions throughout the world and the critical importance of collective working-class antagonism in the development of capitalism.

Moreover, Marx's rejection of the necessity of bourgeois revolution and appreciation of the [[obschina]], the communal land system, in Russia in his letter to [[Vera Zasulich]]; respect for the egalitarian culture of North African Muslim commoners found in his letters from [[Algeria]]; and sympathetic and searching investigation of the global commons and indigenous cultures and practices in his notebooks, including the ''Ethnological Notebooks'' that he kept during his last years, all point to a historical Marx who was continuously developing his ideas until his deathbed and does not fit into any pre-existing ideological straitjacket.

==Differences within Marxist philosophy==
Some varieties of Marxist philosophy are strongly influenced by  Hegel, emphasizing totality and even [[teleology]]: for example, the work of [[Georg Lukács]], whose influence extends to contemporary thinkers like [[Fredric Jameson]]. Others consider "totality" merely another version of Hegel's "spirit," and thus condemn it as a crippling, secret idealism.

[[Theodor Adorno]], a leading philosopher of the [[Frankfurt School]], who was strongly influenced by Hegel, tried to take a middle path between these extremes: Adorno contradicted Hegel's motto "the true is the whole" with his new version, "the whole is the false," but he wished to preserve [[critical theory]] as a negative, oppositional version of the utopia described by Hegel's "spirit."  Adorno believed in totality and human potential as ends to be striven for, but not as certainties.

The status of [[humanism]] in Marxist thought has been quite contentious. Many Marxists, especially Hegelian Marxists and also those committed to political programs (such as many [[Communist Party|Communist]] Parties), have been strongly humanist. These humanist Marxists believe that Marxism describes the true potential of human beings, and that this potential can be fulfilled in collective freedom after the Communist revolution has removed capitalism's constraints and subjugations of humanity. A particular version of the humanism within the marxism is represented by the school of [[Lev Vygotsky]] and his school in [[theoretical psychology]] ([[Alexis Leontiev]], [[Laszlo Garai]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Interview%20with%20Laszlo%20Garai.htm Interview with Laszlo Garai on the Activity Theory of Alexis Leontiev and his own Theory of Social Identity as referred to the meta-theory of Lev Vygotsky. Journal of Russian and East European Psychology, vol. 50, no. 1, January–February 2012, pp. 50–64]&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Praxis school]] based its theory on the writings of the young Marx, emphasizing the humanist and dialectical aspects thereof.

However, other Marxists, especially those influenced by Louis Althusser, are just as strongly [[anti-humanist]]. Anti-humanist Marxists believe that ideas like "humanity," "freedom," and "human potential" are pure ideology, or theoretical versions of the bourgeois economic order. They feel that such concepts can only condemn Marxism to theoretical self-contradictions which may also hurt it politically.

'''''Mr. Bliss''''' is a children's [[picture book]] by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], published posthumously in book form in 1982. One of Tolkien's least-known short works, it tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car.  Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions.

The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932.  The bears were based on [[Teddy bear|toy bears]] owned by Tolkien's sons.  Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book.  His narrative binds the story and illustrations tightly together, as the text often comments directly on the pictures.

Several commentators have compared ''Mr. Bliss'' with the works of [[Beatrix Potter]] and [[Edward Lear]], and also to ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] &amp; [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'', HarperCollins, Reader's Guide p. 592; {{ISBN|978-0-00-714918-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mr. Bliss'' wasn't published during Tolkien's lifetime. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from Tolkien after the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  The ink and coloured pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive.  Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he didn't have time to do it. The manuscript lay in a drawer until 1957, when he sold it (as well as the original manuscripts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''The Hobbit'', and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') to [[Marquette University]] for £1,250.

The book was published in 1982, with Tolkien's difficult-to-read handwritten story and illustrations on one page, and a typeset transcription on the facing page.

Tolkien used two names from ''Mr. Bliss'' for hobbits in ''The Lord of the Rings'': [[Gaffer Gamgee]] and [[Boffin (hobbit family)|Boffin]].

'''Nancy Hatch Dupree''' (October 3, 1927 – September 10, 2017) was an American historian whose work primarily focused on the history of modern [[Afghanistan]]. She was the director of the Afghanistan Center at [[Kabul University]] and author of five books that she compiled while studying the [[history of Afghanistan]] from 1962 until the late 1970s, writing about tourism and history of [[Kabul]], [[Bamiyan]] and [[Balkh]]. She was fondly called the "grandmother of Afghanistan", having spent more of her life there or with Afghans abroad.&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Obituary: Nancy Dupree died on September 10th|url=https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21728874-grandmother-afghanistan-was-89-obituary-nancy-dupree-died-september-10th|work=[[The Economist]]|date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nancy Dupree was born as Nancy Hatch in [[Cooperstown, New York]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; She spent most of her childhood in [[India]]. Her parents were working in [[Kerala]], where her father was an adviser to the Maharaja of Travancore, Kerala. Her mother, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actress, was drawn to Indian art and theatrical dance forms and embarked on the first PhD on [[Kathakali]] by a foreign scholar.

Hatch graduated from [[Barnard College]] in 1949. She then went to [[Columbia University]] to study [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/09/theater/love-affair-with-afghanistan-continues-74-her-guidebook-inspired-play-she-fights.html|title=A Love Affair With Afghanistan Continues at 74; Her Guidebook Inspired a Play, And She Fights for a Nation's Soul|first=Celestine|last=Bohlen|date=July 9, 2002|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did her mastery in Chinese Art at Columbia University, but her life was linked to southern Asia in an inexorable manner. First married to an American intelligence officer, Alan D. Wolfe, posted in what was then called [[Ceylon]], she later moved with her husband to Iraq, then Pakistan, and finally Afghanistan in 1962.

Dupree first arrived in Afghanistan in 1962 as a diplomat's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/08/world/the-saturday-profile-a-chronicler-of-afghan-culture-now-its-loyal-guard.html |title=A Chronicler of Afghan Culture, Now Its Loyal Guard |first=Amy |last=Waldman |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after she wrote the first guide in  English to the [[Bamiyan Buddhas]]&lt;ref&gt;The first guide to Bamiyan was published in French in 1934 by [[Joseph Hackin]], director of the [[Délégation  archéologique française en Afghanistan]], translated in German in 1939 (Paris, éditions d'art et d'histoire).&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt; Several years later, she met [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Duprée]], who was a renowned [[archaeologist]] and [[scholar]] of [[Culture of Afghanistan|Afghan culture]] and history. The two fell in love and got married after divorcing their former spouses, marrying in the [[Bagh-e Bala Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Best American Magazine Writing 2015'' by The American Society of Magazine Editors&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Kabul love affair to Afghanistan's first centre for study of its history |last=Graham-Harrison |first=Emma|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/26/afghanistan-first-centre-study-history|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/45a7ebca-f712-11dd-8a1f-0000779fd2ac&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Nancy was forced to leave the country, while Louis remained. Rather than return to the United States, she moved to a refugee camp in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Moustafa, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rbm.acrl.org/index.php/rbm/article/view/9665 |last=Moustafa |first=Laila Hussein |title=From Peshawar to Kabul: Preserving Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage during Wartime |journal=RBM: A Journal of Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Cultural Heritage |volume=17 |number=2 |pages=134–147 |date=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis was eventually arrested under suspicion of working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] as a spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Verini|first1=James|title=Love and Ruin|url=https://magazine.atavist.com/loveandruin|website=The Atavist Magazine|publisher=The Atavist|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en|date=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined Nancy in Peshawar. While in the refugee camp, Nancy realized the potential for the loss of unique documents about Afghanistan to be lost or destroyed forever. In order to preserve these works and to teach them to a new generation, she and Louis formed the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR). They began to collect both government and non-government documents that related to the country's history, culture, the [[Soviet-Afghan War]], the [[Mujahedeen]], and the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name="Moustafa, 2016"/&gt; Nancy said that in the looting that began after the Soviet invasion, many priceless books were sold to be used for fuel. A large number of books were also sold by weight to be used to wrap food. According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "her networking prowess was so notorious that she was once approached, to see if she could help with permits to dig tunnels in Kabul, by the young [[Osama bin Laden]]."&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt;

After the Coalition forces moved into Afghanistan in 2001, Nancy and Louis did not immediately move back, since Louis passed away in 1989. They were concerned for their own safety and that of ACBAR's collection, which by 1999 consisted of 7,739 titles written in [[Pashto]], [[Dari language|Dari (Persian)]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref name="Moustafa, 2016"/&gt; In 2005, Nancy moved back to Kabul and worked with the Afghan government to find a place to house ACBAR's collection. The collection was moved to Kabul University and the name was changed to the Afghan Collection at Kabul University. A $2 million building was completed to house the collection in 2012.

Dupree divided her time between [[Afghanistan]] and her other home in [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2874148/American-woman-87-called-grandmother-Afghanistan-seeks-preserve-country-s-storied-past-research-center.html|title=American Seeks to Preserve Storied Afghan Past |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louis and Nancy Hatch Dupree Foundation==
[[File:Omar Zakhilwal greeting Nancy Dupree in 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|Dupree with Afghan finance minister Omar Zakhilwal in 2010]]
In 2007, Nancy Hatch Dupree established the Louis and Nancy Hatch Dupree Foundation. It is a charitable organization that promotes research and raises awareness of the history and culture of Afghanistan. In addition, this organization also preserves Afghan cultural heritage. The organization's primary goal is to ensure the sustainability of the Afghanistan Center at Kabul University (ACKU). Programs offer Afghans from all walks of life, especially youth, incentives to acquire and employ information that will help them address the challenges of rebuilding their nation.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The organization has been able to achieve its overall goal by purchasing books and providing them to the schools in parts of Afghanistan that have never had a library. Due to regional instability, the organization has not been able to achieve all of its goals as an active NGO.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3957">'''Osborn Joseph Bergin''' (26 November 1873 – 6 October 1950) was a scholar of the [[Irish language]] and [[early Irish literature]], who discovered [[Bergin's Law]].

He was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]],   sixth child and eldest son of Osborn Roberts Bergin and Sarah Reddin,  and was educated at Queen's College Cork (now [[University College Cork]]). He then went to [[Germany]] for advanced studies in [[Celtic languages]], working with [[Heinrich Zimmer]] at the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin (now the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) and later with [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] at the [[University of Freiburg]], where he wrote his dissertation on [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] in 1906. He then returned to Ireland and taught at the [[School of Irish Learning]] and at [[University College Dublin]].

Within one year of becoming Director of the School of Irish Studies in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Bergin resigned both the senior professorship and his office of director. The reason for his resignation was never made public. He died in a nursing-home in Dublin at the age of 76, having never married.

Bergin, who never used the name Joseph except when signing with his initials, did not seem to have felt the need of [[organized religion|institutional religion]], and during his lifetime, he rarely attended religious services. He developed Irish nationalist sympathies and remained a firm nationalist all his life but without party affiliations. From the number of Irish-speakers living in Cork, Bergin quickly mastered the spoken Irish of West [[Munster]]. By 1897, his knowledge of spoken and literary Modern Irish was so strong that he was appointed lecturer in Celtic in Queen's College, Cork. It was during this time that he became an active member of the Gaelic League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Gerard|title=Osborn Joseph Bergin|journal=Studies: an Irish Quarterly Review|date=December 1950|volume=39|issue=156|pages=385–394|jstor=30100472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published extensively in the journal for Irish scholarship, ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]''. He is  best known for his discovery of [[Bergin's Law]], which states that  while the normal order of a sentence in [[Old Irish]] is [[verb-subject-object]], it is permissible for the verb, in the [[dependent and independent verb forms|conjunct form]], to be placed at the end of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Collinge, N.E.  ''The Laws of Indo-European'' John Benjamins Publishing Co  1985 p.230&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[Frank O'Connor]] wrote humorously that while he discovered the law "he never really believed in it".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Frank, ''My Father's Son'', Macmillan and Co, London 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote poetry in Irish and made a number of well-received translations of Old Irish love poetry.

He is celebrated in [[Brian O'Nolan]]'s  poem ''[[D. A. Binchy|Binchy]] and Bergin and [[Richard Irvine Best|Best]]'', originally printed in the ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' column in the [[Irish Times]] and now included in ''The Best of Myles''. He was noted for his feuds with [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] and [[William Butler Yeats]], but he enjoyed a lifelong friendship with [[George William Russell]]. Frank O'Connor, another good friend, describes Bergin's eccentricities affectionately in his memoir ''My Father's Son''.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan and Co  London  1968&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Leroy Robeson Jr.''' (November 2, 1927&amp;nbsp;– April 26, 2014) was an American author, [[archivist]] and [[historian]].

==Biography==
Robeson was born in [[Brooklyn]] to entertainer and activist [[Paul Robeson]] and [[Eslanda Goode Robeson]].  As his family moved to Europe he grew up in England (visiting the [[St Mary's Town and Country School]] in London) and Moscow, in the [[Soviet Union]]. In Moscow he attended an elite school. The Robesons returned to the United States in 1939 to live first in [[Harlem]], New York, and after 1941 in [[Enfield, Connecticut]]. Robeson graduated from [[Enfield High School]] and attended [[Cornell University]] where he graduated with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1949.

Robeson's paternal grandfather Reverend [[William Drew Robeson I|William Drew Robeson]] was born into [[slavery]],&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-2d78-The-inheritor-of-his-fathers-political-mantle#.Wb5J9ciGM2x|title=The inheritor of his father's political mantle|last=Francis|first=Hywel|authorlink=Hywel Francis|date=May 1, 2014|work=[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; escaped from a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in his teens&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robeson|2001|pp=4, 337–338}}; cf. {{harvnb|Boyle|Bunie|2005|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Duberman|1989|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Brown|1997|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually became the minister of Princeton's Witherspoon Street [[Presbyterian Church]] in 1881. Robeson's paternal grandmother, [[Maria Louisa Bustill]]&lt;ref name="mother"&gt;{{harvnb|Robeson|2001|p=[http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/59/04712426/0471242659.pdf 3]}}; cf. {{harvnb|Boyle|Bunie|2005|p=18}}, {{harvnb|Duberman|1989|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was from a prominent [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] family of mixed ancestry: African, Anglo-American, and [[Lenape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1997|pp=5–6, 145–149}}; cf. {{harvnb|Robeson|2001|pp=4–5}}; {{harvnb|Boyle|Bunie|2005|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robeson worked on the legacy of his father, published a two-volume biography of him, and created an archive of his father's films, photographs, recordings, letters, and publications.&lt;ref name=fitzsimmons/&gt; As an advocate for social and racial justice he shared the political views of his father, indicating that "like him, I am a black radical".&lt;ref name=fitzsimmons/&gt;&lt;ref name=schudel/&gt; He was married to Marilyn Greenberg in 1949; the couple had two children, David (died 1998) and Susan,&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyd|first1=Herb|title=Paul Robeson Jr, the son of a legend who made his own mark, dead at 86|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2014/may/01/paul-robeson-jr-son-legend-who-made-his-own-mark-d/|website=New York Amsterdam News|publisher=New York Amsterdam News|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one grandchild.&lt;ref name=schudel&gt;{{cite web |url=

==Paul Robeson Sr. legacy==
{{See also|The Communist Party USA and African-Americans}}
Robeson maintained on many occasions that his father "never joined the Communist Party or any party for that matter -- he was an independent artist and would never submit to any kind of organizational discipline."

On his own politics he stated: "I was much more an organized political person", he said, adding that from about 1948 to 1962, he was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]]. "It was an instrument, a radical instrument that could help advance the interests of African-Americans. It helped build the early civil-rights movement and independent trade union movement in the 1930s, '40s and '50s." He said he left the party in 1962 after "it became bureaucratic and corrupt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Arnold H.

Robeson's father, Paul Sr., was one of his closest friends and protectors, traveling and living with him intermittently during his life.  Following his father's death, Robeson Jr. worked extensively to establish the Paul Robeson Archive and the Paul Robeson Foundation. The archive, housed at [[Howard University]]'s Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, is the largest repository in the [[Western hemisphere]] of Robeson documents and articles, totaling well over 50,000 items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Duberman | first=Martin | pages=557 | title=Paul Robeson | location=New York | publisher=Knopf  | year=1989 | isbn=0-394-52780-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] descent through his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robeson II |first=Paul |authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The Undiscovered Paul Robeson: An Artist's Journey, 1898–1939 | year=2001 | publisher=Wiley | url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/59/04712426/0471242659.pdf | format=PDF|isbn=0-471-24265-9 | quote=A dark-skinned man descended from the Ibo tribe of Nigeria, Reverend Robeson was of medium height with broad shoulders, and had an air of surpassing dignity. | page=3 | accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Propsteikirche''' is the common name of a church in [[Dortmund]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, the only Catholic church in the city centre. The full name is '''Propsteikirche St. Johannes Baptist Dortmund'''. It was built from 1331 as the abbey church of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery. Consecrated in 1458, it features a late-Gothic [[high altar]] by [[Derick Baegert]] which shows the oldest depiction of Dortmund.

The church became the first Catholic church in Dortmund after the [[Reformation]], a Propsteikirche from 1859. Destroyed in World War II, it was rebuilt until 1966. Its organ, built in 1988, makes it a concert venue. 

== History ==
A [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] abbey was founded in Dortmund in 1330, and a first abbey church was built from 1331 to 1353, consecrated in 1354, dedicated to [[John the Baptist|John the Baptist]]. It was soon expanded to an [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[hall church]], begun in 1404 and consecrated in 1458.&lt;ref name="Glas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Denkmalliste" /&gt; The church of a [[mendicant orders|mendicant order]], it was mainly a place for prayer and built simple and without a steeple.&lt;ref name="Baudenkmale" /&gt; The abbey was dissolved during the [[Secularization (church property)|secularization]] in 1816. The church became the first Catholic parish church in Dortmund after the [[Reformation]] in 1819. It was promoted to a {{ill|Provost church|de|Propsteikirche}} in 1859. The former abbey buildings were used to house the priest and as school buildings.&lt;ref name="Denkmalliste" /&gt;

The church was destroyed in World War II in 1943. Its most important art treasures had been removed, surviving the war. The church was rebuilt from 1947 to 1967.&lt;ref name="Glas" /&gt; It is a listed monument.&lt;ref name="Denkmalliste" /&gt;

'''Roman Brandstaetter''' (January 3, 1906 – September 28, 1987) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-[[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]]  writer, poet, playwright, journalist and translator.

==Life and career==

===Early life: 1906 –1940===
Roman Brandstaetter was born in Tarnów, to a religious [[Jew]]ish family, being the grandson of rabbi Mordechai David Brandstaedter. Roman Brandstaetter graduated from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków with a degree in philosophy and Polish and taught in a Jewish high school in Warsaw.

Beginning in 1927, he published poetry and critical essays in the publications "Chwila" and "Nowy Dziennik". In 1928, he published his first volume of poetry, titled ''Jarzma'' ("Yokes"). He wrote exclusively in Polish and actively participated in literary discussions, and was also interested in history. A particular focus for him was the problem of assimilation, which in the Polish context took on additional dimensions and meaning. In his work ''Tragedie Juliana Klaczki'' ("The Tragedy of Julian Klaczko") (1933), for example, he described the fate of assimilated Jews in Poland during the partitions. His study titled Legion żydowski Adama Mickiewicza ("Adam Mickiewicz's Jewish Legion") (1932) stirred a great controversy; in it, he depicted the great Polish Romantic poet 's initiative as being the precursor to the Zionist program, and as a result was criticized by Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, among others.

In 1933-35, Brandstaetter was the director of the literary section of a Zionist Polish-language publication called "Opinia", in which he published his programmatic article "Sprawa poezji polsko-żydowskiej" ("The Problem of Polish-Jewish Poetry") (1933). This text remains one of the most important analyses regarding this topic. It launched a discussion about Polish Jewish poets writing in Polish who, according to Brandstaetter, "breathed [...] the Jewish national spirit into the Polish language of poetry".

Brandstaetter published the following volumes of poetry: Droga pod górę ("Uphill Road") (1931), Węzły i miecze ("Knots and Swords") (1932), Królestwo trzeciej świątyni ("Kingdom of the Third Temple") (1933) and Jerozolima światła i mroku ("Jerusalem of Light and Darkness") (1935). During the interwar period [1918-1939], they became a pretext for vicious anti-Semitic attacks on their author. The poet's reaction was a brilliant essay titled Zmowa eunuchów ("Conspiracy of the Eunuchs") (1936).

===Move to Palestine: 1940–1946===
After the start of the Second World War, Brandstaetter was in Vilnius. In 1940, he left that city, and through Moscow, Baku and Iran went to the Middle East; in Palestine, he worked for the Polish Telegraph Agency.  This was an unusual period for him in many respects: though he decided to convert to Christianity at that time, it must be emphasized that he never abandoned Jewish traditions, something which he himself often stressed.

===In exile: 1946–1948===
In 1946, Brandstaetter left Palestine for Rome, where he served as cultural attaché at the Polish embassy and was baptized.
During his stay in Rome, Roman Brandstaette married Regina Wiktor. 
It must be emphasized that he never abandoned his Jewish roots or background, something he often spoke about and was very proud of.

===Return to Poland: 1948-1987===
In 1948, he returned to Poland, where he settled in Poznań. After the war, he wrote, among other things, the following works: a poetry anthology titled Słowo nad słowami ("The Word Over Words") (1964); Cztery poematy biblijne ("Four Biblical Poems") (1972); and a four-part novel titled Jezus z Nazaretu ("Jesus of Nazareth") (1967–73). As the titles themselves suggest, these works address Biblical themes, interpreted in the context of one individual's experience, which join two different traditions. An excellent example of this is also his [[biographical novel]], Krąg biblijny ("Bible Study Group") (1975). He also draws on the tradition of Chasidic parables, apparent in his work Inne kwiatki świętego Franciszka z Asyżu ("Other Little Flowers of St. Francis of Assisi") (1976).

Brandstaetter also wrote historical plays, such as Powrót syna marnotrawnego ("Return of the Prodigal Son") (1944) - a play based on Rembrandt's biography; Noce narodowe ("Nights of the Nation") (1946–48), Znaki wolności ("Signs of Freedom") (1953), Marchołt (1954), and Teatr świętego Franciszka ("Theater of St. Francis") (before 1958). His story Ja jestem Żyd z 'Wesela' ("I am the Jew from 'Wesele' ") (1972; 1981) attracted much attention. The work was a literary dialogue with the text of one of the greatest Polish plays by Stanisław Wyspiański, Wesele ("The Wedding"). Brandstaetter's story was adapted for radio, theater and television. Roman Brandstaetter also translated works from Hebrew, including Psalter (1968), German, English (Shakespeare's works), French, Dutch and Czech.

He also wrote extensively for the Polish Catholic press, including the Catholic weekly [[magazine]], ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'', consolidating his reputation as one of Poland’s leading religious writers.

===Death===
Brandstaetter died in Poznań on September 28, 1987 of a  [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was buried next to his wife Regina, née Brochwicz-Wiktor (who died a year earlier)  in the [[Cmentarz na Miłostowie|Milostowo Cemetery]] in [[Poznań]].

==Legacy==
Brandstaetter’s biography reflects the dramatic experiences and radical ideological choices facing twentieth-century Jewish intelligentsia. His life was shaped by Zionism and, later, Catholicism, while his literary output synthesized Jewish, Polish, Christian, and Greek and Roman traditions. His program for Polish Jewish literature called on writers to serve the cause of Zionism, while his interwar poetry relied on classical poetics to address universal and national Jewish themes, especially biblical ones. Cross-fertilization between Judaism and Christianity is central to Brandstaetter’s postwar works, including his best-known novel, Jezus z Nazarethu—an epic about Christ written in biblical style, exegetic in approach. The figure of Christ, shown against the background of first-century Palestine, is presented in historical context, while the Gospels are interpreted as continuing the tradition of the Old Testament. The novel’s language is rooted in biblical imagery, symbols, and parables, and uses biblical literary techniques.

Critics have praised Brandstaetter’s lyric poetry for its function of “hermeneutics of the Judeo-Christian tradition,” as Wojciech Gutowski has termed it, while autobiographical works portray the writer as a bicultural artist, scion of a family rooted in Haskalah. His grandfather, the writer Mordekhai Brandstetter (1844–1928), often appears in Roman Brandstaetter’s work offering insights into values underlying Jewish life.

'''Round Hand''' (also '''Roundhand''') is a type of [[handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]] originating in [[England]] in the 1660s primarily by the writing masters [[John Ayres]] and William Banson. Characterised by an open flowing [[Handwriting|hand]] (style) and subtle contrast of thick and thin strokes deriving from metal [[Nib (pen)#Pointed nib|pointed nibs]], Round Hand's popularity grew rapidly, becoming codified as a standard, through the publication of printed writing manuals.

== Origins ==
During the Renaissance, writing masters of the [[Apostolic Camera]] developed the ''[[italic cursiva]]'' script.  When the Apostolic Camera was destroyed during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]] in 1527, many masters moved to Southern France where they began to refine the renaissance ''{{lang|la|italic cursiva}}'' script into a new script, ''{{lang|la|[[italic circumflessa]]}}''.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;  By the end of the 16th century, ''{{lang|la|italic circumflessa}}'' began to replace ''{{lang|la|italic cursiva}}''.  ''{{lang|la|Italic circumflessa}}'' was further adapted into the French style ''{{lang|fr|rhonde}}'' in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

By the mid-17th century, French officials were flooded with documents written in various hands (styles) at varied levels of skills and artistry.  As a result, officials began to complain that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt; France's [[Controller-General of Finances]] took proposals from French writing masters of the time, the most influential being {{ill|Louis Barbedor|fr}}, who had published his ''{{lang|fr|Les Escritures financière et italienne-bastarde dans leur naturel}}'', circa 1650.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt; After examining the proposals, the [[Controller-General of Finances]] decided to restrict all legal documents to three hands, namely the ''{{lang|fr|Coulée}}'', the ''{{lang|fr|Rhonde}}'', and a ''Speed Hand'' sometimes simply called ''{{lang|fr|Bastarde}}''.&lt;ref name="Whalley"&gt;{{cite book |author=Joyce Irene Whalley |title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America |date=c. 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Edward Cocker had been publishing [[copybook (calligraphy)|copybook]]s based upon French ''{{lang|fr|rhonde}}'' in the 1640s. In the 1680s, [[John Ayres]] and William Banson popularized their versions of ''{{lang|fr|rhonde}}'' after further refining and developing it into what had become known as English round hand style.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

== Golden age ==
Later in the 17th and 18th centuries, English writing masters including [[George Bickham the Elder|George Bickham]], George Shelley and Charles Snell helped to propagate Round Hand's popularity, so that by the mid-18th century the Round Hand style had spread across Europe and crossed the Atlantic to North America. The typefaces Snell Roundhand and [[Kuenstler Script]] are based on this style of handwriting. George Snell was particularly noted for his reaction to other variants of roundhand, developing his own Snell Roundhand which emphasised restraint and proportionality in the script.&lt;ref name="Whalley"/&gt;

'''''Schweizerisches Idiotikon''''' ("the Swiss idioticon",&lt;ref&gt;the term [[:wikt:idioticon|idioticon]] "dictionary of a vernacular" is a learned 18th-century coinage, derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἰδιώς#Ancient_Greek|ἰδιώς]]}} "characteristic" (whence also [[:wikt:idiot|idiot]]), therefore ''Idioticon'' literally means ″index of words which are characteristic for a certain dialect″. See: Walter Haas (ed.): ''Provinzialwörter. Deutsche Idiotismensammlungen des 18. Jahrhunderts,'' Berlin−New York 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''Wörterbuch der schweizerdeutschen Sprache'' "Dictionary of the Swiss German language") is an ongoing, major project of [[lexicography]] of the [[Swiss German]] dialects. Publication began in 1881 and is projected to be complete by 2022. Its scope includes the language since the end of the classical [[Middle High German]] period (13th century) and as such also represents the historical dictionary of the dialects of [[German-speaking Switzerland]], and is one of the most detailed treatments of the [[Early Modern High German]] language in general. 

The history of the project began in 1862 with the foundation of a ''Verein für das Schweizerdeutsche Wörterbuch'', led by [[Friedrich Staub]] (1826&amp;ndash;1896). Originally envisaged as  a dictionary in four volumes, the first fascicle was published in 1881. From 1896, the project was led by [[Albert Bachmann (philologist)|Albert Bachmann]] (1863&amp;ndash;1934), under whose editorship, the scope and depth of the project was greatly expanded; Bachmann endeavored to put the ''Idiotikon'' on the level with the other "national dictionary" projects edited in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic Europe]] at the time, the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'', ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]''. In this sense, the ''Idiotikon'' is the "national dictionary" of Alemannic Switzerland. 

After Bachmann's death in 1934, the project was led by five editors-in-chief: Otto Gröger (1934–1951), Hans Wanner (1951–1974), Peter Dalcher (1974–1991), Peter Ott (1991–2005) and Hans-Peter Schifferle (2005 to present).

By 2012, 16 volumes had been published, covering the alphabet up to ''X''. Volume 17, projected as the final volume, is expected to appear during 2013&amp;ndash;2025. All published portions have been publicly accessible online since 2010 at idiotikon.ch.

'''Stone rubbing''' is the practice of creating an image of surface features of a stone on paper.  The image records features such as natural textures, inscribed patterns or lettering.  By rubbing hard rendering materials over the paper, pigment is deposited over protrusions and on edges; depressions remain unpigmented since the pliable paper moves away from the rendering material.  Common rendering materials include [[Charcoal#Art|charcoal]], [[crayon|wax]], [[Pencil|graphite]] or [[inkstick]]s.  Over time, the practice of stone rubbing can cause permanent damage to cultural monuments due to abrasion.  For an artist, stone rubbings can become an entire body of creative work that is framed and displayed.

==Technique==

The paper that has been used by Chinese scholars to transfer the calligraphy from stones is made from plant fiber. It can be used in two ways to retrieve the calligraphy. One way requires the paper to be dry and then adhered to the stone through a paste made with water and a starch that is made from rice or wheat. The paper is then tamped into the engravings on the stone. The other technique requires the paper to be wet and tamped into the engravings without a paste. &lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;Perkins, Dorothy. “stone rubbings, Chinese.” Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 1998. Ancient and Medieval History Online. Facts On File, Inc. 28 Jan. 2010 &lt;[http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE49&amp;iPin=china02225&amp;SingleRecord=True]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

After doing either of these techniques, an ink, created through grinding an ink stick and adding water one drop at a time to achieve the ideal consistency, is used to retrieve the calligraphy. The ink is stippled on with a cloth filled with the ink. The ink covers the paper without sinking into the engravings. When the paper is peeled off, the calligraphy engravings come out white, while everything else is black from the ink. &lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt;

More commonly, people use butcher paper to create stone rubbings. The butcher paper is usually taped on to the stone or grave, which contains the inscription desired, with either masking or paint tape. Then, usually, charcoal or crayon is rubbed over the stone or grave, leaving the engravings untouched by the crayon. When the butcher paper is removed, the inscriptions should be readable because they are not marked with the crayon.&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;“Headstone Art.” Ancestry. July/August 2008: 55. Print. &lt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NDgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=grave+rubbing&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=grave%20rubbing&amp;f=false]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be helpful to clean the stone beforehand, to ensure optimum results. A soft brush and water is usually what works best to cleanse the stones. One should not use stiff or hard brushes, as they can scratch the stone. Also, one should not use cleaning solutions or mild detergents on the stones, as they can damage the stone. &lt;ref name=MSP&gt;“Cemeteries.” Massachusetts Studies Project. 28 Jan. 2010 &lt;[http://www.msp.umb.edu/LocHistoryTemplates/MSPCemeteries.html]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

When stone rubbing, one should be careful with stones that are deteriorating, as they can collapse under pressure.&lt;ref name=MSP/&gt;

==Gravestone rubbing==


'''Gravestone rubbing''' also applies this technique to [[gravestone]]s, often as a method of retrieving and conserving information about [[genealogy]]. For a genealogist, a gravestone rubbing may become a permanent record of death when a gravestone is rapidly deteriorating. 

Rubbings are commonly made by visitors to the US [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = The Vietnam Veterans Memorial

Gravestone rubbing can be used to teach about local history.  The stone’s condition, art, and inscription can tell what was going on in an area at a specific time.  Studying multiple gravestones in one specific area can give even more information about history.&lt;ref name=MSP/&gt;

'''Street performance''' or '''busking''' is the act of performing in public places for [[gratuity|gratuities]]. In many countries the rewards are generally in the form of money but other gratuities such as food, drink or gifts may be given. Street performance is practiced all over the world and dates back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. People engaging in this practice are called '''street performers''' or '''buskers'''.

Performances are anything that people find [[entertainment|entertaining]]. Performers may do [[acrobatics]], [[Animal training|animal tricks]], [[balloon modelling|balloon twisting]], [[caricature]]s, [[clown]]ing, comedy, [[contortion]]s, [[escapology]], dance, singing, [[Fire performance|fire skills]], [[flea circus]], [[fortune-telling]], [[juggling]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[living statue]], [[music]]al performance, [[puppeteer]]ing, [[snake charming]], [[storytelling]] or reciting poetry or [[prose]], [[street art]] such as [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] and painting, [[street theatre]], [[sword swallowing]], and [[ventriloquism]].

== Etymology ==
The term ''busking'' was first noted in the English language around the middle 1860s in Great Britain. The verb ''to busk'', from the word ''busker'', comes from the Spanish root word ''buscar'', with the meaning "to seek".&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=busker "busker"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish word ''buscar'' in turn evolved from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word ''*bhudh-skō'' ("to win, conquer").&lt;ref name="Diccionario RAE"&gt;{{citation |url= http://dle.rae.es/?id=6LB1acb |title= buscar |work= Diccionario de la Lengua Española |edition=23rd |publisher= [[Real Academia Española]] |language= Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for many street acts, and title of a famous Spanish book about one of them, ''[[El Buscón]]''. Today, the word is still used in Spanish but mostly relegated for female street sex workers, or women seeking to be set up as private mistress of married men.

== History ==
There have been performances in public places for [[gratuities]] in every major culture in the world, dating back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. For many musicians street performance was the most common means of employment before the advent of [[sound recording|recording]] and personal electronics.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;Baird, Stephen (2000).[http://www.buskersadvocates.org/saahistory.html#saafranklin "The History and Cultural Impact of Street Performing in America: Ben Franklin"]. Street Performers and Buskers Advocates. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, a person had to produce any music or entertainment, save for a few mechanical devices such as the [[barrel organ]], the [[music box]], and the [[piano roll]]. [[Organ grinder]]s were commonly found busking in the old days.

Busking is common among some [[Romani people]]. Romantic mention of Romani music, dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry, prose and lore. The Roma brought the word busking to England by way of their travels along the [[Mediterranean]] coast to Spain and the Atlantic Ocean and then up north to England and the rest of Europe.

In medieval France buskers were known by the terms [[troubadour]]s and ''jongleurs''. In northern France they were known as trouveres. In old German buskers were known as [[Minnesingers]] and ''Spielleute''. In obsolete French it evolved to ''busquer'' for "seek, prowl" and was generally used to describe prostitutes. In Russia buskers are called [[skomorokh]] and their first recorded history appears around the 11th century.

[[Mariachi]]s, Mexican bands that play a style of music by the same name, frequently busk when they perform while traveling through streets and plazas, as well as in restaurants and bars.&lt;ref name="WebsterMariachi"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/dictionary/mariachi "mariachi"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

But it all started on street corners, and that is still very connected to what we do. It's such a validating musical experience. Busking is a very humble and brave act that takes courage to do well. It's also about the energy of music being alive outside in a city ... You can walk right by it right in front of you. Sure, to some people you're just another guy with his hand out, so sometimes busking can be great social barometer. You're able to gauge who you live with on earth.&lt;ref name=Ferris&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferris|first=Jedd|title=Catching Up With ...

Around the mid-19th century Japanese ''[[Chindonya]]'' started to be seen using their skills for advertising, and these street performers are still occasionally seen in Japan. Another Japanese street performance form dating from the [[Edo period]] is [[Nankin Tamasudare]], in which the performer creates large figures using a bamboo mat.

In the United States, [[medicine show]]s proliferated in the 19th century. They were traveling vendors selling [[elixir]]s and [[potion]]s to improve the health. They would often employ entertainment acts as a way of making the clients feel better. The people would often associate this feeling of well-being with the products sold. After these performances they would "pass the hat".

[[One-man band]]s have historically performed as buskers playing a variety of instruments simultaneously. One-man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 19th and early 20th centuries and still perform to this day. A current one-man band plays all their instruments acoustically usually combining a guitar, a harmonica, a drum and a tambourine. They may also include singing. Many still busk but some are booked to play at festivals and other events.

[[Folk music]] has always been an important part of the busking scene. Cafe, restaurant, bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form. Two of the more famous folk singers are [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Joan Baez]]. The [[delta blues]]men were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the Mississippi Delta region of the USA around the early 1940s and on. [[B.B. King]] is one famous example who came from these roots.

The [[counterculture]] of the [[hippie]]s of the 1960s occasionally staged "be-ins", which resembled some present-day busker festivals. Bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free, passing the hat to make money. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] was at the epicenter of this movement – be-ins were staged at [[Golden Gate Park]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'s Bee Stadium and other venues. Some of the bands that performed in this manner were [[Janis Joplin]] with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Moby Grape]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]].

[[Christmas carol]]ing can also be a form of busking, as [[wassailing]] included singing for alms, [[wassail]] or some other form of refreshment such as [[figgy pudding]]. In Ireland the traditional Wren Boys and in England [[Morris Dancing]] can be considered part of the busking tradition.

In India and Pakistan's [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] region [[Bhavai]] is a form of street art where there are plays enacted in the village, the [[barot (caste)|barot]] or the village singer also is part of the local entertainment scene.

In the 2000s, some performers have begun "Cyber Busking". Artists post work or performances on the Internet for people to download or "stream" and if people like it they make a donation using [[PayPal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Forms ==
There are three basic forms of street performance

'''"Circle shows"''' are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them. They usually have a distinct beginning and end. Usually these are done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], comedians, [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[juggle]]rs and sometimes musicians. Circle shows can be the most lucrative. Sometimes the crowds attracted can be very large. A good busker will control the crowd so the patrons do not obstruct foot traffic.

'''"Walk-by acts"''' are typically where the busker performs a musical, living statue or other act that does not have a distinct beginning or end and the public usually watch for a brief time. A walk by act may turn into a circle show if the act is unusual or very popular.

'''"Stoplight performers"''' present their act and get contributions from vehicle occupants on a crosswalk while the traffic lights are red. A variety of disciplines can be used in such format (juggling, break dancing, even magic tricks). Because of the short period of time available to them, stoplight performers must have a very brief, condensed routine. This form is seen more commonly in Central and South America than elsewhere.

=== Collecting money ===

Buskers collect donations and tips from the public in a variety of containers and by different methods depending on the type of busking they are performing. For walk by acts their instrument case or a special can or box is often used. For circle shows the performer will typically collect money at the end of the show, although some performers will also collect during the show to ensure all audience members have had a chance to show appreciation for their skills. Sometimes a performer will employ a ''bottler'', ''hat man'', or ''pitch man'' to collect money from the audience. The term ''bottler'' is a British term which originated following the use of the top half of a bottle to collect money. The bottle had a leather flap inserted in the bottle neck and a leather pouch attached. This design allowed coins to be put in the bottle but not allow them to be removed easily without the coins jingling against the glass. The first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous [[Punch and Judy]] troupe of puppeteers in early Victorian times.&lt;ref name="Punch"&gt;Somerville, Chris (1997) [http://www.punchandjudy.com/bottle.htm Who is Mr Punch] ''punchandjudy.com''. Chris Somerville. Retrieved 2010-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottling itself can be an art form, and the difference between a good and a bad bottler can be crucial to the amount of money earned on a pitch. A good bottler is able to encourage audience members to give money. A bottler usually gets a cut of the money made on the pitch. Prior to the 20th century, it was common for buskers to use a trained monkey as a bottler. That practice has diminished or ceased in many countries due to changes in social attitudes and animal control laws. However some modern buskers use a device known as [[monkey stick]] which is a long stick with bottle caps or small cymbals attached to make a noise before a show or prior to making a collection.

The place where a performance occurs is called a "pitch". A good pitch can be the key to success as a busker. An act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting. Popular pitches tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic, high visibility, low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible. Good locations may include tourist spots, popular parks, entertainment districts including lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs and theaters, [[rapid transit|subways]] and bus stops, outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events, almost any [[plaza]] or [[town square]] as well as [[zócalo]]s in Latin America and [[piazza]]s in other regions. Other places include shopping malls, strip malls, and outside supermarkets, although permission is usually required from management for these.

In her book, ''Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York'', Susie J. Tanenbaum examined how the adage "Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast" plays out in regards to busking. Her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform, crime rates tended to go down, and that those with higher education attainment tended to have a more positive view of buskers than did those of lesser educational attainment.&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum"&gt;Tanenbaum, Susie, J.

''mta.info''; [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], New York. Retrieved 2016-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cities in the United States have particular areas known to be popular spots for buskers. Performers are found at many locations like Mallory Square in [[Key West]], in [[New Orleans]], in New York around [[Central Park]], [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], and the subway systems, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. around the transit centers, in Los Angeles around [[Venice Beach]], the [[Santa Monica]] [[Third Street Promenade]], and the Hollywood area, in Chicago on [[Maxwell Street]], in the [[Delmar Loop]] district of [[St. Louis]], and many other locations throughout the US.
Busking is still quite common in Scotland, Ireland, and England with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels.

In the United States under [[constitutional law]] and most European [[common law]], the protection of [[artistic]] [[free speech]] extends to busking. In the U.S. and many countries, the designated places for free speech behavior are the public [[park]]s, streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[thoroughfare]]s and [[town square]]s or [[plaza]]s. Under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers, particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://funandmagic.com/decision.pdf Berger v.

While there is no universal [[code of conduct]] for buskers, there are common law practices which buskers must conform to. Most jurisdictions have corresponding [[statutory law]]. In the UK busking regulation is not universal with most laws (if there are any) being governed local councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who, what, why: Where is the hardest place in the UK to be a busker?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28112716|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some towns in the British Isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In Great Britain places requiring licenses for buskers may also require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Oxford City Council have decided to enact a [[public space protection order]]. Some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules. Some places require a special [[License|permit]] to use electronically amplified sound and may have limits on the [[Loudness|volume]] of sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411newyork.org/guide/2007/07/16/street-performances-in-new-york/ |title=Street Performances in New York |publisher=411newyork.org |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow, block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits, or do things that [[endangerment|endanger]] the public. It is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night. These curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is common law that "performing blue" (i.e. using material that is sexually explicit or any vulgar or obscene remarks or gestures) is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults-only environment such as in a bar or pub.

In London, busking is prohibited in the entire borough of the City of London. The London Underground provides busking permits in tube stations. Most London boroughs do not license busking, but they have optional powers, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, if there is sufficient reason to do so. Where these powers have not been adopted, Councils can rely on other legislation including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to deal with noise nuisance from buskers and the Highways Act to deal with obstructions. Camden Council is currently looking into further options to control the problem of nuisance buskers and the playing of amplified music to the detriment of local residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-insider.co.uk/2010/02/busking-in-london-explained-guide/|title= The Big Busk: London Busking Explained |author=Appleton, Natalie |date=7 February 2010|publisher= The London Insider|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft. Buskers may have their earnings, instruments or props stolen. One particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead, a practice known as "dipping" or "skimming". [[George Burns]] described his days as a youthful busker this way:&lt;ref name="CigarBurns"&gt;[http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html The Ultimate Cigar Aficionado: Ninety-eight-year-old George Burns Shares Memories of His Life] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307054715/http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html |date=7 March 2010 }}, article and interview by Cigar Aficionado Online&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television crew''' positions are derived from those of [[film crew]], but with several differences.

== Pre-Production  ==
{{main|Pre-production}}

: Work before shooting begins is called the pre-production stage. The crew in this stage include the [[casting director]], [[costume designer]], [[Television director|director]], [[location manager]], [[make-up artist]], researcher, [[screenwriter]], [[set designer]], and [[television producer]].

===Casting director===
{{main|Casting director}}

: The casting director casts actors, and so is usually one of the first crew members on the project.  In fact, during initial casting for a television pilot, the executive producer and casting director are often the only crew members.

===Costume designer===

: The '''costume designer''' makes all the clothing and costumes worn by all the Actors on screen, as well as designing, planning, and organizing the construction of the garments down to the fabric, colours, and sizes. They greatly contribute to the appearance of the production, and set a particular mood, time, feeling, or genre. They alter the overall appearance of a project with their designs and constructions, including impacting on the style of the project, and how the audience interprets the show's characters.

===Director===
{{main|Television director}}

: A '''television director''' is usually responsible for directing the actors and other filmed aspects of a television production. The role differs from that of a film director because the major creative control usually belongs to the producer. In general, actors and other regular artists on a show are familiar enough with their roles that the director's input is confined to technical issues. The director is responsible for all creative aspects of a production. The director typically helps hire the cast (and possibly crew). The Director helps decide on locations, and creates a shooting plan. During shooting, the director supervises the overall project, manages shots, and keeps the assignment on budget and schedule. Though directors hold much power, they are  second in command after the producer. The producer usually hires the director (unless the director is also the producer). Some directors produce their own television programs, and, with formal approval of the funding studio, enjoy a tighter grip on what makes the final cut than Directors usually have.

* '''Associate director''' ('''AD''')
{{main|Assistant director}}

: An '''associate director (AD)''' in television production is usually responsible for floor directing in the studio and ensuring that the sets, props and technical equipment are safe, ready to use and positioned correctly before filming. Associate directors are also responsible for communications with the [[audience]] and any guests, for example ensuring they are seated in good time, and assisting the Director with production. In scripted television series, an associate director occasionally serves as an episode's director, in which case someone else substitutes for the AD. Until the mid-2000s in the United States, associate directors were usually credited as ''technical coordinators'', for most sitcoms were shot on film. Drama programs don't usually use ADs.

===Location manager===
{{main|Location manager}}

: The '''location manager''' finds and manages film locations. Most pictures are shot in the controllable environment of a studio [[sound stage]] but occasionally, outdoor sequences call for filming [[Filming location|on location]].

===Make-up artist===
{{main|Make-up artist}}

: A professional '''make-up artist''' is usually a [[cosmetology]] beautician, and applies makeup to anyone who appears on screen. They concentrate on the area above the chest, the face, the top of the head, the fingers, hands, arms, and elbows. Their role is to manipulate the actor's on-screen appearance to make them look younger, older, larger, etc.
: [[Body makeup artist]]s concentrate on the body rather than the head. Make-up itself is substances to enhance the beauty of the human body, but can also change the appearance, disguise, or costume someone. Make-up artists, [[hair stylist]]s, [[costume designer]]s, and [[theatrical technician#Wardrobe|dress technician]]s combine their efforts to transform actors into characters, presenters, etc.

===Production designer===
{{main|Production designer}}

: The '''production designer''' is responsible for the production's visual appearance.They design, plan, organize, and arrange set design, equipment availability, and control a production's on-screen appearance. The production designer is often called the ''[[set designer]]'', or ''[[scenic designer]]''. They are trained professionals, often with [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degrees in scenic design. The set designer collaborates with the theater director to create an environment for the production—and communicates details of this environment to the [[technical director]], [[charge scenic artist]] and [[property master]]. Scenic designers create drawings and scale models of the scenery. The set designer also takes instructions from the [[art director]] to create the appearance of the stage, and design its technical assembly. The art director, who may also be the [[production designer]], plans and oversees the formation of settings for a project. They must be well versed in art and design styles, including architecture and interior design. They also work with the [[Cinematographer]] to accomplish the precise appearance for the project.

===Researcher===
{{main|Researcher}}

: '''Researchers''' research the project ahead of shooting time to increase truth, factual content, creative content, original ideas, background information, and sometimes performs minor searches such as flight details, location conditions, accommodation details, etc. They inform the director, producer, and writer of factual information—technical, cultural, historical, etc.—that relates to events that the production portrays.

===Set designer===
{{main|Set designer}}

The scenic designer collaborates with the theatre director and other members of the production design team to create an environment for the production, and then communicates details of this environment to the [[technical director]], [[production manager]], [[charge artist]], and [[property master]].  Scenic designers create [[scale model]]s of the scenery, [[artistic rendering]]s, paint elevations, and scale construction drawings to communicate with other production staff.

===Television producer===
{{main|Television producer}}

: In the entertainment industry, a '''television producer''' (compare to film producer) is generally in charge of, or helps coordinate, the financial, legal, administrative, technological, and artistic aspects of a production. In television, a '''television producer''' can be given one of the following titles:

* '''Associate producer'''
: The '''associate producer''' performs limited producing functions under the authority of a producer; often in charge of the day-to-day running of a production. Usually the producer's head assistant, although the task can differ. They frequently form a connection between everyone involved in shooting (the [[production team]]) and the people involved after filming to finalize the production, and get it publicized (the ''[[post-production]] team''). Occasionally, credit for this role goes to the product's financial backer, or the person who originally brought the assignment to the producer.

* '''Assistant Producer''' ('''AP''')
: In the UK, '''assistant producer''' is the closest role to that of a film director. An assistant producer often doubles as an experienced researcher, and takes direct charge of the creative content and action within a programme. The title of television director is usually reserved for [[dramatic programming]], productions and most similar to films, or those who control a multi-camera set up from the ''gallery''.

* '''Co-producer'''
: Typically performs producing functions in tandem with one or more other '''co-producers''' (working as a team, rather than separately on different aspects of the production).

* '''Coordinating producer'''
: The coordinating producer coordinates the work of two or more producers working separately on one or more productions.

* '''Executive producer'''
{{main|Executive producer}}

: The executive producer supervises one or more producers in all aspects of their work, and sometimes initiated the production. They are usually the ultimate authority on creative and business aspects of the production. If the title is designated correctly, the executive producer arranges the project's financial backing and maintains a sound [[production budget]]. On scripted programs, the [[showrunner]] receives an executive producer credit.

* '''Line producer'''
{{main|Line producer}}

: A line producer supervises physical aspects of the production (not the creative aspects), including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. The line producer oversees the budget. This involves operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The Line Producer works with the [[Production manager]] on costs and expenditure.

* '''Segment producer'''
: Produces one or more components of a multipart production.

* '''Supervising producer'''
: Supervises one or more producers in some or all aspects of their work; usually works under the authority of an executive producer.

Additionally, more senior members of a television show's writing staff are credited as producers, with the specific title dependent upon the seniority and rate of pay for the writer. For example, a writer credited as a "co-executive producer" will typically receive a higher salary and be considered more senior than a writer credited as a "producer", who will in turn be higher "ranking" than a writer credited as "co-producer."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scriptmag.com/features/writers-room-101-tv-writer-job-titles&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writer===
{{main|Writer}}

: The '''Writer''' creates and moulds an original story, or adapts other written, told, or acted stories for production of a television show. Their finished work is called a script. A script may also have been a contribution of many writers, so it is the [[Writers Guild of America]]'s (WGA) task to designate who gets the credit as 'the Writer'. 'Written by' in the credits, is a Writers Guild of America assigned terminology that means, "Original Story and Screenplay By." A screenplay or script is a blueprint for producing a motion picture, and a [[teleplay]] is the same thing for a television show. Writers can also come under the category of screenwriters. Screenwriters (also called ''script writers''), are authors who write screenplays for productions. Many also work as ''[[script doctor]]s'', changing scripts to suit directors or studios. Script-doctoring can be lucrative, especially for better known writers. Most professional screenwriters are unionized, and are represented by organizations such as the WGA.

===Head writer===
{{main|Head writer}}

: A head writer oversees the writing team on a television or radio series. The title is common in the soap opera genre, and in sketch comedies and talk shows that feature monologues and comedy skits. In prime time series, an executive producer fills this function.

===Screenwriter===
{{main|Screenwriter}}

'''Screenwriters''' or '''scenarists''' or '''scriptwriters''' create short or feature-length screenplays for films and television programs.

===Story editor===
{{main|Story editor}}

: Story editor is a job title in motion picture filmmaking and television production, also sometimes called ''supervising producer''. A story editor is a member of the screenwriting staff who edits stories for screenplays.

==Production==
: Everything that happens as part of shooting the film is part of the ''production stage''. The crew in this stage include the [[cinematographer]], [[production manager]], [[technical director]], [[boom operator (media)|boom operator]], [[Gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffer]], [[dolly grip]], [[key grip]], and [[stunt coordinator]].

===A1===
{{main|Audio Engineer}}
In television and live event production, the A1 is the primary audio engineer responsible for the technical design and operation of associated sound systems (eg. mixers, microphones, intercom, IFB, RF equipment, PA/monitoring, music/sfx playback, multi-track recording, and more).  Generally speaking, the A1 supervises all audio crew members during build, rehearsal, and show phases of any production.  Ultimately, the A1 will have routed, recorded, and mixed all sound sources heard during the program broadcast.

===A2===
The A2 helps get microphones or other audio devices to the right place or to the right person 
: An ''audio assistant (A2)'' positions and interconnects audio devices, such as [[microphone]]s and [[intercom]]s, from the television [[production truck]] to the venue. Typically, larger productions use two or more A2s.

===Boom operator===
{{main|Boom operator (media)}}

: The '''boom operator''' is part of the sound crew, and an assistant to the [[sound engineer]] or [[production sound mixer]]. The boom operator's main responsibility is [[microphone]] placement, sometimes using a "fishpole" with a microphone attached to the end—and sometimes using a "boom" (most often a "fisher boom"). The fisher boom is a piece of equipment that the operator stands on that lets him precisely control the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They also place [[wireless microphone]]s on actors when necessary. The boom operator strives to keep the microphone boom near the action, but away from the camera frame so it never appears onscreen. They work closely with the production sound mixer, or sound recordist, to record all sound while filming including background noises, dialogue, sound effects, and silence.

===Camera operator/cinematographer/videographer===
{{main|Camera operator|cinematographer|videographer}}

: As the head member of the camera crew, the '''camera operator''' uses the camera as instructed by the Director. They ensure the required action is correctly filmed in the frame, and must react instinctively as the proceedings take place. If the camera operator is also a '''[[cinematographer]]''', they also help establish the theme and appearance of the show. The cinematographer—or [[director of photography]] (DP)—regulates lighting for every scene, frames some shots, chooses lenses, decides on film stock, and strives to match the project's visual appearance to the director's vision. However, the cinematographer does not usually move the camera on the set, as this is usually the exclusive role of a camera operator.

===Character generator operator/Aston/Duet operator===
: The '''character generator (CG) [[Operator (profession)|Operator]]''' prepares and displays [[digital on-screen graphics]] (DOG or BUG) and [[lower third]] graphics on the [[character generator]] that were created by the [[broadcast designer]].

===Floor manager===
{{main|Floor manager}}

: The '''floor manager''' represents the director on the studio floor, and gives instructions and direction to crew, cast, and guests. It is closest to the role of an assistant director, as the job frequently entails barking orders to keep a production on schedule. The floor manager is always in direct contact with the director via ''[[Talkback (recording)|talkback]]'' in the gallery. The floor manager also checks that the floor is clear and safe for the performance, checks that scenery and set pieces are ready, turns on appropriate lights, makes announcements to staff and audience, helps maintain quietness and order, calls cues, and prompts talents as required.

* '''Assistant floor manager'''
: An '''assistant floor manager (AFM)''' sets the stage, prompts contributors on the studio floor, and ensures that everyone knows their place in the script. This frees the floor manager for other duties. They often oversee a team of runners. Increasingly, assistant floor managers are asked to help design and prepare props, and help set and reset action on the studio floor.

===Graphics coordinator===
{{main|Graphics coordinator}}

: The '''graphics coordinator''' ('''GC''') decides what graphic content should be displayed on-air—such as on a fullpage (a full-screen graphic) or a lower third (a bar graphic in the lower third of the screen). The GC should not be confused with the Duet operator, who usually operates the Duet and is part of a television crew, or a [[Broadcast designer]] who physically creates the graphics.

===Stage manager===
{{main|Stage manager}}

: Stage managers organize and coordinate theatrical productions. The job encompasses a variety of activities, including organizing the production and coordinating communications between various personnel (e.g., between director and backstage crew, or actors and [[production management]]). Stage management is a sub-discipline of [[stagecraft]].

===Gaffer===
{{main|Gaffer (motion picture industry)}}

: The '''gaffer''' is the head electrician at the production set, and is in charge of lighting the stage under direction of the [[Cinematographer]]. In television, the term '''chief lighting director''' is often used instead of gaffer, and sometimes the [[technical director]] lights the set. The gaffer reports to the [[director of photography]], lighting director. or lighting designer, and usually has an assistant called a '''[[best boy]]''' and a crew of electricians.

===Grip (job)===
{{main|Grip (job)}}

: In the U.S. and Canada, grips are lighting and rigging technicians in the film and video industries. They constitute their own department on a film set and are directed by a key grip. Grips have two main functions. The first is to work closely with the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a dolly, crane, or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating camera dollies or camera cranes. The second main function of grips is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a shot under the direction of the director of photography.

* '''Key grip'''
{{main|Key grip}}

: The '''key grip'' is the head grip. Grips affect shadow effects with lights, and occasionally maneuver camera cranes, dollies, and platforms under direction from the Cinematographer. The term grip is used in slightly different ways in American and British or Australian film making. In the British and Australian film industries, a grip mounts and supports cameras, which can include anything beyond a basic tripod. Lighting in British and Australian film-making is headed by the gaffer, who is also part of the camera department. Grips can also be the people that do the laborious work on sets. These type of grips push, pull, roll, and lift various pieces of equipment under direction from a television director, television producer, or set designer.

* '''Dolly grip'''
{{main|Dolly grip}}

: In [[cinematography]], the '''dolly grip''' places and moves the dolly track where required, and then pushes and pulls the dolly along that track during filming. A dolly grip works closely with the camera crew to perfect these complex movements through rehearsals. For moving shots, dolly grips may also push the wheeled platform that holds the microphone and [[Boom operator (media)|Boom Operator]]. The dolly is a cart that the tripod and camera (and occasionally the camera crew) rest on. It transports the camera without bumps and visual interruptions throughout a shot. It is commonly used to follow beside an actor to give the audience the sense of walking with the actor, or as the actor.

===Gallery/control room team===
{{main|Production control room}}

: These crew positions are only used on a ''[[multiple-camera setup]]'' production. The ''gallery'', or ''production control room'', is a separate darkened area away from the studio floor, where the action can be viewed on multiple monitors and controlled from a single source.

===Production manager===
{{main|Production manager}}

: The '''production manager''' makes deals concerned with business about the crew, and organizes the technical needs of the production. This would involve many things ranging from gaining the correct equipment with the exact technical requirements; to arranging accommodation for the cast and crew. The Production Manager reports their expenses and needs to the Line Producer.

===Production assistant===
{{main|Production assistant}}

: The '''production assistant (PA)''' occupies a prompting role in the Gallery or Control Room. They communicate with the broadcasting channel during a live television broadcast, counting down time-to-transmission aloud to the crew via the studio microphone. They also count down time remaining for sections of a programme, such as an interview or an advertising break. Prior to a production, the PA prepares and times the script, noting pre-recorded inserts, [[sound effect]]s, etc.—and clears copyright and other administrative issues.

===Runner===
{{main|Gofer}}
{{distinguish|Showrunner}}

: '''Runners''' are the most junior members of a television crew. They fetch and carry, and do most production odd jobs. They support anyone who needs help until they learn enough to assume more responsibility. In the United States, this position is called a ''[[gofer]]''.

===Stunt coordinator===
{{main|Stunt coordinator}}

:Where the programme requires a [[stunt]], and involves the use of [[stunt performer]]s, the '''stunt coordinator''' arranges casting and performance for the [[stunt]], working closely with the television director.

===Technical director===
{{main|Technical Director}}

: In a [[production control room]] (PCR), the '''technical director''' ('''TD''') has overall responsibility for the operation of the production. The technical director ensures that all equipment in the PCR operates correctly. They also match the quality and the output of all the cameras on the studio floor through the [[camera control unit]]s (CCU) (Vision Engineering). The TD supervises the other crew members in the PCR. The technical director also coordinates the working of the whole crew, and handles technical problem before, during, or after the shooting of a project.

===Television director – director===
{{main|Television director}}

: Unlike the film counterpart, a director in television usually refers to the gallery (or control room) director, who is responsible for the creative look of a production through selecting which shots to use at any given moment. The director views the action on the studio floor through a bank of screens, each linked to one of the [[professional video camera|cameras]], while issuing instructions down to the [[floor manager]]. They also control the gallery area, calling for sound rolls, [[digital on-screen graphic]]s (''[[Astons]]'') and video rolls [[video tape recorder]] (''VT's''). Some directors also work more closely with on-camera talent and others also act as both producer and director.

===Video control operator/vision engineering===
{{main|Broadcast engineering}}

: A '''video control operator''' (typically credited as ''video control'', and sometimes as a ''video engineer'' or ''video operator'') controls the video console to regulate transmission of content—everything from test patterns to live and recorded telecasts. Video control operators view the action on set through [[video monitor]]s and set switches and observe dials on the video console to control contrast, framing, brilliance, color balance, and the fidelity of the transmitted image. They monitor the program to ensure broadcast technical quality, and review the program to determine that the signal functions properly and is ready for transmission on schedule. Video control operators and video tape operators are used only in television productions recorded on video tape because of the growing use of [[broadcast automation]] with [[video server]]s.

===Camera Control Unit Operator===
{{main|Broadcast engineering}}

: A '''Camera control unit operator''' (typically credited as ''CCU Operator'' controls the Camera Control Unit which is a series of camera remote controls for exposure, white balance, contrast to regulate the picture quality between multiple cameras.

===Video tape operator===
: The '''video tape operator''' ('''VT operator''' or '''VTR operator''') cues and prepares video inserts into a program. A VT operator sets up and operates [[video tape]] equipment to record and play back the program, reads the program log to ascertain when to record the program, and when it airs. They also select sources, such as satellite or studio, for the program, and select the video recording equipment to use. They are heavily used in sports programming, and in all video taped productions, including [[television news]] programming, and sometimes sitcoms, if they are shot on video tape), they are also responsible for action replays and quickly editing highlights while a show is in progress. As the title suggests, video tape operators only work in video taped production. Although, VTR operator's still work on digital productions. It is a name that has just stuck to the playback operator. They can also be on set editors to give the director and director of photography the ability to see how what they shot cuts together.

===Vision mixer===
{{main|Technical director}}

: The '''vision mixer''', or '''[[technical director]]''' ('''TD''') in the United States, switches between video sources—such as camera shots and video inserts. They also maintain colour and contrast balance between the studio cameras. A [[vision mixer]] (Video Switcher) is, confusingly, also the name of the equipment the technical director operates.

==Post-production==
{{main|Post-production}}

: Everything after shooting of a film is '''post production'''. People involved in this stage of production include the film editor for film editing, video editor for [[video editing]], publicist for publicity, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], [[Foley artist]], composer, [[Broadcast designer|title sequence designer]], and [[specialist editor]]s.

===Colorist===
{{Main|Color grading}}
:The colorist interprets the program's visual look, often supervised by post-production producers and the [[cinematographer]]. Digital tools in the [[color grading]] suite control brightness, contrast, color, and the general "mood" of each shot, usually in an effort to make a scene appear to flow naturally from one shot to the next.

===Composer===
{{Main|Composer}}

: A '''composer''' writes the music for a production. They may also conduct an orchestra, or part of an orchestra, that plays the music. The composer occasionally writes theme music for a television show. A television program's theme music is a melody closely associated with the show, usually played during the [[title sequence]] and end [[closing credits]]. If accompanied by lyrics, it is a ''theme song''.

===Editor===
{{main|Film editing|Video editing}}

[[Image:editor in linear suite.png|thumb|right|Editor in linear suite]]
: The editor works in tandem with the director to edit raw footage into a finished work. The director has ultimate accountability for editing choices, but often the editor contributes substantially to the creative decisions concerned in piecing together a finalized product. Often, the editor commences their role whilst filming is still in process, by compiling initial takes of footage. It is an extremely long process to edit a television show, demonstrating the importance, and significance editing has on a production. Gradually more editors work on [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE), limiting physical touching of the actual film, decreasing film corruption due to touch.

: The Editor follows the screenplay as the guide for establishing the structure of the story, and assembles the various shots and takes for greater, clearer artistic effect. There are several editing stages. In the first stage, the editor is supervised by the director, who conveys their vision to the Editor. Therefore, this first [[rough cut]] is created during ''[[offline editing]]''. After the first stage, the following cuts may be supervised by one or more television producers, who represent the [[production company]] and its investors. Consequently, the final cut is the one that most closely represents what the studio wants from the film, and not necessarily what the director wants during ''[[online editing]]''.

===Foley artist===
{{main|Foley artist}}

: The '''Foley artist''' on a film crew creates and records many of the sound effects. Foley artists, editors, and supervisors are highly specialized and essential for producing a professional-sounding soundtrack—often reproducing commonplace yet essential sounds like footsteps or the rustle of clothing. The Foley artist also fabricates sounds that weren't correctly recorded while filming, much like the [[Audio mixing (film and television)|Sound editor]] does with digital sound effects.

===Post-production runner===
: A '''post-production runner''', unlike a [[production runner]], carries out tasks essential to the smooth running of a post-production house. [[Television crew#Runner|Runner]]s are the most junior members of a post-production team.

===Publicist===
{{main|Publicist}}

: A '''publicist''', or '''[[advertiser]]''' has the task of raising public awareness of a production, and ultimately increase viewers and sales of it and its merchandise. The publicist's main task is to stimulate demand for a product through advertising and promotion. Advertisers use several recognizable techniques in order to better convince the public to buy a product. These may include:

*'''Repetition:''' Some advertisers concentrate on making sure their product is widely recognized. To that end, they simply attempt to make the name remembered through repetition.
*'''Bandwagon:''' By implying that the product is widely viewed, advertisers hope to convince potential buyers to "get on the bandwagon."
*'''Testimonials:''' Advertisers often attempt to promote the superior worth of their product through the testimony of ordinary users, experts, or both. For example, using film critics or media personalities. This approach often involves an appeal to authority such as a doctor of media science.
*'''Pressure:''' By attempting to make people choose quickly and without long consideration, some advertisers hope to make rapid sales, and a sense of urgency to watch or buy a product.
*'''Association:''' Advertisers often attempt to associate their product with desirable things, in order to make it seem equally desirable. The use of attractive models, picturesque landscapes, and other similar imagery is common. "Buzzwords" with desired associations are also used.
*'''Imagery:''' Using advertising slogans, logos, or a common image increases familiarity, trust, personality of a production, and the ability for the show to be remembered.

The publicist ensures the media are well aware of a project by distributing the show as a trial run or sneak preview. They issue press releases and arrange interviews with cast and crew members. They may arrange public visits to the set, or distribute media kits that contain pictures, posters, clips, shorts, trailers, and descriptions of the show.

===Sound editor===
{{main|Sound editor (filmmaking)|Audio engineering}}

: In television, the '''sound editor''' deals with audio editing, adjusting and fixing of the soundtrack. They usually have a major decision-making and creative role when it comes to sound and audio. A sound editor also decides what [[sound effect]]s to use and what effects to achieve from the sound effects, edits and makes new sounds using filters and combining sounds, shaping sound with volume curves, and equalizing. A sound editor places the '''[[Foley artist]]'s''' sounds into the sound track. Often, a sound editor uses a sound effects library, either self-compiled, bought or both.

===Title sequence designer===
{{main|Broadcast designer}}

: A [[title sequence]], in a television program, appears at the beginning of the show and displays the show name and credits, usually including actors, producers and, directors. A montage of selected images and a theme song are often included to suggest the essential tone of the series. A title sequence is essential in preparing the audience for the following program, and gives them a sense of familiarity that makes them trust, and feel comfortable with the film. It is up to the '''title sequence designer''' to achieve this very goal, and make it catchy, entertaining.

==Specialist editors==

===ADR editor===
: [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Automatic dialogue replacement]] (ADR) is the process of replacing dialogue that was recorded incorrectly during filming, with the actors voices recorded and put into place during editing. The [[ADR editor]] oversees the procedure and takes the corrupted dialogue, and replaces it with newly recorded lines to the actor's mouth on film to make it lip sync correctly.

===Bluescreen director/matte Artist===
: Bluescreen is the film technique of shooting foreground action against a blue background, which is then replaced by a separately shot ''background plate'' scene by either optical effects or digital composting. This process is directed and co-ordinated by the [[Bluescreen Director]]. The matte artist is a part of the special effects department who assists in making scenery and locations that do not exist. They assemble backgrounds using traditional techniques or computers that mix with the footage filmed to create a false set. Both are fairly alike, but [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] technology is more modern and more widely used.

===Visual effects artist ===
: visual effects artist ([[VFX]]) are used in television productions to create effects that cannot be achieved by normal means, such as depicting travel to other star systems. They are also used when creating the effect by normal means is prohibitively expensive, such as an enormous explosion. They are also used to enhance previously filmed elements, by adding, removing or enhancing objects within the scene. The [[visual effects artist]] creates these effects, and developes them with the help of the [[visual effects supervisor]]. The task of the Visual effects artist differs frequently, and can range from combining extensive over-the-top special effects with computer [[visual effects]] and CGI animation.

[[File:Urania Pio-Clementino Inv293.jpg|thumb|200px|Urania, a restored Roman copy after a Greek original of the 4th century BC, [[Hadrian's Villa]].]]

'''Urania''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ʊəˈr|eɪ|n|i|ə}}; {{lang-grc|Οὐρανία}}, ''Ourania''; meaning "heavenly" or "of heaven") was, in [[Greek mythology]], the [[muse]] of [[astronomy]].

== Family ==
Urania was the daughter of [[Zeus]] by [[Mnemosyne]] and also a great granddaughter of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' v. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts list her as the mother of the musician [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]]&lt;ref&gt;Suidas ''s.v.'' Linos&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Apollo]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Hyginus#Fabulae|Fabulae]]'' 161&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Amphimarus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Description of Greece|Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'']] 9. 29. 5&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Poseidon]], and [[Hymen (god)|Hymenaeus]] also is said to have been a son of Urania.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]] lxi. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function and representation ==
Urania is often associated with Universal Love and the [[Holy Spirit]]. Sometimes identified as the eldest of the divine sisters, Urania inherited Zeus' majesty and power and the beauty and grace of her mother [[Mnemosyne]].

Urania dresses in a cloak embroidered with stars and keeps her eyes and attention focused on the Heavens. She is usually represented with a celestial globe to which she points with a little staff.&lt;ref&gt;Hirt, ''Mythol. Bilderb.'' p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; She is able to foretell the future by the arrangement of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statius]], ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]'' 8. 548 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urania as Muse ==
Those who are most concerned with philosophy and the heavens are dearest to her. Those who have been instructed by her she raises aloft to heaven, for it is a fact that imagination and the power of thought lift men's souls to heavenly heights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' 4. 7. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Urania, o'er her star-bespangled lyre,''&lt;br&gt;''With touch of majesty diffused her soul;''&lt;br&gt;''A thousand tones, that in the breast inspire,''&lt;br&gt;''Exalted feelings, o er the wires'gan roll—''&lt;br&gt;''How at the call of Jove the mist unfurled,''&lt;br&gt;''And o'er the swelling vault—the glowing sky,''&lt;br&gt;''The new-born stars hung out their lamps on high,''&lt;br&gt;''And rolled their mighty orbs to music's sweetest sound.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;—From ''An Ode To Music'' by [[James Gates Percival|James G. Percival]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the [[Renaissance]], Urania began to be considered the Muse for [[Christian]] poets. In the invocation to Book 7 of [[John Milton]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', the poet invokes Urania to aid his narration of the creation of the cosmos, though he cautions that it is "[t]he meaning, not the name I call" (7.5)

A '''water-meadow''' (also '''water meadow''' or '''watermeadow''') is an area of [[grassland]] subject to controlled [[irrigation]] to increase [[agricultural productivity]].  Water-meadows were mainly used in Europe from the 16th to the early 20th centuries.  Working water-meadows have now largely disappeared, but the field patterns and water channels of derelict water-meadows remain common in areas where they were used, such as parts of [[Northern Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[England]].  Derelict water-meadows are often of importance as wetland wildlife habitats.

Water-meadows should not be confused with [[flood-meadow]]s, which are naturally covered in shallow water by seasonal [[flood]]ing from a [[river]].  "Water-meadow" is sometimes used more loosely to mean any level grassland beside a river.

==Types==
Two main types of water-meadow were used.

===Catchwork water-meadow===
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
These were used for fields on slopes, and relatively little engineering skill was required to construct them.  Water from a stream or spring was fed to the top of a sloping field, and gentle sloping terraces were formed along which the water could trickle in a zig-zag fashion down the field.  The water could be used again for fields lower down the slope.

===Bedwork water-meadow===
[[File:Flooded water-meadow.jpg|right|thumb|450px&lt;!-- Note: larger image size than normal, to show features referred to --&gt;|Flooded derelict [[#Bedwork water-meadow|bedwork water-meadow]] at [[Fordingbridge]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]].  Winter flooding has filled an old carrier channel along the crest of a ridge (running from right foreground to middle distance), and has also flooded the drainage channels (on left and into distance, where they join the river).  In use, water would have seeped from the carrier channel on the right, through the grass in the foreground into the drainage channel on the left, which would have been almost empty.]]''Bedwork'' or ''floated'' water-meadows were built on almost-level fields along broad river valleys, and required careful construction to ensure correct operation.

A [[leat]], called a ''main'', ''carrier'' or ''top carrier'', was used to divert water from the river and carry it down the valley at a gentler slope than the river, producing a [[hydrostatic head]] between the two.  Mains were often along the edge of the valley, each main supplying up to about {{Convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of the valley.  The water from the main was used to supply many smaller carriers, on the crests of ridges built across the fields.  The channel on the crest of each ridge would overflow slowly down the sides (the ''panes'') of the ridge, the channel eventually tapering to an end at the tip of the ridge.  The seeping water would then be collected between the ridges, in ''drains'' or ''drawns'', these joining to form a ''bottom carrier'' or ''tail drain'' which returned the water to the river.  The ridges and the drains made an interlocking grid (like interlaced fingers), but the ridge-top channels and the drains did not connect directly.  A ''by-carrier'' took any water not needed for irrigation straight from the main back to the river.  The ridges varied in height depending on the available head &amp;ndash; usually from around {{Convert|10|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.  The pattern of carriers and drains was generally regular, but it was adapted to fit the natural topography of the ground and the locations of suitable places for the offtake and return of water.

The water flow was controlled by a system of ''hatches'' ([[sluice]] gates) and ''stops'' (small earth or wooden-board [[dam]]s).  Irrigation could be provided separately for each section of water-meadow.  Sometimes [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s took carriers over drains, and [[causeway]]s and [[culvert]]s provided access for [[wagon]]s.  The ''working'' or ''floating'' (irrigation) and maintenance of the water-meadow was done by a highly skilled craftsman called a ''drowner'' or ''waterman'', who was often employed by several adjacent farmers.

The terminology used for watermeadows varied considerably with locality and dialect.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Uses==
Water-meadow irrigation did not aim to flood the ground, but to keep it continuously damp &amp;ndash; a working water-meadow has no standing water.  Irrigation in early spring kept [[frost]]s off the ground and so allowed [[grass]] to grow several weeks earlier than otherwise, and in dry summer weather irrigation kept the grass growing.  It also allowed the ground to absorb any plant [[nutrient]]s or [[silt]] carried by the river water &amp;ndash; this fertilised the grassland, and incidentally also reduced [[eutrophication]] of the river water by [[nutrient pollution]].  The grass was used both for making [[hay]] and for [[grazing]] by [[livestock]] (usually [[cattle]] or [[sheep]]).

==Derelict water-meadows==
Former water-meadows are found along many river valleys, where the sluice gates, channels and field ridges may still be visible (however the ridges should not be confused with [[ridge and furrow]] topography, which is found on drier ground and has a very different origin in [[Tillage|arable farming]]).  The drains in a derelict water-meadow are generally clogged and wet, and most of the carrier channels are dry, with the smaller ones on the ridge-tops often invisible.  If any main carrier channels still flow, they usually connect permanently to the by-carriers.  The larger sluices may be concealed under the roots of trees (such as [[crack willow]]s), which have grown up from seedlings established in the brickwork.  The complex mixture of wet and drier ground often gives derelict water-meadows particularly high [[wetland]] [[biodiversity]].

==Working water-meadows==
Derelict water-meadows can be transformed into wildlife protection and conservation areas by repairing the irrigation, as is the case of [[Josefov Meadows]] in the Czech Republic. By imitating the natural river flooding which is rare in modern straightened and dammed rivers, a rich biodiversity can be restored and attract and sustain many rare and protected wetland species.

[[File:Wolfsegg iron.jpg|thumb|right|The Wolfsegg Iron]]

The '''Wolfsegg Iron''', also known as the '''Salzburg Cube''', is a small cuboid mass of iron that was found buried in [[Tertiary]] [[lignite]] in [[Wolfsegg am Hausruck]], [[Austria]], in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grady  | first = Monica M. | authorlink =  |author2=A. L. Graham  | title = Catalogue of Meteorites: with special reference to those represented in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = | page = 529 | url =  | isbn = 0-521-66303-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It weighs 785&amp;nbsp;grams and measures {{nobr|67 mm × 67 mm × 47 mm}}. Four of its sides are roughly flat, while the two remaining sides (opposite each other) are convex. A fairly deep groove is incised all the way around the object, about mid-way up its height.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L'Astronomie"/&gt;

The Wolfsegg Iron became notable when it was claimed to be an [[out-of-place artifact]]: a worked iron cube found buried in a 20-million-year-old coal seam. It was originally identified by scientists as being of meteoric origin,&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; a suggestion later ruled out by analysis.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} It seems most likely that it is a piece of cast iron used as ballast in mining machinery, deposited during mining efforts before it was found apparently within the seam.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== History ==

Early descriptions of the object appeared in contemporary editions of the scientific journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Société_astronomique_de_France#L.27Astronomie_magazine|L'Astronomie]]'', the object identified by scientists as being a fossil meteorite. It was reported that the object was discovered when a workman at the Braun iron foundry in [[Schöndorf, Rhineland-Palatinate|Schöndorf]], Austria, was breaking up a block of lignite that had been mined at Wolfsegg. In 1886, mining engineer Adolf Gurlt reported on the object to the Natural History Society of Bonn, noting that the object was coated with a thin layer of rust, was made of iron, and had a specific gravity of 7.75.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L'Astronomie"/&gt;

A plaster cast was made of the object shortly before the end of the 19th century, as the original had suffered from being handled, and had had samples cut from it by researchers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Analysis ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The object was analysed in 1966–1967 by the Vienna Naturhistorisches Museum using electron beam micro-analysis,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} which found no traces of [[nickel]], [[chromium]] or [[cobalt]] in the iron, suggesting that it was not of meteoric origin, while the lack of sulfur indicated that it is not a [[pyrite]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Because of its low [[magnesium]] content, Dr. Gero Kurat of the museum and Dr. Rudolf Grill of the [[Federal Geological Office]] in Vienna thought that it might be cast iron, Grill suggesting that similar rough lumps had been used as ballast in early mining machinery.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The cast is currently kept in the Oberösterreichischen Landesmuseen in Linz, Austria, where the original object was also exhibited from 1950 to 1958,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} while the original cuboid is held by the Heimathaus Museum of [[Vöcklabruck]], Austria.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Out-of-place artifact ==

The Wolfsegg Iron is claimed by some as an [[out-of-place artifact]] (OOPArt), and it is often stated as a fact in paranormal literature that it disappeared without trace in 1910, from the Salzburg Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noorbergen | first =Rene | authorlink =  | title = Secrets of the Lost Races: New Discoveries of Advanced Technology in Ancient Civilizations | publisher = TEACH Services, Inc. | year = 2001 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 43 | url =  | isbn = 1-57258-198-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Short| first =Robert | authorlink =  | title = Out of the Stars | publisher = Buy Books | year = 2003 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 69 | url =  | isbn = 0-7414-1504-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, as mentioned above, it is at the Heimathaus Museum in Vöcklabruck, Austria, which is where the above photo was taken. It has also erroneously been described as "a perfectly machined steel cube".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sagan| first =Carl | authorlink = Carl Sagan |author2=Jerome Agel  | title = Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 206 | url =  | isbn = 0-521-78303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
