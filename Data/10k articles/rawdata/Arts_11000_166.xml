'''Ama Ata Aidoo''', ''née'' '''Christina Ama Aidoo''' (born 23 March 1942) is a [[Ghana]]ian author, poet, playwright and academic. She was also a [[Ministry of Education (Ghana)|Minister of Education]] in Ghana under the fourth President of Ghana, [[Jerry Rawlings|Jerry Rawlings's]] administration. She currently lives in Ghana, where in  the year 2000 she established the [[Mbaasem Foundation]] to promote and support the work of African women writers.&lt;ref name="Books&amp;Writers" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mbaasem&gt;[http://mbaasem.net/ "Welcome to Mbaasem"], Mbaasem Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Saltpond]] in Ghana's [[Central Region, Ghana]], she grew up in a [[Fante people|Fante]] royal household, the daughter of Nana Yaw Fama, chief of [[Abeadzi Kyiakor]], and Maame Abasema since her father was a king it automatically makes her a princess &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/ama-ata-aidoo|title=Ama Ata Aidoo Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=biography.dictionary.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Aidoo was sent by her father to [[Wesley Girls' Senior High School]] in [[Cape Coast]],&lt;ref name="Books&amp;Writers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authorscalendar.info/aidoo.htm |title=Ama Ata Aidoo |website=Books and Writers (Authors Calendar) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen | location=Finland }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1961 to 1964. The headmistress of Wesley Girls' bought her her first typewriter. After leaving high school, she enrolled at the [[University of Ghana]] in Legon and received her Bachelor of Arts in English as well as writing her first play, ''The Dilemma of a Ghost'', in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10410/Ama-Ata-Aidoo "Ama Ata Aidoo"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was published by [[Longman]] the following year, making Aidoo the first published African woman dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;Naana Banyiwa Horne, "Aidoo, Ama Ata", ''Who's Who in Contemporary Women's Writing'', 2001, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ama Ata Aidoo is Ghanaian playwright and former Education Minister of Ghana. She has portrayed the role of African women in contemporary society. She has opined that the idea of nationalism has been deployed by recent leaders as a means of keeping people oppressed. She has criticized those literate Africans who profess to love their country but are seduced away by the  benefits of the developed world. She believes in a distinct African identity, which she views from a female perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?lang=en&amp;id=737|title=African Success : Biography of  Ama ATa AIDOO|last=www.lesideesnet.com|first=Les Idées Net -|website=www.africansuccess.org|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked in the United States, where she held a fellowship in creative writing at [[Stanford University]]. She also served as a research fellow at the Institute of African Studies, [[University of Ghana]], and as a Lecturer in English at the [[University of Cape Coast]], eventually rising there to the position of Professor.

Aside from her literary career, Aidoo was appointed Minister of Education under the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] in 1982. She resigned after 18 months, realising that she would be unable to achieve her aim of making education in Ghana freely accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/features/womenwriters/aidoo_life.shtml "Ama Ata Aidoo"], BBC World Service.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also spent a great deal of time teaching and living abroad for months at a time. She has lived in the United States, Britain, Germany, and [[Zimbabwe]]. In London in 1986 she delivered the [[Walter Rodney]] Visions of Africa lecture organised by the support group for [[Bogle-L'Ouverture]] publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.com/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=14510&amp;inst_id=118&amp;nv1=search&amp;nv2= "Friends of Bogle"], ([[London Metropolitan Archives]]), Aim 25, Archives in London and the M25 area.&lt;/ref&gt; Aidoo taught various English courses at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], in the early to mid-1990s. She is currently a Visiting Professor in the Africana Studies Department at [[Brown University]].

Her first novel, ''[[Our Sister Killjoy]]'', was published in 1977 and remains one of her most popular works.

Her novel ''Changes'' won the 1992 [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for Best Book (Africa). She is also an accomplished poet—her collection ''Someone Talking to Sometime'' won the Nelson Mandela Prize for Poetry in 1987&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinemann.com/authors/3772.aspx Ama Ata Aidoo biography], Heinemann/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;—and has written several [[children's literature|children's books]].

In 2000 she founded the [[Mbaasem Foundation]], a non-governmental organization based in Ghana with a mission "to support the development and sustainability of African women writers and their artistic output",&lt;ref name=Mbaasem /&gt; which she runs together with her daughter Kinna Likimani&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T49lZMfY1Hg " Ghana international Book fair - Kinna Likimani"], YouTube, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and a board of management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbaasem.net/about/management-and-board/ "Management and Board"], Mbaasem Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6238">'''American verismo''' describes an artistic style of American literature, music, or painting influenced and inspired by artistic ideas that began in 19th-century Italian culture, movements that used motifs from everyday life and working class persons from both urban and rural situations.  American composers, writers, painters, and poets have used this genre to create works that contain socio-political as well as purely aesthetic statements.

In Italy, the term “verismo” is applied to the use of everyday life and characters in artistic works.  It was introduced into opera in the early 1900s in reaction to contemporary conventions that were regarded as artificial and untruthful.&lt;ref&gt;https://prezi.com/rb-rxbujv9iw/what-is-verismo/&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, “verismo” (meaning "realism," from Italian ''vero'', meaning "true") refers to a 19th-century Italian painting style.  This style was practiced most characteristically by the "I Macchiaioli" a group of Tuscan painters, who were forerunners of the French Impressionists.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Boime, Albert The Art of the MAcchia and the Risorgimento University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The style and its underlying social goals related to general 19th-century artistic developments that occurred in many countries, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, which stemmed from nationalist movements and intellectuals' responses to the effects of industrialization.

In Italy, the national origin of “verismo,” especially in literature and opera, was a profound sympathy for the disadvantaged working people, whose life, for the most part, consisted of hard labor, poverty, and oppression.

For example, the authors G. Verga, L. Capuana, D. Ciampoli, R. Fucini, M. Serao introduced the language of common people into their works and made extensive use of dialects.  The Italians also created a theater that reflected everyday life, as exemplified by the comedies of G. Rovetta and G. Giacosa.

In America, Tobias Picker’s 2013 opera that opened at the San Francisco Opera was acclaimed as a “triumph of American verismo.”&lt;ref&gt;http://theclassicalreview.com/2013/09/pickers-dolores-claiborne-a-triumph-for-american-verismo-and-san-francisco-opera/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Verismo opera composers often chose rural folk, poor city dwellers, and representatives of bohemianism.  Early works in this genre were P. Mascagni’s [[Cavalleria Rusticana]]( 1890) which chose rural folk, poor city dwellers, and bohemian characters.

The American painter Jerry Ross calls his style “American verismo.”  Jerry Ross has been teaching a series of workshops and classes in Eugene, Oregon based on his study of the I Macchiaioli.  He founded the group “Club Macchia,” a group of like-minded plein air painters working in Oregon and Washington.  The group had two important exhibitions in Oregon at the Newport Art Center in Newport and the Jacobs Gallery in Eugene.  The exhibition at the Jacobs Gallery in Eugene saw the distribution of their book about the group and was well attended.  This was one of the last exhibitions held at the Gallery before it went out of business in 2015.

In his classes, Ross teaches the concept of Macchia as “spot or stain or dab” and distinguishes between mass, line, color, and edge macchie (the plural of macchia).  Explaining the Francophile bias of American expressionism, Ross builds on the ideas of art historian Albert Boime and his book ''The Art of the Macchia and the Risorgimento, Representing Culture and Nationalism in Nineteenth-Century Italy''.&lt;ref&gt;Boime, Albert The Art of the MAcchia and the Risorgimento University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

This text had a huge effect on Ross who began incorporating the story of the I Macchialioli into his class materials.  Ross’s own background in the radical politics of the 1960s and 1970s led to his identification with the Tuscan group, many of whom participated in the struggle for Italian socialism and national unification.  In 2013, Ross wrote a "Manifesto of American Verismo," which summarized many of his ideas on the subject.

Desiring a painting style that was truly Italian and representative of their particular cultural characteristics, loose and expressive and breaking with tradition the I Macchiaioli began artistic movement.  As explained by Boime, their “sketch style” and “non finito” (unfinished) look was both modern and a clean break with academic “polish,” but also the subject matter was often political as well, featuring socio-political issues such as the plight of women, workers, and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugeneweekly.com/20151231/visual-arts/painting-political&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross makes the point that while line, mass, and color are important in every painting, for rapid plein air work one might be better off beginning with thumbnail “scribble” sketches and small two to four values studies using the biggest brush possible for the job.  This “disegno” (design) becomes the blueprint for the painting and establishes the “macchia” (in the sense of the harmonious overall distribution of lights and darks).  Without a strong macchia structure the work will lack “impact” (the term used by the I Macchiaioli artists) for such an imprimatur (underpainting) that becomes the basis for the final work (either through wet into wet or wet into dry approaches).

Ross points out that the most experienced plein air painters generally use this approach, sometimes called “contemporary impressionism.”  Ross notes that after absorbing some of the ideas in painting brought into the light of day by the Abstract Expressionists, plein air painters need to incorporate abstraction and descriptive/expressive brushwork as well as texture techniques that give the surface a three-dimensional quality.  His class “abstraction in plein air” emphasizes the idea of discovery of large abstract shapes and the importance of composition.  In his approach, “there is abstraction within realism and realism within abstraction.”&lt;ref&gt;Schulte, Mary Jane (September 25, 2014). "Adding Poetry to the World". "The Eugene Register Guard". pp. 1–2. Retrieved 2014-09-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malagasy architectural map.gif|200px|thumb|alt=Map of Madagascar indicating the distribution of predominant construction material over the island|The distribution of traditional construction materials in Madagascar presents a predominance of earthen dwellings in the central Highlands and largely plant-based construction along the coasts, with intermediary zones making use of both material types.]]
The '''architecture of Madagascar''' is unique in Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the [[Bubungan Tinggi|construction norms and methods of Southern Borneo]] from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar are believed to have immigrated. Throughout [[Madagascar]] and the [[South Kalimantan|Kalimantan]] region of [[Borneo]], most traditional houses follow a rectangular rather than round form, and feature a steeply sloped, peaked roof supported by a central pillar.

Differences in the predominant traditional construction materials used serve as the basis for much of the diversity in Malagasy architecture. Locally available plant materials were the earliest materials used and remain the most common among traditional communities. In intermediary zones between the central highlands and humid coastal areas, hybrid variations have developed that use [[cob (material)|cob]] and sticks.  Wood construction, once common across the island, declined as a growing human population destroyed greater swaths of virgin rainforest for [[slash and burn]] agriculture and [[zebu]] cattle pasture. The [[Zafimaniry]] communities of the central highland montane forests are the only [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic group]] who have preserved the island's original wooden architectural traditions; their craft was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] in 2003. As wood became scarce over time, wooden houses became the privilege of the noble class in certain communities, as exemplified by the homes of the Merina nobility in the 19th century [[Kingdom of Madagascar]]. The use of stone as a building material was traditionally limited to the construction of tombs, a significant feature of the cultural landscape in Madagascar due to the prominent position occupied by ancestors in Malagasy cosmology. The island has produced several distinct traditions in tomb architecture: among the [[Mahafaly]] of the southwest coast, the top of tombs may be stacked with the skulls of sacrificed zebu and spiked with ''[[aloalo]]'', decoratively carved tomb posts, while among the Merina, aristocrats historically constructed a small wooden house on top of the tomb to symbolize their ''andriana'' status and provide an earthly space to house their ancestors' spirits.

Traditional styles of architecture in Madagascar have been impacted over the past two hundred years by the increasing influence of European styles. A shift toward brick construction in the Highlands began during the reign of Queen [[Ranavalona II]] (1868–1883) based on models introduced by missionaries of the [[London Missionary Society]] and contacts with other foreigners. Foreign influence further expanded following the collapse of the monarchy and [[French Madagascar|French colonization]] of the island in 1896. Modernization over the past several decades has increasingly led to the abandonment of certain traditional norms related to the external orientation and internal layout of houses and the use of certain customary building materials, particularly in the Highlands. Among those with means, foreign construction materials and techniques – namely imported concrete, glass and wrought iron features – have gained in popularity, to the detriment of traditional practices.

== Plant-based construction ==
[[File:Raffia Houses in Sambava Madagascar.JPG|200px|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a small, one-room rectangular thatch hut with peaked roof |The most traditional coastal style: houses with thatched roofing of [[Traveler's palm|ravinala]] on low piles in [[Sambava]]]] Dwellings made of plant material are common in the coastal regions and were once commonly used throughout the Highlands as well.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis"&gt;{{cite book |last = Acquier |first = Jean-Louis |title = Architectures de Madagascar |publisher = Berger-Levrault | location = Berlin |year = 1997 |isbn = 978-2-7003-1169-3|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of plants available in a given locality determine the building material and style of construction.  The vast majority of homes made of plant material are rectangular, low (one-story) houses with a peaked roof and are often built on low stilts.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  These architectural features are nearly identical to those found in parts of [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Wake, C. Staniland." /&gt; Materials used for construction include [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] (near rivers), [[Juncaceae|rushes]] (in the southwest around [[Toliara]]), [[Didiereaceae|endemic succulents]] (as fencing in the south), wood (in the south and among the [[Zafimaniry]], and formerly common in the Highlands), [[bamboo]] (especially in the eastern [[rainforest|rain forests]]), [[papyrus]] (formerly in the Highlands around [[Alaotra|Lake Alaotra]]), grasses (ubiquitous), [[Arecaceae|palms]] (ubiquitous but prevalent in the west around [[Mahajanga]]) and [[raffia]] (especially in the north and northeast).&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

For much of the length of the eastern coast of Madagascar bordering the Indian Ocean, architecture is highly uniform: nearly all traditional homes in this region are built on low stilts and are roofed with [[thatch]] made of the fronds of the [[traveler's palm]] (''ravinala madagascariensis'').&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; [[File:Bamboo House in Sambava Madagascar.JPG|200px|thumb|alt=Small, rectangular one-room house with walls and roof made of flattened bamboo|Woven bamboo walls, plank roofing]] The stilts, floor and walls are commonly made of the trunk of this same plant, typically after pounding it flat to make wide planks (for floors and roofing) or narrow strips (for walls). These strips are affixed vertically to the frame; the raffia plant is often used in the same way, in place of the traveler's palm, in the north.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; When bamboo is used in place of ravinala, the long pounded sheets are often woven together to create walls with a checker-like pattern.&lt;ref name="Bloch"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bloch |first = Maurice | title = Placing the dead: tombs, ancestral villages and kinship organization in Madagascar |publisher = Berkeley Square House |location = London |year = 1971 |isbn =978-0-12-809150-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These traditional homes have no chimney. Their floor is covered in a woven mat with stones heaped in one corner where wood fires can be burnt to cook food; the smoke that accumulates blackens the ceiling and interior walls over time.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940" /&gt; The doorways of these homes were traditionally left open or could be shut by a woven screen held closed with a leather strap;&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940" /&gt; today the entryway is frequently hung with a fabric curtain.&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book |last = Kottak |first = Conrad |title = Madagascar: Society and History |publisher = Carolina Academic Press |year = 1986 | isbn =978-0-89089-252-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations on this basic template can be found in all coastal regions using locally available material.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  The largest of the traditional coastal houses are found in the southeast among the [[Antemoro]], [[Tanala]] and [[Antefasy]] peoples, where homes can reach 18' long, 9' wide and 15' high.  Elsewhere along the coast homes are much smaller, averaging 10' long, 8' wide and 9' high.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

[[File:Villaggio Mahafaly.JPG|200px|thumb|left|alt=Small one-room rectangular house with walls made of twigs packed with earth|Lateral branches form the walls of traditional wooden Mahafaly houses in the southwest of Madagascar.]] It is believed that wood construction was formerly common in many parts of Madagascar but it has all but disappeared due to deforestation.&lt;ref name="Gade 1996" /&gt;  This is especially true in the Highlands where, until recently, wood had been a building material reserved for the [[andriana|aristocratic class]] due to its increasing rarity, leaving the lower classes to construct in other locally available materials such as reeds and grasses; sticks and branches are occasionally used where available, creating sporadic villages of wood typically within proximity to forest reserves.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  While the wooden architectural tradition among the aristocracy of the [[Merina]] has died out,&lt;ref name="Victor"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kus |first1 = Susan |last2 = Raharijaona |first2 = Victor | title = House to Palace, Village to State: Scaling up Architecture and Ideology |journal = American Anthropologist |series=New Series |issue = 102 |volume = 1 |pages = 98–113 |year = 2000 |doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.98}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least two ethnic groups can be said to have a continuing tradition of plank wood architecture: the [[Zafimaniry]] in the central Highlands, and the [[Antandroy]] in the far south. Each of these three traditions is described below.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

=== Merina aristocratic tradition ===
Among the Merina of the central Highlands, the Temanambondro ([[Antaisaka]]) people of the southeastern [[Manambondro]] region, and several other ethnic groups, deforestation rendered wood a valuable construction material only to be used by aristocrats.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gade 1996" /&gt;  Indeed, its traditional association with the royal ''andriana'' class led King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787–1810) to issue a royal edict forbidding construction in stone, brick or earth within the limits of [[Antananarivo]]&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; and codifying a tradition in which only the houses of nobles were constructed from wood, while those of peasants were made from local plant materials.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last = Oliver |first = Samuel Pasfield | authorlink = Samuel Pasfield Oliver | title = Madagascar: an historical and descriptive account of the island and its former dependencies, Volume 2 |publisher = Macmillan |year = 1886 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lKtBAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition historically existed among a number of ethnic groups in Madagascar, particularly along the eastern coast where the preservation of rainforests continues to facilitate access to wood for construction.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt;

Note the long ''tandrotrano'' extending past the roofline.]]
Traditional peasants' houses throughout Imerina featured a thick central pillar (''andry'') that supported the roof beam and a smaller upright beam at each corner extending into the ground to stabilize the structure.&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt;  Unlike most coastal houses, Highland homes have never been raised on stilts but have always sat flush to the ground.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  To the south of the central pillar, in the area designated for sleeping and cooking, wooden or bamboo planks were occasionally installed for flooring, or woven mats were laid on the packed earth floor, which extended north past the pillar. Traditionally, the bed of the head of the family was in the southeast corner of the house.&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt;  The northern area was distinguished by the hearth, delineated by three oblong stones set vertically into the ground. Houses and tombs were aligned on a north-south axis with the entrance on the west face.&lt;ref name="Nativel"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nativel | first = Didier | title = Maisons royales, demures des grands à Madagascar | publisher = Karthala Editions| year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8IOZLvSrspIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010 | isbn =978-2-84586-539-6|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The north portion of the house was reserved for males and guests, while the south was for women, children and those of inferior rank. The northeast corner was sacred, reserved for prayer and offerings of tribute to the ancestors.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;

The houses of the nobles were constructed according to these same cultural norms, with several additions.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  They were distinguishable from the outside by their walls made of upright wooden planks and the long wooden horns (''tandrotrano'') formed by the crossing of the roof beams at each end of the roof peak.  The length of the ''tandrotrano'' was indicative of rank: the longer the length, the higher the status of the noble family that lived within.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; The interior of the building was also somewhat modified, often featuring three central pillars rather than one and occasionally a wooden platform bed raised high off the ground.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;

After Andrianampoinimerina's edicts regarding construction materials in the capital were revoked in the late 1860s,&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; wooden construction was all but abandoned in Imerina and older wooden houses were rapidly replaced with new brick homes inspired by [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] missionaries' British-style dwellings.&lt;ref name="Gade 1996" /&gt;  The ''tandrotrano'' horns were gradually replaced by a simple decorative finial installed at the two ends of the roof peak.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Other architectural norms such as the north-south orientation, central pillar and interior layout of homes were abandoned, and the presence of finials on roof peaks is no longer indicative of a particular social class.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  Classic examples of Highland wooden architecture of the aristocratic class were preserved in the buildings of the [[Rova of Antananarivo|Rova compound of Antananarivo]] (destroyed in a fire in 1995 but under reconstruction)&lt;ref name="Trano manara"&gt;{{cite book |last = Frémigacci |first = Jean |title = Histoire d'Afrique |contribution = Le Rova de Tananarive: Destruction d'un lieu saint ou constitution d'une référence identitaire? | editor-last = Chrétien | editor-first = Jean-Pierre | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EwjjGtHsaZsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages = 421–444 | accessdate = December 1, 2010 | publisher = Editions Karthala | year = 1999 | isbn =978-2-86537-904-0|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the walled compound at [[Ambohimanga]], location of the wooden palaces of King Andrianampoinimerina and [[Ranavalona I|Queen Ranavalona I]]. Ambohimanga, arguably the most culturally significant remaining example of the wooden architecture of the Highlands aristocracy, was named a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO |title=Woodcrafting Knowledge of the Zafimaniry |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;RL=00080 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vm8Z5sJZ?url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;RL=00080 |archivedate=January 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zafimaniry traditions ===
[[File:Zafimaniry Village Madagascar.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=Several large decoratively carved houses with peaked roofs made entirely of fitted wooden planks|The Zafimaniry construct wooden houses with solid doors and shuttered windows.]]
The Zafimaniry inhabit the heavily forested, rainy and temperate region of the Highlands to the east of [[Ambositra]].  Their homes are rectangular and large (15' long, 12' wide and 18' high) with a peaked roof, overhanging eaves, and wooden windows and doors.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Many of the same standards found in the aristocratic architectural traditions of Imerina are present in the Zafimaniry structures, including the central wooden pillar supporting the roof beam, exclusive use of a [[tongue and groove]] joining technique and the orientation of building features such as windows, doors and the interior layout.&lt;ref name="Zafimaniry"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bloch |first = Maurice |title = About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond | contribution = The Resurrection of the House Amongst the Zafimaniry of Madagascar| editor1-last = Carsten | editor1-first = Janet |editor2-last = Hugh-Jones | editor2-first = Stephen | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AW8JczneTwoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |pages=69–83 |year = 1995 |isbn =978-0-521-47953-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zafimaniry houses are often elaborately decorated with carved, symmetrical, abstract patterns that are rich in complex spiritual and mythological symbolism.&lt;ref name="Zafimaniry" /&gt;  The architecture of the houses found in this region are considered to be representative of the architectural style that predominated throughout the Highlands prior to deforestation, and as such, they represent the last vestiges of a historic tradition and a significant element of Malagasy cultural heritage.  For this reason, the woodcrafting knowledge of the Zafimaniry was added in 2003 to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref name="Zafimaniry" /&gt;

=== Antandroy traditions ===
By contrast, the Antandroy inhabit the [[Madagascar spiny thickets]], an extremely dry and hot region in the south of Madagascar where unique forms of drought-resistant plants have evolved and thrived.  Their homes are traditionally square (not rectangular), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; These homes traditionally had no windows and featured three wooden doors: the front door was the women's entrance, the door at the rear of the house was for children, and the third door was used by the men.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chapman | first = Olive | title = Primitive tribes in Madagascar | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–25 | year = 1940 | doi = 10.2307/1788495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using [[Opuntia|prickly-pear cactus]] (''raketa'') or lengths of [[Didiereaceae|indigenous succulents]] from the surrounding spiny forests.&lt;ref name="Linton"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Linton | first = Ralph | title = Culture Areas in Madagascar | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 363–390 | year = 1928 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1928.30.3.02a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign influences ===

Foreigners were responsible for several architectural innovations that blended the traditions of Highlands architecture with European sensibilities.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  In 1819, Louis Gros designed the Tranovola for [[Radama I]] in the Rova complex, introducing the wraparound veranda supported by exterior columns.  Jean Laborde designed the Queen's Palace in the Rova (built 1839–1841) using this same model on an even grander scale by enlarging the building and adding a third-story veranda.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  The new wooden buildings constructed by Gros and Laborde transformed the ''tandrotrano'' of traditional aristocratic Merina homes into the a decoratively carved post affixed at each end of the gable peak.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

=== Local innovations ===
[[File:Ambalavao house.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Two-story brick house with peaked roof and simple second-floor covered veranda supported by four equidistant pillars |Typical brick houses with columns and west-facing veranda, near Antananarivo]]
In 1867, restrictions were relaxed on the aristocracy's use of stone and brick as building materials, before all restrictions on construction were abolished in 1869 by Queen [[Ranavalona II]], who had already commissioned Jean Laborde in 1860 to encase the exterior of her wooden palace at the Rova in stone.  The building took its final form in 1872 after James Cameron added stone towers to each corner of the palace.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt; The queen converted to Christianity in 1869 and that same year the London Missionary Society commissioned James Cameron to construct a private home for its missionaries.  He drew his inspiration from the work of Gros and Laborde to develop a multi-story wooden house with veranda and columns.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  This model exploded in popularity throughout Antananarivo and surrounding areas as an architectural style for the aristocracy, who had to that point continued to inhabit simple homes similar to the wooden palace of Andrianampoinimerina at [[Ambohimanga]]. These newly favored brick houses often featured shortened ''tandrotrano'' and elaborately carved verandas.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt; These homes can naturally range in color from deep red to almost white depending on the characteristics of the earth used in its construction.&lt;ref name="Bradt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradt |first1=Hilary |last2= Austin |first2=Daniel |title=Madagascar |edition=9th |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |year=2007 |location=Guilford, CT |isbn=978-1-84162-197-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vyNVb2q0RisC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Landscape Madagascar 02.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=Two-story rectangular brick building with peaked roof and no balcony or supporting columns|''Trano gasy'': In rural areas, simplified brick houses retain the two stories but may lose the veranda and obscure the supporting columns]]
Over time, and particularly with the [[French Madagascar|colonization of Madagascar]] by the French, these earthen houses (known as ''trano gasy'' – "Malagasy house") underwent constant evolution.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P."&gt;{{cite news|last=Andriamihaja |first=Nasolo Valiavo |title=Habitat traditionnel ancien par JP Testa (1970), Revue de Madagascar: Evolution syncrétique depuis Besakana jusqu'au trano gasy |newspaper=L'Express de Madagascar |location=Antananarivo |date=July 5, 2006 |url=http://www.madatana.com/article-trano-gasy.php |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vm8o1KK7?url=http://www.madatana.com/article-trano-gasy.php |archivedate=January 16, 2011 |language=fr |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest form of earthen house is one or more stories tall, rectangular, and features a thatched roof with slightly overhanging eaves to direct rain away from the foundation and thereby prevent its erosion.  Wealthier families replace the thatch with clay roofing tiles and construct a veranda on the west face of the building supported by four slender equidistant columns; this design is even more effective at protecting the building's foundations from the eroding effects of rainfall.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Further expansion often entails the enclosure of the western veranda in wood and the construction of an open veranda on the eastern face of the building, and so forth, leading to wrap-around verandas, the connection of two separate buildings with a covered passage, the incorporation of French wrought-iron grills or glass panels into verandas, the application of painted concrete over the brick surface and other innovations.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P." /&gt;  In suburban and rural zones, the ground floor of the ''trano gasy'' is often reserved as a pen for livestock, while the family inhabits the upper floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mouchet | first1 = Jean | last2 = Carnevale | first2 = Pierre |last3 = Manguin | first3 = Sylvie |title = Biodiversity of malaria in the world | publisher = John Libbey Eurotext | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hSUfzyxZRuwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page = 174 | accessdate = December 1, 2010 | isbn =978-2-7420-0616-8 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entrance typically faces west; the kitchen is often to the south, while the family sleeps in the northern part of the building.  This configuration is consistent with that seen in the traditional Zafimaniry houses and reflects traditional cosmology.&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt;

== Mixed cob construction ==
On the eastern side of Madagascar, there is virtually no zone of transition between the earthen houses of the Highlands and the dwellings made of plant materials common to the coastal regions.  In the vast and sparsely populated expanses between the Highlands and the western coastal areas, however, inhabitants utilize locally available materials to construct dwellings that bear features of both regions.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Most often houses are small – one room and only one story high – constructed of a skeleton of horizontally arranged sticks affixed to the wooden house frame as pictured in the preceding section on wooden construction.  But unlike coastal homes where this stick skeleton would serve as a base for affixing plant material to form walls, earthen cob may be packed into the framework instead.  The roof is thatched to complete the dwelling.  These intermediary houses are also often distinguished by the presence of shortened Highlands-style wooden columns on the western face to support the elongated eave of the peaked roof, much as they support the verandas of the larger homes of Imerina.  The floor is typically packed dirt and may be covered with woven mats of grasses or raffia.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

== Tomb construction ==
According to the traditional beliefs of many Malagasy ethnic groups, one attains the status of "ancestor" after death.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt;  It is often believed that ancestors continue to watch over and shape events on Earth and can intervene on behalf of (or interfere with) the living.  As a consequence, ancestors are to be revered: prayers and sacrifices to honor or appease them are common, as well as the observation of the local ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboos) the ancestors may have established in life. Gestures of respect, such as throwing the first capful of a new bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to share it with the ancestors, are practiced throughout the island.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt; The most visible emblem of the respect due to ancestors is the construction of the elaborate family tombs that dot the countryside in much of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Campbell |first = Gwyn | title = The Structure of Trade in Madagascar, 1750–1810 |journal = The International Journal of African Historical Studies |issue = 26 |volume = 1 |pages = 111–148 |year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the majority of Malagasy ethnic groups did not construct solid tombs for their dead.  Rather, the bodies of the deceased were left in a designated natural area to decompose. Among the [[Bara people]] of the southern arid plains, for instance, tombs may be built into natural features such as rock outcroppings or hillsides by placing the bodies within and partially or entirely sealing the space with stacked stones or zebu skulls. Alternately, among the [[Tanala]], the deceased may be placed in coffins made from hollowed-out logs and left in caves or a sacred grove of trees, sometimes covered over by wooden planks held down by small piles of stones.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt; It is said the [[Vazimba]], the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar, submerged their dead in the waters of a designated bog, river, lake or estuary, which was thereby considered sacred for that purpose.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940" /&gt; The practice also existed among the earliest Merina, who submerged their dead chiefs in canoes into Highland bogs or other designated  waters.&lt;ref name="Linton" /&gt; Where tombs were built, minor variation in form and placement from one ethnic group to the next is overshadowed by common features: the structure is partially or fully subterranean, typically rectangular in design and made of stone that is either stacked loosely or cemented with masonry. Among the Merina and [[Betsileo]], some early stone tombs and burial sites were indicated by upright, unmarked standing stones.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

=== Islamic origins of tomb construction ===
The earliest known rectangular stone tombs on Madagascar were most likely built by Arab settlers around the 14th century in the northwestern part of the island.&lt;ref name="Vérin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vérin | first = Pierre  |title = The history of civilisation in North Madagascar | year = 1986 | isbn =978-90-6191-021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar models emerged later among western (i.e. [[Sakalava]], Mahafaly) and highlands (i.e. Merina, Betsileo) peoples, first using unhewn stones and heaped or packed earth before transitioning toward masonry.&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bird | first = Randall |journal=African Arts |title=The Merina landscape in early 19th century highlands Madagascar | date = Winter 2005 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=18–23, 91–92 |jstor=20447730 | doi=10.1162/afar.2005.38.4.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Highlands, the transition to masonry was preceded by the construction of tombs from massive stone slabs collectively hauled by community members to the tomb site. Late 18th century Merina king Andrianampoinimerina is said to have encouraged the construction of such tombs, observing "A house is for a lifetime but a tomb is for eternity."&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;

=== Highlands traditions ===

In the Highlands of Imerina, the above-ground entrances of ancient tombs were originally marked by standing stones and the walls were formed of loosely stacked flat stones.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt; Examples of these ancient tombs can be found at some of the [[twelve sacred hills of Imerina]]. Where a body was not able to be retrieved for burial (as in times of war), a tall, unmarked standing stone (''vatolahy'', or "male stone") was sometimes traditionally erected in memory of the deceased.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt;
Andrianampoinimerina promoted more elaborate and costly tomb construction as a worthy expense for honoring one's ancestors. He also declared that the highest Merina ''andriana'' (noble) sub-castes would enjoy the privilege of constructing a small house on top of a tomb to distinguish them from the tombs of lower castes.&lt;ref name="Trano manara" /&gt;  The two highest ''andriana'' sub-castes, the ''Zanakandriana'' and the ''Zazamarolahy'', built tomb houses called ''trano masina'' ("sacred house"), while the tomb houses of the ''Andriamasinavalona'' were called ''trano manara'' ("cold house"). These houses were identical to standard wooden nobles' houses except for the fact that they had no windows and no hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Van Gennep | first = Arnold | title = Tabou et totémisme à Madagascar: étude descriptive et théorique | publisher = Ernest Leroux Editeur | year = 1904 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=koESAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages = 126–127 | accessdate = December 1, 2010|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Lamba (garment)|lamba]]-wrapped remains were laid to rest on stone slabs in the tomb below, the deceased's valuable possessions such as gold and silver coins, elegant silk lambas, decorative objects and more were placed in the ''trano masina'' or ''trano manara'', which was often decorated much like a regular room with comfortable furniture and refreshments such as rum and water for the deceased's spirit to enjoy.  The ''trano masina'' of King Radama I, which burned with other structures in the 1995 fire at the Rova palace compound in Antananarivo, was said to be the richest known.&lt;ref name="Trano manara" /&gt;

Today, tombs may be constructed using traditional methods and materials or incorporate modern innovations such as concrete.&lt;ref name="Concrete"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vogel | first = Claude | title = Les quatre-mères d'Ambohibaho: étude d'une population régionale d'Imerina (Madagascar) | publisher = Selaf | year = 1982 | isbn =978-2-85297-074-8|language=fr}}&lt;!--|accessdate = December 1, 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Inside, superimposed slabs of stone or concrete line the walls.  The bodies of the ancestors of an individual family are wrapped in silk shrouds and laid to sleep on these slabs.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt; Among the Merina, Betsileo and Tsihanaka, the remains are periodically removed for the [[famadihana]], a celebration in honor of the ancestors, wherein the remains are re-wrapped in fresh shrouds amid extravagant communal festivities before being once again laid to rest in the tomb.  The significant expense associated with tomb construction, funerals and reburial ceremonies honors the ancestors even as it counters the emergence of unequal wealth distribution in traditional communities.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;
[[File:Mahafaly tomb painted carved south Madagascar.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Low rectangular tomb carved and painted with geometric shapes |Mahafaly tomb with traditional painted decoration]]

=== Southern and western traditions ===
The tombs found in the southwest of Madagascar are among the most striking and distinctive.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufmann | first1 = J.C. | year = 2000 | title = Forget the Numbers: The Case of a Madagascar Famine | url = | journal = History in Africa | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 143–157 | doi=10.2307/3172111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like those in the Highlands they are generally rectangular and partially subterranean; modern tombs may incorporate concrete in addition to (or in place of) traditional stone.  They are distinguished from Highlands tombs by their elaborate decoration: images may be painted on the exterior of the tomb, recalling events in an ancestor's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Australian Museum |title=Burial – Madagascar |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Burial-Madagascar |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vm95CxzM?url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Burial-Madagascar |archivedate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The roof of the tomb may be stacked with the horns of [[zebu]] sacrificed in the ancestor's honor at their funeral, and numerous [[aloalo]]—wooden funerary posts carved with symbolic patterns or images representing events in the life of the deceased—may be planted on top.  The tombs of the Mahafaly people are especially famed for this type of construction.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann" /&gt;  Among the Sakalava of the western coast, aloalo may be topped with erotic carvings evocative of the cycle of birth, life and death.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt;

== Modern architecture ==
Foreign architectural influences, having arisen through increased European contact over the course of the 19th century, intensified dramatically with the advent of French colonization in 1896.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thomas | first = Philip | title = Conspicuous Construction: Houses, Consumption and 'Relocalization' in Manambondro, Southeast Madagascar | journal = The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–446 | date = September 1998 | doi = 10.2307/3034155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the past several decades, the increasing availability of relatively inexpensive modern construction materials imported from China and elsewhere has further reinforced a growing trend in urban areas away from traditional architectural styles in favor of more durable but generic structures using industrially produced materials such as concrete and sheet metal.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P." /&gt; Certain modern innovations may be more highly esteemed than others. In the Manambondro region, for instance, corrugated sheet metal roofing was typically the least expensive and prestigious and most common addition to a traditional house. The replacement of locally sourced wood frames with factory-milled lumber was the next most common house modification, followed by the laying of a concrete foundation. Houses built entirely of concrete with glass windows and imported decorative balcony railings and window bars implied great wealth and the highest social status. Although low income levels have served to preserve traditional construction among the majority of the population of Madagascar, due to the prestige associated with modern architectural innovations, traditional construction is often abandoned as income increases.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt;

A limited number of recently constructed homes in Antananarivo attempt to blend Malagasy architectural traditions with the comforts of modern house construction. These hybrids resemble traditional brick Highlands houses from the exterior, but use modern materials and construction techniques to efficiently incorporate electricity, plumbing, air conditioning and current kitchen features in a fully contemporary interior. This innovation is exemplified in the recent residential development at "Tana Water Front" in the Ambodivona district of downtown Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P." /&gt;

An '''aromachologist''' is a person who practices [[aromachology]], which is a method of using smells or [[essential oil]]s to create, either in isolation or through blending in formulations, essential oils that have behavioral, physical and emotional benefits. Smell is the least studied of the senses, but aromachology is being used increasingly in [[healthcare]] and building science, and also in the world of sports and in practical matters such as real estate sales.

While all aromachologists have a refined sense of smell, some employ other senses including sight, sound and hearing. These are [[Synesthesia|synesthetes]] and history documents famous synesthetes such as the British painter [[David Hockney]], the Russian artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]], the Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]] and the English poet [[William Blake]].

An aromachologist is a person who studies the effects of fragrance on human psychology and behavior and works with essential oils for their positive effects on behavior and feeling. An aromachologist is a practitioner of aromachology, which is a term coined in 1982 by the Olfactory Research Fund, now known as the [[Sense of Smell Institute]], a division of the Fragrance Foundation, which has funded numerous medical, university and individual studies on the effects of scents on sleep and performance. Aromachology differs from [[aromatherapy]].

An aromachologist is a formulator who works with essential oils for their aromatic and physical effects and is an expert in the way essential oils can be blended and articulated together to create “behavioral fragrances”&lt;ref&gt;Damian, Kate,'' Aromatherapy: Scent and Psyche'', page 120, 1995, Healing Arts Press, USA, {{ISBN|0-89281-530-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish the positive effects of aromas on human behavior including feelings and emotions.

The aims of aromachology are to “study the interrelationship of psychology and the latest in fragrance technology and to transmit through odor a variety of specific feelings (such as relaxation, exhilaration, sensuality, happiness and achievement) directly to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Lis-Balchin, ''Aromatherapy Science: A Guide for Healthcare Professionals'', page 3, 2006, Pharmaceutical Press, Publications Division of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, {{ISBN|0-85369-578-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When odors activate the [[olfactory]] pathways that lead to the [[limbic]] portion of the brain they trigger the release of [[neurotransmitters]] that affect the brain and mental state of the individual in a variety of ways. Further, stimuli transmitted to the limbic system cannot be consciously blocked and all olfactory stimuli therefore influence our [[emotion]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Smell as a sense is the last frontier of neuroscience and has not been studied in as much depth as vision and hearing. The brain is able to process small differences in smell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070428094824.htm "Brain Processes Sense of Smell Better Than Previously Thought"] "Science Daily", April 30, 2007, retrieved  2009-12-3&lt;/ref&gt; and the sense of smell may last longer in the aging process than sight and hearing. The olfactory bulb is that portion of the brain which processes smells information and its oscillations alter dynamically according to the tasks involved.

==Synesthesia==
There are some people who process smells differently, hearing them as sounds. Canadian aromachologist, Nadine Artemis, author and formulator for Living Libations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livinglibations.com&lt;/ref&gt; is one such [[Synesthesia|synestheste]].{{Failed verification|date=February 2010}}

When Artemis picks up a scent, she also sees colors. Therefore, when she is creating in aromachology, she is not only combining a palette of smells, she is also mixing a palette of colors to blend the purest, organic essential oils into an array of beneficial products. For example, when Artemis sniffs tainted or synthetic fragrances, she sees them as murky gray or muddy brown. Discovering this extraordinary sense of smell at a young age, Artemis sees different distillations of rose, one of the world’s most expensive essential oils, as hues and tones of pink and red. Calming chamomile comes across in hues varying from oceanic teals to deep royal blues.

==Universal synesthesia==
It is believed that we all possess a small degree of [[synesthesia]]&lt;ref&gt;Vintini, Leonardo,[https://archive.is/20130204100533/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/science-technology/synesthetic-synesthesia-patricia-duffy-dr-jamie-ward-dr-richard-cytowic-5912.html "We Could All Be a Little Synesthetic"], ''Epoch Times'', October 20, 2008, updated November 28, 2009, retrieved 2009-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; according to Dr Jamie Ward &amp;mdash; quality of intermixing images, sounds and other sensations. The Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]] is believed to have employed four senses of touch, smell, color and sound.

There are many instances of literature that may have portrayed synesthesia. For example, the famous poet [[William Blake]] (1757–1827) was probably a synesthete. In his poem “Wild Flower Song”, he writes: 
:As I wander'd the forest,
:The green leaves among,
:I heard a wild flower
:Singing a song

In the book ''Perfume'' by [[Patrick Süskind]], the main character, Grenouille, is born with a hyper-acute sense of smell but lacks his own bodily scent. He goes on a life quest, including many murders, to recreate the scent of innocence he sniffed on a beautiful girl.

==Effects of aromachology==

Studies have been conducted to show that those parts of the brain which govern alertness and concentration can be influenced positively or negatively by the olfactory substances used. [[Jasmine]] in a testing room enhanced the problem-solving cognitive skills of participants and also led to them demonstrating more interest and motivation for the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Rottman"&gt;Rottman, T. R. (1989). The effects of ambient odor on the cognitive performance, mood, and activation, of low and high impulsive individuals in a naturally arousing situation. ''Diss. Abstr. Int.'' 50:365B 1989&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of [[eucalyptus]], [[peppermint oil]] and [[ethanol]] has been shown to improve cognitive performance, and after a monotonous stressful task experimental subjects were shown to demonstrate greater motivation after being exposed to a blend of peppermint, [[bergamot essential oil|bergamot]], [[sandalwood]] and [[lavender]].&lt;ref name="Rottman"/&gt;

==Role of an aromachologist==

Pleasant aromas cause people to linger longer, a boon to [[retail]] stores, museums, spas and [[casino]]s. Pleasant smells have been shown to improve productivity, and improve physical performance, with athletes running faster, doing more pushups, and experiencing shorter recovery time after an extensive workout when the room was scented with either [[peppermint]] or [[lemon]].&lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, B., Corley, N., &amp; Eppich, W., Pages 156-160. Augmenting athletic performance through the administration of peppermint odor. ''Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology'', 23,(2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

By blending specific smells, an aromachologist can create a more restful environment and improve health conditions. A study in 1987&lt;ref name="Kempski"&gt;Kempski, Diotoma von, Page 63, "The Use of Olfactory Stimulants to Improve Air Quality", ''Journal of the Human Environmental System'', Vol 5; No.2 61-68, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the smells found in [[nutmeg oil]], maize extract, neroli oil, valerian oil, myristici, soelemcin and [[elemicin]] reduce stress in humans as well as reducing stress-related high blood pressure. The Mind Lab, an independent consultancy in the UK, studies the odor of a building as part of research on the brain’s responses to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;McCooey, Christopher, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ac8eac6-cf93-11dc-854a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 Scenting Success], ''Financial Times'', Feb 02 2008, retrieved 2009-10-03&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate brokers have been recommending to their clients to have smells of freshly baked cookies or the aroma of coffee in the house when it is being presented to potential buyers to create a sense of home. By bottling and releasing appropriate smells to evoke comfort, safety and joy, an owner may be able to accelerate the sale of a house.

Worker productivity can be enhanced by improving the quality of air in a building, not just by removing the negative pollutants, but also by introducing through ventilation or air conditioning systems olfactory stimulation]s to get a mix of ventilated air and odor.

It is necessary to ensure that the dosage is such that the odor is not excessive and should be kept just above the detection level. Also, these olfactory substances are very different from perfume and should instead replicate the smell of natural outdoor air.&lt;ref name="Kempski"/&gt;

A skilled aromachologist can concoct combinations of oils to reduce [[road rage]], reduce fatigue and improve concentration while driving.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Peppermint decreases anxiety and fatigue while driving, and in combination with [[cinnamon]] it reduces the level of frustration encountered in traffic and also heightens alertness.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Jasmine is used as a sleep aid and the scent of [[vanilla]] is useful for those who want to cut the craving for sweets after lunch.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Linda, http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200711/the-hidden-force-fragrance?page=2, ''Psychology Today'', Nov 21 1008, Retrieved 2009-10-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teatro Baralt by Beria.jpg|thumb|View from the south-east, corner of ''Calle 95'' and ''Avenida 5'']]
'''El Teatro Baralt''' is an important [[Venezuelan culture|Venezuelan cultural institution]] dating from the first half of the 19th century, and headquartered in downtown [[Maracaibo]], at the north-western corner of Plaza Bolivar, at the intersection of the streets Urdaneta and Venezuela. Its famous home, today's Baralt Theater (Teatro Baralt) has undergone a long history of constructions.

Construction of the theater started in 1839 on the property donated by wealthy landowner, don Miguel Antonio Baralt, son of don Ignacio Baralt y Torres – founder of that lineage in Venezuela – and father in turn of one of the glories of Venezuela's literary world: the famed author [[Rafael María Baralt]]. With subsequent additional help from the "Society of Industrialists", under the presidency of José Montaña Arrieta, a decree was emitted by that society on December 5 of 1845, committing the amount of 3,000 pesos for the construction of a more permanent structure within the property of don Miguel. This first structure, operating between the 1840s and 1870s, was known as Baralt's Theater (or Teatro ''de'' Baralt), following a custom dating from decades before, when don Miguel used to lend his parcel of land between Urdaneta and Venezuela for impromptu theatrical performances using a temporarily built stage. As such, this location had been associated with theatrical performances since the early parts of the 19th century and the informal denomination, "el Teatro de Baralt" (after don Miguel), stuck until that time when his donation of land to the city allowed for the construction of an even grander venue.

This occurred on July 28, 1877, when general Rafael Parra, then President of the State of Zulia (the equivalent of today's modern title of Governor), ordered the demolition of the old theater and construction of the new, proceeding to place the first stone of the new complex on October 7 of the same year. The new building, in neo-classical style, was finished on time for a spectacular inauguration made to coincide with the centennial of Simon Bolivar's birth in 1883, being rechristened Teatro Baralt in honor of don Miguel's son&amp;nbsp;... that famous man of letters mentioned above. A Spartan building, built in the same spirit of the classical productions it had the good fortune to host, it remained a favorite of Maracaibo's elite until its demolition in 1928 at the orders of Vicente Pérez Soto, then Governor of the State, to be replaced by a design by the architect León Jerónimo Hoet – opening its doors on December 19, 1932.

On November 1981, Baralt Theater joined the list of Venezuela's National Monuments; often a first step in the arduous and very selective process of becoming a World Heritage Site. After an extensive and expert restoration, the theater reopened its doors in 1998 regaling the urban landscape with yet another architectural jewel, one which remains a treasured Venezuelan institution to this day.

[[File:An-actress-at-her-toilet-or-miss-brazen-just-breecht-john-colley.jpg|300px|thumb|1779 John Colley Playbill of an actress dressing in breeches]]
{{Crossdressing|history}}
A '''breeches role''' (also '''pants role''' or '''trouser role''', ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' or "Hosenrolle") is a role in which an actress appears in male clothing. [[Breeches]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|tʃ|ᵻ|z}}, also "britches"), tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the standard male garment at the time breeches roles were introduced. 

In opera it also refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a [[mezzo-soprano]] or [[contralto]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Budden J. Breeches part. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in ''[[Fidelio]]'' or Gilda in Act III of ''[[Rigoletto]]'') are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''), Octavian (''[[Der Rosenkavalier]])'', Hansel (''[[Hansel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel und Gretel]]'') and Orpheus (''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Euridice]]''), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a [[castrato]] and later, in the revised French version, an [[haute-contre]].

Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; [[Hamlet#Hamlet as a character|Hamlet]] is not a breeches role, but [[Sarah Bernhardt]] once played Hamlet ''as'' a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as "containing" a breeches role, this ''does'' mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.

== History ==
When the London theatres re-opened in 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of [[Restoration comedy]] and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays.

Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these [[cross-dressing]] roles subvert conventional [[gender roles]] by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object". The epilogue to [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''Sir Anthony Love'' (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous "breeches" actress [[Susanna Verbruggen|Susanna Mountfort]] (also known as Susanna Verbruggen):

:You'll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see,
:In a contented lazy waggery,
:The Female Mountford bare above the knee.

Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelation scene where the character not only unpins her hair but as often reveals a breast as well. This is evidenced in the portraits of many of these actresses of the Restoration.

Breeches roles remained an attraction on the British stage for centuries, but their fascination gradually declined as the difference in real-life male and female clothing became less extreme. They played a part in [[Victorian burlesque]] and are traditional for the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]].

== Opera ==
Historically, the list of roles that are considered to be breeches roles is constantly changing, depending on the tastes of the opera-going public. In early Italian opera, many leading operatic roles were assigned to a [[castrato]], a male castrated before puberty with a very strong and high voice. As the practice of castrating boy singers faded, composers created heroic male roles in the mezzo-soprano range, where singers such as [[Marietta Alboni]] and Rosamunda Pisaroni specialised in such roles.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; (See ''[[Serse|Xerxes]]'' below.)

Currently, many castrato roles are being reclaimed by men. As the training and use of [[countertenor]]s becomes more common, there are more men with these very high voices to sing these roles.

Casting directors are left with choices such as whether to cast the young Prince Orlofsky in [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss II's]] ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' for a woman or man; both commonly sing the role. When played by a mezzo, the prince looks like a woman, but sounds like a boy. When played by a counter-tenor, he looks like a man, but sings like a woman. This disparity is made even clearer if, as in this case, there is also spoken dialogue.

The term ''Travesty'' (from the Italian ''travesti'', disguised) applies to any roles sung by the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;Budden J. Travesty. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is a ''skirt role'', a female character to be played by a male singer, usually for comic or visual effect. These roles are often ugly stepsisters or very old women, and are not as common as trouser roles. As women were not allowed to sing on stage in the [[Papal States]] during the [[Baroque period]], many female operatic roles which premiered in those areas were originally written as skirt roles for [[castrato|castrati]] (e.g. ''Mandane'' and ''Semira'' in [[Leonardo Vinci]]'s [[Artaserse (Vinci)|Artaserse]]). Britten's Madwoman in ''[[Curlew River]]'' and the Cook in Prokofiev's ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' are examples. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', although written for a mezzo-soprano is now more regularly{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} sung by a tenor, who sings the part an octave lower. In the same opera the "male" roles of Hänsel, the Sandman, and the Dewman are however meant to be sung by women.

'''Britt Allcroft''' (born '''Hilary Mary Allcroft''', 14 December 1943) is an English film, television and live theater producer, writer, director and voice actress. She is the creator of the children's television series ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends]]'' (later re-titled ''[[Thomas &amp; Friends]]''), ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' (with Rick Siggelkow) and ''[[Magic Adventures of Mumfie]]''. She wrote, co-produced and directed the film ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' (2000).

==Life and career==
She was born Hilary Mary Allcroft in [[Worthing]], England. At the age of 16, she changed her first name to Britt as her career in British radio and television gained momentum. She went on to create a succession of programmes for the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] during the 1970s and 1980s, including ''Moon Clue Game'', ''Dance Crazy'' and ''Keepsakes''. ''Mothers By Daughters'', produced for Channel Four, was broadcast by [[PBS]] in the United States. She also worked in theatre, staging shows at the [[London Palladium]] and [[Drury Lane]] Theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britt Allcroft|url=https://www.buckinghamcovers.com/celebrities/view/613-britt-allcroft.php|website=buckinghamcovers.com|accessdate=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, while making a documentary about British steam trains, Allcroft met the Reverend [[Wilbert Awdry]], author of ''[[The Railway Series]]'' of children's books. She said, "It really didn't take me long to become intrigued by the characters, the relationships between them and the nostalgia they invoked." She told him that she wanted to bring these stories to life and made an arrangement to secure certain rights through the then publishers [[Kaye &amp; Ward]].&lt;ref name=TTtTEM&gt;{{cite book

In 1980, she co-founded Britt Allcroft Railway Productions (internationally known as The Britt Allcroft Company) with her husband, television producer [[Angus Wright (producer)|Angus Wright]]. It took Allcroft four years to raise the funding for, and create, a first series of twenty-six episodes in collaboration with director [[David Mitton]]. The first two episodes of ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends]]'', shot on [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] with narration by [[Ringo Starr]] in the U.K./U.S. and music by Mike O'Donnell and [[Junior Campbell]], were aired together for the first time on British television on 9 October 1984.

The series's success in the U K., and the merchandising campaign that Allcroft had been organising since 1983, soon led to further success in other parts of the world. In 1989, she and American producer Rick Siggelkow created ''[[Shining Time Station]]'', a live-action children's sitcom fronted by the magical character of the miniature Mr. Conductor, who introduced two ''Thomas'' stories in each half-hour programme. ''Shining Time Station'' won a number of awards and significantly increased the popularity of the ''Thomas'' media franchise in the United States. ''Shining Time Station'' lasted until 1995.

Allcroft followed ''Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends'' and ''Shining Time Station'' with the cartoon-animated ''[[Magic Adventures of Mumfie]]'' in collaboration with director John Collins. Inspired by the books by Katharine Tozer, this production received critical acclaim and was seen in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| title =''The Magic Adventures of Mumfie''| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.mumfieand.me/britts-page| accessdate =30 September 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121105074924/http://www.mumfieand.me/britts-page| archivedate =5 November 2012| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, several years after she left her original company, Allcroft bought back the ''Mumfie'' library.

Allcroft wrote and directed ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'', a film based on the ''Thomas'' franchise that was released in 2000. She also provided the voice of the character [[Thomas the Tank Engine film characters#Lady|Lady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2667">[[File:Даниил.jpg|thumb|The prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].]]

According to the theory of the art historian [[Marcia B. Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Marcia B.|title=Color and Meaning: Practice and Theory in Renaissance Painting|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-521-45733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has gained considerable acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Canonical Painting Modes by APA|url=http://artpaintingartist.org/the-four-canonical-painting-modes-of-the-renaissance/}}. Retrieved June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; '''''cangiante''''' is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian [[High Renaissance]] painters, along with [[sfumato]], [[chiaroscuro]] and ''[[unione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Marcia B., ''Rome'' (series "Artistic Centers of the Italian Renaissance"), pp.148-150, 2005, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521624452}}, 9780521624459, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gt5gtrqoKOIC&amp;pg=PA148 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;   The word itself derives from the Italian ''cangiare'' ("to change").

''Cangiante'' is characterized by a change in color necessitated by an original color's darkness or lightness limitation. For example,  when painting shadows on a yellow object, the artist may use a red color simply because the yellow paint cannot be made dark enough. There are other methods of rendering shadows or highlights (for example, mixing the original hue with black or brown), but these can render the shadow color dull and impure. During the Renaissance, the variety and availability of paint colors were severely limited.
[[File:Giotto ArenaChapel Lamentation.jpg|thumb|An early example of cangiante by [[Giotto]] from the [[Scrovegni Chapel|Arena Chapel]]. Note the shift in color on the robes.]]
The greatest practitioner of the ''cangiante'' technique was [[Michelangelo]],&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Marcia B., ''Rome'' (series "Artistic Centers of the Italian Renaissance"), pp.148-150, 2005, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521624452}}, 9780521624459, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gt5gtrqoKOIC&amp;pg=PA148 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in many parts of the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. For example, in the image of the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], a transition from green to yellow is evident in the subject's robes. After Michelangelo's time, the technique found widespread acceptance and is now a standard painting technique.

The '''culture of [[Lebanon]]''' and the [[Lebanese people]] emerged from various civilizations over thousands of years. It was home to the [[Phoenicia]]ns and was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], the [[Arabs]], the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], the [[Ottoman Turks]] and the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French]]. This variety is reflected in Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different religious groups, and features in the country's festivals, musical styles, literature, [[cuisine of Lebanon]] and [[architecture of Lebanon]]. [[Tourism in Lebanon]] is popular with periods of interruption during conflict.

Despite the religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they “share an almost common culture”.&lt;ref name="Stokes, Jamie page 406"&gt;Stokes, Jamie.  ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East'', page 406&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on Article 11 of the [[Constitution of Lebanon]] states: "[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the [[French language|French]] language is to be used." The spoken [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]] is the language used in public which is a hybrid of the languages of the above-mentioned cultures, Food, music, and literature are deep-rooted “in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms”.&lt;ref name="Stokes, Jamie page 406"/&gt;

The hilly Mediterranean [[Geography of Lebanon]] has played a role in shaping the [[history of Lebanon]] and its culture. [[Archaeology of Lebanon]] is conducted to explore the area's past.

==Arts==
By the turn of the 20th century, Beirut was vying with Cairo to be the major center for modern Arab thought, with many newspapers, magazines and literary societies.  Additionally, Beirut became a thriving epicenter of Armenian culture with varied productions&lt;ref&gt;Migliorino, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  that was exported to the Armenian diaspora.

===Visual arts===
[[Mustafa Farroukh]] was one of Lebanon's most prominent painters of the 19th century. Formally trained in Rome and Paris, he exhibited in venues from Paris to New York to Beirut over his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaftoun.com/component/content/article/197-moustafa-farroukh/358-moustafa-farroukh |title=Moustafa Farroukh |publisher=Kaftoun.com |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307122305/http://www.kaftoun.com/component/content/article/197-moustafa-farroukh/358-moustafa-farroukh |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary art===
Contemporary art started in Beirut immediately after the end of the civil war (1975-1991).

Many contemporary artists are currently active, such as [[Walid Raad]], a contemporary media artist currently residing in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/raad/biography/ |title=Media Art Net &amp;#124; Ra’ad, Walid: Biography |publisher=Medienkunstnetz.de |accessdate=5 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430025450/http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/raad/biography/ |archivedate=30 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Architecture of Lebanon}}

Architecture in Lebanon includes the legacies of various occupying powers including the Romans, Phoenicians, Ottomans and French, as well as post independence developments.

When the Ottomans exiled [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhreddine]] to [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]] in 1613, he entered an alliance with the [[Medicis]]. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1618, he began modernizing Lebanon. He developed a silk industry, upgraded olive-oil production, and brought with him numerous Italian engineers who began the construction of mansions and civil building throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gh8ZrZRKaRwC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=Italianate+architecture+Fakhreddine |title=Syria &amp; Lebanon&amp;nbsp;— Google Books |publisher= books.google.com |accessdate=2010-01-18|isbn=978-1-86450-333-3|author1=Carter, Terry| author2= Dunston, Lara|author3=Humphreys, Andrew|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Beirut]] and [[Sidon]] were especially built in the Italianate style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AylB2M5DjaoC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Italianate+architecture+Fakhreddine |title=Warlords and merchants: the Lebanese ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-01-18|isbn=978-0-86372-297-4|author1=Dib, Kamal|author2=Dīb, Kamāl|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], specifically, Tuscan, influence on architecture in Lebanon dates back to the [[Renaissance]] when Fakhreddine, the first Lebanese ruler who truly unified [[Mount Lebanon]] with its Mediterranean coast executed an ambitious plan to develop his country.

The influence of these buildings, such as the ones in [[Deir el Qamar]], influenced building in Lebanon for many centuries and continues to the present time. For example, streets like [[Rue Gouraud]] continues to have numerous, historic houses with Italianate influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12079102&amp;CFID=22575473&amp;CFTOKEN=49147749 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308022752/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12079102&amp;CFID=22575473&amp;CFTOKEN=49147749 |archivedate=2009-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings like the [[Sursock Museum|Nicolas Sursock mansion]] on [[Rue Sursock]], which is today a major museum, attest{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} to the continuous influence of Italianate architecture in [[Lebanon]].

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Lebanon}}
Cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Armes|title=Arab filmmakers of the Middle East: a dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHT8LjR_kC4C&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=11 December 2011|date=23 August 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35518-8|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films,&lt;ref&gt;Harabi, Najib (University of Applied Sciences, Northwestern Switzerland)  [http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/251761/day3creative%20Industry%20WB_version%201.pdf Knowledge Intensive Industries: Four Case Studies of Creative Industries in Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000044/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/251761/day3creative%20Industry%20WB_version%201.pdf |date=2013-01-17 }}, World Bank Project (May 2009) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are:

===Theatre===
{{Main|Theatre of Lebanon}}
Lebanese theatre has its origin in [[passion play]]s.  The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of modern Arab theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Reed Stone|title=Popular culture and nationalism in Lebanon: the Fairouz and Rahbani nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EdxrNmDE1UC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77273-0|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars like Abdulatif Shararah divided theatre in Lebanon into three phases: translations of European plays, Arab nationalism, and realism.&lt;ref&gt;Badawī, Muḥammad Muṣṭafá. ''Modern Arabic Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt ===
The cultural relations between Lebanon and [[Egypt]] is considered a unique kind of cultural historical relations, Because there is a considerable overlap between the Lebanese and Egyptian [[culture]]s, especially in the fields of literature, theater, cinema and journalism, all of them played an integral role towards each other especially in theater, cinema and journalism, that's what was confirmed by the Conference Egypt in the eyes of the Lebanese and which is Within the activities of the cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World . Which is held at the headquarters of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, and in the presence of the Lebanese Ambassador in Egypt, [[Madeleine Tabar]] and Ahmed Ghanem founder of cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World  and an elite of Lebanese artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-balad.com/761416|title=سفير لبنان بالقاهرة : حريصون على تدعيم أواصر التعاون مع مصر|author=|date=|website=el-balad.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405104551/http://www.el-balad.com/761416|archivedate=5 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion==
Many Christians and most Muslims who live in the cities wear European style clothes. In the countryside, women sometimes wear traditional colorful skirts and men wear a traditional sherwal (baggy trousers). Dress was historically Ottoman, but remains only as part of the [[folk culture]]. Today, almost all Lebanese wear Western clothing.

Famous names in the Lebanese fashion industry include [[Elie Saab]], [[Zuhair Murad]], Reem Acra, and [[Rabih Kayrouz]].

==Holidays and festivals==
[[File:Beiteddine Palace InnerCourtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Beiteddine Palace]], venue of the [[Beiteddine Festival]]]]
{{Main|Public holidays in Lebanon}}
Lebanon celebrates national holidays and both [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] holidays.

Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian Calendar and Julian Calendar.  Maronites, [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], Catholics, Protestant, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar.

Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura. Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day.

Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture.&lt;ref name = "Festivals"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Sean|author2=Latif  |others=Zawiah|title=Lebanon|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Children's Books|date=30 August 2007|series=Cultures of the World|volume=13|page=123|chapter=Leisure|isbn=978-0-7614-2081-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cA-RDzlwVVAC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most famous are [[Baalbeck International Festival]], [[Byblos International Festival]], [[Beiteddine Festival|Beiteddine International Festival]], Broumana Festival, Batroun Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival.&lt;ref name="Festivals" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Terry|author2=Dunston Lara|others= Humphreys Andrew|title=Syria &amp; Lebanon|publisher=Lonely Planet|date=1 August 2004|edition=2|series=Guidebook Series|page=11|chapter=Getting Started|isbn=978-1-86450-333-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EskzgI-229IC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's [[Ministry of Tourism (Lebanon)|Ministry of Tourism]], Lebanon Hosts about 15 Concerts from International Performers Each Year Ranking Number one for Nightlife in the Middle east and 6th Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/news/Details.aspx?NewsId=10|title=Lebanon Summer &amp; Winter Festivals|work=Lebanese Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=19 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722145040/http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/news/Details.aspx?NewsId=10|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Lebanese cuisine}}
[[File:Yoghurt and Hummus at Moroccan Soup Bar.jpg|thumb|right|230px|An array of Lebanese cuisine.]]

Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and [[Cyprus]].

The Lebanese national dishes are the [[kibbe]], a meat pie made from finely minced [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[burghul]] (cracked [[wheat]]), and the [[tabbouleh]], a salad made from [[parsley]], [[tomato]]es, and burghul. The national beverage is [[Arak (drink)|arak]], a strong [[anise]]-flavored liquor made from fermented [[grape juice]]. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki.

Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of [[mezze]] - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled [[meat]] or [[fish]]. In general, meals are finished with [[Arabic coffee]] and fresh [[fruit]], though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.

[[M'Juhdara]], a thick stew of [[onions]], [[rice]], and [[lentils]], is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around [[Lent]] by people in the Lebanese diaspora.

Beirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, [[wine]] is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards currently exist in the [[Bekaa valley]] and elsewhere. [[Beer]] is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which [[almaza]] is perhaps the most popular.

===Food in daily life===
Lebanese cuisine is influenced by other Mediterranean cuisines. [[Pita bread]] is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy [[hummus]] (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean dip), and other bean dishes. [[Rice]] is nearly a staple, and [[pasta]] is very popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. [[Red meat]] and chicken are common but are usually eaten as part of a dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost never eat alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Saint Barbara, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. [[Wine]] is produced in the Bekaa and exported to France{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

==Society==
{{main|Lebanese society}}

Lebanese society is similar to certain cultures of [[Southern Europe|Mediterranean Europe]] as the country is "linked ideologically and culturally to Europe through France, and its uniquely diverse religious composition [create] a rare environment that [is] at once Arab and European.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Craig S. ''The Middle East For Dummies''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often considered as Europe's gateway to Western Asia as well as Asia's gateway to the Western World.&lt;ref&gt;Lebanon Culture. [http://hangoverguide.com/lebanon/ hangoverguide.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402060253/http://www.hangoverguide.com/lebanon/ |date=2012-04-02 }}, 18 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-sex groups of youth are very common especially in Verdun, [[Hamra Street]], [[Ashrafieh]], and [[Beirut Central District|downtown Beirut]] as well as other places. Premarital physical sexual relations are very common, although intercourse is frowned upon and avoided by both Muslim and Christian girls.

The contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated at 58%, of which 34% modern contraceptives, primarily IUDs, pills and condoms.&lt;ref name="unfpa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA-LEBANON/Country-Profile.aspx|title=UNFPA Lebanon - Country Profile|author=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org.lb|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919052311/http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA-LEBANON/Country-Profile.aspx|archivedate=19 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution in Lebanon]] is nominally legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Prostitution – The business of sex|publisher= Executive Magazine|date= |url= http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/prostitution-the-business-of-sex|accessdate= 2014-10-22|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141106130624/http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/prostitution-the-business-of-sex|archivedate= 2014-11-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison to most other Arab capitals, Beirut is more [[westernized]] and more [[culturally liberal]]. Compared to [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]], and [[Baghdad]], and especially in contrast to such cities as [[Riyadh]], Beirut is more tolerant with regard to relations between men and women, and also with regard to [[homosexuality]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Notwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, [[Lebanese women]] enjoy equal [[civil rights]] and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties.

While gay sex does not enjoy wide acceptance, Beirut has a number of gay bars and nightclubs, in addition to five LGBT rights organizations, namely Helem, Arab Foundation for Equality (AFE), Nasawiya-Feminist Collecrive, Proud Lebanon, and Mosaïque.  {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''''Fanny''''' is a 1961 American [[Technicolor]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Joshua Logan]]. The screenplay by [[Julius J. Epstein]] is based on the [[libretto|book]] for the 1954 [[Fanny (musical)|stage musical of the same title]] by Logan and [[S.N. Behrman]], which in turn had been adapted from [[Marcel Pagnol]]'s trilogy: ''[[Marius (film)|Marius]]'' (1929) and ''[[Fanny (1932 film)|Fanny]]'' (1932), plays which he adapted to film a year or two later; and ''[[César (film)|César]],'' the film he wrote and directed for the screen in 1936 (and later adapted for the stage).

The film deleted all the songs from the 1954 stage musical, but the music by [[Harold Rome]] served as the [[underscore]] for the [[soundtrack]], and the title tune is used as the Main Title theme. Although it had been composed for another medium, it was nominated for both the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].

==Plot==
César ([[Charles Boyer]]) is a barkeeper in [[Marseille]] in the early 1920s. His 19-year-old son Marius ([[Horst Buchholz]]) works for him at his bar, but wants nothing more than to go to sea and leave his boring existence behind. The only thing holding him back is Fanny ([[Leslie Caron]]), an 18-year-old girl with whom he grew up. Fanny works selling fish with her mother down at the waterfront. Fanny has been in love with Marius her whole life, and flirts with him, but Marius always rejects her.

Fanny invites Marius to a Sunday night dance, but he rejects her once more. Unbeknownst to Fanny, Marius is planning to leave the next day, having secretly signed on as a sailor on a lengthy scientific expedition traveling around the world after being encouraged to do so by his friend known as the Admiral ([[Raymond Bussieres]]). Fanny is offended and leaves.

Meanwhile, elderly but wealthy merchant Panisse ([[Maurice Chevalier]]) asks to meet with Fanny's mother Honorine (Georgette Anys), who believes he wants to propose to her. To her surprise, he wants to marry Fanny, even though he knows she loves someone else. Although disappointed, Honorine does not object, seeing as Panisse is worth 600,000 francs.

Fanny tells Marius she has rejected Panisse's proposal because she loves him and is willing to wait until he returns. Marius tells her he will be away for five years and to forget about him. They declare their love for each other and go to Fanny's house, which is empty while her mother is away.

The following morning, Honorine discovers Fanny and Marius in bed together. She and César begin to plan their children's wedding, but Fanny urges Marius to leave, even lying to him, telling him that she would rather marry a rich man like Panisse than she would him. But, in truth, she is fearful he eventually will grow to hate her for depriving him of this great opportunity.

Around two months after Marius goes off to sea, Fanny discovers she is pregnant with Marius's child and tells Panisse the news. He is happy to marry her anyway, overjoyed with the possibility of a male heir to carry on his name. They marry and Fanny gives birth to a boy to whom César is godfather. César, knowing the baby's true father, collaborates with Panisse to give the baby the name Césario Marius Panisse.

On Césario's first birthday, Panisse leaves on the train to Paris on business, and while he is gone, Marius returns on a short leave. He visits Fanny, and upon learning her child is his, apologizes to Fanny, as he knows now she said those things only to make him go. Marius tells her that he wants her back, but then César comes in before anything can happen. Panisse then arrives home early and says that he will not try to stop Fanny from leaving with Marius but he will not part with the child, knowing that Fanny won't leave without the boy. Fanny tells Marius she loves him but will not take Césario from Panisse, as it was Panisse who had been there for Fanny and Césario all along. César advises his son the father is "the one who loves," and Panisse loves this child and has been a wonderful father to him. Marius then departs with neither Fanny nor his child.

Ten years later, Césario (Joel Flateau) is looking forward to his birthday party. After being taken to the waterfront with Fanny's mother, Césario wanders off and meets the Admiral. The Admiral takes the boy sailing without telling anyone and reunites him with Marius, though Césario has no idea who Marius is. Marius, who is now working in a garage, is overjoyed to see his son, but when Panisse is told the boy is missing, he is stricken and taken to his room. Fanny finds Césario with his father and is shocked. She announces that Panisse is dying and Marius drives them home to the dying Panisse.

When they arrive at the house, Panisse calls for Césario to sit with him, and Cesario asks to invite Marius to the birthday party. Fanny goes outside to the property entrance and joins Cesar and Marius in discussion. Marius has an opportunity to express his bitterness and plans to leave for the United States the next day. Fanny explains to Marius she never told him about the baby because on the day he left she had hoped he would turn around and not get on the boat, and when he didn't she felt betrayed and was angry. Fanny then goes to Panisse and as he lies dying, Panisse dictates a letter asking Marius to marry his wife once he is dead, and be a father to Césario; his only request being that the boy keep his last name.

The original film trilogy in French was directed by [[Alexander Korda]] (''[[Marius (film)|Marius]]'', 1931), [[Marc Allégret]] (''[[Fanny (1932 film)|Fanny]]'', 1932) and Pagnol himself (''[[César (film)|César]]'', 1936). There was a 1933 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] named ''[[Fanny (1933 film)|Fanny]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0024002|Fanny (1933)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1934 [[Cinema of Germany|German film]] ''[[Der Schwarze Walfisch]]'' ("The Black Whale"),&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0025753|Der Schwarze Walfisch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Port of Seven Seas]]'', a 1938 American film directed by [[James Whale]], also based on the trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan and Vincendeau, Ginette, ''French Film, Texts and Contexts''. London: Routledge 1990. {{ISBN|0-415-00131-5}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack L. Warner]] purchased the screen rights to the stage musical but eventually decided he wanted the film to exclude the songs because the popularity of movie musicals was on the wane. Released the same year as ''Fanny'', ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' proved to be a box office hit.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=74539&amp;category=Articles ''Fanny'' at Turner Classic Movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter Julius J. Epstein had collaborated with Joshua Logan on ''[[Tall Story]]'' the previous year, but he initially declined the director's offer to adapt ''Fanny'' for the screen because he found Marius' motivation for leaving Marseille difficult to believe. Only after Logan assured him he could take liberties with the original script did he accept the assignment. He relied on Pagnol's plays for inspiration, but retained the ending of the musical,&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt; which was quite different from the plot of Pagnol's original film ''César''.

Prior to Warner's decision to film the property as a straight drama, Logan had offered [[Charles Boyer]] the role of César but the actor declined because he felt he could not sing and was unwilling to [[lip sync]] to someone else's voice. When the songs were dropped, he accepted the offer. He and [[Maurice Chevalier]], cast as Panisse, were old friends but never had performed together, and both welcomed the opportunity to do so.&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

[[Audrey Hepburn]] agreed to portray Fanny but eventually had to decline the role due to prior commitments. Assuming the French would dislike an [[English language]] interpretation of the Pagnol plays, [[Leslie Caron]] was hesitant to replace her, but she liked the script and accepted three weeks before principal photography began.&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

Among the [[Marseille]] locations used for filming were [[Notre-Dame de la Garde]] and [[Old Port of Marseille|Vieux Port]].

==Critical reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed, "Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether partial to music or no, you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart. For Mr. Logan, with the aid of expert craftsmen and a cast of principals that we do not believe an act of divine cooperation could have greatly improved upon, has given the charming Marseilles folk play a stunning pictorial sweep, a deliciously atmospheric flavor and a flesh-touching intimacy. And, embraced by these graphic, sensuous virtues are the rich human, comic elements that flowed out of Pagnol's little pictures and glimmered upon the Broadway stage . . . To be sure, there are flaws in the compound. The cutting is often too abrupt, some scenes are confused by intercutting, and the tempo in the early phases is much too fast. Also, occasionally the actors are costumed too prettily, and the domestic magnificence of the Panisses in the last part is tasteless and absurd . . . [But] on the whole, the appropriate atmosphere of Marseilles is literally and colorfully conveyed — in excellent color, by the way. Perhaps there will be some prim objection to the lush emotionalism of it all and to the frankness of the musical nudging, but we loved it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E5D7113FE13ABC4F53DFB166838A679EDE ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene,''' commonly known as NYTF, is a professional theater company in New York City which produces both [[Yiddish theater|Yiddish plays]] and plays translated into [[Yiddish]], in a theater equipped with simultaneous superscript translation into English. The company's leadership consists of Broadway Producer CEO [[Christopher Massimine]] and artistic director [[Zalmen Mlotek]]. The board is chaired by Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld, principal at Bernstein Global Wealth Management.

Folksbiene (Yiddish for the ''People's Stage'') was founded in 1915, under the auspices of the [[Fraternity|fraternal]] and Yiddish cultural organization [[Workmen's Circle]],&lt;ref name="History"&gt;"[http://nytf.org/history History]".

''Live &amp; Be Well: A Celebration of Yiddish Culture in America''. Rutgers University Press. p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; The era when it was founded is considered to be the height of [[Yiddish theater]]; at the time there were 15 Yiddish theatre companies in the [[Yiddish Theater District]] in New York and many more worldwide. Due to the destruction of [[European Jew]]ry by the [[Nazi Germany|German Nazis]], the Folksbiene is one of only five professional Yiddish theatre companies still in operation; also in New York City is the New Yiddish Rep, and the others are in [[Bucharest]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The company's 2006 production of ''Di Yam Gazlonim'', a Yiddish adaptation of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', by Al Grand, was nominated for the 2007 [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Musical Revival, and their 2012/13 Off Broadway production of ''The Golden Land'' was nominated for the 2013 [[Drama Desk Award]] for outstanding Musical Revival. In the summer of 2012, Folksbiene announced their plans to create an international Festival of new works in celebration of  their Centennial in 2015. A play contest accompanying the festival was juried by producer Emanuel Azenberg; the Tony Award-winning composer and songwriter Jason Robert Brown ("Parade"), and the playwrights Joe DiPietro (Tony Award for "Memphis"); Obie Award-winning Israel Horovitz, and Pulitzer Prize finalist Jon Marans ("Old Wicked Songs").

A revival of the 1923 operetta [[The Golden Bride]] in 2015/16 drew press attention as a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] Theatre Critics Pick and garnered Drama Desk awards as well.&lt;ref name="SchleierRevived"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schleier|first1=Carl|title=A classic Yiddish operetta, revived for a new generation|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/12/08/arts-entertainment/a-classic-yiddish-operetta-revived-for-a-new-generation|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=JTA|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaroneLostOperetta"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barone|first1=Joshua|title=A Yiddish Operetta, Once Lost, Will Receive Its Full First Staging in 70 Years|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/a-yiddish-operetta-once-lost-will-receive-its-full-first-staging-in-70-years/?_r=0|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=''New York Times''. nytimes.com|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folksbiene was a producer on the 2015/16 Broadway play "[[Indecent (play)|Indecent]]."

In the Fall of 2017, the company staged a revival of Abraham Goldfadn's ''[[The Witch of Botoșani|The Sorceress]]'' as part of their restoration project – an endeavor that will restore lost or nearly lost Yiddish works to the canon of Yiddish culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/national-yiddish-theatre-to-revive-the-sorceress_83062.html|title=National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene to Revive Lost Yiddish Operetta The Sorceress|work=TheaterMania.com|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene announced that it would stage the American premiere of [[Fiddler on the Roof]] in Yiddish, which has not been staged since its world premiere production in Israel more than 50 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/n-y-theater-company-will-present-an-all-yiddish-fiddler-1513888504|title=N.Y.

The container consists of a vessel, usually in terracotta, perforated to allow the passage of air, polished on the inside to prevent escape and with a lid to seal the top.

'''Gregg Bordowitz''' (born August 14, 1964) is a writer, artist and activist currently working as a professor in the Video, New Media, and Animation department at [[The School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].

==Biography==
Gregg Bordowitz was born August 14, 1964 in [[Brooklyn]], NY. In 1982, Bordowitz began his academic career at the [[School of Visual Arts]], then studied at the [[Whitney Museum]] Independent Study Program from 1985 to 1986, and at [[New York University]] from 1986 to 1987. In 1987, Bordowitz dropped out of school to become a full-time video artist, guerilla TV director and activist with the direct action advocacy group [[ACT UP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greggbordowitz.com/docs/Bordowitz_CV_2012.pdf|title=Gregg Bordowitz's online ''Curriculum vitae''|publisher=Greggbordowitz.com|accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Bordowitz was central to the formation of the notable video activist collective, Testing the Limits, who produced work documenting AIDS activism that were distributed through television, museums, schools and community centers. He also wrote prolifically on the topic of AIDS activism, contributing heavily to the 1987 "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism" of the well-respected academic journal [[October (journal)|October]]. In 1988, Gregg Bordowitz tested positive for [[HIV]] and, as a result, came out as a [[homosexual]] man  to his mother and stepfather. He left Testing the Limits (now a self-sufficient non-profit entity) to focus on a more 'guerilla' approach to documenting AIDS activism. In 1988, he met video artist [[Jean Carlomusto]] at a demonstration partnered with her to produce the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC) cable TV show ''Living With AIDS'', which ran regularly until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/diva/Archive.html |title=A Report on the Archiving of Film and Video Work by Makers with AIDS |publisher=Actupny.org |date=1986-06-30 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he, along with numerous other video activists, formed [[Like a Prayer (documentary)|DIVA]] (Damned Interfering Video Activists), a partner organization to ACT UP, dedicated to accurately documenting the protests organized by ACT UP and providing an alternative representation of the AIDS activist movement than the one presented by the [[Media portrayal of HIV/AIDS#United States|mainstream media]].

In 1993, filled with despair at the decline of AIDS activism as well as his own diminishing chances of survival, Bordowitz produces one of his most famous pieces, the documentary/montage ''Fast Trip, Long Drop''. In this video, Bordowitz addresses the public's reaction to and representation of the [[AIDS epidemic]] as well as his own fears, insecurities and struggles related to the disease. ''Fast Trip, Long Drop'' provides a pessimistic counterpoint to the flood of representations of people "Surviving and Thriving" with AIDS through a collage of documentary footage, staged parody and vintage film clips. For the first time in an AIDS related documentary, people with AIDS were shown addressing and coming to terms with the ever-present fact of their own mortality. As Bordowitz explains in his 1999 interview with the AIDS art forum Artery, "When I made "Fast Trip, Long Drop" I was tired of pretending for the sake of others that I would survive. I became preoccupied with the burdens that sick people bear on behalf of those around them who are well. I wanted to get a handle on despair and put it out there as a political problem. To be recognized and discussed. If we couldn't do this, then it all seemed like bullshit. I wanted an honest media produced in the interests of people living with AIDS." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertatkins.net/beta/witness/artists/moves/bordowitz.html |title=Robert Atkins.Net |publisher=Robert Atkins.Net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, along with many of his other works, has been shown in film festivals, museums and on television ever since with extremely positive response.

From there, Bordowitz continued to address AIDS in his artwork, video work and writing. He taught video art at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], [[Brown University]], and [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] from 1995 to 2010, before being hired as a permanent professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His works have been shown at [[the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[the Whitney Museum of American Art]], and [[the Museum of Modern Art]], as well as numerous film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter |first=Rebecca A. |url=http://www.fnewsmagazine.com/2002-april/aprilregulars5.html |title=Faculty Profile: Gregg Bordowitz |publisher=Fnewsmagazine.com |date=2002-07-07 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A History of Sexuality Volume One by Michel Foucault: An Opera==
In 2009, Gregg Bordowitz began collaboration with artist Paul Chan an opera adaptation of [[Michel Foucault]]’s [[History of Sexuality]]. Though they envisioned the project as an impossible to complete, they were approached by Viennese museum curator Achim Hochdörfer, and asked to stage a performance at the [[MUMOK]]. In 2010, they staged a 6-man performance written and directed by Bordowitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/words/id=26517 |title=Gregg Bordowitz |publisher=Artforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greggbordowitz.com/projects.html |title=Projects |publisher=Greggbordowitz.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through hosting dialogues and exhibition series, InLiquid was an early contributor to the rejuvenation of the city’s arts scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rozsko|first1=Nikki|title=Breaking the Mold|url=http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/2002-05-09/artpicks2.shtml|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=Philadelphia City Paper|date=9 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the website hosts hundreds of artist portfolios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tiger|first1=Caroline|title=Artist Friendly|url=http://inliquid.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/usair_2008.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=US Airways|date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including recognizable names like photographer [[Zoe Strauss]], founder of the Philadelphia Public Art Project, and the artwork of internationally known jewelry designer John Wind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Directory|url=http://inliquid.org/complete-artist-list/|website=inliquid.org|publisher=InLiquid|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose collections have been featured in [[O, The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]] and [[Elle (magazine)|Elle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the News|url=http://www.maximalart.com/pages/in-the-news|website=maximalart.com|publisher=John Wind Maximal Art|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location ===
The organization has offices in the Crane Arts building, a warehouse-turned-art space originally built in 1906, and located at 1400 N. American Street in the [[Kensington, Philadelphia|Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stigale|first1=Theresa|title=Manufacturing a Good Time|url=http://hiddencityphila.org/2013/03/manufacturing-a-good-time/|website=hiddencityphila.org|publisher=Hidden City Philadelphia|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Year-round member exhibitions are held in neighborhoods throughout the city and the surrounding region. Regular InLiquid exhibition spaces include the [[Painted Bride Art Center]] in Old City, International House Philadelphia in University City, and the [[SundanceTV|Sundance TV]] offices in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InLiquid Projects|url=http://inliquid.org/happenings/|website=inliquid.org|publisher=InLiquid|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past partnerships have included Gallery 543 at [[Urban Outfitters|URBN]] Headquarters, the Leonard Pearlstein Gallery at [[Drexel University]], project space de, Feast Your Eye’s Salon at Front+Palmer, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] Courtyard at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], Carpenter Square, minima, [[Bryn Mawr Film Institute]], [[West Elm|west elm]], the digital cube at the [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts]], the media wall at [[Commerce Square]], Spruce Street Harbor Park, James Oliver Gallery, Select Fair Miami, Select Fair New York, River's Edge Gallery at [[Bridgeton House]], Engagement Studios, bahdeebahdu, and Old City Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership Guidebook|url=http://inliquid.org/become-a-member/membership-guidebook/|website=inliquid.org|publisher=InLiquid|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==

Other programming for the organization centers around two yearly events: the Benefit and Art for the Cash Poor. The Benefit and Silent Auction, held every February in the Crane Arts space, serves as a showcase for emerging and established visual artists as well as a fundraiser for InLiquid, with part of the proceeds going back to the artists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dillon|first1=HughE|title=InLiquid Benefit Party at Crane Arts|url=http://www.phillymag.com/the-scene/2013/02/19/photos-inliquid-benefit-party-crane-arts/|website=phillymag.com|publisher=Philadelphia Magazine|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art for the Cash Poor, a block-party style art sale, acts as its more affordable summer counterpart every June, with all artwork priced under $200 and a goal of fostering a new audience of art collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adkins|first1=Lynne|title=Fine Art For Budget-Friendly Prices At 'Art For The Cash Poor' This Weekend|url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/06/07/fine-art-for-budget-friendly-prices-at-art-for-the-cash-poor-this-weekend/|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=CBS Philly|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karin Albou''' is a French director, screenwriter and actress.

==Early life==
Karin Albou was born on in March 12, 1968 &lt;ref&gt;http://inter.pyramidefilms.com/pyramidefilms-international-catalogue/karin-albou.html in &lt;/ref&gt;[[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] to [[Algeria]]n immigrant parents. Her mother was only 16 when she was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karin Albou|url=http://www.mymoviepicker.com/personne/karin-albou-138361.htm|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albou was raised in the [[Jewish]] faith. In 1999 she moved to Tunisia to settle down for one year. She went back to Paris and started her career as a filmmaker.
She also started a career as a writer and published her first novel in 2010. ("La Grande Fête", édition Jacqueline Chambon. Translated in Italian : "La grande festa" Oedipus edizioni, traduzione di Maria Teresa Fiore

As a child, Karin Albou was always finding ways to be an artist; involved with dance and singing. After high school, Karin continued to study dance, but also studied Hebrew French and Arabic literature, English, drama and eventually enrolled in film school in Paris. She studied screening writing in Paris but discovered while taking classes at École Supérieure de Réalisation Audiovisuelle&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_Supérieure_de_Réalisation_Audiovisuelle&lt;/ref&gt; she wanted to be a director. After she graduated, she started her journey as a director with her first short film “Hush!” establishing the beginning of her remarkable career path. 

==Career==
Albou made her feature film debut in 2005 with ''[[Little Jerusalem (film)|Little Jerusalem]]'' which debuted at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[International Critics' Week]]. Despite being Albou's first feature film Albou was disqualified from competing for the Camera d'Or, awarded to the best first film playing at the festival, because she had previously directed a made-for-TV movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camera d'Or disqualifies 3 directors|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0206842/|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Albou released her second feature film ''[[Le Chant des mariées|The Wedding Song]]'', a [[Holocaust]] drama set in [[Tunisia]] in 1942 that was loosely inspired by letters Albou's paternal grandmother had sent to her husband during the war when he was sent to a labour camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esther|first1=John|date=6 November 2009|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: KARIN ALBOU|url=http://jestherent.blogspot.ca/2009/11/exclusive-interview-karin-albou.html|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film played multiple Jewish festivals but failed to garner mainstream attention something Albou attributed to the many scenes of graphic nudity in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Jonathan|date=19 July 2009|title='Wedding Song' offers fresh take on feminity &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Wedding-Song-offers-fresh-take-on-feminity-3292152.php|website=SFGate.com|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Albou's third feature film ''My Shortest Love Affair'' was released in 2015. Albou also co-starred in the film as a woman in her 40s who becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with a former fling and who decides to try to make a go of it with the father of her future child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Shortest Love Affair|url=http://sfjff.org/2015/films/my-shortest-love-affair/|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karin wrote and directed Aïd El Kebir, La petite Jérusalem (Little Jerusalem), Yasmine et la Révolution (Yasmine and the Revolution), Ma plus courte histoire d’amour (My Shortest Love Affair) – which she also produced, Le chant des mariées (The Wedding Song) and Corps de dame (Lady’s Body)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0016900/&lt;/ref&gt;. 

She is also an established actress, starring in her films&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0016900/&lt;/ref&gt; including Ma plus courte histoire d’amour (My Shortest Love Affair) as Louisa Witz, Le chant des mariées (The Wedding Song) as Tita and Corps de dame (Lady’s Body) as a doctor. 

Karin Albou was the second assistant editor for director David Rozenberg’s 1994 for feature, Shortcomings (Carences).

==Styles and Themes==
Karin Albou is a very distinct director, one of the ways to distinguish her is the themes in her films. Knowing Karin’s heritage explains some of the themes she chooses to cover. Raised in the Jewish faith, Karin's films explore the lasting trauma of the Holocaust&lt;ref&gt;Lechintan, Adela A. "Cinematic Reverberations of Historical Trauma: Women's Memories of the Holocaust and Colonialism in Contemporary French-Language Cinema." Order No. 3493307, (The Ohio State University, 2011), 91. https://search.proquest.com/docview/919704252?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt; – French colonialism&lt;ref&gt;Schoonover, Karl and Rosalind Galt, Queer Cinema in the World. Durham: Duke University Press, 2017. 231-36. 
&lt;/ref&gt;, secret identity&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, John. "Secret Identity, Sumptuous Film:" The Gazette, Oct 29, 2005. https://search.proquest.com/docview/434250723?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt;, exile, assimilation&lt;ref&gt;"Writer, Director, Actress Karin Albou in Interview." Interview by Sharon Adler. Aviva-Berlin. May 15, 2009. https://www.aviva-berlin.de/aviva/content_Interviews.php?id=1425092.&lt;/ref&gt;, and double diaspora&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stephanie. "Double-Diaspora in the Literature and Film of Arab Jews." Order No. NR98058, University of Ottawa (Canada), 2012. https://search.proquest.com/docview/1355763142?accountid=14523.

&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Karin explores and challenges the rules of religion and marriages. Karin directs My Shortest Love Affair with themes of love, sex and family values&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Josh. "Love, Sex and Family Values all a Tangle in 'My Shortest Love Affair'." The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California : J, Jul 17, 2015. https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779870367?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt;. Her themes involve bringing intimate scenes of female spaces, tackling sexual dysfunction in marriage and uncovering how culture impacts the idea of romance&lt;ref&gt;Wilmington Michael, Tribune, movie critic. "'Jerusalem' Puts Cultures in Opposition to Romance ; 'La Petite Jerusalem' ***." Chicago Tribune, May 05, 2006. https://search.proquest.com/docview/420477406?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt;. Karin keeps these themes consistent in her films and portrays them with her unique film style. Her style focuses on the representation of women&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hossain, Haya. "Feminist Representations in North African Cinema." Order No. 3449116, The George Washington University, 2011, 168 - 169. https://search.proquest.com/docview/861742163?accountid=14523.&lt;/ref&gt;. In The Wedding Song, the film style displays a lesbian, female, and  Orientalist gaze.

*My country left me (1994)&lt;ref&gt;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karin_Albou&lt;/ref&gt;
Plot: The documentary explores the repercussions of the Israeli-Arab conflict. Many Jews from Tunisia, a former French colony, were forced to resettle in France, leading to the transformation of Judeo-Arabic culture from Tunisia to Paris. Karin explores the group's culture shock, recalling fondly of Tunisia, but also speaking of the pain of becoming outcasts in their own land. She interviewed young Jews who are as French as they are Tunisian, where they speak about the emergence of their identity in the mosaic of contemporary France. Through these intimate relationship Karin reveals a complex experience of exile and assimilation. A pilgrimage back to Tunisia uncovers the identification of three generations of Jews who continue to feel for the country left behind.&lt;ref&gt;https://sfjff.org/watch-online/jfi-on-demand/my-country-left-me&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Albou made her feature film debut in 2005 with ''[[Little Jerusalem (film)|Little Jerusalem]]'' which debuted at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[International Critics' Week]]. Despite being Albou's first feature film Albou was disqualified from competing for the Camera d'Or, awarded to the best first film playing at the festival, because she had previously directed a made-for-TV movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camera d'Or disqualifies 3 directors|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0206842/|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Albou released her second feature film ''[[Le Chant des mariées|The Wedding Song]]'', a [[Holocaust]] drama set in [[Tunisia]] in 1942 that was loosely inspired by letters Albou's paternal grandmother had sent to her husband during the war when he was sent to a labour camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esther|first1=John|date=6 November 2009|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: KARIN ALBOU|url=http://jestherent.blogspot.ca/2009/11/exclusive-interview-karin-albou.html|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film played multiple Jewish festivals but failed to garner mainstream attention something Albou attributed to the many scenes of graphic nudity in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Jonathan|date=19 July 2009|title='Wedding Song' offers fresh take on feminity &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Wedding-Song-offers-fresh-take-on-feminity-3292152.php|website=SFGate.com|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Albou's third feature film ''My Shortest Love Affair'' was released in 2015. Albou also co-starred in the film as a woman in her 40s who becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with a former fling and who decides to try to make a go of it with the father of her future child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Shortest Love Affair|url=http://sfjff.org/2015/films/my-shortest-love-affair/|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuchi-e''' are [[Book frontispiece|frontispieces]] of books, especially woodblock printed fronticpieces for Japanese romance novels and literary magazines published from the 1890s to the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005). ''Hotei Encyclopedia of Japanese Woodblock Prints.''  Amsterdam: Hotei, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

They usually portrayed women and were bounded into the book's spine or inserted into literary magazines to give readers a sense of what type of stories were to unfold.  Most '''Kuchi-e''' were [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]] in romance novels intended for a female audience.  However, some were [[Lithography|lithographs]], and some were inserted into other types of literature.  Most measured either 22 x 30&amp;nbsp;cm or 14 x 20&amp;nbsp;cm, the former being folded in thirds, and the latter being folded in half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/kuchi-e.asp  Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the '''kuchi-e''' by [[Mizuno Toshikata]], note the two horizontal fold lines and the margin on top for binding.  Artists who designed '''kuchi-e''' include [[Hirezaki Eiho]], [[Ikeda Shoen]], [[Kaburagi Kiyokata]], [[Kajita Hanko]], [[Mishima Shoso]], [[Mizuno Toshikata]], [[Odake Kokkan]], [[Ogata Gekko]], [[Suzuki Kason]], [[Takeuchi Keishu]], [[Terasaki Kogyo]], [[Tomioka Eisen]], [[Tsutsui Toshimine]], [[Utagawa Kunimatsu]], [[Watanabe Seitei]], and [[Yamada Keichu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oberlin.edu/staff/fzwegat/ Oberlin College website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/kuchi-e.asp  Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
The word "kuchi-e" (口絵) is usually translated into English as mouth (kuchi) picture (e).&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005). ''Hotei Encyclopedia of Japanese Woodblock Prints.''  Amsterdam: Hotei, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "kuchi" (口) may also mean opening, as it does in the compound words iri-guchi 入口 (entrance) and de-guchi 出口 (exit).  In this way, the translation "entrance picture" more clearly communicates the intended function of a kuchi-e as a frontispiece in a literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication with Stephen Salel, Robert F. Lange Foundation Assistant Curator of Japanese Art, Honolulu Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuhn &amp; Komor''' ({{lang-ja|康茂洋行}}), also known colloquially as ''K&amp;K'', was a Hungarian multinational luxury jewelry and specialty retailer, having headquarters in Shanghai, China. K&amp;K produced jewelry, sterling silver, china, crystal, stationery, and personal accessories. K&amp;K was renowned in East Asia for its luxury goods, also being called the "[[Asprey]] of Asia."&lt;ref&gt;http://naturalisticspoon.com/Kuhn_And_Komor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Komor family was Jewish and originally came from Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalassets.ushmm.org/photoarchives/detail.aspx?id=1131191&lt;/ref&gt;

Moritz Montague Kuhn founded Kuhn &amp; Co in Yokohama in 1869, a shop filled with ''Curios'', curiosities from the Far East (or souvernirs shop). Siegfried Komo, the nephew of Kuhn, came to Japan in 1887 to work for his uncle, followed by the son ok Kuhn, Arthur, who arrived in Japan in 1890. In 1894, Siegfried Komo and Arthur Kuhn founded Kuhn &amp; Komor in Yokohama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokingsamurai.com/KUHN_KOMOR.html|title=KUHN &amp; KOMOR 康茂洋行 (1869-1930)|website=Smokingsamurai.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company opened a shop in the [[Shanghai Palace Hotel]] in Shanghai. They later opened a shop on No. 37 Water Street (水町通り) in [[Yokohama]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inherited-values.com/2011/10/antique-japan-travel-guide-for-westerners/&lt;/ref&gt; The company existed roughly until the 1930s, when the outbreak of World War II brought it to an end.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjgk.com/1/gazdasagikapcsolat/148-kuhnandkomor&lt;/ref&gt; 

Items by Kuhn &amp; Komor receive high prices on auctions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/21861/lot/383/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="127885">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of general music articles in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia''}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}
The music articles in the [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey Sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey Jr]] (1791–1851).The ''Cyclopædia'' was illustrated using 53 plates as well as a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

The general musical articles list all those that are not biographical, which form a separate list. They were written mostly by Charles Burney. Others on the scientific basis of music were by John Farey Sr, and technical descriptions of some musical instruments were given by his son.

It had been Burney's intention to write a ''Dictionary of Music'', but for various reasons he never did so.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger, "Dr Burney's 'Dictionary of Music" ',''Musicology Australia'', vol. 5, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–171, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 when he was aged 75 he was offered the chance of writing music articles in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', and this occupied him to around 1805 or '06. His fee was £1000. Burney's brief was to 'include definitions in all the languages of Europe where Music has been much cultivated, with its history, biography, Criticism and discussions'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Lonsdale, Roger, ''Dr Charles Burney: a Literary Biography'', OUP 1965, pp 412&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles contain an enormous amount of musical information, much of which being augmented versions of what he had already published in his earlier writings &lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer, Frank]], ed. Charles Burney, ''A General History of Music'', 2 vol. 1935, rep 1957 [Originally published in 4 volumes, 1776–1789]; and Scholes, P. A., ''Dr Burney's Musical Tours in Europe'', 2 vol, OUP 1959, [France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773]; as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he took the opportunity to add new topics covering the years of the last quarter of the eighteenth century and much of the first decade of the nineteenth, in particular the London musical scene. In all he wrote 996 general articles. While the majority of the articles have some length, a good proportion are brief (3 or 4 lines or fewer), dictionary definitions, or cross references. Many of the former are terms derived from French and Italian. The encyclopaedic-length articles (as distinct from the dictionary-length articles) are usually longer than Burney's earlier published writings on the same topic.

Dr [[Percy Scholes]] cites a statement by Dr Rees from Preface to the ''Cyclopaedia'' that he had 'constantly interpolated his own additions to the articles of his specialists'. and quotes a passage from the article about Dance (Vol 11) describing 'in our own memory', Welsh church-goers being played out of church by a fiddle.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, P. A.,''The Puritans and Early Music in England and New England'', OUP, 1934, p77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, sr]] was by profession a geologist, but was greatly interested music.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Croy Kassler, ''The Science of Music in Britain, 1714–1830'', Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London, 1979, vol 1, pp 329–343&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved with the Choral Fund,&lt;ref&gt;Established in 1791 by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] to assist poor musicians. Farey was the first Secretary and Librarian.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cecilian Society&lt;ref&gt;A group founded in 1785 which sang mainly oratorios. The newspapers of the period carried frequent advertisements of their performances.&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[Surrey Chapel|Surrey Chapel Society]], and also sang in oratorios in Drury Lane Theatre. He was particularly interested in the [[mathematics of music]] and [[musical temperament|temperament]], and wrote all the 215 scientific articles on these topics for Rees. Farey's investigations of [[musical temperament|temperament]] involved discussing (and criticising) the various schemes in use then. He described them in a series of letters to the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', and the ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'' as well as the ''[[American Journal of Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Kassler, above for details of these.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed 25 articles to the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'' on this topic .&lt;ref&gt;For a list of the latter see the bibliography appended to Trever D. Ford and [[Hugh S. Torrens]] introduction ('John Farey (1766–1826) an unrecognised polymath') to the 1989 reprinting of the first volume of John Farey's ''General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, jr]] was a prolific contributor to Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', not only as a writer but also as an artist of many of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;Woolrich, A. P., "John Farey, Jr., technical author and draughtsman: his contribution to Rees's ''Cyclopædia''". ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', 20, (1998), 49–68 [http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm AIA Abstracts 1998. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207111214/http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm |date=7 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the four articles he wrote, he drew plates for two illustrating [[John Isaac Hawkins]]'s ''Finger-keyed Viol'', and two different patterns of pipe organ. The plates were keyed to the texts of the articles, and for this reason it was necessary for Farey to have produced both, since writing the texts describing the plates would have required technical knowledge which Burney would not have possessed.

'''Alphabetisation of articles:'''&lt;br&gt;
The work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.

'''Annotations:'''&lt;br&gt;
The articles are annotated to [[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer]]'s edition of Burney's ''History'' (1935) and [[Percy Scholes|Scholes]]'s edition of Burney's travels, ''Travels'' (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''.

'''Lucía Puenzo''' (born 28 November 1976, [[Buenos Aires]]) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] author, screenwriter and film director. She is the daughter of the Oscar-winning film director, producer, and screenplay writer, [[Luis Puenzo]].

== Early life ==
Puenzo studied literature at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and proceeded to attend the [[ENERC]], film school of the [[National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts|National Film Institute from Argentina]] (INCAA), where she graduated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mertin-litag.de/authors_htm/Puenzo-L.htm|title=Lucía Puenzo|accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has done work with feature films, documentary films and mini series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mertin-litag.de/authors_htm/Puenzo-L.htm|title=Lucía Puenzo|work=mertin-litag.de|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Puenzo began her career in the film industry as a screenwriter; her first work being [[The Whore and the Whale]] (2002)&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/237120660&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote the screenplay for the film Through Your Eyes (2007), which was based on the short story "Cinismo", by the Argentine writer [[Sergio Bizzio]]. Within the same year, Puenzo made her debut as a director with the film, [[XXY (film)|XXY]] (2007).&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt;

In much of her work, Puenzo focuses on childhood and adolescences. Most of these pieces feature either [[queer]] or [[intersex]] characters.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA335734742&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=ocul_carleton&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She frames these stories through the innocence of a child's gaze. Through this practice, she attempts to resist [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] models of development.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup.com"/&gt;

In an interview with [[Elle (magazine)|Elle magazine]], Puenzo discusses her interest in [[nazism]]. A common theme in her work, is the fascination with modulating the human body, much like how Hitler attempted to modulate a whole race. In the work that she creates, writes and directs, such as [[XXY (film)|XXY]] and [[The German Doctor]], she focuses on the question of medically modified bodies. She shows the ethical dilemma with modern medicine and the creation of what a "perfect body" should conform to. With her work, Puenzo addresses the fact that society keeps on pushing towards standardization. She finds there is a delicate line between the good of medicine and what is unnecessary. By addressing different stories that sway back and forth across the line, she explores the limits of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a24665/director-lucia-puenzo-interview-on-nazi-beauty-standards/|title=Director Lucia Puenzo on Nazi Beauty Standards - 'The German Doctor' Director Interview|author=Svetlana Kitto|work=ELLE|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a director, she is strongly influenced by [[silent films]]. Although her work features sound, she makes an effort to not solely rely on dialogue if a scene can be told with a look.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt;

On top of directing and screenwriting, Puenzo also has written several novels including [[El Niño Pez]] and Nueve Minutos. She creates films from many of her novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/181175-lucia-puenzos-the-german-doctor/|title=Lucía Puenzo Discusses Her New Film, 'The German Doctor'|date=29 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Migrant literature''' is either written by migrants or tells the stories of migrants and their [[immigration|migration]]. It is a topic of growing interest within literary studies since the 1980s. Migrants are people who have left their homes and cultural settings and who started a new life in another setting that is, in most cases, initially strange to them.

==Settings==
Although any experience of migration would qualify an author to be classed under migrant literature, the main focus of recent research has been on the principal channels of mass-migration in the twentieth century.  These include: European migration to North America or Australia; migration from former colonies to Europe ([[Black British]] literature, [[British-Asian]] literature, [[French Beur]] literature); situations of ethnic cleansing such as the mass migration of people from India to Pakistan and vice versa at the time of the partition of India; guest worker programs (Turks, Italians or Greeks in Germany and Holland); exile situations, such as that of exiled German dissidents during the Nazi period.

==Themes==
Migrant literature often focuses on the social contexts in the migrants' country of origin which prompt them to leave, on the experience of migration itself, on the mixed reception which they may receive in the country of arrival, on experiences of [[racism]] and hostility, and on the sense of rootlessness and the search for [[Psychological identity|identity]] which can result from displacement and cultural diversity.

==Relationship to post-colonial literature==

Colonialism often creates a setting which results in the migration of large numbers of people, either within the colonies or from them to the "imperial centre" (Britain, France etc.).  Consequently, migrant literature and [[postcolonial literature]] show some considerable overlap.  However, not all migration takes place in a colonial setting, and not all postcolonial literature deals with migration.  A question of current debate is the extent to which [[postcolonial theory]] also speaks to migration literature of non-colonial settings.  The presence in central Europe of [[Gastarbeiter]] communities, for example, is not a result of colonialism, yet their literature does have much in common with, say, British-Asian literature.

==Categories==
A number of categories have been developed for discussing migrant literature.  Some of these are the standard categories of post-colonial theory, while others have been worked out precisely to cope with non-colonial settings.

===Displacement===
Displacement is a key term in post-colonial theory which applies to all migrant situations.  It refers both to physical displacement and a sense of being socially or culturally "out of place".

===Guest and host communities===
Picking up on the term ''Gastarbeiter'' and using it affirmatively, [[Rafik Schami]] has used the terminology of guest and host to express some of the dynamics of migrant situations.

===Emigrant versus immigrant perspectives===
It is possible to distinguish the "emigrant perspective" of the migrant whose main focus is backwards to the country of origin from the "immigrant perspective" of the migrant who is reconciled with the prospect of permanent residence in the country of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Terminology first proposed in Graeme Dunphy, "Migrant, Emigrant, Immigrant: Recent Developments in Turkish-Dutch Literature", ''Neophilologus'', 85 (2001) 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary migration===
In relation to work migration, it is common for one member of a family, typically the father, to travel in search of work, the rest of the family following later. In the context of migration and family ties, "secondary migration" refers to the emigration of relatives to join the primary migrant.

(Alternatively, in other context related to migration, the expression "secondary migration" is also used to refer to the migration of an immigrant from their country of residence that is not their country of birth to yet another country.&lt;ref name="pmid20850920"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Urquia ML, Frank JW, Glazier RH |title=From places to flows. International secondary migration and birth outcomes |journal= 	Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=1620–6 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20850920 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is also used to refer to the [[Internal migration#Secondary migration|internal migration of an immigrant]], that is, the migration of an immigrant to another state within the country of residence.&lt;ref name="pmid21361922"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weine SM, Hoffman Y, Ware N, Tugenberg T, Hakizimana L, Dahnweigh G, Currie M, Wagner M |title=Secondary migration and relocation among African refugee families in the United States |journal=Family Process |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=27–46 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21361922 |pmc=5322815 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.2010.01344.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===First and second generation migrants===
First generation migrants are those who, as adults, themselves made the move from one country to another.  Second generation migrants are the children of migrants, who were either very young at the time of migration or were born in the country of arrival.  The perspectives across the generations can differ enormously.  Some critics have even used the term "third generation migrants", though it is highly questionable whether this is meaningful: if a third generation is still culturally distinct it is probably more useful to speak of an established ethnic minority.

===Between cultures===
In literature of second generation migrants, a location "between" two cultures, sometimes called an "interstitial" space, is often mentioned as a way of expressing a sense of belonging in neither the guest nor the host community.  Those whose experience has been more positive may reject the notion of "between" and feel that they live, rather, in the cultural overlap, not a void but a place of particular richness.

===Hybridity===
[[Hybridity]] is another catch-phrase from post-colonial theory which applies also in many non-colonial migrant situations.  It refers to the migrant's culturally mixed identity as the opposed forces of assimilation and the search for roots force a middle way.
(In post-colonial theory, the term hybridity is also used in non-migrant situations to refer to the impact of the culture of the colonisers on the culture of the colonised.)

===Bilingual theory===
[[Multilingualism|Bilingualism]] is an essential component of hybridity.  Results of socio-linguistic research are therefore of importance to work on migrant literature.

'''Military art''' is art with a [[military]] subject matter, regardless of its style or medium.  The battle scene is one of the oldest types of art in developed civilizations, as rulers have always been keen to celebrate their victories and intimidate potential opponents. The depiction of other aspects of warfare, especially the suffering of casualties and civilians, has taken much longer to develop.  As well as portraits of military figures, depictions of anonymous soldiers away from the battlefield have been very common; since the introduction of [[military uniform]]s such works often concentrate on showing the variety of these.

Naval scenes are very common, and battle scenes and "ship portraits" are mostly considered as a branch of [[marine art]]; the development of other large types of military equipment such as [[warplane]]s and [[tank]]s has led to new types of work portraying these, either in action or at rest.  In 20th century wars official [[war artist]]s were retained to depict the military in action; despite artists now being very close to the action the battle scene is mostly left to popular graphic media and the cinema.  The term war art is sometimes used, mostly in relation to 20th century military art made during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/war-art "War art"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com, and the article by Richard Woodward on "Military artists" in the same work ([http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists penultimate paragraph]); note that the term does not appear at all in [[Grove Art Online]], or other large art reference works. As formal "wars" have largely vanished, "combat artist" seems to be replacing "war artist" in official use.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient world===
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|The Roman [[Alexander Mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] (left) defeating [[Darius III of Persia]]; a floor mosaic excavated from [[Pompeii]], c. 100BC]]

Art depicting military themes has existed throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Battlefield Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette]] from the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt]] (circa [[3500 BC|~3500]] to [[3000 BC]]) is incomplete, but shows prisoners being led away, and wild animals feasting on the dead. The [[Stele of the Vultures]], about 2,500 BC, is one of a number of [[Mesopotamian]] "victory [[stelae]]".  Also around 2,500 BC, the earliest known depiction of a city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the [[Nome (Egypt)#Upper Egypt|21st nome of Upper Egypt]], who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Strudwick (2005), p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2008), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC appears to have been inconclusive, reliefs erected by [[Ramesses II]] show him scattering his [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] opponents with his chariot.

Surviving [[Assyrian art]] mainly consists of large stone [[relief]]s showing detailed scenes of either military campaigns or hunting.  The ancient Greek [[Parthenon Marbles]] show lengthy parades of the city's volunteer [[cavalry]] force, and many [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] show scenes of combat.  In [[Han dynasty]] China, a famous stone relief of c. 150-170 AD from the [[Wu family shrines]] shows a battle between cavalry forces in the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Ancient Roman art]] the most elaborate [[Roman triumphal column]]s showed very long reliefs of military campaigns winding round the body of huge columns; among the most impressive are those of [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] in Rome.  The [[Alexander Mosaic]] is a large and dramatic battle scene showing [[Alexander the Great]] defeating [[Darius III of Persia]]; it is a floor mosaic excavated from [[Pompeii]], probably copying a lost painting.&lt;ref name="Military Artists"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists "Military Artists"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[Hellenistic]] and Roman [[sarcophagi]] showed crowded scenes of combat, sometimes mythological (an [[amazonomachy]] is a term for a scene of battle between [[Amazons]] and [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]]), and usually not relating to a particular battle; these were not necessarily used to bury people with military experience.  Such scenes had a great influence on Renaissance battle scenes.&lt;ref name="Pepper, 1 i"&gt;Pepper, 1 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;  By the Late Roman Empire the reverse of coins very often showed soldiers and carried an inscription praising 'our boys', no doubt in hope of delaying the next military revolt.

===Medieval===

Christian art produced for the church generally avoided battle scenes, although a rare [[Late Antique]] motif shows Christ dressed as a victorious emperor in general's dress, having conquered the devil, in [[Christ treading on the beasts]] and other [[iconography|iconographies]].  The violent tastes of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] elite managed to add the [[Harrowing of Hell]], conceived as a raid on Satan's stronghold, led by Christ, to the standard group of scenes for a cycle on the ''[[Life of Christ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soldier saints]], shown in military dress, were extremely popular, as were images of the [[Archangel Michael]] stabbing Satan as a dragon with a cross with a spear-point at its base.  Some [[illuminated manuscript]]s illustrated the many battles in the [[Old Testament]].

Secular works produced for secular patrons often show military themes, for example in illuminated manuscript copies of histories like the 15th century [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)]], where most of the 112 miniatures show military scenes.  The ''[[Siege of the Castle of Love]]'', often found on Gothic [[ivory]] mirror-cases, showed knights attacking a castle defended by ladies, a metaphor from the literature of [[courtly love]].  The 11th century [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is a linear panoramic narrative of the events surrounding the [[Norman Conquest]] and the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22470&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Xnib8Hg?url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/homepage/ |date=2012-02-18 }}, Bayeaux tapestry, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151214212044/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Nomination Form, p. 4]; excerpt,"... it is an established fact that it recounts a military triumph: the conquest of England by William the Conqueror"; [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151214212044/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Nomination Form], pp. 5-6; excerpt, "This large-scale textile work of the 11th century is, to our knowledge, the only one of its kind to have survived to the present day. The Tapestry is an almost contemporary visual record of the event it depicts, one of the most significant events of Medieval times. It tells of the beginnings of the Norman Conquest; the landing of Norman and French troops in England and the Battle of Hastings"&lt;/ref&gt; the only surviving example of a type of embroidered hanging with which rich [[Anglo-Saxons]] used to decorate their homes.  In [[Islamic art]] the battle scene, often from a fictional work of [[epic poetry]], was a frequent subject in [[Persian miniature]]s, and the high viewpoint they adopted made the scenes more easily comprehensible than many Western images.

===Renaissance to Napoleonic Wars===
[[File:Urs Graf Schrecken des Kriegs 1521.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Battle of Marignano]], drawing by [[Urs Graf]], 1521]]

[[Italian Renaissance painting]] saw a great increase in military art by the leading artists, '''battle paintings''' often featuring near-contemporary scenes such as the huge set of three canvases of  ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1445) by [[Paolo Uccello]], and the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' (1504–06) by Michelangelo and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1503–06), which were intended to be placed opposite each other in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]], but neither of which were completed.  For Renaissance artists with their new skills in depicting the human figure, battle scenes allowed them to demonstrate all their skills in depicting complicated poses; Michelangelo choose a moment when a group of soldiers was surprised bathing, and almost all the figures are nude.  Leonardo's battle was a cavalry one, the central section of which was very widely seen before being destroyed, and hugely influential: it "exerted a fundamental change on the whole idea of battle painting, an influence that lasted through the Late Renaissance and the Baroque up until the heroic machines of the Napoleonic painters and even the battle compositions of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]", according to the art historian [[Frederick Hartt]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 457 on Leonardo (quoted), 470-471 on Michelangelo, 246-248 on Uccello.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these depicted frankly minor actions where Florence had defeated neighbouring cities, but important battles from distant history were equally popular. [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Triumphs of Caesar]]'' shows the [[Roman triumph]]al parade of [[Julius Caesar]], though concentrating on the booty rather than the army following it; the print series ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' shows both, leading up to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] riding on a huge carriage. ''[[The Battle of the Milvian Bridge (Giulio Romano)|The Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'' by [[Giulio Romano]] brought a huge and "seminal" battle scene into the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]].&lt;ref name="Pepper, 1 i"/&gt;  The unusual ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' (1528–9) by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] managed to make one of the most highly regarded Renaissance battle scenes, despite, or perhaps because of, having a vertical format, which was dictated by the planned setting; it was commissioned as one of a set of eight battle paintings by various artists. "It was the most detailed and panoramic battle picture of its day",&lt;ref name="Military Artists"/&gt;  and its aerial viewpoint was to be very widely followed over the next centuries, though rarely to such dramatic effect.
[[Image:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602.jpg|thumb|''Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602'', 1617, by [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom|Hendrick Vroom]]]]

Especially in Northern Europe, small groups of soldiers became a popular subject for paintings and especially [[old master print|prints]] by many artists, including [[Urs Graf]], who is unusual in that he was a professional [[Swiss mercenary]] for many years.  These works began to present a less heroic view of soldiers, who often represented a considerable threat to civilian populations even in peacetime, though the extravagant costumes of the [[Landsknecht]] are often treated as glamorous.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 1 (iii), Kettering, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  For Peter Paret, from the Renaissance "the glorification of the temporal leader and of his political system - which had of course also been present in medieval art - replaces the Christian faith as a determining interpretive force" in military art.&lt;ref&gt;Paret, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval painting became conventionalized in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], and from then on artists tended to specialize in it or not attempt it; apart from anything else "Marine artists have always dealt with a particularly demanding class of patron", as [[JMW Turner]] found when the "Sailor King" [[William IV of England]] rejected his version of ''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]'' because of inaccuracy. [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom|Hendrick Vroom]] was the earliest real specialist,  followed by the [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son team of Willem van de Velde]], who emigrated to London in 1673, and effectively founded the English tradition of naval painting, "producing a stunning visual record of the Anglo-Dutch naval wars, which set the conventions of maritime battle painting for the next 150 years".  Vroom had also worked for English patrons, designing a large set of tapestries of the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] which was destroyed when the [[Houses of Parliament]] burnt down in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (i) quoted on patrons; 2 (ii) quoted on van de Veldes; Slive, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th and 18th centuries saw depictions of battles mostly adopting a [[bird's eye view]], as though from a hill nearby; this made them less interesting to paint, and the major artists now tended to avoid them. A very different view of warfare is seen in ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]'' ("The Misfortunes of War"), a set of twelve [[etching]]s produced by [[Jacques Callot]] during the [[Thirty Years War]] which follows a group of soldiers ravaging the countryside before eventually being rounded up by their own side and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 155-156; [http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists "Military Artists"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the first half of the 17th century, a branch of [[genre painting]] in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] specialized in [[guardroom scene]]s of rather disorderly soldiers, not often in battle, but ransacking farmhouses or sitting around in a camp guardroom.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 2 (i); Kettering, 104-109&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings of [[Salvator Rosa]], essentially [[landscape art|landscapes]], often showed groups variously described as bandits or soldiers lurking in the countryside of Southern Italy.  ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (1634–35) shows a crowded scene as the two sides meet peacefully to surrender the town; a theme more often copied in naval painting than land-based military art.&lt;ref name="Military Artists"/&gt;

During the 17th century sets of [[tapestries]] became the main medium for "official military art".  A set produced for the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] showing his victories was varied for different clients, and even sold to one of his opponents, [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]], after reworking the general's faces and other details.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 2 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishbattles.com/spanish-succession/battle-blenheim.htm 1704 Battle of Blenheim depicted in tapestry at Blenheim Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-18th century, a number of artists, especially in Britain, sought to revive military art with large works centred on a heroic incident that would once again bring the genre to the fore in [[history painting]], as it had been in the Renaissance.  The standard contemporary battle scene tended to be grouped in the lowly category of [[topographical painting]], covering maps and views of country houses.  ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771) by [[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of Captain James Cook (Zoffany)|The Death of Captain James Cook]]'' (1779) by [[Johann Zoffany]], ''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782]]'' and  ''[[The Death of Major Pierson]]'' (1784) by [[John Singleton Copley]] are leading examples of the new type, which ignored complaints about the unsuitability of modern dress for heroic subjects.  However such works had more immediate influence in France than in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Napoleonic era]], France added [[Romanticism]] to its style and began to portray individual soldiers with more character.  Battle paintings were increasingly produced for large public buildings, and grew larger than ever before. [[Antoine-Jean Gros|Baron Gros]] painted mostly glorifications of Napoleon and his victories, but his 1808 painting of the ''[[Battle of Eylau]]'' does not neglect the suffering of the dead and wounded on the frozen battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Geraldine. (1977). "Gros, Baron Antoine Jean", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|''Nineteenth-century Painters and Painting: A Dictionary'', p. 100.|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Goya]]'s large paintings ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', perhaps consciously conceived as a riposte to Gros, and his related series of 82 [[etching]]s, ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' (Spanish: ''Los Desastres de la Guerra''), emphasized the brutality of the French forces during the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (ii); Honour &amp; Fleming, 483&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Goya y Lucientes, Franciso José de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 99.|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British depictions of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] continued the late 18th century patterns, often on a larger scale, with the death of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] quickly producing large works by [[Arthur William Devis]] (''[[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805]]'') and West (''[[The Death of Nelson (West painting)|The Death of Nelson]]''). [[J. M. W. Turner]] was among the artists who produced scenes of Nelson's victories, with ''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Institution]] ran competitions for sketches of art commemorating British victories, the winning entries being then commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, 14-28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grande Armée - 10th Regiment of Hussars.jpg|thumb|upright|left|10th Regiment of Hussars, by Carle Vernet]]
In this period the uniform print, concentrating on a detailed depiction of the uniform of one or more standing figures, typically hand-coloured, also became very popular across Europe. Like other prints these were typically published in book form, but also sold individually.  In Britain the 87 prints of ''The Loyal Volunteers of London'' (1797–98) by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], published by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], mark the start of the classic period.  Though Rowlandson usually satirized his subjects to some degree, here the soldiers were "represented as they, and particularly their colonels who paid for their uniforms, preferred to see themselves", which remained the usual depiction in such prints.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 73-74, quoting Ford's history of the Ackermann firm.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[commons:Category:La Grande Armée (Carle Vernet)|set of prints]] by [[Carle Vernet]] of the splendid uniforms of ''La [[Grande Armée]] de 1812'' showed most foot-soldiers in pairs in camp, in a variety of relaxed poses that showed one from the front and the other from behind.  A rare oil painting by a leading artist that treats soldiers in the spirit of the uniform print is ''Soldiers of the 10th Light Dragoons'' (the "Prince of Wales Own") painted in 1793 by [[George Stubbs]] for their [[Colonel in Chief]], the future [[George IV of England]].  Other paintings of single soldiers were more dramatic, like [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'' (c. 1812).

[[Eugène Delacroix]], who also painted many smaller combat scenes, finished his ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' in 1824, showing a then notorious attack on Greek civilians by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[Greek War of Independence]], who are shown in an entirely negative light.  It had a more immediate impact on European art than Goya's ''Tres de Mayo'' (''The Third of May 1808'') of a few years earlier, which was apparently not even on display in the [[Prado Museum]] until some years later.  In contrast, Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' of 1830 showed fighting in a positive light, but not the "military" as it shows armed civilian revolutionaries of the [[July Revolution]], advancing against the unseen uniformed forces of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 487-488&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkish atrocities were to remain a recurrent theme in 19th-century painting, especially in former Ottoman territories escaped from the declining empire (often pre-rape scenes treated rather salaciously), and general anti-military sentiments, previously mostly found in prints, were also to emerge regularly in large oil paintings.

Military art remained popular during the remainder of the 19th century in most of Europe. French artists such as [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Messonier, Jean Louis Ernest", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 145.|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edouard Detaille]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Detaille, Jean Baptiste Edouard", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 73.|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Alphonse de Neuville]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Neuville, Alphonse Marie de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 159.|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; established military genre painting in the [[Paris Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A.E. (1958). "Military Art and Artists", ''Army Quarterly and Defence Journal'', Vol. 76-77, pp. 235-236; excerpt, "A collaborator of [[Edouard Detaille|Detaille]], and like him a specialist in military art, was [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Alphonse de Neuville]] (1836&amp;ndash;1885), who made his debut at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1859 with a scene showing a French battery at [[Sevastopol|Sebastapol]]."&lt;/ref&gt; New forms of military art which developed in the 1850s met considerable opposition from the [[Royal Academy]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ|pp. 58.|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European artists in a generally [[Academic art|academic style]] who were well known as painters of battle scenes, still often of subjects from the Napoleonic Wars or older conflicts, included [[Albrecht Adam]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Albrecht, Adam", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 28.|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicaise de Keyser]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Keyser, Nicaise de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 120.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piotr Michałowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Michalowski, Piotr", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 120.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Charles Horace Vernet]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Vernet, Antoine Charles Horace", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 211.|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emile Jean Horace Vernet]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Vernet, Emile Jean Horace", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 212.|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Camphausen]] and [[Emil Hünten]].  The rise of [[nationalism]] promoted battle painting in countries such as Hungary (great attention paid to uniforms), Poland (huge forces) and the [[Czech Lands]]. [[Jan Matejko]]'s enormous ''[[Battle of Grunwald (painting)|Battle of Grunwald]]'' (1878) reflects [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slav]] sentiment, showing various [[Slav]] forces joining together to smash the power of the [[Teutonic Knights]].

The usage of the term "military art" has evolved since the middle of the 19th century.  In France, Charles Baudelaire discussed military art, and the impact on it of photography, in the Paris [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Paret, Peter (1997). {{Google books|iCyO0uVEzRUC|''Imagined Battles.

Charvet, pp. 295, 297; excerpt, "In a section preceding the discussion of ''military art'' in his articles on the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859, Baudelaire discussed the advent of photography and its impact on art."&lt;/ref&gt;  A British critic of the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition of 1861 observed that 
{{cquote|British painters have never fully grappled with ''military art'', they have only hovered around the edges, touching and trimming. -- [[William Michael Rossetti]]&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ| pp. 68-69.|page=68}}; the term ''military art'' is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; a [[neologism]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This perspective is also seen in ''[[Remnants of an Army]]'' which showed William Brydon struggling into Jalalabad on a dying horse. Dr.  Brydon was the sole survivor of the 1842 retreat from Kabul, in which 16,000 were massacred by Afghan tribesmen.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article6828145.ece  "Pictures,"] September 10, 2009;  [http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1842-04-07-05-001&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1842-04-07-05  "The Disasters in Afghanistan,"] ''The Times.''

The British market began to develop in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ| p. 71.|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relations between the state and its military, and the ideologies which are implied in that relationship affected the artwork, the artists and the public perceptions of both artwork and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ|p. 2-3.|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Crimean War]] photographers began to compete strongly with artists in coverage of scenes in camp, and the aftermath of battle, but exposure times were generally too long to enable them to take pictures of battles very effectively. [[War photography]] is not covered in this article.  Illustrations for newspapers and magazines continued a heroic style with perhaps more confidence than painters, and [[Melton Prior]] followed British forces around Imperial troublespots for decades, working for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''; his scenes "helped to establish a style of action draughtsmanship which has left an indelible stamp on the art of the [[comic strip]]."&lt;ref name="Pepper, 3, ii"&gt;Pepper, 3, (ii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior and other "special correspondents" such as [[Frederic Villiers]] were known as "specials". [[Richard Caton Woodville]] and [[Charles Edwin Fripp]] were "specials" and also painters who exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Pepper, 3, ii"/&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[File:'Stormtroops Advancing Under Gas', etching and aquatint by Otto Dix, 1924.jpg|thumb|''[[Stormtrooper]]s Advancing Under Gas'', etching and aquatint by [[Otto Dix]] from ''Der Krieg'', 1924]]
World War I very largely confirmed the end of the glorification of war in art, which had been in decline since the end of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Introduction and 3, ii&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, and despite the establishment of large schemes employing official [[war artist]]s, the most striking art depicting the war is that emphasizing its horror. Official war artists were appointed by governments for information or propaganda purposes and to record events on the battlefield;&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Archives|National Archives (UK)]], [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/inf3.htm  "'The Art of War,' Learn About the Art."]&lt;/ref&gt; but many artists fought as normal soldiers and recorded their experiences at the time and later, including the Germans [[George Grosz]] and [[Otto Dix]], who had both fought on the Western Front, and continued to depict the subject for the rest of their careers. Dix's ''[[The Trench (Dix)|The Trench]]'' (1923), showing the dismembered bodies of the dead after an assault, caused a scandal, and was first displayed behind a curtain, before causing the dismissal of the museum director who had planned to buy it.  Later, after exhibiting it in their 1937 travelling exhibition of "[[Degenerate art]]", the [[Nazi]] government burnt it.  He produced a set of fifty prints in 1924 on ''Der Krieg'' ("The War").  The English artist [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] began to make drawings of the war while fighting on the Western Front in the [[Artists Rifles]].  After recovering from a wound he was recruited as an official war artist and produced many of the most memorable images from the British side of both World Wars.  After the war, the huge demand for [[war memorial]]s caused a boom for sculptors, covered below, and makers of [[stained-glass]].

[[Poster]]s had become universal by 1914 and were addressed at both the military and the "home front" for various purposes, including recruitment, where the British ''[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]'' (not actually the slogan) was repeated in the United States with [[Uncle Sam]], and elsewhere with similar totemic figures.  The Soviet Union began with very [[Modernist]] posters such as ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' by [[Lazar Markovich Lissitzky]] but soon turned to [[socialist realism]], used for most [[World War II posters from the Soviet Union]], which sometimes are similar to their [[Art of the Third Reich|Nazi equivalents]].  In World War II they were even more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;James covers all major combatant nations of World War I; for British World War II posters, and a wider bibliography, see ''Weapons on the Wall'' in external links&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrators and sketch artists such as Norman Rockwell also followed the trend away from military themed shots following the Second World War and with the rise of photographic covers in general.

The impact of the [[Spanish Civil War]] on a non-combatant populace was depicted in [[Picasso]]'s masterpiece, [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']], showing the [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, William. [http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0209-04.htm The Lessons of Guernica,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012027/http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0209-04.htm |date=2010-12-04 }} ''Toronto Star.'' February 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; a very different treatment of a similar subject is seen in [[Henry Moore]]'s drawings of sleeping civilians sheltering from [[The Blitz]] bombing on the station platforms of the [[London Underground]]. Among official World War II war artists, Paul Nash's ''[[Totes Meer]]'' is a powerful image of a scrapyard of shot-down German aircraft, and the landscapist [[Eric Ravilious]] produced some very fine paintings before being shot down and killed in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Ardizzone]]'s pictures concentrated entirely on soldiers relaxing or performing routine duties, and were praised by many soldiers: "He is the only person who has caught the atmosphere of this war" felt [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]], the art critic and historian, friend of Picasso, and then in a military medical unit.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Photography and film were now able to capture fast-moving action, and can fairly be said to have produced most of memorable images recording combat in the war, and certainly subsequent conflicts like the [[Vietnam War]], which was more notable for specifically anti-war protest art, in posters and the work of artists like [[Nancy Spero]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 77-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraiture===
[[File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|''[[Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster|Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration]] of the [[Peace of Münster]]'', 1648, by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], 232 × 547 cm (91.34 × 215.35 in)]]
Rulers have been shown in specifically military dress since ancient times; the difference is especially easy to see in [[Ancient Roman sculpture]], where generals and increasingly often emperors are depicted with armour and the short military tunic.  Medieval [[tomb effigies]] more often than not depict knights, nobles and kings in armour, whether or not they saw active service.  In the [[Early Modern period]], when senior commanders tended to wear their normal riding dress even on the battlefield, the distinction between a military portrait and a normal one is mostly conveyed by the background, or by a breastplate or the buff leather jerkin worn underneath armour, but once even generals began to wear military uniform, in the mid-18th century, it becomes clear again,&lt;ref&gt;Kettering, 100&lt;/ref&gt; although initially officer's uniforms were close to smart civilian costume.

Full-length and equestrian portraits of rulers and [[general officer|generals]] often showed them on the battlefield, but with the action in the distant background; a feature probably dating back to [[Titian]]'s magisterial ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'', which shows the emperor after his victory at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] but with no other soldiers present.  Monarchs were not often painted in military uniform until the Napoleonic period, but in the 19th century this became typical for formal portraits, perhaps because uniform was more visually appealing. A distinctively Dutch type of painting are huge group portraits commissioned by the wealthy part-time officers of city militia companies, of which [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' is much the most famous, although its narrative setting is atypical of the genre.  Most examples just show the officers lined up as though about to eat dinner, and some show them actually eating it.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise group portraits of officers are rather surprisingly rare until the 19th century.

===Sculpture===

[[File:Fischerskulptur aus Stgw 57 IMG 1477.JPG|thumb|right|Sculpture made from Swiss assault rifles [[SIG SG 510|Stgw 57]]]]
Most surviving sculpture of battle scenes from antiquity is in stone reliefs, covered above.  Renaissance artists and patrons were keen to revive this form, which they mostly did in much smaller scenes in stone or bronze.  The tomb in [[Milan]] of the brilliant French general [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours]] included numerous marble reliefs round the base of the sarcophagus (which was never completed).  Statues and tomb monuments of commanders continued to be the most common site until the more general [[war memorial]] commemorating all the dead began to emerge in the period of the Napoleonic Wars. [[Nelson's Column]] in London still commemorates a single commander; it has very large reliefs around the base by different artists, although these are generally regarded as less memorable than other aspects of the monument. [[Wellington's Column]] in [[Liverpool]] is also known as the "Waterloo Memorial", shifting to the more modern concept when "the dead were remembered essentially as soldiers who fought in the name of national collectives".&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge losses of the [[American Civil War]] saw the first really large group of sculptural war memorials, as well as many monuments for individuals.  Among the most artistically outstanding is the Memorial to [[Robert Gould Shaw]] and the all-[[African American|black]] [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Regiment]] by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] in Boston, with a second cast in the [[National Gallery of Art, Washington]].  The even larger losses of World War I led even small communities in most nations involved to raise some form of memorial, introducing the widespread use of the form to Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the sudden increase in demand leading to a boom for sculptors of [[public art]].  Even more than in painting, the war brought a crisis in style, as much public opinion felt the traditional heroic styles inappropriate.  One of the most successful British memorials is the starkly realist [[Royal Artillery Memorial]] in London, the masterpiece of [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]], who had been wounded three times in the war and spent most of the next decade commemorating it.  In the defeated nations of Germany and Austria controversy, which had a political aspect, was especially fierce, and a number of memorials considered excessively modern were removed by the Nazis, whose own memorials, such as the [[Tannenberg Memorial]] were removed after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions were to make memorials more neutral, as in the repurposed [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin, since rededicated to different groups several times, and the dignified architectural forms of the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph in London]] (widely imitated) and the German [[Laboe Naval Memorial]]; tombs of the [[Unknown Warrior]] and [[eternal flame]]s were other ways of avoiding controversy.  Some, like the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|Canadian National War Memorial]], and most French memorials, were content to update traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 103–106 on conservatism, and generally throughout Chapter 5 on war memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great number of World War I memorials were simply expanded in scope to cover the dead of World War II, and often subsequent conflicts. The now dominant role of [[photography]] in depicting war is reflected in the [[National Iwo Jima Memorial]], which recreates the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.  The [[National D-Day Memorial]], a project of the 1990s, includes strongly realist sculpture, in contrast to the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington.  More innovative memorials have often been erected for the civilian victims of war, above all those of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, throughout. His Chapter 1 gives an overview of the study of 19th and 20th century memorials&lt;/ref&gt;

(2010) [http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7876/2/Gough_Introduction_A_Terrible_Beauty.pdf ''A Terrible Beauty: British Artists in the First World War,'' p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the tussle includes determining how best to illustrate complex war scenes. [[Charles Bean|C.E.W. Bean]]'s ''Anzac Book'', for example, influenced Australian artists who grew up between the two world wars.  When they were asked to depict a second multi-nation war after 1939, there was a precedent and format for them to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, John B. (1977). ''Australian Artists at War,'' Vol. 2, p. 5; excerpt, "The Australian people first became familiar with Australasian ''war art'' as a genre with the publication of the so-called 'Christmas books' ... which contained the writings of servicemen and were illustrated by the current war artists."&lt;/ref&gt;

War art has been used as an instrument of propaganda, such as a nation-building function or other persuasive ends.&lt;ref name="foss157"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|p. 6.|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|p. 58.|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; War art is also captured in caricature, which offers contemporary insights.&lt;ref&gt;ASKB, [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/collections/askb/caricatures.php Caricature]&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Civilization and aesthetic tradition were both clearly marked by military conflicts throughout history.  War drove culture and culture drove war.  The legacy of war inspired artworks reads like a series of mile markers, documenting the meandering course of civilization's evolutionary map. &lt;ref&gt;Chase Maenius.

====War artists====
[[File:Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier - The Portrait of a Sergeant - WGA14740.jpg|thumb|Artist portraying a sergeant (1874), by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]].]]
War artists may be involved as onlookers to the scenes, military personnel who respond to powerful inner urges to depict direct war experience, or individuals who are officially commissioned to be present and record military activity.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ro8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Oxford+Companion+to+Military+History+War+art+is+that+which+has+been+developed&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Companion+to+Military+History+War+art+is+that+which+has+been+developed&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LJ9YTPu0AY689QT9xLnsBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''Oxford Companion to Military History'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of nation's efforts to document war events, [[Japanese official war artists|official Japanese war artists]] were commissioned to create artwork in the context of a specific war for the Japanese government, including ''sensō sakusen kirokuga'' ("war campaign documentary painting"). Between 1937 and 1945, approximately 200 pictures depicting Japan's military campaigns were created.  These pictures were presented at large-scale exhibitions during the war years; After the end of World War II, Americans took possession of Japanese artwork.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, Barbara. (2005).  ''Artists of World War II'', pp. 111-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsuruya_aas"&gt;Tsuruya, Mayu. [http://www.asian-studies.org/absts/2007abst/japan/j-156.htm  "Cultural Significance of an Invisible Emperor in ''Sensô Sakusen Kirokuga'' ('War Campaign Documentary Painting')."] [[Association for Asian Studies]] (AAS), Annual Meeting (Boston, Massachusetts), March 22–25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nara, Hiroshi. (2007). {{Google books|bMMusu0O4zAC|''Inexorable Modernity: Japan's Grappling with Modernity in the Arts'', p. 97 n47.|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some who may choose not to create war art. During the course of World War II, the Italians created virtually no art which documented the conflict.  The French began to paint the war only after the war was ended in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Alan. (1983). ''Colours of War,'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical examples====
Examples of classical war art include the friezes of warriors at the [[Temple of Aphaia]] in Greece or the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], is a linear panoramic narrative of the events surrounding the [[Norman Conquest]] and the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stover, Eric ''et al.''

'''''Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket''''' is a c. 1875 painting by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] held in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. The painting exemplified the [[Art for art's sake]] movement – a concept formulated by [[Pierre Jules Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]. 

First shown at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in London in 1877, it is one of two works (the other being ''Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Firewheel'') inspired by the [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]], a celebrated pleasure resort in London. One of his many works from his series of [[Nocturne_(painting)|Nocturnes]], it is the last of the London Nocturnes and is now widely acknowledged to be the high point of Whistler's middle period. Whistler's depiction of the industrial city park in ''The Falling Rocket'' includes a fireworks display in the foggy night sky. ''Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket'' is most famously known as the inception of the lawsuit between Whistler and the art critic [[John Ruskin]].

==Composition==
''Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket'' is fundamentally composed of bleak tones, with three main colors: blue, green, and yellow.  Restricted in its use of colors, the piece develops a muted yet harmonious composition. The billowing smoke gives the viewer a clear distinction between the water and the sky, where the separation blurs into a cohesive and somber space. It is this large avalanche of fog that represents the rocket of the title. Dabs of yellow enliven the artwork as exploding fireworks in the misty air. The figures watching are almost transparent, their shapes general and simplistic. To the left, the artist signs his name in a manner that has clearly been influenced by [[Japanese print]]s, with thick, straight brushstrokes that appear to imitate Japanese characters. Influenced by Japanese artists like [[Utagawa Hiroshige]], Whistler spent years perfecting his splatter technique. Eventually he possessed the ability to make an object or person with what appeared to be nothing more than a single flick of paint. Although Whistler's critics denounced his technique as reckless or lacking artistic merit, it is notable that Whistler spent much of his time with meticulous details, often going so far as to view his work through mirrors to ensure that no deficiencies were overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and theory==
''The Falling Rocket'' retains a certain degree of colour-laden luminosity that provokes spatial ambiguity set against a structure of line and form. Nocturnes were a series of paintings which, through painterly style, were evocative of differing night time scenes. The artist insisted that they were not pictures, but rather, scenes or moments. Working against contemporary inclinations for narrative (indicative of the heavy consumption of literature), Whistler can be seen arguing for painting's essential difference from literature within this work, as colour and tone trounce hints of narrative or moral allusion. Whistler's focus was on coloristic effects as a means of creating a particular sensation. More than that, a Nocturne is concerned with its depiction of space, seeking a particular sense of void that seems to arise only in the night time. As part of the [[Art for Art's Sake]] movement, the artwork seeks to provide complex emotions that go beyond the technicalities of the imagery. Whistler believed that certain experiences were often best expressed by nuance and implication. These compositions were not designed to avoid the truth of a scene, but instead served as a means of reaching deeper, more hidden truths.&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt; His artistic endeavours no longer concerned themselves with physical accuracy, seeking only to capture the essence of an intangible, personal and intimate moment. Whistler has been quoted as saying "If the man who paints only the tree, or flower, or other surface he sees before him were an artist, the king of artists would be the photographer. It is for the artist to do something beyond this.” In essence, ''The Falling Rocket'' is the synthesis of a fireworks scene in London, and so by no means does it aim to look like it. Like his other Nocturnes, the painting is meant to be seen as an arrangement, set to invoke particular sensations for the audience.

==Controversy==
Affronted by ''The Falling Rocket'', [[John Ruskin]] accused Whistler of "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face" in the ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Linda, ''After Whistler: The Artist and His Influence on American Painting.'' City: Publisher, 2003. Pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; As a leading art critic of the [[Victorian era]], Ruskin's harsh critique of ''The Falling Rocket'' caused an uproar among owners of other Whistler works. Rapidly, it became shameful to have a Whistler piece, pushing the artist into greater financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; With his pride, finances, and the significance of his Nocturne at stake, Whistler sued Ruskin for [[libel]] in defence. In court, he asked the jury to not view it as a traditional painting, but instead as an artistic arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Stuttaford, Genevieve. "Nonfiction – the Aesthetic Movement by Lionel Lambourne." Vol. 243. (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; In his explanation, he insisted that the painting was a representation of the fireworks from the Cremorne Gardens. During the trial, Sir John Holker asked, "Not a view of the Cremorne?" to which Whistler was quoted as saying, "If it were a view of Cremorne, it would certainly bring about nothing but disappointment on the part of the beholders."&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his case was not helped when ''The Falling Rocket'' was accidentally presented to trial upside down.&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; His explanation of the composition proved fruitless before the judge. The Ruskin vs. Whistler Trial, which took place on November 25 and 26, 1878,  was disastrous for Whistler. While he did not lose, he only won a [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/whistler/ Whistler, James Abbott McNeill]. WebMuseumn, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; After all the court costs, he had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. Whistler was forced to pawn, sell, and mortgage everything he could get his hands on.&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler included a transcript of the case in his 1890 book ''[[The Gentle Art of Making Enemies]]''.

John Ruskin was not aware of the effort and theory that had gone into ''Nocturne in Black and Gold'' when he accused ''The Falling Rocket'' of being a public insult. Ruskin had berated Whistler's paintings long before the event leading up to the trial. Four years earlier he had denounced Whistler's art as "absolute rubbish".&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that Ruskin was envious of Whistler's close relationship with [[Charles Augustus Howell]], who often aided Whistler financially – especially after the court case.&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, Elizabeth and Joseph Pennell. ''The Life of James McNeill Whistler''. London: Ballantyne Press, 2012. pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that the artist's lack of homage offended Ruskin. Whistler was not the only person disturbed by the art critic's commentary. [[Henry James]] was one individual that spoke out against Ruskin, remarking that Ruskin had begun to overstep his bounds as an art critic, becoming tyrannical in his diction – so much so that to see him brought to court over his offensive words was perceived as a delight.&lt;ref&gt;Prideaux, pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested John Ruskin suffered from [[CADASIL syndrome]] and the visual disturbances this condition caused him might have been a factor in his irritation at this particular painting.&lt;ref name="Kempster"&gt;Kempster PA, Alty JE.

'''Northwest Coast art''' is the term commonly applied to a style of art created primarily by artists from [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Heiltsuk]], [[Nuxalk]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] and other [[First Nations]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] of North America, from pre-European-contact times up to the present.

== Distinguishing characteristics ==
[[File:Namgis (Native American). Thunderbird Transformation Mask, 19th century.jpg|thumb|Namgis, ''Thunderbird Transformation Mask'', 19th century. The Thunderbird is believed to be an Ancestral Sky Being of the Namgis clan of the [[Kwakwaka’wakw]], who say that when this bird ruffles its feathers, it causes thunder and when it blinks its eyes, lightning flashes. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Two-dimensional Northwest Coast art is distinguished by the use of [[formlines]], and the use of characteristic shapes referred to as ''ovoids'', ''U forms'' and ''S forms''.  Before European contact, the most common media were wood (often [[Western red cedar]]), stone, and copper; since European contact, paper, canvas, glass, and precious metals have also been used.  If paint is used, the most common colours are red and black, but yellow is also often used, particularly among [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] artists.&lt;ref name="Bill1"&gt;Bill Holm, Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form.  University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chilkat weaving]] applies formline designs to textiles. Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian have traditionally produced Chilkat woven regalia, from wool and yellow cedar bark, that is important for civic and ceremonial events, including potlatches.

The patterns depicted include natural forms such as bears, ravens, eagles, orcas, and humans; [[legendary creature]]s such as [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbirds]] and [[sisiutl]]s; and abstract forms made up of the characteristic Northwest Coast shapes.  [[Totem poles]] are the most well-known artifacts produced using this style.  Northwest Coast artists are also notable for producing characteristic "bent-corner" or "bentwood" boxes, masks, and canoes.  Northwest Coast designs were also used to decorate traditional First Nations household items such as spoons, ladles, baskets, hats, and paddles; since European contact, the Northwest Coast art style has increasingly been used in gallery-oriented forms such as paintings, prints and sculptures.

{{quote|Although highly conventionalized decorative design occurs all along the coast, to the south and north of this center the representational motive becomes progressively stronger. Krickeberg (1925: 144) characterizes this as a fresh naturalism to the south among the Kwakiutl, Nootka, and Salish and a certain relationship to Eskimo engraving and painting among the Tlingit to the north. The shift in emphasis is gradual - Bella Bella art, for example, has a close affinity to its Coast Tsimshian counterpart. Two-dimensional art of all these groups, however, is much more closely related than is their sculpture, especially among the northern tribes of Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and Bella Bella.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Bill. Northwest Coast Indian Art: An analysis of Form. Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum Monograph No. 1. Douglas &amp; McIntyre. Vancouver/Toronto. 1965. p. 20. {{ISBN|0-88894-172-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Textile arts from the Northwest Coast include [[Chilkat weaving]], Raven's Tail Weavings, Button Blankets, and elaborate ceremonial regalia using a range of materials. Three dimension art was created from many materials, notably wood.

== History ==
Prior to contact with Europeans, First Nations on the Northwest coast evolved complex social and ceremonial institutions, including the [[potlatch]] system, hereditary systems of rank and descent, ceremonial societies, and permanent villages. Social organization involved groups of kin, reckoned variously matrilineally, patrilineally or bi-lineally. These groups hold various tangible and intangible rights and properties. Among them are origin stories. Many instances of Northwest coast art are visual references to these stories. 

After European contact, in the late 18th century, the peoples who produced Northwest Coast art suffered huge population losses due to diseases such as smallpox, and cultural losses due to colonization and assimilation into European-North [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].  The production of their art dropped drastically as well.

Toward the end of the 19th century, Northwest Coast artists began producing work for commercial sale, such as small [[argillite]] carvings.  The end of the 19th century also saw large-scale export of totem poles, masks and other [[Painting|traditional art]] objects from the region to museums and private collectors around the world.  Some of this export was accompanied by financial compensation to people who had a right to sell the art, and some was not.

In the early 20th century, very few First Nations artists in the Northwest Coast region were producing art.  A tenuous link to older traditions remained in artists such as Charles Gladstone, Henry Speck, Ellen Neel, Stanley George, and [[Mungo Martin]].  The mid-20th century saw a revival of interest and production of Northwest Coast art, due to the influence of historians, artists and critics including [[Bill Reid]], a grandson of Charles Gladstone and [[Bill Holm (art historian)|Bill Holm]]. A revival of traditional ceremonial ways also drove the increased production of traditional arts. This time also saw an increasing demand for the return of art objects that were illegally or immorally taken from First Nations communities.  This demand continues to the present day.  Today, there are numerous art schools teaching formal Northwest Coast art of various styles, and there is a growing market for new art in this style.&lt;ref name="Jack2"&gt;Jonathan Meuli. Shadow House: Interpretations of Northwest Coast Art {{ISBN|90-5823-083-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival of ceremonial life, following the lifting of the potlatch ban - have also driven production of traditional clothing, painting and carving for use in ceremonies.

== Cultural appropriateness ==
[[File:Tommy joseph tlingit.jpg|thumb|180px|Tommy Joseph, Tlingit woodcarver and sculptor from [[Sitka, Alaska]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskanativeartists.com/tommy_joseph.htm "Tommy Joseph."] ''Alaska Native Artists.'' (retrieved 27 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Juneau city-hall mural.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This mural on the front of the [[City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska|Juneau, Alaska]], city hall shows a scene from Northwest Coast mythology.]] --&gt;

Although neighbouring peoples such as the [[Coast Salish peoples]] also traditionally produced art which shares some characteristics of Northwest Coast art, these styles of art are not usually included in the term, since the patterns and artifacts produced are rather different.  For example, Salish peoples traditionally created standing welcome figures not created by other Northwest Coast peoples, did not traditionally create totem poles, and did not traditionally use the form lines and shapes of other Northwest Coast peoples.&lt;ref name="Gill1"&gt;Hilary Stewart.  ''Looking at Totem Poles''.  Douglas &amp; McIntyre, Vancouver/Toronto, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  One corollary of this fact is that — contrary to popular belief — other than some of the peoples of the [[Olympic Peninsula]], no [[Federally recognized tribes|Native American nations]] of Washington and Oregon states produced totem poles and other characteristic, formline, Northwest Coast-style art objects before European contact.&lt;ref name="Hill1"&gt;Hilary Stewart,''Looking at Indian Art of the Northwest Coast''.  Douglas &amp; McIntyre, Vancouver/Toronto, 19795&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, within a given community, some patterns and motifs could be used only by certain families and lineages, or with the agreement of those families and lineages.  Today, in [[British Columbia]], it is a point of contention whether only [[First Nations]] artists of the appropriate nation have the moral right to produce art of given types and using given motifs, or whether only the intent of the person and the respect given to the respective peoples are significant. Likewise, in Ontario, similar controversies have arisen over whether non-Native artists have the moral right to make use of Native motifs and visual art styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nasser |first1=Shanifa |title=Toronto gallery cancels show after concerns artist 'bastardizes' Indigenous art |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-gallery-indigenous-art-cancels-amandapl-1.4091529 |website=CBC |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-Native artists, such as John Livingston, have been adopted into First Nations and have thus formally acquired the right to produce such art.&lt;ref name="Bill1"/&gt;  In some nations, such as the Haida, adoptions are seen by some only as gestures, and production of work in their trademark style by outsiders may, in some contexts, be viewed as economic and cultural appropriation.

==Notable art historians and thinkers==
Notable academics and publishers of northwest Northwest Coast include [[Bill Holm (art historian)|Bill Holm]], [[Bill Reid]], [[Hilary Stewart]], Bill McLennan, [[Martha Black (art historian)|Martha Black]], and [[George F. MacDonald]]. [[Doreen Jensen]] and Polly Sargent's book ''Robes of Power'' (1986) deals with ceremonial robes - called [[Button blanket]] - and their history and forms. Cheryl Samuel and her book ''The Raven's Tail'' (1987) describes northern weaving style known as Raven's Tail - used to make ceremonial robes and other regalia. 

[[Emily Carr]], though she did not formally adopt the techniques, commonly used native art as the motif of many of her early paintings.

'''Opera management''' is the management of the processes by which [[opera]] is delivered to audiences. A multifaceted task, it involves managing an opera company, primarily the singers and musicians who perform the operas, but in many cases also managing the [[opera house]] in which the company performs. 

Opera is a complex art form involving high fixed costs and requiring complex management. In addition to the singers and musicians who form the core of the company its production requires scenery and costumes and sometimes dancers and non-singing actors. Fixed costs in today's opera organizations—keeping many of the singers and musicians on year-round contracts, and if managing their own theatre, the cost of workers needed to create and maintain the sets and costumes as well as the cost of maintaining and running the building—combined with the costs of individual productions, make opera the most expensive of the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Towse, Ruth (2011).  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eyXQbYAXCBQC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MW7ZT8myMIrE0QX62-n8Aw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "Opera and Ballet"], p. 313 in Ruth Towse (ed.) ''A Handbook of Cultural Economics''. Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|1848448872}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in the 19th century when opera was largely run by individual [[impresario]]s rather than large organisations, opera management as a profession was characterised as "a devouror of the fortunes of the victims it has tempted by its seductions".&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader'' (6 August 1864). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?pg=PA175&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;ei=GULbT8PqK82r8AO-zK3JCw&amp;id=ToBNAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "The Opera Season at Covent Garden"], p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Gye]], who turned the [[Royal Italian Opera]] in Covent Garden into one of London's premiere opera houses in the 19th century and who shaped the careers of many famous singers, described opera management as a "dreadful business".&lt;ref&gt;Dideriksen, Gabriella and Ringel, Matthew (1995). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/746717 "Frederick Gye and 'The Dreadful Business of Opera Management'"], ''19th-Century Music'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (Summer, 1995), pp. 3-30. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venice and the development of opera as a business==
The [[origins of opera|earliest operas]] were privately performed and financed by the noble families who commissioned them, often to mark great court occasions. One such example was [[Marco da Gagliano]]'s ''[[La Flora]]'',  performed in 1628 at the Medici Palace in Florence to celebrate the marriage of [[Margherita de' Medici]] and  [[Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma]]. [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena]], the wife of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo II de' Medici]] and the mother of the bride, took an active role in the planning of the production. She secured the services of the musicians and singers, attended the rehearsals, and according to musicologist Kelley Harness, may well have contributed to the development of the plot as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harness, Kelley Ann (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfj1sn6m_XoC&amp;q=%22La+Flora%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22La%20Flora%22&amp;f=false ''Echoes of Women's Voices: Music, Art, and Female Patronage in Early Modern Florence''], p. 175. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226316599}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Publicly performed operas first appeared in [[Venice]] during the [[Carnival|Carnival season]] of 1637. This was facilitated by the large number of public theatres already present in the city which originally served for the production of plays. They were built by noble families such as the [[Grimani]], [[Nicolò Tron|Tron]],  and [[Vendramin]]. The rebuilt [[Teatro San Cassiano]], sponsored by the Tron family, was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. Performances of ''L'Andromeda'' in 1637 by librettist [[Benedetto Ferrari]] and composer [[Francesco Manelli]] marked the theatre's first commercially produced opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ringer, Mark (2006). ''Opera's First Master: The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi'', pp. 130-131. Amadeus Press. {{ISBN|1574671103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of cases the [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Venetian owners  profited from their theatres by renting them out to others who produced and managed the opera performances. The key figure in the actual production of the operas was the impresario, who assembled the singers, musicians and creative team and made the business and artistic decisions. Sometimes the impresarios were hired by the theatre renters and their backers. On other occasions the impresario was also one of the investors and the renter of the theatre. The ''cassier'' (cashier) was in charge the financial side of the production, including handling the payments and receipts. While the ''cassier'' was sometimes a separate member of the management team, in many instances the impresario also acted as the ''cassier''.&lt;ref&gt;Glixon, Beth Lise and Glixon, Jonathan Emmanuel (2006). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nP5zEo5K7a8C&amp;q=managers#v=snippet&amp;q=managers&amp;f=false ''Inventing the Business of Opera: The Impresario and His World in Seventeenth-Century Venice''], p. 4. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195154169}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous impresarios of the day was [[Marco Faustini]] who managed several Venetian opera houses in the course of his career.

The '''''Oscar Wilde Memorial Sculpture''''' is a collection of three statues in [[Merrion Square]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland, commemorating Irish poet and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. The sculptures were unveiled in 1997 and were designed and made by [[Danny Osborne]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/DublinArtInParks/English |title=Oscar Wilde Memorial Sculpture |publisher=Dublin City Council |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Statue of Oscar Wilde and companion pieces.jpg|right|thumb|Statue and companion pieces]]

English sculptor Danny Osborne was commissioned by the [[Guinness Brewery|Guinness Ireland Group]] to create a statue commemorating Oscar Wilde, which was unveiled in 1997, by Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4042930/Sculpting_Irishness_A_Discussion_of_Dublins_Commemorative_Statues_of_Oscar_Wilde_and_Phil_Lynott|title=Sculpting Irishness: a discussion of Dublin&amp;#39;s commemorative statues of Oscar Wilde and Phil Lynott |first=Smith |last=Sarah|publisher=|journal=Sculpture Journal|volume=21|year=2012|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial budget of [[Irish pound|IR£]]20,000 was later increased to IR£45,000.&lt;ref name=it&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18986554.html |title=Chasing ghosts |work=The Sunday Herald |url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[marble]] alone was deemed inadequate, the statue was formed from different coloured stones from three continents.&lt;ref name=jj /&gt; The torso is of green [[nephrite jade]] from [[British Columbia]], Canada, and pink [[thulite]] from Norway.&lt;ref name=trin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trinitynews.ie/the-surprising-geology-of-dublins-oscar-wilde-statue/ |title=The surprising geology of Dublin’s Oscar Wilde statue |publisher=Trinity News |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legs are of Norwegian [[granite|Blue Pearl granite]] with the shoes being black Indian [[charnockite]] and finished with bronze shoelace tips.&lt;ref name=trin /&gt; The statue also wears a [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] tie made from glazed [[porcelain]], and three rings – Wilde's wedding ring and two [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]]s, one for good luck, the other for bad luck.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

The statue is mounted with Wilde reclining on a large [[quartz]] boulder obtained by Osborne himself from the [[Wicklow Mountains]].&lt;ref name=trin /&gt; The sculpture also includes two pillars flanking the boulder with one pillar having a nude pregnant representation of Wilde's wife [[Constance Lloyd]] on top. The other one has a male torso representing [[Dionysus]], the Greek God of drama and wine, atop it. Both flanking sculptures are in [[bronze]] and [[granite]],&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; and both pillars have inscriptions from Wilde's poems carved onto them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoff |last=Wallis |title=The Rough Guide to Dublin |page=61 |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2002 |isbn=1858289130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions of the quotes copy
the personal handwriting of figures including [[Seamus Heaney]], [[John B. Keane]] and [[Michael D. Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content/RecreationandCulture/DublinCityParks/Documents/ArtinParksFinalPDF.pdf|title=Art in Parks|publisher=Dublin City Council|date=2014|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people, living at the time near to the artist's West Cork studio, posed as models for the three sculptures.

When the statue was unveiled in 1997, it was the first statue commemorating Wilde, who had died 97 years earlier. It received near unanimous praise for the materials used and for its location near his childhood home at 1, [[Merrion Square]].&lt;ref name=it /&gt; In 2010, the porcelain head of Wilde had to be replaced because cracks were forming on it. The porcelain head was replaced by a new one made of white [[jadeite]].&lt;ref name=jj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-26354523.html |title=A geological odyssey for Oscar as Wilde gets a new jade head |work=The Irish Times |url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact and significance ==
In a May 2001 article in the Irish edition of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Mark Keenan commented on the surprisingly long wait for a commemoration of Wilde in his native city and suggested an explanation for the delay, "... a decade ago, more conservative elements among the Dublin public may not have dared allow his city to commemorate his name."&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, Mark, "Take a walk on the Wildeside of Merrion Square", ''[[The Sunday Times]] (Irish edition), 20 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Paula Murphy agreed, saying, "It has taken nearly one hundred years for an Irish body, public or private, to risk suggesting that we might consider Oscar Wilde worthy of such commemoration. But then it has taken the same length of time for Ireland to awaken, reluctantly, to the existence of sexuality and the reality of the way in which it dictates a lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Paula. "The Quare on the Square: a statue of Oscar Wilde for Dublin", in Jerusha McCormack (ed), 1998. ''Wilde the Irishman'', New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; It took as long for London, where Wilde spent most of his adult life, to commemorate the dramatist: [[Maggi Hambling]]'s ''[[A Conversation with Oscar Wilde]]'' was unveiled in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London's Wilde tribute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/224663.stm|accessdate=20 May 2018|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=November 30, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the work in her 2012 article "Sculpting Irishness: a discussion of Dublin&amp;#39;s commemorative statues of Oscar Wilde and Phil Lynott" for ''Sculpture Journal'', Sarah Smith writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another distinction is the figure's facial expression, which, disrupting the realism of the figure, might be described as a rather contorted sneer. Intended by the artist to represent two antithetical sides of Wilde, one half of his face is smiling widely ... while the other bears a sombre expression ... and this divide is echoed in his posture on either side. Because of its positioning at the corner of the park on the turn of the outer pathway, the visitor to the monument sees one side of Wilde when approaching and another when walking away. One is the witty Wilde who is most often remembered in popular culture, the other the "broken man" he became following his two-year incarceration for committing homosexual acts.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith argues "we cannot help but read this work according to today’s conventions of dress and gesture", saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The choice of pose for Wilde, which invokes familiar art historical and popular images of 'feminized masculinity', the use of colour for this ‘colourful character’ and his gaze directed at the nude male torso all coalesce with our knowledge of his homosexuality. We consequently see an overemphasis on his sexuality in this work, augmented by the nicknames given to it by Dubliners.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17883">'''Postinternet''' denotes an idea in arts and criticism that refers to society and modes of interaction following the widespread adoption of the internet. The term emerged from discussions about [[Internet Art]] by [[Marisa Olson]], Gene McHugh, and Artie Vierkant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/nov/1/postinternet/ What's Postinternet Got to do with Net Art?], Rhizome, Michael Connor, November 1st, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie Lonergan and [[Cory Arcangel]] have mentioned it as a term for being "internet aware", which some believe to be more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandra Domanović and Oliver Laric in conversation with Caitlin Jones, page 114 , MASS EFFECT, Art And The Internet In The Twenty First Century&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally it is described as art that is about the internet's effects on aesthetics, culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/post_internet_art What Is Post-Internet Art? Understanding the Revolutionary New Art Movement], Artspace, Ian Wallace
March 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The term “post-internet” refers not to a time 'after' the internet, but rather to an internet state of mind...'', is written on a press release for ''Art Post-Internet,'' an exhibition organized by the [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the term claim that it falsely implies that there is a kind of art made after the internet has ceased to exist (and artists such as [[Rafael Rozendaal]] have criticized the ambiguity of "post-" in this instance).

==History and context==
The idea of art post-internet was born in the wake of [[Internet Art]], which gained significant traction in the early- to mid-2000s. Much like Internet Art, the postinternet art movement has roots in [[Dada]], [[Fluxus]], and exploration of net culture in general. Unlike Internet Art, postinternet art is less heavily influenced, at least in form, by [[telematic art]], being more concerned in commenting on communications technology (the internet) than in being medium-native to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/mar/26/mission-creep/#_ftn4|title=Rhizome - Mission Creep: K-Hole and Trend Forecasting as Creative Practice|work=rhizome.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works created within the postinternet paradigm often shares the aesthetics of the [[Internet Art]], [[net.art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artfcity.com/2014/10/14/finally-a-semi-definitive-definition-of-post-internet-art/|title=Finally, a Semi-Definitive Definition of Post-Internet Art|work=Art F City}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DataDada Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datadada.net/en/|title=DataDada|work=datadada.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs in that it does not use the internet only as a tool to produce art, but addresses the internet as a force that has altered social structures in both digital and physical spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newrafael.com/post-internet-art/|title=Rafaël Rozendaal  -   Post internet art|work=newrafael.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postinternet art is not necessarily art produced on the internet, but art that reflects the internet and the internet's effects on culture and society.

Postinternet art has gained some attention because of [[Petra Cortright]]'s work, ''BRIDAL SHOWER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkFibbxeHw|title=BRIDAL SHOWER|date=9 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://totallystockholm.se/arts-culture/post-internet-art-petra-cortright/|title = Post-internet Art with Petra Cortright|work = Totally Stockholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notably also [[Katja Novitskova]]'s work, ''Post Internet Survival Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katjanovi.net/postinternetsurvivalguide.html|title=POST INTERNET SURVIVAL GUIDE 2010|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Postinternet art by [[Harm van den Dorpel]] has been covered on the Creators Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/harm-van-den-dorpels-post-internet-art/|title = Navigating the Complexity of Harm van den Dorpel’s Post-Internet Art|work = Creators Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner]] described their collaborative practice as "partly a response to how post-internet artists were using social media to promote their work and how that promotion became the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shia LaBeouf art show collaborators speak out about his alleged rape|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/30/shia-labeouf-collaborators-turner-ronkko-speak-alleged-rape-iamsorry-art-show|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-04-22|first = David|last = Batty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have also applied the ideas of postinternet art in discussions of the use of the internet by some contemporary British and American poets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2015-07-03|title=THIS HAS BEEN A BLUE/GREEN MESSAGE EXITING THE SOCIAL WORLD|url=|journal=The Poetry Review|volume=105|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance [[Steve Roggenbuck]], [[Sam Riviere]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabotagereviews.com/2013/11/26/kim-kardashians-marriage-by-sam-riviere/|title=Kim Kardashian’s Marriage by Sam Riviere|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2013-11-26|website=Sabotage|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/17627-sam-riviere-kim-kardashians-marriage-poetry-review-post-flarf-google|title=Positivity As Tension: On Kim Kardashian's Marriage|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2015-04-26|website=The Quietus|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Zultanski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/post-internet-poetry-comes-of-age|title=Post-Internet Poetry Comes of Age|last=Kenneth|first=Goldsmith|date=2015-03-10|website=The New Yorker|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encompassing work otherwise frequently grouped under [[Alt lit]], [[flarf]] or [[conceptual poetry]], postinternet poetry articulates the ubiquity of the experience of internet and social media usage among poets, similar to the ideas in visual art described above, such that the internet touches all elements of a poem's composition and distribution without necessarily being an explicit focus of the work itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2015-07-03|title=THIS HAS BEEN A BLUE/GREEN MESSAGE EXITING THE SOCIAL WORLD|url=|journal=The Poetry Review|volume=105|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the conceptual poet [[Kenneth Goldsmith]] remarks in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', a postinternet poem "seems to view the Internet with a shrug".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/post-internet-poetry-comes-of-age|title=Post-Internet Poetry Comes of Age|last=Kenneth|first=Goldsmith|date=2015-03-10|website=The New Yorker|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and philosophy==
Postinternet art has been criticized as being art ''about'' the internet, rather than art ''of'' the internet, in the manner of Net Art. In doing so, postinternet art loses many of the structural benefits of Net Art, namely that postinternet art exists through the institution of physical galleries. While Net Art sought to redefine a space for its work, postinternet art is more rooted in an older, traditional notion of the role of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/arts/international/post-internet-art-waits-its-turn.html|title=Post-Internet Art Waits Its Turn|date=29 September 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis of postinternet art is often characterized as a question of how the inherently intangible and democratized work resulting from internet content-creation paradigms can be monetized, and in this sense postinternet art is sometimes negatively described as the image of network-native art repackaged for the gallery or for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/mar/26/mission-creep/|title=Rhizome - Mission Creep: K-Hole and Trend Forecasting as Creative Practice|work=rhizome.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, it has also been proposed that postinternet is more like a condition for art making and critical thinking. Since the internet is no longer an option but a necessity in our society, one must also be critically aware of the internet's impact on society when making art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantmag.com/youll-know-it-when-you-see-it/|title=Post-Internet Art: You'll Know It When You See It - ELEPHANT|work=ELEPHANT|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also clearly stated by Marisa Olson in an interview with "''we make money not art"-'' blogger Regine Debatty;

''"There doesn't seem to be a need to distinguish, any more, whether technology was used in making the work - after all, everything is a technology, and everyone uses technology to do everything. What is even more interesting is the way in which people are starting to make what I've called "post-internet" art in my own work (such as my'' Monitor Tracings''), or what Guthrie Lonergan recently called "''Internet Aware Art"''. I think it's important to address the impacts of the internet on culture at large, and this can be done well on networks but can and should also exist offline. Of course, it's an exciting challenge to explain to someone how this is still internet art.... If that really matters".''&lt;ref&gt;Regine Debatty, "interview with Marisa Olson", we make money not art, March 28, 2008, http://we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2008/03/how-does-one-become-marisa.php.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it has been proposed by Stefan Heidenreich in discussions with students at ''[[The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]]'' during his lecture, ''Networks and Objects: On Postinternet, Speculative Realism, Media- or Network Theory and related artistic practises,'' that the strength of the postinternet term comes from it being undefinable or at least  very difficult to define.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/freeportism-as-style-and-ideology-part-i-post-internet-and-speculative-realism/|title=Freeportism as Style and Ideology: Post-Internet and Speculative Realism, Part I|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Paul Kneale]] discusses post internet in an interview with [[i-D]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/vbdv9x/canadian-artist-paul-kneale-says-post-internet-is-dead|title=Freeportism as Style and Ideology: Post-Internet and Speculative Realism, Part I|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview entitled 'Canadian Artist Paul Kneale Says Post Internet is Dead', Kneale rephrases the term calling it 'Post-Art Internet.' He uses this to highlight that categorising art in terms of the period it belongs to has lost its validity in the new age of internet. He states: 

″The thing we call 'art' is a historical period, like ancient art — it has a vague beginning point that makes it a period, and also an end, which is usually marked by a major changes in other areas of life. Quite possibly we've just witnessed this end. The thing that we call 'Internet' is a whole way of being in the world. It's the Internet you know from your browser window, but also the Internet of things and materials, and also the internet of minds, of tastes and feelings. After this passing historical period 'Art', you have this new period 'Internet'. So it makes sense to ask, what does that change mean for aesthetics? How do we present and represent in this new period?″

The '''''Principia Discordia''''' is a [[Discordianism|Discordian]] [[religious text]] written by Greg Hill ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). The first edition was printed using [[Jim Garrison]]'s Xerox printer in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Robert Anton|title=Cosmic Trigger I: Final Secret of the Illuminati|date=1992|publisher=New Falcon Publications|location=Scottsdale, AZ|isbn=978-1561840038|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was published under the title ''Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost'' in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The phrase ''Principia Discordia'', reminiscent of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', is presumably intended to mean ''Discordant Principles'', or ''Principles of Discordance''.

The ''Principia'' describes the Discordian Society and its Goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], as well as the basics of the [[POEE]] [[religious denomination|denomination]] of Discordianism. It features typewritten and handwritten text intermixed with clip art, stamps, and seals appropriated from other sources.

While the ''Principia'' is full of literal contradictions and unusual [[humor]], it contains several passages which propose that there is serious intent behind the work, for example a message scrawled on page 00075: "If you think the PRINCIPIA is just a ha-ha, then go read it again."

The ''Principia'' is quoted extensively in and shares many themes with the satirical [[science fiction]] book ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson was not directly involved in writing the Principia.
[[File:Little_Apple_of_Eris_colour.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Golden Apple, symbol of Eris, Our Lady of Discord]]
Notable symbols in the book include the [[Apple of Discord]], the [[pentagon]], and the "Sacred Chao", which resembles the [[Taijitu]] of [[Taoism]], but the two principles depicted are "Hodge" and "Podge" rather than [[yin and yang]], and they are represented by the apple and the pentagon, and not by dots. Saints identified include [[Emperor Norton]], [[Yossarian]], [[Don Quixote]], and [[Bokononism|Bokonon]].  The ''Principia'' also introduces the mysterious word "[[fnord]]", later popularized in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''; the trilogy itself is mentioned in the afterword to the [[Loompanics]] edition, and in the various introductions to the fifth editions.

==Overview==
[[File:Poee_symbol.jpg|alt=POEE stands for Paratheo-metamystikhood of Eris Esoteric|right|thumb|100px|POEE Symbol]]
The ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic Principle (order), the Eristic Principle (disorder) and the notion that both are mere illusions. The following excerpt summarizes these principles:{{quote|The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.

With our concept-making apparatus called "the brain" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.
The ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently.

It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.
We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.

Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.

Disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.

The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.
The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.

Reality is the original Rorschach. Verily! So much for all that.

—Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Pages 00049–00050}}

==History==
[[File:Sacred_Chao_2.jpg|alt=showing the Hodge and Podge in dynamic tension|right|thumb|100px|The Sacred Chao]]
The ''Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost'' was first published in a limited edition of five copies and released into the [[public domain]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=Publisher alters, then copyrights Principia Discordia|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/01/publisher-alters-the.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full title of the fourth and most well-known edition is ''Principia Discordia or How I Found Goddess And What I Did To Her When I Found Her: The Magnum Opiate Of Malaclypse The Younger, Wherein is Explained Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing About Absolutely Anything''.Included on page 00075 is the following note about the history of the ''Principia'':
:''This being the 4th Edition, March 1970, San Francisco; a revision of the 3rd Edition of 500 copies, whomped together in Tampa 1969; which revised the 2nd Edition of 100 copies from Los Angeles 1969; which was a revision of ''PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST'' published in New Orleans in 1965 in five copies, which were mostly lost.''

Additionally, the "contents of this edition" note in the Loompanics edition identifies the fourth edition as having originally been published by [[Rip Off Press]] of [[San Francisco, California]].

A "Fifth Edition" consisting of a single Western Union telegram page filled with the letter M was published as an appendix to the Loompanics and SJ Games re-printings of the 4th Edition.

In 1978, a copy of a work from Kerry Thornley titled "THE PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST" was placed in the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations|HSCA JFK]] collections as document 010857.&lt;ref&gt; The record identifier can be found by searching for Thornley and Discordian on [http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=jfksnew.txt&amp;id=demo&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK nara.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917155729/http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=jfksnew.txt&amp;id=demo&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK |date=2008-09-17 }}. {{cite web|title=Kennedy Assassination Collection: Discordian Socity [sic]|url=http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/5234/jfksnew.txt|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105233622/http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/5234/jfksnew.txt|archivedate=5 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Gorightly, author of ''The Prankster and the Conspiracy'' about Kerry Thornley and the early Discordians, said the copy in the JFK collection was not a copy of the first edition but a later and altered version containing some of the original material.  In an interview with researcher Brenton Clutterbuck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Wikinews interviews Brenton Clutterbuck| url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Brenton_Clutterbuck| publisher=Wikinews |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gorightly said he had been given Greg Hill's copy of the first edition.

== Mythology ==
In [[Discordianism|Discordian]] mythology, '''Aneris''' is described as the sister of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] aka Discordia. Whereas Eris/Discordia is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, Aneris/[[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] is the Goddess of Order and Non-Being.

"DOGMA III – HISTORY 32, 'COSMOGONY'" in ''Principia Discordia'', states

:In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the smaller) was that of BEING, named &lt;u&gt;ERIS&lt;/u&gt;, and one (the larger) was of NON-BEING, named &lt;u&gt;ANERIS&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/63.php |title=Page 56 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris (who was born pregnant), and starts making existent things non-existent. This explains why life begins, and later ends in death.

:''And to this day, things appear and disappear in this very manner.''&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia" /&gt;

The names of Eris and Aneris (who are later given a brother, ''Spirituality''), are used to show some fundamental Discordian principles in "Psycho-Metaphysics":

:The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made &lt;u&gt;concepts&lt;/u&gt; and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_metaphysics.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027092923/http://geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_metaphysics.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts''' ({{lang-sl|Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti}} (SAZU){{#tag:ref|Also occasionally abbreviated SASA in some English publications.|group=Note}}) is the [[national academy]] of [[Slovenia]], which encompasses [[science]] and [[the arts]] and brings together the top Slovene [[researcher]]s and [[artist]]s as members of the [[academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sazu.si/en/o-sazu.html | title = About SASA | date = 3 April 2011 | publisher = SASA - Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Established in 1938, the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts (SAZU) is the supreme national institution for science and the arts. It associates scientists and artists who have been elected as its members for their outstanding achievements in the field of sciences and arts. It cultivates, encourages and promotes sciences and arts and, through its activities, contributes to the development of scientific thought and creativity in the arts, particularly by: addressing basic issues of sciences and arts; participating in establishing the policies of research activities and creativity in arts; giving appraisals, proposals and opinions on the position, development and promotion of sciences and arts and on the organisation of research activities and creativity in the arts; organising research work, also in co-operation with universities and other research institutions, particularly in the fields which are important for the awareness of and gaining insight into the natural and cultural heritage of the Slovene nation and for the development of its language and culture; and developing international co-operation in the field of sciences and arts.

==Leadership==
The president ([[acting president]] currently {{Interlanguage link multi|Tadej Bajd|sl}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sazu.si/o-sazu.html "O SAZU"] {{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two vice-presidents, the secretary general and the secretaries of its various sections are elected for a period of three years with the possibility of one further re-election. SAZU can have a maximum of 60 full and 30 associate members; at present it has 84 full and 10 associate members. It can also have a maximum of 90 corresponding members from scientific institutions abroad; at present it has 85 such members.

SAZU is active in different fields of research, as reflected in the corresponding six sections of the Academy: The Section of Historical and Social Sciences has 11 full members, three associate members and 19 corresponding members, and comprises two subsections, Historical Sciences and Social Sciences. The Section of Philological and Literary Sciences has 15 full members, two associate members and 16 corresponding members. The Section of Mathematical, Physical, Chemical and Technical Sciences has 15 full members, four associate members and 17 corresponding members and comprises two subsections, Mathematical, Physical and Chemical Sciences and Technical Sciences. The Section of Natural Sciences has 12 full members, two associate members and eight corresponding members. The Section of Medical Sciences has nine full members, two associate members and 11 corresponding members. And the Section of Arts has 12 full members, six associate members and 14 corresponding members.

SAZU has founded 17 important research institutes from the fields of the humanities and natural sciences, each of which functions an autonomous research organisation, yet falls under the overall management of the Academy's Research Centre (ZRC SAZU).

SAZU also has several special units, including the Department for International Relations and Scientific Co-ordination is headed by a full member of SAZU and the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts (SAZU) Library, the third largest library in Slovenia, which regularly exchanges publications with scientific institutions all over the world.

==History==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
SAZU was established in 1938 and was initially named ''Academy of Sciences and Arts'' (AZU). On 23 January 1943, AZU breached the [[cultural silence]].&lt;ref name="Casnik2011-01-23"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.casnik.si/index.php/2011/01/23/akademija-znanosti-in-umetnosti-krsila-kulturni-molk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019152219/http://www.casnik.si/index.php/2011/01/23/akademija-znanosti-in-umetnosti-krsila-kulturni-molk/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2011 |title=Akademija znanosti in umetnosti kršila kulturni molk |trans-title=The Academy of Sciences and Arts Has Breached the Cultural Silence |date=23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the efforts of [[Milan Vidmar]], the epithet ''Slovenian'' was added to its name in 1943 with a decree by [[Leon Rupnik]], the mayor of Ljubljana under the [[Province of Ljubljana|Italian annexation]].&lt;ref name="STA521405"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=s&amp;id=521405 |title=Mednarodni simpozij v spomin na literarnega zgodovinarja dr. Franceta Kidriča (EMBARGO DO 18. URE) |date=27 October 2000 |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111042805/http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=s&amp;id=521405 |archivedate=11 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renaming was disregarded after the war. 

In autumn 1945, the [[National Government of Slovenia]] led by [[Boris Kidrič]] took autonomy from the Academy and again named it Academy of Sciences and Arts. The literary historian [[France Kidrič]] was elected its president, and confirmed for the second term in 1948. In 1948, it lost even more autonomy and was renamed to the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts again. The academy lost its members with the new act and 30 days later ceased to exist.&lt;ref name="STA521405" /&gt; In 1949, an amendment to the act was passed that allowed for membership not only of scientists and artists, but also of those the deeds of which had a "special significance". In this manner, [[Josip Broz Tito|Josip Broz - Tito]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]] became its honorary members. [[Boris Kidrič]], [[Josip Vidmar]] and [[Boris Ziherl]] were elected members, which significantly influenced the development of the Academy.&lt;ref name="STA521405" /&gt;

According to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scheme of development, the Institute of Physics and the Institute of Chemistry were established in 1946, followed by the Institute of Electrical Economics four years later. Despite this, humanistics, social sciences and classical natural history remained the dominating fields.&lt;ref name="STA521405" /&gt; In 1950, there were ten institutes, one board and one committee, among them the Institute of Slovene language and the Institute of Literatures. In this time, the Academy divided into five classes: a class for historical and social sciences, a class for [[philology|philological]] and literary sciences, a class for mathematical-physical and technical sciences, a class for natural history and medicine, and a class for arts. This make its composition similar to the current one.&lt;ref name="STA521405" /&gt;

SAZU joined the European Scientific Foundation in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.culture.si/en/Slovene_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Arts_%28SAZU%29 | title = Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts (SAZU) | date = 3 April 2011 | publisher = Culture.si}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two '''Taşçı reliefs''' are [[rock relief]]s from the time of the [[Hittite empire]]. They are two kilometres south of {{ill|Taşçı, Develi|lt=Taşçı|tr}} in [[Develi]] district, [[Kayseri Province]], Turkey. They are known in Turkish as ''Yazılı Kaya'' ("Inscribed cliffs").  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
At Taşçı the Zamantı Irmağı river is met by the Şamaz Dere river (also known as the Homur Suyu), which has its source at Bakırdağ to the south. At this spot the river passes through a narrow gorge with steep cliffs on either side; the two reliefs known as Taşçı A and B are on the left bank, les than a hundred metres apart. No travel route can have passed through the gorge at the time when the reliefs were created, since the creation of the modern road required advanced stone blasting work. This, the location by the water, and the presence of caves above the reliefs suggests the site had a ritual function.

== Taşçı A ==
[[File:Tasci6.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Setting of Taşçı A from the opposite bank]]
[[File:Tasci1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Detail of Taşçı A: the three figures and the inscription]]
The north relief, Taşçı A, lies near the bank, about two metres above the water level, and now rises less than a metre above the soil which has built up around about. On the right hand side, it shows three robed figures facing right, who are covered by soil up to their hips. Their outlines are marked with depp grooves. The left figure is the best preserved - he is the only one where internal details can be made out. Ribbons run over their heads, a cloth hangs over their backs; from these details the figure appears to be female. Her eyes and chin are still visible, the nose and mouth area is broken. The two left figures each extend an arm; according to the 1939 sketch by [[Ignace Gelb]], the right figure had the same posture, but this cannot be seen any more on account of heavy weathering. The central and right figures, who wear round caps, are only visible as silhouettes. All three figures are generally interpreted as priests.

Above the heads are inscriptions in [[Luwian hieroglyphs]]; the symbols on the left can be grouped together, while the symbols on the right are not preserved. Their poor condition makes them difficult to read. Only the name of the left, female figure can be read, as "Ma-na-a-za/i". She is further identified as the "daughter of Lubakkis, the son of the military scribe." Another group of hieroglyphs are located to the left of the three figures, which name another person - [[John David Hawkins]] reads "Bodyguard Zida, servant of [[Hattusili III|Hattusili]], the Great King, the hero." This Zida is not depicted, but he is probably the creator of the relief.

== Taşçı B ==
[[File:Tasci5.jpg|thumb|vertical|Setting of Taşçı B on the west bank]]
[[File:Tasci4.jpg|thumb|vertical|Taşçı B]]
Less than 100 metres upstream is Taşçı B on a boulder which is right on the bank and is covered by water when the water level is high. The relief depicts a male figure facing right. He wears a round cap with a horn, the long robes of a priest and a stole which hangs over his shoulders. His right hand is held in pose of greeting, his left is stretched out. A holy symbol which is reserved for actual gods can be seen above. Three hieroglyphs below his arms have been read in differing ways by different researcher, but his name cannot be made out.

== Interpretation ==
There is a cave in the cliff-face above Taşçı A, from which a shaft descends vertically. It is now filled with soil, but it probably reached the water level. There is also a cave in the cliff face behind Taşçı B, with a similar shaft. The two caves and the location of the reliefs by the water suggest that the place had a ritual function. The orientation of the priestly figure upstream, in the direction of the fields at water level suggests that they performed a protective role for the surrounding area and for a (presumed) settlement in the area.

The reliefs are dated to around the 13th century BC by their inscriptions.

== Research history ==
A short description and first reading of Taşçı A were published by Hans Rott and [[Leopold Messerschmidt]] after Rott's visit to Anatloia in 1906. [[Guillaume de Jerphanion]] produced another account in the same year. [[Ignace Gelb]] uncovered the lower part of the relief in 1935 and published a sketch and a photograph. Taşçı B was first described by [[Sedat Alp]] and [[Ekrem Akurgal]] in 1947. Subsequently, [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]] visited the place in 1954. The first published account of both reliefs was produced by [[Piero Meriggi]] in 1975, after his first trip to Anatolia. His understanding of the inscriptions agreed closely with that of Gelb, unlike the work of [[Franz Steinherr]] published in the same year. The latter was followed by [[Markus Wäfler]]. Another account was published by [[Kay Kohlmeyer]] in 1983 and finally [[Horst Ehringhaus]] published a description in 2003.

[[Image:Ten American Painters (The Ten).jpg|thumb|right|The Ten in 1908]]

'''The Ten American Painters''' (also known as '''The Ten''') was an artists' group formed in 1898 to exhibit their work as a unified group. [[John Henry Twachtman]], [[J. Alden Weir]], and [[Childe Hassam]] were the driving forces behind the organization. Dissatisfied with the conservatism of the American art establishment, the three artists recruited seven others from Boston, New York City, and elsewhere on the East Coast, with the intention of creating an exhibition society that valued their view of originality, imagination, and exhibition quality. The Ten achieved popular and critical success,&lt;ref&gt;“Ten American Painters: The First Exhibition, Catalogue of the Pictures, from the Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Dewing Family Papers - Image and Media Gallery | Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.” Accessed September 16, 2015. http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/items/detail/ten-american-painters-first-exhibition-catalogue-pictures-14281.&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted two decades before dissolving.

==Foundation==
In America, popular painting styles usually originated on the east coast in cities like New York and Boston. The Ten continued a tradition of artists forming new groups  in reaction to a lack of support from existing artists' groups. Thus, the [[National Academy of Design]] (founded in 1825 by students dissatisfied by the conservatism of the older [[American Academy of the Fine Arts]]) eventually became too conservative to suit the artists who in 1877 initiated the [[Society of American Artists]] so they could meet and exhibit their work as a collective. The Ten American Painters was born from this group in 1898, when Twachtman, Weir, and Hassam found the Society hostile to the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] style they had adopted. Leaving the group was considered a bold move by the general public, but the Society of American Artists felt that it was easier to let the members that were leaving go than appease them.

==Impressionism==
[[Impressionism]] was a French art movement that emerged in the 1870s, and was picked up by American painters towards the end of the 19th century. Painters like [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]] and [[Auguste Renoir]] are generally considered the masters of the impressionist movement. An Impressionist painting will often use small dabs of color in order to make the painting distinguishable from afar, but indistinguishable from up close.&lt;ref&gt;“Impressionism.” Accessed September 21, 2015. http://www.artmovements.co.uk/impressionism.htm.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The founding members of The Ten were [[Frank Weston Benson|Frank W. Benson]], [[Joseph Rodefer DeCamp]], [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Leroy Metcalf]], [[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]], [[Edward Simmons (painter)|Edward Simmons]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[J. Alden Weir]]. All were former members of the Society of American Artists. [[Winslow Homer]] declined an invitation to join the group; [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] accepted membership but withdrew before the group's first exhibition. After J. H. Twachtman died in 1902, [[William Merritt Chase]] joined in his place. Unanimous approval was required to admit a new member to the society.&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite web|last=Brockett|first=Erik|title=The Ten American Painters|url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=844|publisher=Antiques &amp; Fine Art Magazine|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also decided that there would never be less than ten members active for the group to remain as one. 

For twenty years The Ten exhibited in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and other American cities. After this it dissolved due to death in its ranks and lack of public interest.&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite web|last=Brockett|first=Erik|title=The Ten American Painters|url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=844|publisher=Antiques &amp; Fine Art Magazine|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bee and the Orange Tree''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].

==Synopsis==
After many childless years, a king and queen had a daughter, whom they named Aimée. Unfortunately, a ship she was on, wrecked. As fate would have it, she drifted ashore in her cradle.  There, an [[ogre]] couple found her, and the ogress resolved to raise Aimee, instead of eating her, resolving that the infant would make a good wife for her son when she grew up.  The ogress summoned a hind from the woods to nurse the baby.  After fifteen years, the king and queen gave up hope of locating the princess and the king told his brother to send his best son to be the heir to the throne.  The brother chose his second son.

Meanwhile, Aimee grew up among the ogres.  A little ogre had fallen in love with her, but the thought of marrying him revolted her.  She regularly walked along the shore after storms, to protect things swept ashore from the ogres, and one day she found a man.  She saved the man, who happened to be her cousin, although neither of them knew the truth or could speak each other's language.  She managed to make him understand that he had to hide in a cave.  After some time hiding and feeding him, she wished to show her friendship and gave him a locket she wore.  This had her name on it, and the prince deduced from her looks that she was indeed his cousin, the princess Aimee.

The little ogre decided it was time for them to marry, and horror-struck, Aimee fled to the prince.  When she returned, she injured her foot on a thorn and could no longer walk.  The prince wondered why she did not come, and when he tried to find her, he was captured.

Now, every night, the ogres all put on golden crowns before they went to bed.  The princess snuck in that night, took a crown from the head of a little ogre, and put it on the prince's head.  The ogre woke up, seized on the sleeping little ogre who no longer had a crown, and ate him.  Again the next night, the princess stole a crown from one of the ogres to place on the Prince's head.  This time, the ogress ate the crown-less ogre.

The princess remembered the magic wand that the ogress had used to summon the hind.  With it, she gave herself the power to speak the prince's language.  He told her who she was, and the princess decided to steal the ogres' camel so they could ride away to safety.  She used the wand to enchant a bean to hide their escape.  It spoke whenever the ogress asked anything.  Finally, however, the ogress realized they had fled.  The ogre used his [[seven-league boots]] to follow.

When the ogre caught up, the princess [[Shapeshifting|turned]] herself into a boatwoman, the prince into a boat, and the camel into a lake; to confuse the ogre.  He found nothing, but when he returned, the ogress told him how they had been transformed with her stolen magic wand, and so he set out to find them again.  This time Aimmee turned herself into a dwarf, the prince into a portrait, and the camel into a pillar.  When the ogre reached her, she told an elaborate story about how the prince had fought in a tournament in honor of the lady in the picture.  Confused again, the ogre returned home.

This time the ogress came after them.  The princess turned the prince into an orange tree, herself into a bee, and the camel into a box.  The princess stung the ogress and drove her off, but some travelers carried off the wand.  Without the wand, the Princess was unable to change the group back into their prior forms.

A princess, Linda, loved to walk in the woods where the orange tree stood.  Linda tried to have the tree transplanted into her gardens, Aimee stung Linda out of jealousy.  This caused the prince and princess to quarrel, but they soon reconciled.  When Linda tried again, Aimee stung her again.  Linda tried to arm herself with a branch, but when she did, blood flowed from the tree.  Aimee went to fetch a balm for the wound.

A fairy visited the princess and when she detected the enchantment, the fairy restored the prince.  He told his story, and she restored Aimee as well, and then brought them to her parents, where they married.

'''''The Holy Family with Three Hares''''' is a c. 1496 [[woodcut]] by German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528). It depicts the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Holy Family]] of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[St Joseph|Joseph]], and the [[infant Jesus]], in an [[Hortus conclusus|enclosed garden]], symbolizing Mary's virginity. The infant Jesus is reading from what is very probably a book of scripture, representing his close connection with the Word of God, not only because in Christianity he fulfills the [[Old Testament]] prophecy of a [[messiah]], but also because in some Christian traditions Jesus has been described as the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catholic Church|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|date=2000|publisher=Vatican: Libreria Editrice Vaticana|page=Section 2, Paragraph 1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mays Literary Anthology''''' (or just '''''The Mays''''') is an anthology of new writing by students from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1992, when Peter Ho Davies, Adrian Woolfson, and Ron Dimant came up with the original concept for the ''Mays'', the publication was split into two separate anthologies; one devoted to prose and the other to poetry. In 2003 the ''Mays'' became a single publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX|url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830224605/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the ''Mays'' receives hundreds of submissions from students at Oxford and Cambridge.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 2006 the ''Mays'' received a record 1,100 entries. The Editorial Committee (composed of students from both universities) review the submissions during Lent Term.

''The Mays'' is broader in scope than most university literary projects: it is sold in bookstores and by delivery nationwide; it is distributed to every major literary agent; and each year a guest editor — usually a prominent author, poet, or artist — writes an introduction to the anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX|url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830224605/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 August 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous guest editors include: [[Margaret Drabble]] and [[Jon Stallworthy]] (1992), [[Michael Dibdin]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] (1993), [[Stephen Fry]] (1994), [[Ted Hughes]] (1995), [[Penelope Fitzgerald]] (1996), [[Christopher Reid]] and [[Jill Paton Walsh]] (1997), [[Sebastian Faulks]] and [[J.H. Prynne]] (1998), [[Penelope Lively]] and John Kinsella (1999), [[Paul Muldoon]] and [[Lawrence Norfolk]] (2000), [[Zadie Smith]] and [[Michael Donaghy]] (2001), [[Andrew Motion]] and [[Nick Cave]] (2002), [[Ali Smith]] (2003), [[Philip Pullman]] (2004), Robert Macfarlane (2005), [[Don Paterson]] and [[Jeanette Winterson]] (2006), [[Colm Toibin]] (2007), Ian Patterson (2008), [[Patti Smith]] (2009), [[Amit Chaudhuri]], [[Tom Raworth]] (2010), {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, [[Jarvis Cocker]] (2011), [[John Darnielle]], [[Tao Lin]], [[Toby Litt]] (2012), [[Michael Frayn]], [[David Harsent]], [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]] (2013), [[John Fuller (poet)|John Fuller]], [[Paul Farley]], [[Ben Okri]], [[Prajwal Parajuly]], [[Emma Chichester Clark]] and [[Alexander Gilkes]] (2014), Roger Mcgough and Rupi Kaur (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX |url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/post/5744413958/poetry-jarvis-cocker-is-a-musician-actor-radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124923/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/post/5744413958/poetry-jarvis-cocker-is-a-musician-actor-radio |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Mays'' is often noted for launching the career of novelist [[Zadie Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1560999,00.html "Learning Curve," ''The Guardian'', 3 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Her work appears in two of the short story editions (1996 and 1997). Literary agencies first took notice of Smith after seeing her story "Mrs. Begum’s Son and the Private Tutor" in the 1997 collection. Smith guest edited the ''Mays'' in 2001. Her quip "maybe in a few years this lot will have me out of a job" has become a catch phrase for the publication.

''The Mays'' is associated with Varsity Publications Ltd, which publishes ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The cost of publication is funded in part by donations from various Oxford and Cambridge colleges.

'''''Ulzzang''''' ({{lang-ko|얼짱}}, {{audio|Ko-얼짱.oga|listen}}), also spelled as '''''eoljjang''''' or '''''gue lanjiao''''' ({{IPA-ko|ʌl.t͈ɕɐŋ}}), is a popular [[South Korea]]n term literally meaning "best face" or "good-looking". A person desiring ''ulzzang'' status would gain popularity on the internet through entering contests where their photos are judged and chosen by voters. The trend is unisex and is practised by both males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ulzzang.net/how-to-be-an-ulzzang |title=How to be an Ulzzang |website=Ulzzang.net |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity and influence of [[Korean Wave|Korean popular culture]] throughout Asia has led to ulzzangs becoming a trend in Asian countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and certain parts of South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.be.com/beauty/korean-beauty/gyaru-vs-ulzzang-make-one-really-go-77983.html |title=Gyaru vs ulzzang make-up: which one should you really go for? |website=Asia.be.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/blogs/singapore-showbiz/korean-ulzzang-beauty-mania-comes-singapore-072253957.html |title=Korean ‘Ulzzang’ beauty mania comes to Singapore |website=Sg.entertainment.yahoo.com |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popsop.com/2015/11/the-most-fashionable-country-on-earth-and-its-global-influence/ |title=The most fashionable country on Earth and its global influence – POPSOP &amp;#124; Consumer Insight, Sustainability &amp; Design |website=Popsop.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cindi Loo |url=http://test.thedailyant.mobi/Main/Korea-Ulzzang-subculture-joins-list-of-impossible-beauty-obsessions |title=Korea Ulzzang subculture joins list of impossible beauty obsessions - Theantdaily |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718005304/http://test.thedailyant.mobi/Main/Korea-Ulzzang-subculture-joins-list-of-impossible-beauty-obsessions |archivedate=2016-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''unsigned artist''', '''unsigned band''' or '''independent artist''' is a [[musician]] or [[musical group]] not under a [[contract]] with a [[record label]]. The terms are used in the [[music industry]] as a [[marketing]] technique. Bands that release their own material on self-published CDs can also be considered unsigned bands. Often unsigned bands primarily exist to perform at concerts.

In more recent years, the Internet has helped promote the music of unsigned bands. Artists often post their music as [[MP3]]s on websites such as [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], [[Myspace]], [[PureVolume]], [[GarageBand.com]] and [[SoundClick]].

In 2016, the [[Unsigned Music Awards]] was established in the UK as the first ever televised international awards ceremony to champion artists without the backing of a record label.

UK unsigned bands and musicians are able to use such services as [[The Unsigned Guide]] and to gather music industry contact names, phone numbers, websites and social media links, as well as information on how to get signed or market music independently.

Song pitching websites, such as [[TAXI (A&amp;R)|TAXI]] allow unsigned musicians to see which record labels (and other music companies) are currently seeking new music.

Further, companies like [[Sentric Music]] and the royalty payment service offered by [[Last.fm]] can help in generating income streams for unsigned bands.

==History and current scene==
Many unsigned artists used to sell their music and music-related merchandise without the financial support of a record label, while often seeking a recording contract through the recording of [[Demo (music)|demo]]s. Recently, the Internet has helped promote independent artistic material. Artists tend to post their music on websites such as [[MySpace]], and [[ILike]], and sometimes have their music played on podcast shows like [[Kooba Radio]].  In recent times, artists such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Radiohead]], who once had major label record deals, have started to release their music independently.

Various musicians remain independent in their beginning of their music career but later on get a [[record deal]] and continue as a signed musician.  But this concept changed when major artists such as [[The Eagles]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] became independent and parted their ways with record labels such as [[Interscope]].

Many services are offered to independent musicians like [[Cdbaby]], [[Feiyr]], [[Nimbit]] and [[Tunecore]] by which the artists can retain the copyrights of their songs and also deliver their music to various stores including [[iTunes Store]], [[Amazon MP3]], [[Napster]], [[Spotify]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;

== Internet promotion ==

Internet promotion has been the key for some bands for getting popular. Bands like the [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Owl City]], and solo artists like [[Lily Allen]] have gained popularity through Myspace, although the [[Arctic Monkeys]] did not even know what MySpace was, and claimed that fans made it for them.

Unsigned bands have become more popular with Internet users and have been able to break into the mainstream charts. They are now finding many resources across the Internet to promote, market, and sell their music almost free of charge.

Unsigned charts are now being promoted on almost all the underground music sites and has seen many of the domain owners spending large amounts of money on developing these charts to bring bands to them. A number of these are now additionally registered with the [[top 40|official charts]].

Blog sites have become popular, as they regularly feature reviews or interviews with unsigned artists. Other blog sites have offered helpful guidance and resources for new unsigned artists. Similar to bloggers, music curators including podcasts, DJs, and Youtube channels are all dedicated to finding quality new songs from unsigned artists for online audiences to discover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pushpowerpromo.com/submit-music-to-these-places|title=Submit Music To These Places {{!}} Push Power Promo|website=www.pushpowerpromo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music promotion site, Feature.fm, has emerged to allow artists to promote their music natively directly inside music streaming services.

==Record labels==
Major record company [[Universal Music]] entered into a joint venture with Tunecore to distribute albums online on major stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/07/universaltunecore-deal-opens-major-doors-for-indie-artists.ars|title=Universal/TuneCore deal opens major doors for indie artists|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The record labels which entered into venture are [[Interscope]](Interscope Digital Distribution), [[Universal Motown]] (Unimo Digital Distribution), [[Island Def Jam]] (IDJ FirstLook) and [[Universal Republic]] (Republic Digital Distribution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musiciancoaching.com/music-business/digital-distribution-music-2/|title=Digital music distribution {{!}} Music Consultant|website=musiciancoaching.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Island Def Jam Music Group partnered with Tunecore to launch IDJ Firstlook, a new web portal that provides unsigned artists with potential access to such coveted major label services as worldwide distribution and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/66788/idj-firstlook-debuts|title=IDJ FirstLook Debuts|work=All Access|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent vanity record labels===
Artists can also create their own record labels and sell their music under the label's imprint as well. Services such as [[Nimbit]] gives facilities for independent musicians to release their music independently as well as under a record label create by artist itself. Other efforts made in this field include [[Magnatune]], an independent record label based in [[Berkeley, California]], [[United States]].

== Notable unsigned artists ==
Notable artists who have never been signed to a record label include [[Chance the Rapper]], [[Noname (rapper)]] and [[David Choi]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Gwalior]], her father, Manohar Khanna, was a lyricist and singer, working as Assistant Superintendent in the Water Works Department in then Gwalior State. When he came to Bombay (now Mumbai) for some work in 1946 he met Jaddanbai who was mother of Hindi film actress Nargis Dutt.On her request he started writing Gazals for Hindi films by the name, Jaaved Anwar .He was getting a monthly salary of Rs. 250 in Gwalior State and Jaddanabi offered him Rs. 800 for 3 gazals which he wrote for Jaddanbai,s Nargis Art Productions film Romeo Juliet . Usha Khanna did often take inspiration from [[Arabic music]], which she liked and she claims that she has never lifted any song directly, but that she has composed something along the lines.

The popular music director [[O. P. Nayyar]] introduced Usha Khanna to [[Sashadhar Mukherjee]], a powerful man in the Indian film industry at that time. She sang a song for Mukherjee, and when he realised that she had composed the song on her own, he told her to compose two songs per day for one year. After a few months, Mukherjee signed her as the composer for his movie ''[[Dil Deke Dekho]]'' (1959) as a music composer.&lt;ref name="RajadhyakshaWillemen2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ashish Rajadhyaksha|author2=Paul Willemen|title=Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rF8ABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1994-IA627|date=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-94325-7|pages=1994–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, which also introduced the actress [[Asha Parekh]], became a big hit, and Mukherjee hired her again for another [[Asha Parekh]] starrer [[Hum Hindustani]] (1961).

After she started composing music for Hindi movies, Usha Khanna struggled to establish herself as a music director, despite producing many hit songs. She often collaborated with [[Asha Bhosle]], who referred to Usha Khanna as her daughter, and [[Mohammed Rafi]]. This trio produced many hit songs.Many of songs sung by Mohammed Rafi under composition of Usha Khanna are still very popular and will be everlasting forever. DIL DEKE DEKHO (1959)'''.''' HAWAS (1974), SAJAAN KI SAHELI (1981),AAP THO AISE NA THE (1980) as to named a few good songs of movie of Rafi Usha Association. 

[[Saawan Kumar Tak|Saawan Kumar]] was often the lyricist for Usha Khanna, and wrote most of his lyrics for her songs. He directed and produced the lyrics for eleven movies she scored the music for. In 1979 [[K. J. Yesudas]] received [[Filmfare award]] for her song ''Dil ke tukde tukde'' in the film Dada. 
Usha Khanna was married to Sawan Kumar Tak but later they separated and she lives in Bombay (present name Mumbai).

The effort she had put earlier in life to establish herself in the industry, made her realise how difficult it was to break through, and this made her often give the chance to new singers. She gave the chance to the singers who were little known at that time – [[Anupama Deshpande]], [[Pankaj Udhas]], [[Hemlata]], [[Mohammed Aziz]], [[Roop Kumar Rathod]], [[Shabbir Kumar]], and [[Sonu Nigam]]. Many of these went on to become notable singers. Usha Khanna herself also sang a few songs as a playback singer.

Many of Usha Khanna's songs are still very popular. Some of the other movies she provided for are 'Shabnam', 'Aankh Micholi', ''[[Saajan Bina Suhagan]]'', 'Sautan', 'Sajan ki Saheli', 'Ab Kya Hoga', 'Lal Bungalow', 'Dada', 'Do Khiladi', 'Hanste Khelte'.

Usha Khanna remained quite active as a composer until the mid-nineties. Until now, the last movie she has given music to was in 2003. The movie was [[Dil Pardesi Ho Gaya]], produced and directed by her ex-husband [[Saawan Kumar]] who she was briefly married to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Hindu : At home with melody|work=The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/08/07/stories/2003080700250200.htm |author=Rana A. Siddiqui|date=7 August 2003| accessdate = 16 October 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usha Khanna has given music to non-Hindi movies too. The Malayalam movie [[Moodal Manju]] (1969) is still remembered for some of the finest songs in Malayalam including 'Nee Madhu Pakaroo' by K. J. Yesudas and 'Maanasa Mani veenayil' by S.Janaki. [[Agni nilavu]] and [[Puthooram Puthri Unniyarcha]] are the other Malayalam movies done by her. Why she did not get many chances remains a mystery for many music lovers even now.

'''''Watsonville: Some Place Not Here''''' is a three-act 1996 play by [[Cherríe Moraga]]. It depicts a cannery strike in [[Watsonville, California]]. ''Watsonville'' and the 1995 play ''[[Circle in the Dirt]]'' were published together in a single book by the [[West End Press]]. It is the sequel to the 1994 play ''[[Heroes and Saints]]''.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43&gt;Pareles, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was a project of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=Pignatarop2829&gt;Pignataro, p. 28-29. "La obra ''Watsonville: Some Place Not Here'' (1996) fue parte de una proyecto de Stanford University por el cual Moraga entra a East Palo Alto — una comunidad cerca de la universidad— y de ello resulta una creatividad colectiva por su comunicacion con el pueblo para investigar los sentimientos de la gente en cuanto a los acontecimientos sociales, geograficos y religiosos en la region de California —los "cannery strikes" (Watsonville/Circle in the Dirt 4) del 1985–1987; el terremoto de grado 7.1 de 1989 en California, y la apariencia de la Virgen de Guadalupe en un roble en el parque del condado Pinto Lake en 1992 (Watsonville/Circle in the Dirt 4). Por lo tanto, tal obra teatral era un proyecto iniciado por un programa universitario y ligado a la comunidad."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareles wrote that ''Watsonville'' criticizes anti-immigration policies in California and Mexican-Americans perceived to have sold out to Anglo culture, or ''vendidos'', who believe such policies should be compromised with.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; Ruben Mendoza of ''[[Confluencia: Revista Hispanica de Cultura y Literatura]]'' wrote that the play uses a communal [[third place]] (also known as a third space)&lt;!--stated as "thirdspace" in the source--&gt; to criticize "[[capitalist]] spatial practice".&lt;ref name=Mendozap132&gt;Mendoza, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the play also discusses the labor movement's gender and immigrant rights situation.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;

Moraga stated that the play is based "loosely on three actual events that took place in a central California coastal farm worker town by the same name."&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524&gt;Thompson, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; These events were a 1985–1987 cannery strike, a 1989 7.1 [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] earthquake, and a vision of the [[Lady of Guadalupe]] in the Pinto Lake county park.&lt;ref name=Pignatarop2829/&gt; Lisa B. Thompson of the ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' wrote that there is "drama with vibrant dialogue and compelling, diverse characters" because Moraga did not use the words of those she interviewed for research purposes [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] and instead "the voices Moraga listened to while researching the plays merge with her own."&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt;

''Watsonville'' has select phrases and sentences in the dialog in the Spanish language instead of English.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; The play, along with ''Circle in the Dirt'', uses dialog that is a mixture of English and Spanish to paraphrase the content of the interviews conducted by Moraga; most of the actual interviews were done entirely in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Pareles, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The music in the play includes [[bolero]], [[cumbia]], and [[rap]]. Some of the music includes original compositions.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt;

==Plot==
In the play, set in the mid-1990s, workers in a [[Watsonville, California]] cannery strike.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; The workers at the Pajaro Valley Cannery strike partly because they want additional rights,&lt;ref name=Mendozap134&gt;Mendoza, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; and also because they want to be paid better wages.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; As strategies the workers use a type of protest theater used by ''[[El Teatro Campesino]]'' and they also use [[hunger strikes]] in the manner done by [[César Chávez]].&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; At the same time, the area Latino community faces divisions as anti-immigration legislation is being proposed in California.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; During the play the politicians deliberate on Bill 1519, which is intended to separate the workers into legal residents and illegal immigrants as a way to divide them, referring to real-life [[border control]] legislation.&lt;ref name=Mendozap134/&gt; Marissa Pareles of the ''[[Lambda Book Report]]'' wrote that "the end of the play "has only a bit of a &lt;!--The D and M are both capitalized--&gt;[[Deus ex Machina]] feeling about it".&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;

Lisa B. Thompson wrote that realism is the predominant atmosphere of the work, but that the work highlights the importance of the spiritual aspect of protesting by giving some characters relationships with spirits of the deceased and also having the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] appear on a tree trunk.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; An earthquake with the magnitude 7.5 occurs during the story.&lt;ref name=Mendozap132/&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Lucha''' – A cannery worker,&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; she learns enough English to use the language to express her romantic desire for Susana.&lt;ref name=Mendozap137&gt;Mendoza, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Susana''' – Susana is physician's assistant at a community clinic,&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; and she is an activist.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; Susana and Lucha become girlfriends, and Susana refuses to be [[LGBT|in the closet]].&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt;
* '''Juan''' – Juan is an organizer for radical leftist causes.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; He is originally a priest who tries and fails to convince an area [[monsignor]] to bless a vision of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].&lt;ref name=Mendozap135&gt;Mendoza, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dolores Valle''' – A migrant worker who sees the Virgin of Guadalupe,&lt;ref name=Mendozap134/&gt; she ultimately dies in a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref name=Mendozap137/&gt;
* '''Chente''' – A labor organizer&lt;ref name=Mendozap135/&gt;
* '''Amparo'''
