'''Annulate lamella''' is one of cell membrane classes, occurring as set of parallel elements with duble same dimensional membranes, as the [[nuclear envelope]]. These lamella have pore complexes which are identical to those of the nuclear cover. It is arranged in highly ordered structure with a regular spacing between themselves.&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rieger R. Michaelis A.|author2=Green M. M.|year=1976|title=Glossary of genetics and cytogenetics: Classical and molecular|publisher=Springer-Verlag|place= Heidelberg - New York|isbn= 3-540-07668-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite book|author=King R. C.|author2=Stransfield W. D. |year=1998|title=Dictionary of genetics|publisher=Oxford University Press|place= New York, Oxford|isbn=0-19-50944-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These lamella are characteristic for the [[oocytes]], [[spermatocytes]], some somatic and [[cancer]] cels. They are characteristic of actively growing cells, including many functions in [[genetic information]] transfer and storage.  They are probably formed from the nuclear envelope.&lt;ref name="Bajrović"&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Bajrović K |editor2=Jevrić-Čaušević A. |editor3=Hadžiselimović R.|title=Uvod u genetičko inženjerstvo i biotehnologiju|publisher=Institut za genetičko inženjerstvo i biotehnologiju (INGEB) Sarajevo|year=2005|isbn= 9958-9344-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell N. A. |display-authors=etal|year=2008|title=Biology|edition=8th |publisher=Person International Edition, San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-53616-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar membranes are found in both the [[cytoplasm]] and [[nucleoplasm]]. In the nucleoplasm, they are small, irregular, as well as short-lived. It has been established that, in some conditions, [[ribosomes]] are directly connected to the annulate lamellar membrane, supposing a role in the process of [[protein synthesis]].

'''Anticipatory democracy''' is a theory of [[civics]] relying on democratic [[decision making]] that takes into account [[futurology|predictions of future events]] that have some credibility with the electorate. The phrase was coined by [[Alvin Toffler]] in his book ''[[Future Shock]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=qsPgTpt_jrKEB5CI0IAF&amp;ct=result&amp;id=SvbQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Anticipatory+democracy%22&amp;q=Toffler#search_anchor | title=Anticipatory democracy | work=The Indian journal of public administration, Volume 26 | date=1980 | accessdate=December 8, 2011 | pages=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was expanded on in the 1978 book ''Anticipatory Democracy'', edited by [[Clement Bezold]].

Other well-known advocates of the anticipatory approach include [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Heidi Toffler]], [[K. Eric Drexler]], and [[Robin Hanson]]. They all advocate approaches where the public, not just experts, participate in this "anticipation".

The FutureMAP program of the [[Information Awareness Office]] program of the [[United States of America|United States]] government proposed a prediction market prior to its cancellation on July 29, 2003.

== Variants ==

[[Bioregional democracy]] can appear as a variant of anticipatory democracy in that it anticipates (using a similar scientific process) the [[ecological health]] outcomes of any given action. However it usually relies more on far less fragile means, and less on compared measures and quantities.

An alternative, [[deliberative democracy]], may combine with either the anticipatory or the bioregional model.  It relies less on formal models and a [[market system]] for betting on future events, and more on discussion.

Deliberative, anticipatory and bioregional approaches can all be considered variants of [[participatory democracy]] with different thresholds of ease of participation, [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], concern for non-human life or future generations, and reflection of participants' tolerances versus preferences or ideals of [[truth]].  Sometimes a deliberative model is described as more [[left-wing politics|"left"]] and an anticipatory model as more [[right-wing politics|"right"]]. Those who wish to avoid this debate and see merits to both approaches, e.g. [[Green politics|Greens]], usually prefer the generic term "[[participatory democracy]]". This term has become fundamental to [[green politics]] itself.
 
Other terms which likewise have more specific associations with advocates or methods include: [[grassroots democracy]], [[semi-direct democracy]], [[consensus democracy]].

'''"Blue Sky Mine"''' is a song by Australian rock band [[Midnight Oil]] released in 1990 as the first single from their album ''[[Blue Sky Mining]]''. It peaked at No. 7 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' Top Singles]] chart, No. 8 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]] and [[VG-lista|Norwegian Singles Chart]], No. 25 on the [[Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique|French Singles Chart]], No. 66 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], No. 47 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock]] and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock]] charts. It charted the highest in New Zealand, where it reached No. 2 for two weeks behind "[[Don't Make Me Over (song)|Don't Make Me Over]]" by [[Sybil (singer)|Sybil]].

The song was inspired by the experiences of workers at the [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]] [[asbestos]] mines who contracted various asbestos-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbestosdiseases.org.au/asbestosinfo/wittenoom_tragedies.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r13029|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/travel-tips-and-articles/76715&lt;/ref&gt; The "blue" refers to [[blue asbestos]], and the "sugar refining company" refers to the [[CSR Limited|Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd (CSR)]], the owner of the mines.

'''Bone remodeling''' (or '''bone metabolism''') is a lifelong process where mature [[osseous tissue|bone tissue]] is removed from the [[skeleton]] (a process called ''[[bone resorption]]'') and new bone tissue is formed (a process called ''[[ossification]]'' or ''new bone formation''). These processes also control the reshaping or replacement of bone following injuries like [[Bone fracture|fractures]] but also [[Microdamage in bone|micro-damage]], which occurs during normal activity. Remodeling responds also to functional demands of the mechanical loading.

In the first year of life, almost 100% of the skeleton is replaced. In adults, remodeling proceeds at about 10% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/bone_remodeling Wheeless Textbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

An imbalance in the regulation of bone remodeling's two sub-processes, bone resorption and bone formation, results in many metabolic bone diseases, such as [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?bone+remodeling Online Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==
Bone [[homeostasis]] involves multiple but coordinated cellular and molecular events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.jbc.org/content/285/33/25103.full|title = Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Bone Remodeling|last = Raggatt|first = L.

The structure of bones as well as adequate supply of [[calcium]] requires close cooperation between these two cell types and other cell populations present at the bone remodeling sites (ex. immune cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/bonekeyreports/2014/140108/bonekey2013215/full/bonekey2013215.html|title = Coupling the activities of bone formation and resorption: a multitude of signals within the basic multicellular unit|last = Sims|first = N.

These controls include the action of several hormones, including [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH), [[vitamin D]], [[growth hormone]], [[steroids]], and [[calcitonin]], as well as several [[bone marrow]]-derived membrane and soluble [[cytokines]] and [[growth factors]] (ex. [[M-CSF]], [[RANKL]], [[VEGF]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] family...). It is in this way that the body is able to maintain proper levels of [[calcium]] required for physiological processes. Thus bone remodeling is not just occasional "repair of bone damage" but rather an active, continual process that is always happening in a healthy body. 

Subsequent to appropriate signaling, osteoclasts move to resorb the surface of the bone, followed by deposition of bone by osteoblasts.  Together, the cells that are responsible for bone remodeling are known as the basic multicellular unit (BMU), and the temporal duration (i.e. lifespan) of the BMU is referred to as the [[bone remodeling period]].&lt;ref&gt;Pietrzak, WS.

Climax species, also called '''late [[Sere (ecology)|seral]]''', '''late-successional''', '''[[K-selected]]''' or '''equilibrium''' species, are [[plant]] [[species]] that will remain essentially unchanged in terms of species composition for as long as a site remains undisturbed.  They are the most [[Shade tolerance|shade-tolerant]] species of [[tree]] to establish in the process of [[Ecological succession|forest succession]].  The [[seedling]]s of climax species can grow in the shade of the parent trees, ensuring their dominance indefinitely.  A [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], such as fire, may kill the climax species, allowing [[pioneer species|pioneer]] or earlier successional species to re-establish for a time.  They are the opposite of [[pioneer species]], also known as [[ruderal species|ruderal]], fugitive, opportunistic or [[R-selected]] species, in the sense that climax species are good competitors but poor colonizers, whereas pioneer species are good colonizers but poor competitors.  Climax species dominate the [[climax community]], when the pace of succession slows down, the result of [[ecological homeostasis]], which features maximum permitted [[biodiversity]], given the prevailing [[ecology|ecological]] conditions.  Their reproductive strategies and other adaptive characteristics can be considered more sophisticated than those of opportunistic species.  Through [[negative feedback]], they adapt themselves to specific environmental conditions. Climax species are mostly found in forests. Climax species, closely controlled by [[carrying capacity]], follow [[K strategy|K strategies]], wherein species produce fewer numbers of potential offspring, but invest more heavily in securing the reproductive success of each one to the micro-environmental conditions of its specific [[ecological niche]].  Climax species might be [[Semelparity and Iteroparity|iteroparous]], [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption efficient]] and [[Biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html Relationships Among Species] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616010027/http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html |date=June 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed term==
The idea of a climax species has been criticized in recent ecological literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/doaklab/timberland/timberland/results.htm Results, Analysis of Timberland Owned by San Jose Water Company] 2007-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;  Any assessment of successional states depends on assumptions about the natural fire regime.  But the idea of a dominant species is still widely used in [[Silviculture|silvicultural]] programs and [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|California Department of Forestry]] literature.

==Examples==

[[Picea glauca|White spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') is an example of a climax species in the northern forests of North America.

Other examples:
*[[Tsuga canadensis|Canadian Hemlock]]
*[[Abies amabilis|Pacific Silver Fir]]
*[[Abies concolor|White Fir]]
*[[Sloanea woollsii|Yellow Carabeen]]
*[[Blue grama]]
*[[Douglas fir]]

'''DNA–DNA hybridization''' generally refers to a [[molecular biology]] technique that measures the degree of genetic similarity between pools of [[DNA]] sequences. It is usually used to determine the [[genetic distance]] between two organisms. This has been used extensively in [[phylogeny]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

== Method ==

The DNA of one organism is labeled, then mixed with the unlabeled DNA to be compared against. The mixture is incubated to allow DNA strands to dissociate and then cooled to form renewed hybrid double-stranded DNA. Hybridized sequences with a high degree of similarity will bind more firmly, and require more energy to separate them: i.e. they separate when heated at a higher temperature than dissimilar sequences, a process known as "[[DNA melting]]".

To assess the melting profile of the hybridized DNA, the double-stranded DNA is bound to a column and the mixture is heated in small steps. At each step, the column is washed; sequences that melt become single-stranded and wash off the column. The temperatures at which labeled DNA comes off the column reflects the amount of similarity between sequences (and the self-hybridization sample serves as a control). These results are combined to determine the degree of genetic similarity between organisms.

== Use in zoology ==

When several species are compared that way, the similarity values allow the species to be arranged in a [[phylogenetic tree]]; it is therefore one possible approach to carrying out [[molecular systematics]]. [[Charles Sibley]] and [[Jon Ahlquist]], pioneers of the technique, used DNA–DNA hybridization to examine the phylogenetic relationships of avians (the [[Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds|Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy]]) and primates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/_0/history_26 Genetic Similarities: Wilson, Sarich, Sibley, and Ahlquist]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Phylogeny of the Hominoid Primates, as Indicated by DNA–DNA Hybridization| author=C.G.

The '''''Da’at Miqra''''' (Hebrew דעת מקרא) is a series of volumes of [[Hebrew]]-language [[biblical]] [[Bible commentary|commentary]] published by the [[Jerusalem]]-based [[Mossad Harav Kook]] and constitutes a cornerstone of contemporary [[Israel]]i [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[bible]] scholarship. The project was headed by [[Yehuda Kiel]], who received the [[Israel Prize]] for his part in the enterprise.

==Overview==
The singularity of ''Da’at Miqra'' lies in its combination of a [[traditional]] outlook and the findings of modern research.  The ''Da’at Miqra'' editors have sought to present an interpretation based primarily upon ''[[Peshat]]'' — the direct, literal reading of the text — as opposed to ''[[Peshat|Drash]]''.  They do so by incorporating [[geographic]] references, [[archaeological]] findings and textual analysis, presenting a clear link between the commentary's traditional approach and contemporary methodology.  There has been some suggestion that the ''Da’at Miqra‘''s dualistic approach reflects an underlying polemic against [[biblical criticism]], without directly addressing the views and queries of [[bible]] critics but via a commentary aimed at debunking their methodology.

==Methodology and structure==
The ''Da’at Miqra'' relies upon the [[Aleppo Codex]] for its basic text.  The commentary includes clarifications of difficult words and [[etymological]] references—particularly with regard to the names of locations mentioned—and contains various notes aimed at demonstrating, expanding upon or presenting alternate views on the text.  Each book of the ''[[Tanakh]]'' is divided into parts, each of which is preceded by a description of the chapter’s division and literary style and a general explanation of the portion.  In addition, each book contains a general introduction aimed at clarifying general issues within the text, such as the dating of its authorship, its historical background, parallels to other biblical books, an explanation of various repeating phrases or personas, and the like.

==Editorial staff==
Editors of the series included  [[Yehuda Elitzur]] of [[Bar-Ilan University]], the [[International Bible Contest]] champion and Bible scholar [[Amos Hakham]],  [[Sha’ul Yisra’eli]] and  [[Mordechai Breuer]].

'''Dendroclimatology''' is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s (primarily properties of the annual [[tree rings]]). Tree rings are wider when conditions favor growth, narrower when times are difficult. Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.  By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates.

==Advantages==
Tree rings are especially useful as climate [[proxy (climate)|proxies]] in that they can be well-dated via [[dendrochronology]], i.e. matching of the rings from sample to sample.  This allows extension backwards in time using deceased tree samples, even using samples from buildings or from archeological digs.  Another advantage of tree rings is that they are clearly demarked in annual increments, as opposed to other proxy methods such as [[borehole]]s.  Furthermore, tree rings respond to multiple climatic effects (temperature, moisture, cloudiness), so that various aspects of climate (not just temperature) can be studied.  However, this can be a double-edged sword.

==Limitations==
Along with the advantages of dendroclimatology are some limitations:  [[confounding variable|confounding factors]], geographic coverage, annular resolution, and collection difficulties.  The field has developed various methods to partially adjust for these challenges. 

===Confounding factors===
There are multiple climate and non-climate factors as well as [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] effects that impact tree ring width.  Methods to isolate single factors (of interest) include botanical studies to calibrate growth influences and sampling of "limiting stands" (those expected to respond mostly to the variable of interest).

====Climate factors====
Climate factors that affect trees include temperature, precipitation, sunlight, and wind.  To differentiate among these factors, scientists collect information from "limiting stands."  An example of a limiting stand is the upper elevation treeline: here, trees are expected to be more affected by temperature variation (which is "limited") than precipitation variation (which is in excess).  Conversely, lower elevation treelines are expected to be more affected by precipitation changes than temperature variation.  This is not a perfect work-around as multiple factors still impact trees even at the "limiting stand," but it helps.  In theory, collection of samples from nearby limiting stands of different types (e.g. upper and lower treelines on the same mountain) should allow mathematical solution for multiple climate factors.  

====Non-climate factors====
Non-climate factors include soil, tree age, fire, tree-to-tree competition, genetic differences, logging or other human disturbance, herbivore impact (particularly sheep grazing), pest outbreaks, disease, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  For factors which vary randomly over space (tree to tree or stand to stand), the best solution is to collect sufficient data (more samples) to compensate for confounding noise.  Tree age is corrected for with various statistical methods:  either fitting spline curves to the overall tree record or using similar aged trees for comparison over different periods (regional curve standardization).  Careful examination and site selection helps to limit some confounding effects, for example picking sites undisturbed by modern man.

====Non-linear effects====
In general, climatologists assume a linear dependence of ring width on the variable of interest (e.g. moisture).  However, if the variable changes enough, response may level off or even turn opposite.  The home gardener knows that one can underwater or overwater a house plant.  In addition, it is possible that interaction effects may occur (for example "temperature times precipitation" may affect growth as well as temperature and precipitation on their own.  Here, also, the "limiting stand" helps somewhat to isolate the variable of interest.  For instance, at the upper treeline, where the tree is "cold limited", it's unlikely that nonlinear effects of high temperature ("inverted quadratic") will have numerically significant impact on ring width over the course of a growing season.

====Botanical inferences to correct for confounding factors====
Botanical studies can help to estimate the impact of confounding variables and in some cases guide corrections for them.  These experiments may be either ones where growth variables are all controlled (e.g. in a [[greenhouse]]{{cn|date=November 2012}}), partially controlled (e.g. FACE [Free Airborne Concentration Enhancement] experiments—add ref), or where conditions in nature are monitored.  In any case, the important thing is that multiple growth factors are carefully recorded to determine what impacts growth.  (Insert Fennoscandanavia paper reference).  With this information, ring width response can be more accurately understood and inferences from historic (unmonitored) tree rings become more certain.  In concept, this is like the limiting stand principle, but it is more quantitative—like a calibration.

====Divergence problem====
{{Main|Divergence problem}}
The divergence problem is the disagreement between the temperatures measured by the [[thermometer]]s (instrumental temperatures) on one side, and the temperatures reconstructed from the latewood density or width of tree rings on the other side, at many treeline sites in northern forests.

While the rendering and analysis of data from thermometer records largely suggest a substantial warming trend, tree rings from these particular sites do not display a corresponding change in their maximum latewood density or, in some cases, their width. This does not apply to all such studies.&lt;ref name=Darrigo&gt;{{cite journal | last = D'Arrigo  | first = Rosanne
| last2=Wilson | first2=Rob | last3=Liepert | first3=Beate | last4=Cherubini | first4=Paolo | title = On the ‘Divergence Problem’ in Northern Forests: A review of the tree-ring evidence and possible causes | journal = Global and Planetary Change | volume = 60 | pages = 289–305 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~liepert/pdf/DArrigo_etal.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2007.03.004 | format =PDF |bibcode = 2008GPC....60..289D }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Where this applies, a temperature trend extracted from tree rings alone would not show any substantial warming.  The temperature graphs calculated from instrumental temperatures and from these tree ring proxies  thus "diverge" from one another since the 1950s, which is the origin of the term. This divergence raises obvious questions of whether other, unrecognized divergences have occurred in the past, prior to the era of thermometers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2006 |isbn=0-309-10225-1 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence suggesting that the divergence is caused by human activities, and so confined to the recent past, but use of affected proxies can lead to overestimation of past temperatures, understating the current warming trend. There is continuing research into explanations and ways to reconcile this the discrepancy between analysis of tree ring data and thermometer based data.&lt;ref name=Darrigo /&gt;

===Geographic coverage===
Trees do not cover the Earth. [[Polar climate|Polar]] and marine climates cannot be estimated from tree rings. In perhumid tropical regions, [[Australia]] and [[southern Africa]], trees generally grow all year round and don't show clear annual rings. In some forest areas, the tree growth is too much influenced by multiple factors (no "limiting stand") to allow clear climate reconstruction{{Examples|date=September 2011}}. The coverage difficulty is dealt with by acknowledging it and by using other proxies (e.g. ice cores, corals) in difficult areas.  In some cases it can be shown that the parameter of interest (temperature, precipitation, etc.) varies similarly from area to area, for example by looking at patterns in the instrumental record.  Then one is justified in extending the dendroclimatology inferences to areas where no suitable tree ring samples are obtainable.

===Annular resolution===
Tree rings show the impact on growth over an entire growing season.  Climate changes deep in the dormant season (winter) will not be recorded.  In addition, different times of the growing season may be more important than others (i.e. May versus September) for ring width.  However, in general the ring width is used to infer the overall climate change during the corresponding year (an approximation).  Another problem is "memory" or [[autocorrelation]].  A stressed tree may take a year or two to recover from a hard season.  This problem can be dealt with by more complex modeling (a "lag" term in the regression) or by reducing the skill estimates of chronologies.

===Collection difficulties===
Tree rings must be obtained from nature, frequently from remote regions.  This means that special efforts are needed to map sites properly.  In addition, samples must be collected in difficult (often sloping terrain) conditions.  Generally, tree rings are collected using a hand-held borer device, that requires skill to get a good sample.  The best samples come from felling a tree and sectioning it.  However, this requires more danger and does damage to the forest.  It may not be allowed in certain areas, particularly with the oldest trees in undisturbed sites (which are the most interesting scientifically).  As with all experimentalists, dendroclimatologists must, at times, decide to make the best of imperfect data, rather than resample.  This tradeoff is made more difficult, because sample collection (in the field) and analysis (in the lab) may be separated significantly in time and space.  These collection challenges mean that data gathering is not as simple or cheap as conventional laboratory science.

==Other measurements==
Initial work focused on measuring the [[tree ring]] width—this is simple to measure and can be related to climate parameters.  But the annual growth of the tree leaves other traces.  In particular ''maximum latewood density'' (MXD) is another metric used for estimating environmental variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian H. |last=Luckman |title=Tree Rings as Temperature Proxies |format=PDF |work=2008 Gussow-Nuna Geoscience Conference |publisher=cspg.org |url=http://www.cspg.org/documents/Conventions/Archives/Gussow/2008Gussow/015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, harder to measure.  Other properties (e.g. isotope or chemical trace analysis) have also been tried most notably by L. M. Libby in her 1974 paper "Temperature Dependence of Isotope Ratios in Tree Rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libby|Pandolfi|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, multiple measurements on the same ring will allow differentiation of confounding factors (e.g. precipitation and temperature).  However, most studies are still based on ring widths at limiting stands.

Measuring [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon]] concentrations in tree rings has proven to be useful in recreating past [[sunspot]] activity, with data now extending back over 11,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The plant ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' has a genome with only around 135 megabase pairs (Mbp), making it small enough to fully synthesize. It also makes it relative easy to study, leading to its use as a common [[model organism]] in the field of plant genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/genAnnotation/gene_structural_annotation/agicomplete.jsp|title=TAIR - Genome Assembly|website=www.arabidopsis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rensink|first=W.

Plant pathogens are able to travel through a plant's vascular system, but plants do not have specific immune cells that can travel this way. Plants also do not have an adaptive immune system, so other forms of immunity are required. One is the use of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) to bind to [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMP), which are highly-conserved structures on the outside of many invasive organisms. This form of immunity acts on intercellular pathogens, which are ones outside of individual plant cells. PRRs are [[transmembrane protein]]s, which have an anchor inside the cell and portions that extend beyond the membrane. They are part of the innate immune system and bind to and prevent the proliferation of pathogens with the PAMPs that they can bind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jonathan D. G.|last2=Dangl|first2=Jeffery L.|date=2006-11-16|title=The plant immune system|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/full/nature05286.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=444|issue=7117|pages=323–329|doi=10.1038/nature05286|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EF-Tu, a very common and highly conserved protein, is an example of a PAMP that can be found in numerous pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Hiroshi|last2=Qin|first2=Yan|last3=Achenbach|first3=John|last4=Li|first4=Chengmin|last5=Kijek|first5=Jaroslaw|last6=Spahn|first6=Christian M.

When a protein is being formed, amino acids are connected in a long sequence, known as a protein's primary structure. Elongation factors help coordinate the movement of [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) and [[messenger RNA]]s (mRNA) so they stay aligned as the ribosome translocates along the mRNA chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan|first=V.|date=2002-02-22|title=Ribosome structure and the mechanism of translation|journal=Cell|volume=108|issue=4|pages=557–572|issn=0092-8674|pmid=11909526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its importance in ensuring the accuracy of translation and preventing mutations, EF-Tu is a good target of both immune systems and drug therapies designed to prevent infections and subsequent diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krab|first=Ivo M.|last2=Parmeggiani|first2=Andrea|date=2002|title=Mechanisms of EF-Tu, a pioneer GTPase|journal=Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology|volume=71|pages=513–551|issn=0079-6603|pmid=12102560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological function ==

=== Synthesis ===
EFR, like other proteins, undergoes translation in a cell's ribosomes. After the primary structure of the protein has been formed it must fold into its three dimensional [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] to become functional. This occurs in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). While in the ER, this primary polypeptide chain undergoes a regulatory process known as ER-quality control (ER-QC) to help ensure it folds into the correct 3-D structure. and avoids. ER-QC process consists of a series of chaperone proteins that help guide the folding of the EFR polypeptide chains, preventing the aggregation of many polypeptide chains into one large group. Proteins that have not folded are kept in the ER until they have folded into their correct 3-D shape. If folding does not occur then the unfolded protein is eventually destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anelli|first=Tiziana|last2=Sitia|first2=Roberto|date=2008-01-23|title=Protein quality control in the early secretory pathway|url=http://emboj.embopress.org/content/27/2/315|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|pages=315–327|doi=10.1038/sj.emboj.7601974|issn=0261-4189|pmid=18216874|pmc=2234347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nekrasov|first=Vladimir|last2=Li|first2=Jing|last3=Batoux|first3=Martine|last4=Roux|first4=Milena|last5=Chu|first5=Zhao-Hui|last6=Lacombe|first6=Severine|last7=Rougon|first7=Alejandra|last8=Bittel|first8=Pascal|last9=Kiss‐Papp|first9=Marta|date=2009-11-04|title=Control of the pattern‐recognition receptor EFR by an ER protein complex in plant immunity|url=http://emboj.embopress.org/content/28/21/3428|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=28|issue=21|pages=3428–3438|doi=10.1038/emboj.2009.262|issn=0261-4189|pmid=19763086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the control mechanisms of EFR is the protein Arabidopsis stromal-derived factor-2 (SDF2). A genetic variant of the ''A. thaliana'' plant that did not have the gene to encode for this protein had a far lower production of functional EFR proteins. SDF2 also cannot be substituted for other enzymes in EFR production. Experimental analysis indicated that EFR is destroyed in the cell when it is produced without SDF2, though the mechanism of this action is unknown. Other proteins that are required for the proper synthesis of EFR include Arabidopsis CRT3 and UGGT, which are members of the EFR-QC and act as [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]] to help folding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Role in plant immunity ===
EFR receptors have a high affinity for the EF-Tu PAMP. This has been proven analytically through competitive binding assays and [[SDS-page|SDS-PAGE]] analysis. When EFR binds to EF-Tu, the basal resistance is activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This response happens after an infection has already been established and it is important to the plant immune system because it prevents the spread of the pathogen throughout the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niks|first=Rients E.|last2=Marcel|first2=Thierry C.|date=2009-06-01|title=Nonhost and basal resistance: how to explain specificity?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02849.x/abstract|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=182|issue=4|pages=817–828|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02849.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only bacteria that have a high amount of EF-Tu are effectively inhibited by EFR, such as ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Similarities to FLS2 ===
Like EFR, FLS2 (flagellin-sensing 2) is a plant receptor-like kinase that acts as a PRR in the plant innate immune system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Gómez|first=L.|last2=Boller|first2=T.|date=June 2000|title=FLS2: an LRR receptor-like kinase involved in the perception of the bacterial elicitor flagellin in Arabidopsis|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=5|issue=6|pages=1003–1011|issn=1097-2765|pmid=10911994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of binding to EF-Tu, it binds to [[flagellin]], another highly conserved structure present on many pathogens. It, like EF-Tu, is a good target for the plant immune system since it is so widespread. It also triggers an immune response in a larger variety of plants than EF-Tu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The immune response triggered by FLS2 is very similar to the one that is triggered by EFR and the enzymes that are activated by both receptors likely come from a common pool that is found in many cells. This indicates that the two receptor pathways converge, which has been shown to occur at the ion channels in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeworutzki|first=Elena|last2=Roelfsema|first2=M.

== Applications ==
EFR is found only in the ''[[Brassicaceae]]'' family of plants, meaning it has a limited effect in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Experiments have demonstrated the ability to successfully transfer EFR to plants in other families, such as ''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'', a relative of tobacco, and ''[[Tomato|Solanum lycopersicum]]'', the tomato plant. The ability to transfer PRRs between plants and have them retain their effectiveness broadens genetic engineering techniques to promote disease resistance in crops. It can also reduce chemical wastes associated with mass agriculture and enable the transfer of immunity rapidly and without traditional breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lacombe|first=Séverine|last2=Rougon-Cardoso|first2=Alejandra|last3=Sherwood|first3=Emma|last4=Peeters|first4=Nemo|last5=Dahlbeck|first5=Douglas|last6=van Esse|first6=H.

'''Environmental soil science''' is the study of the interaction of humans with the [[pedosphere]] as well as critical aspects of the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Environmental [[soil science]] addresses both the fundamental and applied aspects of the field including: buffers and surface water quality, [[vadose zone]] functions, [[septic drain field]] site assessment and function, land treatment of [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[erosion]] control, [[soil contamination]] with metals and pesticides, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated soils, restoration of [[wetlands]], [[soil degradation]], [[nutrient management]], movement of viruses and bacteria in soils and waters, [[bioremediation]], application of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetic engineering]] to development of soil microbes that can degrade hazardous pollutants, [[land use]], [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], and the study of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] soils, such as [[terra preta]]. Much of the research done in environmental soil science is produced through the use of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Hongwei|last2=An|first2=Jing|last3=Wei|first3=Shuhe|last4=Gu|first4=Jian|last5=Liang|first5=Wenju|title=Spatial Patterns and Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Soils in a Resource-Exhausted City, Northeast China|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=2015|volume=10|issue=9|page=e0137694|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0137694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziadat|first1=Feras Mousa|last2=Yeganantham|first2=Dhanesh|last3=Shoemate|first3=David|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Raghavan|last5=Narasimhan|first5=Balaji|last6=Tech|first6=Jaclyn|title=Soil-Landscape Estimation and Evaluation Program (SLEEP) to predict spatial distribution of soil attributes for environmental modeling|journal=International Journal of Architectural and Biological Engineering|date=2015|volume=8|issue=3|pages=158–172|doi=10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.1270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7577">Within the guidelines of '''[[halacha]]''', as presented by ''[[chazal]]'' and [[rishonim|early]] rabbinic authorities,''' [[fellatio]] '''is classified as ביאה דרך איברים (penetration by way of the limbs) or מעשה חידודים בעלמא (general acts of sharpening).

Peripheral halachic discussion of the topic revolves upon whether or not a husband may engage in varying sexually-gratifying acts with his wife – including fellatio – performed up to and including a complete extra-vaginal ejaculation.

The discussion includes the opinion of the permitting authorities limiting their permit to specific frequencies and timings, the consensus being that any halachic-permit ("''hetter''") is solely applicable within the exclusive framework of a [[Torah Laws|Torah]]-permitted marital relationship and strictly during the time that one's wife is not in her ''[[niddah]]'' state.

==Rambam==
The original Hebrew text of the ''[[Mishnah Torah]]'' of the [[Rambam]], as translated by [[Yosef Qafih]], shows the Rambam takes a lenient approach that permits all that a man desires to do with his wife. The presentation omits the customary [[Prohibition of extracting semen in vain (Judaism)|prohibition on extracting semen in vain]], which Qafih quarantines as an addition by a subsequent unknown editor. The Rambam's commentary to the [[Mishnah]] likewise hints at a lenient stance.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Mishna commentary to [[Tractate Sanhedrin]] [[s:he:רמב"ם על סנהדרין ז#משנה ד|7:4]] (..כל מה שרוצה לעשות באשתו עושה לפי שהענין..האסור והמותר אינן בענין המרוחק והשנוא והמרוצה והאהוב ומה שראוי לעשות מדרך הצניעות  ותכלית הפרישות)&lt;/ref&gt;

== On occasion ==

[[Chazal]] have in certain instances permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation in tandem with one's wife.&lt;ref&gt;The [[tannaim]] [[Rabbi Eliezer]] and [[Rabbi Meir]] ([[Tosefta]], Niddah 2:), for safety reasons (prior to the advent of female [[birth control]]) permits exterior ejaculation for a duration of 24 months post childbirth (Talmud Yebamoth 34).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tosefot]] cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak ([[Isaac ben Samuel]]) who permits an occasional complete extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife on condition that one does not accustom himself to ''always'' doing so (Tosfoth, [[Yebamot]]h [[s:he:יבמות לד ב#תוספות|34b]]; Tosfoth, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] [[s:he:סנהדרין נח ב#תוספות|58b]]). The ''Bayit Chadash'' ([[Yoel Sirkis]]) commentary to the [[Rabbeinu Asher]] (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the Tosafist opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Asher to Yebamoth ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion is likewise quoted in ''[[Tur Shulchan Aruch]]'', ''[[Even Ha'ezer]]'' ch. 25.

The ''Bayis Chodosh'' sourced his views based on the Talmudic tract of Yebamoth;

{{Quote|It isn't comparable to the action of Er and Onan only if one is accustomed to doing so all the time, but if it is performed on occasion when he desire his wife for non-vaginal relations—it is permitted ...as whatever a man desires to do with his wife he may as per the (''chazalic'') parable of meat that is acquired from the butcher and fish from the fisherman (Tractate [[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]], [[s:he:נדרים כ ב|20b]])|Hagahot HaBach to Tractate Yebamoth 34b}}

Thus Rabbenu Asher, followed by Rabbi [[Elijah Spira]], commented that an occasional exterior ejaculation in tandem with one's wife is not considered "extracting semen in vain" (and not banned by the Talmud) as long as the intention is not to avoid impregnating one's wife ''and'' it is done on occasion, as this is not likened to the desire of [[Onan]] who wished to avoid impregnating [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"Eliyah rabbah" to ch. 240 of Orach Chayim, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Aguddah]]'' work also sides with the lenient opinion permitting an occasional extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Agudah, p. 115 col. 2&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Rabbi Samuel Eidels (the [[Maharsha]]) likewise taking a lenient view.&lt;ref&gt;Maharsha to Talmud Nedarim 20a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parable of meat and fish==
In a varying text of [[Minor tractate|Kallah Rabthi]] as printed by Rabbi [[Solomon Aaron Wertheimer]] in "''Battei Medrashoth''",&lt;ref&gt;of the Cairo geniza: http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21179 vol. 1 p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Werthheimer notes the significance of the Talmud quoting both meat and fish in its parable depicting the enhanced permissiveness of sexually gratifying activities that one may perform with his wife;

Since the Torah forbids [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|cooking one's meat in milk]], a parable quoting just meat would not suffice as meat has this restrictive element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element, thus implying that man has an enhanced level of (sexual) freedom with his wife.

==As often as needed==
A more explicit permissive stance is that of the tosafist rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani|Isaiah di Trani the Elder]] who hints that a complete extra-vaginal ejaculation is permitted whenever needed to "seat" one's desire with the stark exclusion being to avoid pregnancy;

{{Quote|What was the (forbidden) action of Er and Onan that the torah prohibits? that committed with the intent of not diminishing her beauty (due to pregnancy) and he doesn't desire to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] of procreation (פרו ורבו) with her. But if his intent.. is for his inclination and to satisfy his desire and his intent is not to avoid impregnating her, it is permitted, ..he whose intent is to fulfill the desire of his inclination does not transgress as "all that a man wants to do with his wife he may do" (Tractate Nedarim, 20b) -and this isn't called "wasting his seed"|Tosfoth Ri"d to Tractate Yebamoth, p. 12b (Yad HaRav Herzog, Jerusalem)}}

Rabbi Isaiah the Elder's view is likewise echoed by his descendant, Rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ria"z", jerusalem 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms]], in his recently published Torah commentary to the verse "Adam and his wife, and where not embarrassed" (Genesis) permits any activity with one's wife necessary to "quiet (lit. seat)" his desire.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach to the Torah (J. Kluggman, Bnei Brak), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active participation===
Later rabbinic authorities differentiated between masturbation (self-extracting semen in vain) and an extra-vaginal ejaculation achieved with the active participation of one's Torah-permitted partner - with the former being forbidden under most if not all circumstances. Apparently, any halachic permit for an extra-vaginal ejaculation must be accompanied by the active participation of one's wife.

From among rabbis of the [[achronim]] era, the [[Tzemach Tzedek]] differentiated between extracting one's seed alone ("masturbation upon trees and stones") and extra-vaginal extracting of one's semen with the active participation of one's wife, with the latter classified as a form of a tandem relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa, ch. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">The '''Flory convention''' for defining the variables involved on modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from [[Cartesian coordinates]] (x,y,z) to [[generalized coordinates]]. It is named after [[nobel prize]]-winning [[Paul Flory]].&lt;ref name="Flory1941"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flory PJ |title=Molecular Size Distribution in Three-Dimensional Polymers: I, Gelation |journal=J.

As an example of its use, a [[peptide bond]] can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the [[bond length]]s &lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt;, [[bond angle]]s &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[dihedral angle]]s &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; (note that the sequence of dihedral angles is specified using angle 0 as ''trans''). Applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates will describe the same three-dimensional structure using the Flory convention.

The '''Great Transition''' is a term used by the Great Transition Initiative and its predecessor, the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), to describe a vision of a just and sustainable global future. The term was originally coined by [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in ''The Meaning of the 20th Century – The Great Transition'' (1964) and describes the shift from [[Pre-Modern|pre-modern]] to post-modern culture, and the four possible courses of action that these organizations believe will allow humanity to successfully manage the Great Transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u8YSAAAACAAJ}}|title=The Meaning of the 20th Century: The Great Transition|last=Boulding|first=Kenneth Ewart|publisher=University Press of America|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8191-7102-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elements of the Great Transition vision include egalitarian social and ecological values, increased inter-human connectivity, improved [[quality of life]], and a healthy planet, as well as the absence of poverty, war and environmental destruction. The Great Transition concept was cited by [[List of Prime Ministers of Bhutan|Prime Minister of Bhutan]] [[Jigme Thinley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Thinly, [http://www.cabinet.gov.bt/?page_id=207 "Address by the Prime Minister on Well-Being and Happiness,"] UN Headquarters, New York, April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Ryan-Collins of the [[New Economics Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;Josh Ryan-Collins, [http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/the-great-transition ''Great Transition''] (London: New Economics Foundation, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Capital Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisymposium.com/ The Capital Institute Symposium: "Beyond Sustainability: The Road to Regenerative Capitalism] New York, June 20–21, 2013, &lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a theme for the 2011 SmartCSOs conference on strategies for Civil Society Organisations in London.&lt;ref&gt;SmartCSOs, [http://www.veblen-institute.org/Effective-change-strategies-for ''Effective Change Strategies for the Great Transition: Five Leverage Points for Civil Society Organisations''] Berlin: Smart CSOs, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Great Transition was first introduced by the [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG), an international body of scientists convened in 1995 by the [[Tellus Institute]] and [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] to examine the requirements for a transition to a sustainable global society. The GSG set out to describe and analyze scenarios for the future of the earth as it entered a [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.gsg.org/gsgpub.html and Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, [http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''] (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Transition Initiative==

Further development of Great Transition scenarios is carried on by the [[Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI). Launched in 2003, GTI is a global network of several hundred scholars, intellectuals, civil society leaders, and activists working to develop visions and pathways for a “Great Transition" to a future of equity, solidarity and ecological sustainability. The Initiative was relaunched as an online journal and discussion network in 2014.

'''High-dynamic-range imaging''' ('''HDRI''') is a [[high dynamic range]] (HDR) technique used in imaging and [[photography]] to reproduce a greater [[dynamic range#Photography|dynamic range]] of [[luminosity]] than is possible with standard [[digital imaging]] or photographic techniques. The aim is to present a similar range of [[luminance]] to that experienced through the human [[visual system]]. The human eye, through [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and other methods, adjusts constantly to adapt to a broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can see in a wide range of light conditions.

HDR images can represent a greater range of luminance levels than can be achieved using more traditional methods, such as many real-world scenes containing very bright, direct sunlight to extreme shade, or very faint nebulae. This is often achieved by capturing and then combining several different, narrower range, [[Exposure (photography)|exposures]] of the same subject matter.&lt;ref name="mann1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mann1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Reinhard, Erik |author2=Ward, Greg |author3=Pattanaik, Sumanta |author4=Debevec, Paul |title=High dynamic range imaging: acquisition, display, and image-based lighting |year=2005 |quote=Images that store a depiction of the scene in a range of intensities commensurate with the scene are what we call HDR, or "radiance maps".

HDR images can also be acquired using special image sensors, such as an [[oversampled binary image sensor]].

Due to the limitations of printing and [[display contrast]], the extended luminosity range of an HDR image has to be compressed to be made visible. The method of rendering an HDR image to a standard monitor or printing device is called [[tone mapping]]. This method reduces the overall contrast of an HDR image to facilitate display on devices or printouts with lower dynamic range, and can be applied to produce images with preserved local contrast (or exaggerated for artistic effect).

In photography, dynamic range is measured in exposure value ([[exposure value|EV]]) differences (known as ''stops''). An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling of the amount of light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.
High-dynamic-range photographs are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using [[Bracketing#Exposure bracketing|exposure bracketing]], and then later merging them into a single HDR image, usually within a [[photo manipulation]] program). Digital images are often encoded in a camera's [[raw image format]], because 8-bit [[JPEG]] encoding does not offer a wide enough range of values to allow fine transitions (and regarding HDR, later introduces undesirable effects due to [[lossy compression]]).

Any camera that allows manual exposure control can make images for HDR work, although one equipped with [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] is far better suited. Images from film cameras are less suitable as they often must first be digitized, so that they can later be processed using software HDR methods.

In most imaging devices, the degree of exposure to light applied to the active element (be it film or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) can be altered in one of two ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the [[aperture]] or by increasing/decreasing the time of each [[exposure (photography)|exposure]]. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the '''exposure time''' and ''not'' the aperture size; this is because altering the aperture size also affects the [[depth of field]] and so the resultant multiple images would be quite different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.

An important limitation for HDR photography is that any movement between successive images will impede or prevent success in combining them afterward. Also, as one must create several images (often three or five and sometimes more) to obtain the desired [[luminance]] range, such a full 'set' of images takes extra time. HDR photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, but the use of a sturdy tripod is, at least, advised.

Some cameras have an [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] feature with a far greater dynamic range than others, from the 3 EV of the [[Canon EOS 40D]], to the 18 EV of the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Auto Exposure Bracketing by camera model |url=http://hdr-photography.com/aeb.html |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the popularity of this imaging method grows, several camera manufacturers are now offering built-in HDR features. For example, the [[Pentax K-7]] DSLR has an HDR mode that captures an HDR image and outputs (only) a tone mapped JPEG file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Pentax K-7: The era of in-camera High Dynamic Range Imaging has arrived! |url=http://www.adorama.com/alc/0011608/blogarticle/The-Pentax-K-7-The-era-of-in-camera-High-Dynamic-Range-Imaging-has-arrived |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canon PowerShot G12]], [[Canon PowerShot S95]] and [[Canon PowerShot S100]] offer similar features in a smaller format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canon PowerShot G12 picks up HD video recording, built-in HDR |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/cameras/canon-powershot-g12-picks-up-hd-video-recording-built-in-hdr/?news=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikon's approach is called 'Active D-Lighting' which applies exposure compensation and tone mapping to the image as it comes from the sensor, with the emphasis being on creating a realistic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Balancing Photo Exposures with Active D-lighting |url=http://www.nikonusa.com/en/learn-and-explore/a/ideas-and-inspiration/balancing-photo-exposures-with-nikons-active-d-lighting.html |accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[smartphone]]s provide HDR modes, and most [[mobile platform]]s have apps that provide HDR picture taking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/search?q=hdr%20mode&amp;c=apps HDR apps for Android] Google Play&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera characteristics such as [[Gamma correction|gamma curves]], sensor resolution, noise, [[photometry (optics)|photometric]] calibration and [[color calibration]] affect resulting high-dynamic-range images.&lt;ref name="SCV2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=High Dynamic Range |edition=First |author1=Asla M. Sá |author2=Paulo Cezar Carvalho |author3=Luiz Velho |publisher=Focal Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59829-562-7 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDsFgWPhWWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ISBN:+9781598295627#v=onepage&amp;q=ISBN%3A%209781598295627&amp;f=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color film negatives and slides consist of multiple film layers that respond to light differently. As a consequence, transparent originals (especially [[Reversal film|positive slides]]) feature a very high dynamic range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photo.net/learn/drange/ |title=Learn about Dynamic Range |publisher=photo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917173424/http://photo.net/learn/drange/ |archive-date=2011-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tone mapping ===
{{Main article|Tone mapping}}

Tone mapping reduces the dynamic range, or contrast ratio, of an entire image while retaining localized contrast. Although it is a distinct operation, tone mapping is often applied to HDRI files by the same software package.

Several software applications are available on the PC, Mac and Linux platforms for producing HDR files and tone mapped images. Notable titles include

=== Comparison with traditional digital images ===
Information stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of [[luminance]] or [[radiance]] that can be observed in the real world. This is different from traditional [[digital images]], which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called ''scene-referred'', in contrast to traditional digital images, which are ''device-referred'' or ''output-referred''. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human [[visual system]] (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called ''gamma encoding'' or ''[[gamma correction]]''. The values stored for HDR images are often [[gamma correction|gamma compressed]] ([[power law]]) or [[logarithm]]ically encoded, or [[floating point|floating-point]] linear values, since [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.&lt;ref name=gregward/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/picture_format.html |accessdate=2009-08-21 |title=The Radiance Picture File Format}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernando |first=Randima |title=GPU Gems |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2004 |chapter=26.5 Linear Pixel Values |url=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |isbn=0-321-22832-4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412001848/http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color [[channel (digital image)|channel]]—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range. For that purpose, they do not use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (''[[half precision]]'') or 32-bit [[floating point]] numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate [[transfer function]] is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a [[color depth]] that has as few as 10–12&amp;nbsp;bits for luminance and 8&amp;nbsp;bits for [[chrominance]] without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.&lt;ref name=gregward&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anyhere.com/gward/hdrenc/hdr_encodings.html |title=High Dynamic Range Image Encodings |author1=Greg Ward |author2=Anyhere Software }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/resources/hdrvideo/ |title=Perception-motivated High Dynamic Range Video Encoding |author=[[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of HDR photography ==

=== Mid 19th century ===
[[File:Gustave Le Gray - Brig upon the Water - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Photo by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]
The idea of using several exposures to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of [[luminance]] was pioneered as early as the 1850s by [[Gustave Le Gray]] to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.&lt;ref name=GettyExh&gt;[[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. [http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/le_gray Gustave Le Gray, Photographer. July 9&amp;nbsp;– September 29, 2002.] Retrieved September 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid 20th century ===
{{external media |image1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20170315033441/http://www.cybergrain.com/tech/hdr/images1/eugene_smith.jpg Schweitzer at the Lamp], by [[W. Eugene Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybergrain.com/tech/hdr/ The Future of Digital Imaging – High Dynamic Range Photography], Jon Meyer, Feb 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="durand"&gt;[http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/ArtAndScienceOfDepiction/ 4.209: The Art and Science of Depiction], Frédo Durand and Julie Dorsey, [http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/ArtAndScienceOfDepiction/12_Contrast/contrast.html Limitations of the Medium: Compensation and accentuation&amp;nbsp;– The Contrast is Limited], lecture of Monday, April 9. 2001, [http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/ArtAndScienceOfDepiction/12_Contrast/contrast6.pdf slide 57–59]; image on slide 57, depiction of dodging and burning on slide 58&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Manual tone mapping was accomplished by [[dodging and burning]]&amp;nbsp;– selectively increasing or decreasing the exposure of regions of the photograph to yield better tonality reproduction. This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph ''Schweitzer at the Lamp'' by [[W. Eugene Smith]], from his 1954 [[photo essay]] ''A Man of Mercy'' on Dr. [[Albert Schweitzer]] and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a dark shadow.&lt;ref name="durand"/&gt;

[[Ansel Adams]] elevated dodging and burning to an art form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called ''The Print,'' which prominently features dodging and burning, in the context of his [[Zone System]].

With the advent of color photography, tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response, or continued to shoot in black and white to use tone mapping methods.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Late 20th century ===
Georges Cornuéjols and licensees of his patents (Brdi, Hymatom) introduced the principle of HDR video image, in 1986, by interposing a matricial LCD screen in front of the camera's image sensor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19910924&amp;CC=US&amp;NR=5051770A&amp;KC=A#|title=Image processing device for controlling the transfer function of an optical system|last=|first=|date=|website=espacenet.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19870724&amp;CC=FR&amp;NR=2593295A1&amp;KC=A1#|title=Image processing device for controlling the transfer function of an optical system|last=|first=|date=|website=espacenet.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the sensors dynamic by five stops. The concept of neighborhood tone mapping was applied to video cameras by a group from the [[Technion]] in Israel led by Dr. Oliver Hilsenrath and Prof. Y.Y.Zeevi who filed for a patent on this concept in 1988.&lt;ref name="WDR Patent"&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |status=granted |number=5144442 |title=Wide dynamic range camera |pubdate=1992-09-01 |fdate=1991-11-21 |inventor=Ginosar, R., Hilsenrath, O., Zeevi, Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February and April 1990, Georges Cornuéjols introduced the first real-time HDR camera that combined two images captured by a sensor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19970610&amp;CC=US&amp;NR=5638119A&amp;KC=A#|title=Device for increasing the dynamic range of a camera|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19911011&amp;CC=FR&amp;NR=2660822A1&amp;KC=A1#|title=Device for increasing the dynamic range of a camera|last=|first=|date=|website=espacenet.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19970610&amp;CC=US&amp;NR=5638119A&amp;KC=A#|title=Camera with very wide dynamic range|last=|first=|date=|website=espacenet.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19910823&amp;CC=FR&amp;NR=2658685A1&amp;KC=A1#|title=Camera with very wide dynamic range|last=|first=|date=|website=espacenet.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by two sensors of the camera. This process is known as [[bracketing]] used for a video stream.

In 1991, the first commercial video camera was introduced that performed real-time capturing of multiple images with different exposures, and producing an HDR video image, by Hymatom, licensee of Georges Cornuéjols.

Also in 1991, Georges Cornuéjols introduced the HDR+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images to increase the sensitivity of the camera:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19970610&amp;CC=US&amp;NR=5638119A&amp;KC=A#|title=Device for increasing the dynamic range of a camera, column 5 of the published patent application|last=|first=|date=|website=espacenet.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for low-light environments, several successive images are accumulated, thus increasing the signal to noise ratio.

In 1993, another commercial medical camera  producing an HDR video image, by the Technion.&lt;ref name="AdaptiveSens"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Technion&amp;nbsp;– Israel Institute of Technology |title= Adaptive Sensitivity |url=http://visl.technion.ac.il/research/isight/AS/ |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern HDR imaging uses a completely different approach, based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations (across the entire image), and then [[tone mapping]] the result. Global HDR was first introduced in 1993&lt;ref name="mann1993"&gt;"Compositing Multiple Pictures of the Same Scene", by Steve Mann, in IS&amp;T's 46th Annual Conference, Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 9–14, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a mathematical theory of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter that was published in 1995 by [[Steve Mann]] and Rosalind Picard.&lt;ref name="mann1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wearcam.org/is_t95_myversion.pdf |title=On Being ‘Undigital’ With Digital Cameras: Extending Dynamic Range By Combining Differently Exposed Pictures |author1=S. Mann |author2=R. W. Picard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 1998, Ben Sarao created one of the first nighttime HDR+G (High Dynamic Range + Graphic image) of STS-95 on the
launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. It consisted of four film images of the shuttle at night that were digitally composited with additional digital graphic elements. The image was first exhibited at NASA Headquarters Great Hall, Washington DC in 1999 and then published in ''Hasselblad Forum'', Issue 3 1993, Volume 35 ISSN 0282-5449.&lt;ref name="sarao1999"&gt;{{cite book |work=Hasselblad Forum | issue=3 | year=1999 | volume=35 | issn=0282-5449 |title=Ben Sarao, Trenton, NJ |author=B. M. Sarao |editor=S. Gunnarsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of consumer digital cameras produced a new demand for HDR imaging to improve the light response of digital camera sensors, which had a much smaller dynamic range than film. [[Steve Mann]] developed and patented the global-HDR method for producing digital images having extended dynamic range at the MIT Media Laboratory.&lt;ref name="MannPatent"&gt;{{ref patent |country=US |number=5828793 |status=application |title=Method and apparatus for producing digital images having extended dynamic ranges |pubdate=1998-10-27 |fdate=1996-05-06 |inventor=Steve Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann's method involved a two-step procedure: (1) generate one floating point image array by global-only image operations (operations that affect all pixels identically, without regard to their local neighborhoods); and then (2) convert this image array, using local neighborhood processing (tone-remapping, etc.), into an HDR image. The image array generated by the first step of Mann's process is called a ''lightspace image'', ''lightspace picture'', or ''radiance map''. Another benefit of global-HDR imaging is that it provides access to the intermediate light or radiance map, which has been used for computer vision, and other image processing operations.&lt;ref name="MannPatent"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In 2005, [[Adobe Systems]] introduced several new features in [[Photoshop CS2]] including ''Merge to HDR'', 32 bit floating point image support, and HDR tone mapping.&lt;ref name="llcs2hdr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/hdr.shtml |title=Merge to HDR in Photoshop CS2 |accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2016, [[Microsoft]] added support for the digital compositing of HDR images to [[Windows 10]] using the [[Universal Windows Platform]].&lt;ref name="2016HDRphotographyWindows10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Microsoft talks up the advantages of HDR photography and videography in Universal Windows Platform apps |author=Kareem Anderson |publisher=winbeta.org |url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-talks-advantages-hdr-photography-videography-universal-windows-platform-apps |date=2016-06-30 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple exposures anomalies ===
This fast-moving subject captured by an Apple iPhone 6 benefited from HDR by exposing both the shaded grass and the bright sky. However, the merging of images from a fast moving golf swing lead to a ghost effect.

== HDR sensors ==
Modern CMOS image sensors can often capture a high dynamic range from a single exposure. The wide dynamic range of the captured image is non-linearly compressed into a smaller dynamic range electronic representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=High Dynamic Range Imaging: Sensors and Architectures |edition=First |author=Arnaud Darmont |publisher=SPIE press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-81948-830-5 |url=http://spie.org/x648.html?product_id=903927}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with proper processing, the information from a single exposure can be used to create an HDR image.

Such HDR imaging is used in extreme dynamic range applications like welding or automotive work. Some other cameras designed for use in security applications can automatically provide two or more images for each frame, with changing exposure {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. For example, a sensor for 30fps video will give out 60fps with the odd frames at a short exposure time and the even frames at a longer exposure time. Some of the sensors on modern phones and cameras may even combine the two images on-chip so that a wider dynamic range without in-pixel compression is directly available to the user for display or processing{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

While at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1962, [[Michel Hénon]] and [[Carl Heiles]] worked on the non-linear motion of a star around a galactic center with the motion restricted to a plane. In 1964 they published an article titled "The applicability of the third integral of motion: Some numerical experiments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Hénon, M. |author2=Heiles, C.
|title=The applicability of the third integral of motion: Some numerical experiments
|journal=The Astronomical Journal
|volume=69
|pages=73–79
|year=1964
|bibcode=1964AJ.....69...73H
|doi = 10.1086/109234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their original idea was to find a third [[integral of motion]] in a galactic dynamics. For that purpose they took a simplified two-dimensional nonlinear axi-symmetric potential and found that the third integral existed only for a limited number of initial conditions.
In the modern perspective the initial conditions that do not have the third integral of motion are called chaotic orbits.

==Introduction ==
The '''Hénon–Heiles potential''' can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|last = Hénon

|chapter = Numerical exploration of Hamiltonian Systems
|pages = 53–170

:&lt;math&gt;
V(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \lambda \left(x^2y - \frac{y^3}{3}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
The Hénon–Heiles [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; H = \frac12 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \lambda \left(x^2y - \frac{y^3}{3}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The Hénon–Heiles system (HHS) is defined by the following four equations:
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = p_x, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{p_x} = -x - 2\lambda xy, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{y} = p_y, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \dot{p_y} = -y - \lambda(x^2 - y^2).&lt;/math&gt;
In the classical chaos community, the value of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is usually taken as unity.   
Since HHS is specified in &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt;, we need a Hamiltonian with 2 degrees of freedom to model it.
It can be solved for some cases using [[Painlevé transcendents|Painlevé analysis]].

==Quantum Henon–Heiles Hamiltonian==
In the quantum case the Henon–Heiles [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] can be written as a two-dimensional [[Schrödinger equation]].

The corresponding two-dimensional Schrödinger equation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,y) = \left[ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + \frac12 (x^2 + y^2 ) + \lambda \left(x^2 y - \frac13 y^3\right) \right] \Psi(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

==Wada property of the exit basins ==
Hénon–Heiles system shows rich dynamical behavior. Usually the [[Wada property]] cannot be seen in the [[Hamiltonian system]], but Hénon–Heiles exit basin shows an interesting Wada property. It can be seen that when the energy is greater than the critical energy, the Hénon–Heiles system has three exit basins. In 2001 [[Miguel Angel Fernández Sanjuán|M. A. F. Sanjuán]]  et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wada basins and chaotic invariant sets in the Henon–Heiles system, Phys. Rev. E 64, 066208 (2001) |url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v64/i6/e066208}}&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that in the Hénon–Heiles system the exit basins have the Wada property.

'''''idem.''''' is a [[Latin]] term meaning "the same".  It is commonly [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''''id.''''',
which is particularly used in legal citations to denote the previously cited source (compare ''[[ibid.]]''). It is also used in academic citations to replace the name of a repeated author. 

''Id.'' is employed extensively in [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Law of Canada|legislation]] and in [[United states legislative branch|legal documents of the United States]] to apply a short description to a section with the same focus as the previous.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. 9th circuit appeals court|title=9th circuit appeals court - opinion of judges (9 Feb 2017) - State of Washington v. Donald J.Trump|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf|website=www.cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Id'' is masculine and neuter;  '''''ead.''''' (feminine), is the abbreviation for '''''eadem''''', which also translates to "the same". 

As an abbreviation, ''Id.'' always takes a period (or full stop) in both British and American usage (see [[Full stop#Abbreviations and personal titles of address|usage of the full stop in abbreviations]]). Its first known use dates back to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ''Idem'' |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idem |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary}}

==Use==
===Legal===
*''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte'', 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976).
*''Id.'' at 547.

Here, the first citation refers to the case of ''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte.'' The volume number cited is 428 and the page on which the case begins is 543, and the page number cited to is 545.  The "U.S." between the numerical portions of the citation refers to the ''[[United States Reports]]''. 1976 refers to the year that the case was published.  The second citation references the first citation and automatically incorporates the same reporter and volume number; however, the page number cited is now 547. ''Id.'' refers to the immediately preceding citation, so if the previous citation includes more than one reference, or it is unclear which reference ''Id.'' refers to, its usage is inappropriate.

* ''"...the Executive Order declares that “the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.” Id. It asserts, “Deteriorating..."'' (from page 2 of [http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf State of Washington v. Donald J. Trump])

Here, Id. refers to the Executive Order that was mentioned in the previous sentence.&lt;ref name="trump" /&gt;

===Academic===

*''Id.'' ''Astral Labyrinth: Archaeology of the Greek Sky''. Sutton Pub, 2003.

In this example, ''Id'' in the second citation indicates that the author is identical to that of the previous citation. That is, the author of the second citation is also Macgillivray, J. A.

'''Immunocomputing''' explores the principles of [[information processing]] that '''[[proteins]]''' and '''immune networks''' utilize in order to solve specific complex problems while protected from viruses, noise, errors and intrusions.

It intends to establish:

* A proper mathematical framework
* A new kind of [[computing]]
* A new kind of hardware

The main difference with other kinds of computing lay on the function of its ''basic element'', the '''formal protein''', defined according with its biological prototype and its [[mathematical model]]. 

The main [[biophysics|biophysical issues]] considered in immunocomputing are:

* Free '''[[Protein folding|folding]]''' to a stable state (inspiration for the Formal Protein)
* Free '''binding''' with other elements dependent on their reciprocal states (inspiration for the [[Immune network theory|Formal Immune Networks]])

'''Formal immune networks''' (FINs) have as closest model the ''idiotypic network'' of ''[[Niels Kaj Jerne|N. Jerne]]'' but they consider specific mechanisms of [[Protein-protein interaction|interactions between proteins]]. FINs are able to learn, recognize and solve problems.

'''Inclusion''', in [[education]] refers to the a model wherein [[special needs]] students spend most or all of their time with non-special (general education) needs students.  It arises in the context of special education with an [[individualized education program]] or [[504 plan]], and is built on the notion that it is more effective for students with special needs to have said mixed experience for them to be more successful in social interactions leading to further success in life.  Inclusion rejects but still provides the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities. Schools with inclusive classrooms do not believe in separate classrooms. They do not have their own separate world so they have to learn how to operate with students while being less focused on by teachers due to a higher student to teacher ratio.

Implementation of these practices varies.  Schools most frequently use the inclusion model for selected students with mild to moderate special needs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, K.E., Schwartz, I&lt;/ref&gt;  Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, do not separate "general education" and "special education" programs; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scheyer ''et al.'' (1996). The Inclusive Classroom Teacher Created Materials, Inc. ''[http://lib.syndetics.com/hw7.pl?isbn=1557348804/LC.JPG The Inclusive Classroom]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the 'integration' or '[[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreaming]]' model of education, which tended to be concerned principally with disability and special educational needs, and learners changing or becoming 'ready for' or deserving of accommodation by the mainstream.  By contrast, inclusion is about the child's right to participate and the school's duty to accept the child.

A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights.  Feeling included is not limited to physical and cognitive disabilities, but also includes the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and of other forms of human differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Inclusive Design|url=http://idrc.ocadu.ca/about-the-idrc|website=Inclusive Design Research Centre|publisher=OCAD University|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett wrote, "student performance and behaviour in educational tasks can be profoundly affected by the way we feel, we are seen and judged by others.  When we expect to be viewed as inferior, our abilities seem to diminish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Richard|last2=Pickett|first2=Kate|title=The Spirit Level- Why Equity is Better for Everyone|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|location=England|isbn=978-0-241-95429-4|pages=113|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and mainstreaming==
Inclusion has different historical roots which may be integration of students with severe disabilities in the US (who may previously been excluded from schools or even lived in institutions)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. &amp; Ferguson, D. (1985). A summary of strategies utilized in model programs and resource materials. In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Integration of Students with Severe Handicaps in Regular Schools''. Washington, DC: The Council for Exceptional Children.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schnorr, R. (1990). Peter? He comes and goes...First graders' perspectives on a part-time mainstream student. ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 15(4): 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. (1986, winter). Education Integration/Integracion Scolaire. ''Entourage'', 1(1): 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; or an inclusion model from Canada and the US (e.g., Syracuse University, New York) which is very popular with inclusion teachers who believe in participatory learning, cooperative learning, and inclusive classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sapon-Shevin, M., Ayres, B., &amp; Duncan, J. (1994). Cooperative learning and inclusion. In: J. S. Thousand, R.A. Villa, &amp; A.I. Nevins, ''Creativity and Collaborative Learning: A Practical Guide to Empowering Students and Teachers''. (pp. 45-58). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the early university 
  professor's work (e.g., 1970s, Education Professor Carol Berrigan of Syracuse University, 1985; Douglas Biklen, Dean of School of Education through 2011) in ''[[Educational integration|integration]]'' and ''mainstreaming''&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1985). ''Achieving the Complete School: Strategies for Effective Mainsreaming''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which were taught throughout the world including in international seminars in Italy. Mainstreaming (e.g., the Human Policy Press poster; If you thought the wheel was a good idea, you'll like the ramp)tended to be concerned about "readiness" of all parties for the new coming together of students with significant needs. Thus, integration and mainstreaming principally was concerned about disability and 'special educational needs' (since the children were not in the regular schools) and involved teachers, students, principals, administrators, School Boards, and parents changing and becoming 'ready for'&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, C., Palombaro, M., &amp; Hollowood, T. (1993). On the nature and change of an inclusive elementary school. ''JASH'', 18(2): 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt; students who needed accommodation or new methods of curriculum and instruction (e.g., required federal IEPs – [[individualized education program]])&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, P., Goetz, L., &amp; Anderson, J. (1986, Summer). The quality of IEP objectives associated with placement on integrated versus segregated school sites. ''The Journal of The Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 11(2): 125-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snell, M. &amp; Browder, D.M. (1986, Spring). Community-referenced instruction: Research and issues. ''JASH'', 11(1): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, P.S. (1994, Spring). Judgment of the social validity of instructional strategies used in community-based instructional sites. ''JASH'', 19(1): 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Table 6.3: Curriculum for students with severe handicaps. ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 134). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, A. &amp; Davern, L. (1989). Moving forward on school integration: Strategies for involving studennt with severe disabilities in the life of the school. In: R. Gaylord-Ross, ''Integration Strategies for Persons with Handicaps''. (pp. 11-31). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, inclusion is about the child’s right to participate and the school’s duty to accept the child returning to the US Supreme Court's Brown vs. the Board of Education decision and the new Individuals with Disabilities Education (Improvement) Act (IDEIA).  Inclusion rejects the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms, which remain popular among large multi-service providers, to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities.  A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities, in contrast to earlier concept of partial participation in the mainstream,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Schwarz, P., Udvari-Solner, A., Kampchroer, E., Johnson, F., Jorgensen, J., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1991, Spring). How much time should students with severe intellectual disabilities spend in regular education classrooms and elsewhere? ''JASH'', 16(1): 39-47.&lt;/ref&gt; and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights. Inclusion gives students with disabilities skills they can use in and out of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;"Students learn the importance of individual and group contributions and develop valuable life skills that are often unexplored in less inclusive settings" (Tapasak 216). Tapasak, Renee and Christine Walther-Thomas. "Evaluation of a First-Year Inclusion Program:Student Perceptions and Classroom Performance." Remedial and Special Education 20(1999): 216-225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fully inclusive schools and general or special education policies==
Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, no longer distinguish between "general education" and "[[special education]]" programs which refers to the debates and federal initiatives of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, W. (1989). The regular education initiative debate: Its promises and pitfalls. ''Exceptional Children'', 55(5): 440-446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, J. (1989).

''Exceptional Children'', 51: 102-11.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Community Integration Project&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, J. &amp; Meyer, L. (1986). Principles and practices for school integration of students with severe disabilities: An overview of the literature. In: M. Berres &amp; P. Knoblock, ''Managerial Models of Mainstreaming''. Rockville, MD: Aspen.&lt;/ref&gt; and the debates on home schools and special education-regular education classrooms;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Long, E., Udvari-Solner, A., Schwarz, P., VenDeventer, P., et al. (1989, Spring). Should students with severe intellectual disabilities be based in regular or in special education classrooms in home schools? ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 14(1): 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sailor, W. (1991, November/December). Special education in the restructured school. ''Remedial and Special Education'', 12(6): 8-22.&lt;/ref&gt; All approaches to inclusive schooling require administrative and managerial changes to move from the traditional approaches to elementary and high school education.&lt;ref&gt;Sage, D.D. (1996). Administrative strategies for achieving inclusive schooling. (pp. 105-116). In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion remains in 2015 as part of school (e.g., Powell &amp; Lyle, 1997, now to the most integrated setting from LRE)&lt;ref&gt;Powell, D. &amp; Hyle, A. (12997, May). Principals and school reform: Barriers to inclusion in three secondary schools. ''Journal of School Leadership'', Volume 7: 301-326&lt;/ref&gt; and educational reform initiatives in the US&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, T.G. (1989). Book Review of D. K. Liptsky and A. Gartner, ''School Reform for All Students: An Essay Review of Beyond Separate Education: Quality Education for All''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and other parts of the world. Inclusion is an effort to improve quality in education in the fields of disability, is a common theme in educational reform for decades,&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., (1999). ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 219). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006). Inclusion has been researched and studied for decades, though reported lighly in the public with early studies on heterogeneous and homogeneous ability groupings (Stainback &amp; Stainback, 1989),&lt;ref&gt;Stainback, W. &amp; Stainback, W. C. (1989). Classroom organization for diversity among students. In: D. Biklen, D. Ferguson &amp; Al Ford, ''Schooling and Disability''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; studies of critical friends and inclusion facilitators (e.g., Jorgensen &amp; Tashie, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C. &amp; Tashie, C. (2000).

Equity and excellence: Finding common ground between inclusive education and school reform. In: C. M. Jorgensen, ''Restructuring High School For All Students''. (pp. 15–28). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; among many others obtaining doctoral degrees throughout the US.

==Classification of students and educational practices==
Classification of students by disability is standard in educational systems which use diagnostic, educational and psychological testing, among others. However, inclusion has been associated with its own planning, including MAPS which Jack Pearpoint leads with still leads in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. &amp; Pearpoint, J.. (1992). MAPS: Action planning. (pp. 52–56). In: J. Pearpoint, M. Forest, &amp; J. Snow, ''The Inclusion Papers: Strategies to Make Inclusion Work''. Toronto, Canada: The Inclusion Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[person-centred planning]] with John O'Brien and Connie Lyle O'Brien who view inclusion as a force for school renewal.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. &amp; Lyle O'Brien, C. (1996). Inclusion as a force for school renewal. In : S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion has two sub-types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrE8sgg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |df= }} Definition of inclusion, accessed October 11, 2007.  2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; the first is sometimes called '''regular inclusion''' or '''partial inclusion''', and the other is '''full inclusion'''.&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;Bowe, Frank.  (2005).  ''Making Inclusion Work''.  Merrill Education/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inclusive practice'' is not always inclusive but is a form of integration.  For example, students with special needs are educated in regular classes for nearly all of the day, or at least for more than half of the day.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Whenever possible, the students receive any additional help or special instruction in the general classroom, and the student is treated like a full member of the class. However, most specialized services are provided outside a regular classroom, particularly if these services require special equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class (such as [[speech therapy]]), and students are pulled out of the regular classroom for these services.  In this case, the student occasionally leaves the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services, such as speech and language therapy, [[occupational therapy|occupational]] and/or [[physical therapy]], psychological services, and social work.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; This approach can be very similar to many [[mainstreaming in education|mainstreaming]] practices, and may differ in little more than the educational ideals behind it.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;

In the "full inclusion" setting, the students with special needs are always educated alongside students without special needs, as the first and desired option while maintaining appropriate supports and services. Some educators say this might be more effective for the students with special needs.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology&gt;"Understanding Psychology Eighth Edition", Feldman, Robert S. (2008), page 309. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the extreme, full inclusion is the integration of all students, even those that require the most substantial educational and behavioral supports and services to be successful in regular classes and the elimination of special, segregated special education classes.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt; Special education is considered a service, not a place and those services are integrated into the daily routines (See, ecological inventories) and classroom structure, environment, curriculum and strategies and brought to the student, instead of removing the student to meet his or her individual needs. However, this approach to full inclusion is somewhat controversial, and it is not widely understood or applied to date.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Student teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of children with special needs. Educational Psychology,'' Hastings. R.P., &amp; Oakford, S. (2003), page 23, 87-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mainstreaming to full inclusion: From orthogenesis to pathogenesis of an idea. International Journal of Disability, Development, and Education,'' Kavale, K.A. (2002), page 49, 201-214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Attitudes of elementary school principals toward the inclusion of students with disabilities. Exceptional Children,'' Praisner, C. L. (2003), page 69, 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much more commonly, local educational agencies have the responsibility to organize services for children with disabilities. They may provide a variety of settings, from special classrooms to mainstreaming to inclusion, and assign, as teachers and administrators often do, students to the system that seems most likely to help the student achieve his or her individual educational goals.  Students with mild or moderate disabilities, as well as disabilities that do not affect academic achievement, such as using power [[wheelchair]], scooter or other mobility device, are most likely to be fully included; indeed, children with polio or with leg injuries have grown to be leaders and teachers in government and universities; self advocates travel across the country and to different parts of the world. However, students with all types of disabilities from all the different disability categories (See, also 2012 book by Michael Wehmeyer from the University of Kansas) have been successfully included in general education classes, working and achieving their individual educational goals in regular school environments and activities (reference needed).

===Alternatives to inclusion programs: school procedures and community development===
Students with disabilities who are not included are typically either mainstreamed or segregated.

A [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] student attends some general education classes, typically for less than half the day, and often for less academically rigorous, or if you will, more interesting and career-oriented classes.  For example, a young student with significant [[intellectual disabilities]] might be mainstreamed for physical education classes, art classes and storybook time, but spend reading and mathematics classes with other students that have similar disabilities ("needs for the same level of academic instruction"). They may have access to a [[resource room]] for remediation or enhancement of course content, or for a variety of group and individual meetings and consultations.

A segregated student attends no classes with non-disabled students with disability a tested category determined before or at school entrance.  He or she might attend a [[special school]] termed residential schools that only enrolls other students with disabilities, or might be placed in a dedicated, self-contained classroom in a school that also enrolls general education students.  The latter model of integration, like the 1970s Jowonio School in Syracuse, is often highly valued when combined with teaching such as [[Montessori education]] techniques. Home schooling was also a popular alternative among highly educated parents with children with significant disabilities.

Residential schools have been criticized for decades, and the government has been asked repeatedly to keep funds and services in the local districts, including for family support services for parents who may be currently single and raising a child with significant challenges on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). ''Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All''. Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Children with special needs may already be involved with early childhood education which can have a [[family support]] component emphasizing the strengths of the child and family.&lt;ref&gt;Dunst, C.J. &amp; Trivette, C.M. (2012). Capacity-building family-system intervention practices. (pp. 33–57). In: G.H. S. Singer, Biegel, D.E. &amp; Conway, P., ''Family Support and Family Caregiving across Disabilities''. London &amp; NY, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some students may be confined to a hospital due to a medical condition (e.g., cancer treatments) and are thus eligible for tutoring services provided by a school district.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C., Schuh, M., &amp; Nisbet, J. (2005). The inclusion facilitator's guide. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  Less common alternatives include [[homeschooling]]&lt;ref name="NCES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/TableDisplay.asp?TablePath=TablesHTML/table_4.asp|title=Homeschooling in the United States: 2003 - Table 4: Number and percentage of homeschooled students whose parents reported particular reasons for homeschooling as being applicable to their situation and as being their most important reason for homeschooling: 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trentin G. &amp; Benigno V.

==Legal issues: education law and disability laws==
The new anti-discriminatory climate has provided the basis for much change in policy and statute, nationally and internationally. Inclusion has been enshrined at the same time that segregation and discrimination have been rejected. Articulations of the new developments in ways of thinking, in policy and in law include:
* The UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) which sets out children’s rights in respect of freedom from discrimination and in respect of the representation of their wishes and views.
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] of [[UNESCO]] prohibits any discrimination, [[social exclusion|exclusion]] or [[racial segregation|segregation]] in education.
* The [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/inclusive-education/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921043927/http://www.unesco.org/en/inclusive-education/ |archivedate=September 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salamanca Statement (1994) which calls on all governments to give the highest priority to inclusive education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/SALAMA_E.PDF ''Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs.''] (PDF-File, 198 KB)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (2006) which calls on all States Parties to ensure an inclusive education system at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml ''Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities''], Article 24 – Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the least restrictive to the most integrated setting===
For [[special education in the United States|schools in the United States]], the federal requirement that students be educated in the historic [[least restrictive environment]] that is [[reasonable]] encourages the implementation of inclusion of students previously excluded by the school system.&lt;ref&gt;Karp, N. &amp; Taylor, S.J. (1988). ''The Least Restrictive Environment and Community Integration: A Leadership Institute''. Washington, DC and Syracuse, NY: National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation and Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, M., Blacher, J., Duffy, S., Hardman, M., McDonnell, J., Nisbet, J., Safer, N., &amp; Snell, M. (2005). Effective education in the least restrictive environment. In: K.C. Lakin &amp; A. Turnbull, ''National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities''. Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and the American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a critical critique of the LRE principle, commonly used to guide US schools, indicates that it often places restrictions and segregation on the individuals with the most severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. (1988, Spring). Caught in the continuum: A critical analysis of the principles of the least restrictive environment. ''JASH'', 13(1): 41-53.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, individuals with significant disabilities and their families and caregivers were already living quality lives in homes and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Racino, J., Knoll, J., &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M. (1987). ''The Least Restrictive Environment: On Community Integration of Persons with the Most Severe Disabilities''. Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheerenberger, R. (1988, June). Review of the nonrestrictive environment: On community integration of persons with the most severe disabilities. ''Mental Retardation'', 167-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Biklen, D. &amp; Knoll, J. (1987). ''Community Integration for Persons with Severe Disabilities''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Luckily, the US Supreme Court has now ruled in the Olmstead Decision (1999) that the new principle is that of the "most integrated setting",&lt;ref&gt;Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities. (2012). ''Olmstead Implementation and the Concept of the Most Integrated Setting''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; as described by the national Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, which should result in better achievement of national integration and inclusion goals in the 21st Century.

==Inclusion rates in the world: "frequency of use"==
The proportion of students with disabilities who are ''included'' varies by place and by type of disability, but it is relatively common for students with milder disabilities and less common with certain kinds of severe disabilities.  In Denmark, 99% of students with [[learning disabilities]] like 'dyslexia' are placed in general education classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vouchers Help the Learning Disabled:  Lesson from 22 countries: Special-education students thrive in private schools

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, three out of five students with learning disabilities spend the  majority of their time in the general education classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Cortiella, C. (2009). [http://www.ncld.org/stateofld The State of Learning Disabilities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706072327/http://www.ncld.org/stateofld |date=2009-07-06 }} New York, NY: National Center for Learning Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postsecondary statistics (after high school) are kept by universities and government on the success rates of students entering college, and most are eligible for either disability services (e.g., accommodations and aides) or programs on college campuses, such as supported education in psychiatric disabilities or College for Living. The former are fully integrated college degree programs with college and vocational rehabilitation services (e.g., payments for textbooks, readers or translators), and the latter courses developed similar to retirement institutes (e.g., banking for retirees).

==Principles and necessary resources==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}Although once hailed,{{By whom|date=August 2016}} usually by its opponents, as a way to increase achievement while decreasing costs, full inclusion does not save money, but is more cost-beneficial and cost-effective. It is not designed to reduce students' needs, and its first priority may not even be to improve academic outcomes; in most cases, it merely moves the special education professionals (now dual certified for all students in some states) out of "their own special education" classrooms and into a corner of the general classroom or as otherwise designed by the "teacher-in-charge" and "administrator-in-charge".  To avoid harm to the academic education of students with disabilities, a full panoply of services and resources is required (of education for itself), including:&lt;ref&gt;This list from the [[Utah Education Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate supports and services for the student
* Well-designed [[individualized education program]]s
* Professional development for all teachers involved, general and special educators alike
* Time for teachers to plan, meet, create, and evaluate the students together
* Reduced class size based on the severity of the student needs
* Professional skill development in the areas of cooperative learning, peer tutoring, adaptive curriculum
* Collaboration between parents or guardians, teachers or para educators, specialists, administration, and outside agencies.
* Sufficient funding so that schools will be able to develop programs for students based on student need instead of the availability of funding.
Indeed, the students with special needs do receive funds from the federal government, by law originally the Educational for All Handicapped Children Act of 1974 to the present day, Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which requires its use in the most integrated setting.

In principle, several factors can determine the success of inclusive classrooms:
* Family-school partnerships
* Collaboration between general and special educators
* Well-constructed plans that identify specific accommodations, modifications, and goals for each student
* Coordinated planning and communication between "general" and "special needs" staff
* Integrated service delivery
* Ongoing training and staff development
* Leadership of teachers and administrators

By the mid-1980s, school integration leaders in the university sector already had detailed schemas (e.g., curriculum, student days, students with severe disabilities in classrooms) with later developments primarily in assistive technology and communication, school reform and transformation, personal assistance of user-directed aides, and increasing emphasis on social relationships and cooperative learning.  In 2015, most important are evaluations of the populations still in special schools, including those who may be deaf-blind, and the leadership by inclusion educators, who often do not yet go by that name, in the education and community systems.

===Differing views of inclusion and integration===
However, early integrationists{{Who|date=August 2016}} [[community integration]] would still recommend greater emphasis on programs related to sciences, the arts (e.g., exposure), curriculum integrated field trips, and literature as opposed to the sole emphasis on community referenced curriculum. For example, a global citizen studying the environment might be involved with planting a tree ("independent mobility"), or going to an arboretum ("social and relational skills"), developing a science project with a group ("contributing ideas and planning"), and having two core modules in the curriculum.

However, students will need to either continue to secondary school (meet academic testing standards), make arrangements for employment, supported education, or home/day services (transition services), and thus, develop the skills for future life (e.g., academic math skills and calculators; planning and using recipes or leisure skills) in the educational classrooms. Inclusion often involved individuals who otherwise might be at an institution or residential facility.

Today, longitudinal studies follow the outcomes of students with disabilities in classrooms, which include college graduations and quality of life outcomes. To be avoided are negative outcomes that include forms of institutionalization.

==Common practices in inclusive classrooms==
Students in an inclusive classroom are generally placed with their chronological age-mates, regardless of whether the students are working above or below the typical academic level for their age.  Also, to encourage a sense of belonging, emphasis is placed on the value of friendships. Teachers often nurture a relationship between a student with special needs and a same-age student without a special educational need. Another common practice is the assignment of a [[wikt:buddy|buddy]] to accompany a student with special needs at all times (for example in the cafeteria, on the playground, on the bus and so on). This is used to show students that a diverse group of people make up a community, that no one type of student is better than another, and to remove any barriers to a friendship that may occur if a student is viewed as "helpless." Such practices reduce the chance for elitism among students in later grades and encourage cooperation among groups.&lt;ref&gt;Strully, J., &amp; Strully, C. (1996). Friendships as an educational goal: What we have learned and where we are headed. In W. Stainback &amp; S. Stainback (Eds.), ''Inclusion: A guide for educators''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers use a number of techniques to help build classroom communities:
* Using games designed to build community
* Involving students in solving problems
* Sharing songs and books that teach community
* Openly dealing with individual differences by discussion
* Assigning classroom jobs that build community
* Teaching students to look for ways to help each other
* Utilizing [[physical therapy]] equipment such as [[standing frames]], so students who typically use wheelchairs can stand when the other students are standing and more actively participate in activities
* Encouraging students to take the role of teacher and deliver instruction (e.g. read a portion of a book to a student with severe disabilities)
* Focusing on the strength of a student with special needs
* Create classroom checklists
* Take breaks when necessary
* Create an area for children to calm down
* Organize student desk in groups
* Create a self and welcoming environment
* Set ground rules and stick with them
* Help establish short-term goals
* Design a multi-faced curriculum
* Communicate regular with parents and/or caregivers
* Seek support from other special education teachers

'''Inclusionary practices are commonly utilized by using the following team-teaching models:'''
* One teach, one support:
In this model, the content teacher will deliver the lesson and the special education teacher will assist students individual needs and enforce classroom management as needed.
* One teach, one observe:
In this model, the teacher with the most experience in the content will deliver the lesson and the other teacher will float or observe.  This model is commonly used for data retrieval during IEP observations or Functional Behavior Analysis.
* Station teaching (rotational teaching):
In this model, the room is divided into stations in which the students will visit with their small groups.  Generally, the content teacher will deliver the lesson in his/her group, and the special education teacher will complete a review or adapted version of the lesson with the students.
* Parallel teaching:
In this model, one half of the class is taught by the content teacher and one half is taught by the special education teacher.  Both groups are being taught the same lesson, just in a smaller group.
* Alternative teaching:
In this method, the content teacher will teach the lesson to the class, while the special education teacher will teach a small group of students an alternative lesson.
* Team teaching (content/support shared 50/50):
Both teachers share the planning, teaching, and supporting equally.  This is the traditional method, and often the most successful co-teaching model.

===Children with extensive support needs===
For children with significant or severe disabilities, the programs may require what are termed health supports (e.g., positioning and lifting; visit to the nurse clinic), direct one-to-one aide in the classroom, assistive technology, and an individualized program which may involve the student "partially" (e.g., videos and cards for "visual stimulation"; listening to responses)in the full lesson plan for the "general education student". It may also require introduction of teaching techniques commonly used (e.g., introductions and interest in science) that teachers may not use within a common core class.

Another way to think of health supports are as a range of services that may be needed from specialists, or sometimes generalists, ranging from speech and language, to visual and hearing (sensory impairments), behavioral, learning, orthopedics, autism, deaf-blindness, and traumatic brain injury, according to Virginia Commonwealth University's Dr. Paul Wehman.&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. (1997). ''Exceptional Individuals in School, Community and Work''. Austin, TX: PRO-ED.&lt;/ref&gt; As Dr. Wehman has indicated, expectations can include post secondary education, supported employment in competitive sites, and living with family or other residential places in the community.

In 2005, comprehensive health supports were described in National Goals for Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities as universally available, affordable and promoting inclusion, as supporting well-informed, freely chose health care decisions, culturally competent, promoting health promotion, and insuring well trained and respectful health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, D., Bacon, A., Birenbaum, A., Campbell, V., Cerreto, M., Corbin, S., Crocker, A., Krahn, G., McClain, C., McDermott, Nehring, W., Pietrangelo, R., Rader, R., Spitalnik, D. &amp; White-Scott, S.(2005). Comprehensive health support and health promotion. (pp.109-124).  In: K. C. Lakin &amp; A. Turnbull, ''National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities''. Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mental health, behavioral, communication and crisis needs may need to be planned for and addressed.
 
"Full inclusion" – the idea that all children, including those with severe disabilities, can and should learn in a regular classroom has also taken root in many school systems, and most notably in the province of New Brunswick.

==Collaboration among the professions==
Inclusion settings allow children with and without disabilities to play and interact every day, even when they are receiving therapeutic services. When a child displays fine motor difficulty, his ability to fully participate in common classroom activities, such as cutting, coloring, and zipping a jacket may be hindered.  While occupational therapists are often called to assess and implement strategies outside of school, it is frequently left up to classroom teachers to implement strategies in school. Collaborating with occupational therapists will help classroom teachers use intervention strategies and increase teachers' awareness about students' needs within school settings and enhance teachers' independence in implementation of occupational therapy strategies.

As a result of the 1997 re-authorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals With Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA), greater emphasis has been placed on delivery of related services within inclusive, general education environments. [Nolan, 2004] The importance of inclusive, integrated models of service delivery for children with disabilities has been widely researched indicating positive benefits. [Case-Smith&amp; Holland, 2009] In traditional "pull out" service delivery models, children typically work in isolated settings one on one with a therapist, Case-Smith and Holland(2009) argue that children working on skills once or twice a week are "less likely to produce learning that leads to new behaviors and increased competence." [Case Smith &amp;Holland, 2009, pg.419]. In recent years, occupational therapy has shifted from the conventional model of "pull out" therapy to an integrated model where the therapy takes place within a school or classroom.

Inclusion administrators have been requested to review their personnel to assure mental health personnel for children with mental health needs, vocational rehabilitation linkages for work placements, community linkages for special populations (e.g., "deaf-blind", "autism"), and collaboration among major community agencies for after school programs and transition to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., Destefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policy''. Sycamore, IL: Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schall, C. &amp; McFarland-Whisman, J. (2009). Meeting transition goals through inclusion. (pp.95-110). In: P. Wehman, Datlow-Smith, M. &amp; Schall, C., ''Autism and the Transition to Adulthood: Success Beyond the Classroom''. Sydney, Australia: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly recommended are collaborations with parents, including parent-professional partnerships in areas of cultural and linguistic diversity (e.g., Syracuse University's special education Ph.D.'s Maya Kaylanpur and Beth Harry).

==Selection of students for inclusion programs in schools==
Educators generally say that some students with special needs are not good candidates for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Doug. "Transformation Ahead for Special Education"  ''The Arizona Republic.'' 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Many schools expect a fully included student to be working at or near [[grade level]], but more fundamental requirements exist:  First, being included requires that the student is able to attend [[school]].  Students that are entirely excluded from school (for example, due to long-term hospitalization), or who are educated outside of schools (for example, due to enrollment in a [[distance education]] program) cannot attempt inclusion.

Additionally, some students with special needs are poor candidates for inclusion because of their effect on other students.  For example, students with severe behavioral problems, such that they represent a serious physical danger to others, are poor candidates for inclusion, because the school has a duty to provide a safe environment to all students and staff.

Finally, some students are not good candidates for inclusion because the normal activities in a general education classroom will prevent them from learning.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  For example, a student with severe attention difficulties or extreme [[sensory processing disorder]]s might be highly distracted or distressed by the presence of other students working at their desks. Inclusion needs to be appropriate to the child's unique needs.

Most students with special needs do not fall into these extreme categories, as most students do attend school, are not violent, do not have severe sensory processing disorders, etc.

The students that are most commonly included are those with physical disabilities that have no or little effect on their academic work ([[diabetes mellitus]], [[epilepsy]], [[food allergies]], [[paralysis]]), students with all types of mild disabilities, and students whose disabilities require relatively few specialized services.

Bowe says that regular inclusion, but not full inclusion, is a reasonable approach for a significant majority of students with special needs.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  He also says that for some students, notably those with severe [[autism spectrum]] disorders or [[mental retardation]], as well as many who are [[deaf]] or have multiple disabilities, even regular inclusion may not offer an appropriate education.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Teachers of students with autism spectrum disorders sometimes use antecedent procedures, delayed contingencies, self-management strategies, peer-mediated interventions, [[pivotal response training]] and naturalistic teaching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to progressive education ==
Some advocates of inclusion promote the adoption of [[progressive education]] practices.  In the progressive education or inclusive classroom, everyone is exposed to a "rich set of activities", and each student does what he or she can do, or what he or she wishes to do and learns whatever comes from that experience. [[Maria Montessori]]'s schools are sometimes named as an example of inclusive education.

Inclusion requires some changes in how teachers teach, as well as changes in how students with and without special needs interact with and relate to one another.  Inclusive education practices frequently rely on active learning, [[Authentic assessment|authentic assessment practices]], applied curriculum, multi-level instructional approaches, and increased attention to diverse student needs and individualization.

sometimes it is not necessary that there will always be a positive environment and therefore a lot of attention of the teachers is also required along with the support of other children which will ensure a peaceful and happy place for both kinds of children.

==Arguments for full inclusion in regular neighborhood schools==
Advocates say that even partial non-inclusion is morally unacceptable.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;Stainback, W., &amp; Stainback, S. (1995). ''Controversial Issues Confronting Special Education''. Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents believe that non-inclusion reduces the disabled students' social importance and that maintaining their social visibility is more important than their academic achievement. Proponents say that society accords disabled people less [[human dignity]] when they are less visible in general education classrooms. Advocates say that even if typical students are harmed academically by the full inclusion of certain special needs students, that the non-inclusion of these students would still be morally unacceptable, as advocates believe that the harm to typical students' education is always less important than the social harm caused by making people with disabilities less visible in society.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;

A second key argument is that everybody benefits from inclusion. Advocates say that there are many children and young people who don't fit in (or feel as though they don't), and that a school that fully includes all disabled students feels welcoming to all. Moreover, at least one author has studied the impact a diversified student body has on the general education population and has concluded that students with mental retardation who spend time among their peers show an increase in social skills and academic proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Trainer, M. (1991). ''Differences in common: Straight talk on mental retardation, Down Syndrome, and life''. Rockville, MD" Woodbine house.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for inclusion say that the long-term effects of typical students who are included with special needs students at a very young age have a heightened sensitivity to the challenges that others face, increased empathy and compassion, and improved leadership skills, which benefits all of society.&lt;ref&gt;Giangreco, M.F., Cloninger, C.J., &amp; Iverson, V.S.(1998). Choosing outcomes and accommodations for Children (COACH): A guide to educational planning for students with disabilities (2nd ed.). Baltimore: Paul H Brookes Publishing Co&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of inclusion and pull-out (partial inclusion) services has been shown to be beneficial to students with learning disabilities in the area of reading comprehension, and preferential for the special education teachers delivering the services.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Douglas. ''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 30, No. 2, 121–132 (1996)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education can be beneficial to all students in a class, not just students with special needs. Some research show that inclusion helps students understand the importance of working together, and fosters a sense of tolerance and empathy among the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, R.M. (2004). The effects of cooperative learning on junior high school students during small group learning. ''Learning and Instruction'' there are inclusion units and other rooms in some schools which focus on these aspects, 14(2), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive effects in regular classrooms==
There are many positive effects of inclusions where both the students with special needs along with the other students in the classroom both benefit. Research has shown positive effects for children with disabilities in areas such as reaching individualized education program (IEP) goal, improving communication and social skills, increasing positive peer interactions, many educational outcomes, and post school adjustments.  Positive effects on children without disabilities include the development of positive attitudes and perceptions of persons with disabilities and the enhancement of social status with non-disabled peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, T., Deluca, D., &amp; Bruns, D. (1997). Putting inclusion into practice: perspectives of teachers and parents. ''Exceptional Children,'' 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Several studies have been done on the effects of inclusion of children with disabilities in general education classrooms. A study on inclusion compared integrated and segregated (special education only) preschool students. The study determined that children in the integrated sites progressed in social skills development while the segregated children actually regressed.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, P., &amp; Carey, D. (1995). The Sociometric status of students with disabilities in a full-inclusion school. ''Exceptional Children,'' 62.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Another study shows the effect on inclusion in grades 2 to 5.  The study determined that students with specific learning disabilities made some academic and affective gains at a pace comparable to that of normal achieving students.  Specific learning disabilities students also showed an improvement in [[self-esteem]] and in some cases improved motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji, M., &amp; Dailey, R. (1995). A Study of the effects of an inclusion model on students with specific learning disabilities. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' 28(8), 511-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third study shows how the support of peers in an inclusive classroom can lead to positive effects for children with [[autism]].  The study observed typical inclusion classrooms, ages ranging from 7 years old to 11 years old.  The peers were trained on an intervention technique to help their fellow autistic classmates stay on task and focused.  The study showed that using peers to intervene instead of classroom teachers helped students with autism reduce off-task behaviors significantly.  It also showed that the typical students accepted the student with autism both before and after the intervention techniques were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Use of a peer support intervention for promoting academic engagement of students with autism in general education settings|last = McCurdy|first = E.

L.|volume = 44|issue = 4|pages = 883–893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of inclusion programs of school districts==
Critics of full and partial inclusion include educators, administrators and parents. Full and partial inclusion approaches neglect to acknowledge the fact that most students with significant special needs require individualized instruction or highly controlled environments.  Thus, general education classroom teachers often are teaching a curriculum while the special education teacher is remediating instruction at the same time.  Similarly, a child with serious inattention problems may be unable to focus in a classroom that contains twenty or more active children. Although with the increase of incidence of disabilities in the student population, this is a circumstance all teachers must contend with, and is not a direct result of inclusion as a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Barkley, R.A. (1998). ''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorders: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full inclusion may be a way for schools to placate parents and the general public, using the word as a phrase to garner attention for what are in fact illusive efforts to educate students with special needs in the general education environment.&lt;ref&gt;JM Kauffman, DP Hallahan.''The Illusion of Full Inclusion: A Comprehensive Critique of a Current Special Education Bandwagon''. PRO-ED, Inc., 8700 Shoal Creek Blvd., Austin, TX 78757-6897&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study examined the lack of individualized services provided for students with IEPs when placed in an inclusive rather than mainstreamed environment.&lt;ref&gt;Espin, C.A.Individualized Education Programs in Resource and Inclusive Settings.''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 32, No. 3, 164–174 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have maintained school districts neglect to prepare general education staff for students with special needs, thus preventing any achievement. Moreover, school districts often expound an inclusive philosophy for political reasons, and do away with any valuable pull-out services, all on behalf of the students who have no so say in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Laurence M. ''Preserving Special Education''. Weston: Nobb Hill Press Inc, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion is viewed by some as a practice philosophically attractive yet impractical.  Studies have not corroborated the proposed advantages of full or partial inclusion. Moreover, "push in" servicing does not allow students with moderate to severe disabilities individualized instruction in a [[resource room]], from which many show considerable benefit in both learning and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Resource Rooms for Children with Specific Learning Disabilities Lawrence H. Weiner Journal of Learning Disabilities, Apr 1969; vol. 2: pp. 223 - 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents of disabled students may be cautious about placing their children in an inclusion program because of fears that the children will be ridiculed by other students, or be unable to develop regular life skills in an academic classroom.&lt;ref&gt;This information provided by SEDL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that inclusive schools are not a cost-effective response when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions, such as [[special education]].  They argue that special education helps "fix" the special needs students by providing individualized and personalized instruction to meet their unique needs.  This is to help students with special needs adjust as quickly as possible to the mainstream of the school and community.  Proponents counter that students with special needs are not fully into the mainstream of student life because they are secluded to special education.  Some argue that isolating students with special needs may lower their self-esteem and may reduce their ability to deal with other people.  In keeping these students in separate classrooms they aren't going to see the struggles and achievements that they can make together. However, at least one study indicated [[mainstreaming in education]] has long-term benefits for students as indicated by increased test scores,&lt;ref&gt;van den Bos, K.P., Nakken, H., Nicolay, P.G.,&amp; van Houten, E.J. (2007). Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: Can their reading comprehension ability be improved? ''Journal of Intellectual Disability Research'', 51(11), 830–845.&lt;/ref&gt; where the benefit of inclusion has not yet been proved.

== Broader approach: social and cultural inclusion ==
As used by UNESCO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf|title=Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; inclusion refers to far more than students with special educational needs.  It is centered on the inclusion of  marginalized groups, such as religious, racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities, immigrants, girls, the poor, students with disabilities, HIV/AIDS patients, remote populations, and more.  In some places, these people are not actively included in education and learning processes.&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines"&gt;UNESCO (2009) Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education. UNESCO: Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. this broader definition is also known as "culturally responsive" education, which differs from the 1980s-1990s cultural diversity and cultural competency approaches,&lt;ref&gt;Harry, B. (1992). ''Cultural Diversity, Families and the Special Education System''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, T.B., Bazron, B. &amp; Dennis, K. W. (1989). ''Towards Culturally Competent System of Care''. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Child Development Center.&lt;/ref&gt; and is promoted among the ten equity assistance centers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/equitycenters/index.html|title=Training and Advisory Services - Equity Assistance Centers|date=1 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the U.S. Department of Education, for example in Region IX (AZ, CA, NV), by the Equity Alliance at ASU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equityallianceatasu.org/|title=Home - The Equity Alliance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]]&lt;ref name="Gloria Ladson-Billings"&gt;Ladson-Billings, B. (1992). Reading between the lines and beyond the pages: A culturally relevant approach to literacy teaching.  Theory Into Practice, 31(4), 312-320.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that teachers who are culturally responsive know how to base learning experiences on the cultural realities of the child (e.g. home life, community experiences, language background, belief systems). Proponents argue that [http://ea.niusileadscape.org/lc/Record/137?search_query=Culturally%20Responsive culturally responsive pedagogy] is good for all students because it builds a caring community where everyone's experiences and abilities are valued.

Proponents want to maximize the participation of all learners in the community schools of their choice and to rethink and restructure policies, curricula, cultures and practices in schools and learning environments so that diverse learning needs can be met, whatever the origin or nature of those needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bps.org.uk/downloadfile.cfm?file_uuid=CE1DCB9D-1143-DFD0-7EA9-5C1B82EA4596&amp;ext=doc British Psychological Society position statement on inclusive education&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that all students can learn and benefit from education, and that schools should adapt to the physical, social, and cultural needs of students, rather than students adapting to the needs of the school. Proponents believe that individual differences between students are a source of richness and diversity, which should be supported through a wide and flexible range of responses. The challenge of rethinking and restructuring schools to become more culturally responsive calls for a complex systems view of the educational system (e.g.see Michael Patton&lt;ref name="Developmental Evaluation"&gt;Patton, M. (2011). Developmental evaluation: Applying complexity concepts to enhance innovation and use. New York, NY, The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;), where one can extend the idea of strength through diversity to all participants in the educational system (e.g. parents, teachers, community members, staff).

Although inclusion is generally associated with elementary and secondary education, it is also applicable in postsecondary education.  According to UNESCO, inclusion "is increasingly understood more broadly as a reform that supports and welcomes diversity amongst all learners."&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines" /&gt;  Under this broader definition of inclusion, steps should also be taken to eliminate discrimination and provide accommodations for all students who are at a disadvantage because of some reason other than disability.

===Benefiting in an inclusive environment===
"The inclusion of age-appropriate students in a general education classroom, alongside those with and without disability is beneficial to both parties involved. (Waitoller and Thorius) With inclusive education, all students are exposed to the same curriculum, they develop their own individual potential, and participate in the same activities at the same time. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which learning takes place because students learn differently, at their own pace and by their own style. (Carter, Moss, Asmus, Fesperman, Cooney, Brock, Lyons, Huber, and Vincent) Effectively, inclusive education provides a nurturing venue where teaching and learning should occur despite pros and cons. It is evident that students with disabilities benefit more in an inclusive atmosphere because they can receive help from their peers with diverse abilities and they compete at the same level due to equal opportunities given."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4785">'''[[Urban studies]]''' is the diverse range of disciplines and approaches to the study of all aspects of cities, their suburbs, and other urban areas. This includes among others: [[urban economics]], [[urban planning]], [[urban ecology]], urban transportation systems, [[urban politics]], [[sociology]] and urban social relations. This can be contrasted with the study of [[rural]] areas and [[rural lifestyle]]s.

'''Irruptive growth''', sometimes called '''Malthusian growth''', is a growth pattern over time, defined by [[Human overpopulation|population explosions]] and subsequent sharp population crashes, or diebacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of Population Genetics and Evolutionary Ecology|first=J.|last= Roughgarden|authorlink=Joan Roughgarden|year=1996|publisher= Prentice-Hall, Inc.|isbn=0-13-441965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extension of the [[Malthusian growth model]], specifically the growth pattern that causes a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], and can occur when populations overshoot their [[carrying capacity]], a phenomenon typically associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]]. Populations which exhibit irruptive growth do not stabilize around their carrying capacity, a feature of [[logistic function|logistic growth]]. Irruptive growth occurs when a species reproduces more rapidly than the environment is capable of supporting with the available resources.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/06-2032.1 |title=Irruptive Population Dynamics in Yellowstone Pronghorn|accessdate= 26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irruptive growth is studied in [[population ecology]].

An '''irruption''' is any sudden change in the population density of an organism.

==K-strategist and r-strategist species==
{{main|r/K selection theory}}
r-strategist species (species that evolve according to r-selection) are characterized by rapid development, early reproduction, small body size, and shorter lifespans, whereas [[r/K selection theory|K-strategist]] species (species that evolve according to K-selection) exhibit slow development, delayed reproduction, large body size, and longer lifespans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Population Ecology: First Principles|author=John H. Vandermeer and Deborah E. Goldberg|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11440-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the main two [[evolution]]ary strategies for ensuring the continuation of the species by passing down its [[Genetics|genetic code]]. 

r-strategist species have variable population sizes and are more likely to exhibit irruptive growth than K-strategist species, whose populations are usually constant and remain at or close to the carrying capacity of the environment. r-selection leads to high productivity, while K-selection leads to high efficiency. Productivity refers to the number of offspring produced, whereas efficiency refers to the quality and the probability of survival of individual offspring. 

The [[Human|human species]] is K-strategist; that is, each mating pair has a small number of offspring, of which the majority will survive to adulthood and reach reproductive age. Reproductive age is later in life for K-strategists. r-strategist species, such as some [[insect]]s, have very large numbers of offspring, the majority of which will die before reaching physical maturity. If there is a change in their environment, more of these offspring may survive than is typical, leading to irruptive growth. 

Because of these differences in the number of offspring produced between K- and r-strategists, K-strategist species are more likely to have stable populations and less likely to exhibit irruptive growth.

==Malthusian growth==
{{main|Malthusian growth model}}
One exception to the general rule of K-strategists being less likely to exhibit irruptive growth is people. As Thomas Malthus described in his essay on the [[An Essay on the Principle of Population|Principle of Population]], human overpopulation is a serious issue, and one which can only become more pressing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Essay on the Principle of Population|author=Thomas Malthus|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to our advanced mental capacity, humans have succeeded in maximizing the carrying capacity of the environment through the invention of higher-yielding crops and transportation to get food from where it is produced to where it is needed for consumption&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11520695 |title=The Malthus Blues|accessdate=26 September 2011 | work=The Economist|date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the world's population continues to rise, and the capacity of the current food supply to adequately provide for all the people on earth is called ever more into doubt. Thus, we may become one of the few K-strategist species to experience a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

==In mammal populations==
Populations of some species tend to initially show a lack of response to density-dependent factors that limit population size as it nears carrying capacity. The exhibition of Malthusian growth is dependent on a number of elements including resource availability, degree of both interspecific and intraspecific competition, and strength of [[predator-prey]] relationships.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/06-2032.1 |title=Irruptive Population Dynamics in Yellowstone Pronghorn|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irruptive growth patterns are seen in a few mammal species, often in specific locations, and they are usually herbivores with relatively small body size. In cases where a single herbivore prey species is dominant in an ecosystem, there is likely to be a strong link with predator species, which serves to prevent un-checked population growth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing predator-prey theory by studying fluctuating populations of small mammals|author=S. Boutin|year=1995|journal=Wildl. Res.|volume=22|pp=89–100 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.575.6975&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.575.6975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits and house mice of Australia tend to show irruptive growth, likely because when a drought ends, they reproduce at a rapid rate and continue to breed at that rate while predator reproduction is still seasonal in occurrence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; This allows for the population to explode and to be limited more by a return of dry conditions than by predators.

Larger herbivores like [[pronghorn]] and [[Cervidae|deer]] are also known to exhibit irruptive growth; this occurs in populations with high reproduction and delayed density dependent inhibition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; The time that a species is most likely to irrupt in population growth is when a population is first inhabiting an area or when predators are first removed, and both weather and food supplies are in the species' favor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; When an area is being colonized, populations of species can grow rapidly and predator species are often not present to limit growth. Resource availability is not an issue either for colonizing populations, which will also experience little intraspecific and interspecific competition in early settlement of a location.

Similar to white-tailed deer in North America, roe deer in European locations have shown increases in abundance even in the face of already extremely high densities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Irruptive potential in roe deer: Density-dependent effects on body mass and fertility|author=R. Andersen |author2=D. C. L. John|year=2000|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|volume= 64|issue=3|pp=698–706|doi=10.2307/3802739|jstor=3802739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deer are able to irrupt and continue to increase in density over their carrying capacity because in particular areas especially, populations show delayed response to density dependent factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt;  The mammal species that exhibit Malthusian growth are the ones that, under certain conditions, act more like r-strategists than K-strategists compared to surrounding populations.

[[File:St John the Baptist, Great East Window of York Minster, by John Thornton.jpg|thumb|right|Thornton's depiction of [[St John the Baptist]], from the Great East Window of [[York Minster]], showing his characteristic treatment of faces]]
'''John Thornton''' of [[Coventry]] ([[floruit|fl]]. 1405-1433) was a master [[glazier]] and [[stained glass]] artist active in England during the 15th century. The output of his workshop includes some of the finest English medieval glass.

==Biography==
The first certain record of Thornton, apart from a possible 1371 reference in Coventry, is his 1405 contract with the Dean of [[York Minster]] to glaze the choir east window.&lt;ref name=sge180&gt;Marks, R. ''Stained Glass in England during the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 1993, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of York]] at the time was [[Richard le Scrope]], a former [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]], and the window was funded by [[Walter Skirlaw]], also previously Bishop of Coventry, so it seems possible both men would have recommended Thornton based on their knowledge of his work in his home town.

Thornton was made a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of York in 1410, but was known to be back living in the St John's Bridges area of Coventry (now known as Burges&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16006&lt;/ref&gt;) by 1413. He appears again in 1433, when he received further payment from the dean and chapter of York, and was recorded as holding property there.&lt;ref name="sge180"/&gt;

It has been suggested, though without any strong evidence, that Thornton was the son of a "John Coventre", a glazier in the royal glass-painting workshops at Westminster in 1351 and 1352, who later assisted in setting up windows at [[Windsor Castle]] for [[Edward III of England]]. Thornton could have worked as an assistant to his father before rising to the position of designer and draughtsman.&lt;ref name=nq&gt;Knowles, J. 'John Thornton of Coventry', ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 140, 481&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Thornton was instrumental in disseminating the [[International Gothic]] style in the north and Midlands of England. The products of his workshop can be recognised by their favouring of white glass and [[silver nitrate|yellow stain]] set against blue and ruby "seaweed"-patterned backgrounds, and by the very distinctive modelling of faces.&lt;ref name=sge183&gt;Marks, p.183. Thornton's treatment of faces was expressive, using relatively heavy shading, and generally features small mouths and rather elongated noses with a bulbous tip.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thornton's masterpiece is the Great East Window of York Minster, the largest in the building and containing about {{convert|1680|sqft|m2}} of glass. According to the contract, much of the work was to be executed by his own hand, though specifically only to "pourtray [...] the histories, images, and other things to be painted on the [window]"; evidently some of the glazing would be carried out by apprentices or workmen.&lt;ref name=blair280&gt;Blair, J and Ramsay, N. ''English Medieval Industries'', CIP, 1991, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton is likely to have recruited glaziers locally in York: he seems to have been an enthusiastic teacher, and his style quickly became dominant in the area.&lt;ref name=marks182&gt;Marks, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Work thought to be by Thornton can also be found in several smaller churches, as well as in [[St Mary's Guildhall|St Mary's Hall]] in Coventry. His surviving windows for [[Coventry Cathedral]] were removed before it was destroyed in the [[Coventry Blitz]] and have been preserved.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2002/08/cathedral-stained-glass.shtml A rare glimpse of unseen cathedral stained glass]'', [[BBC]], 23-08-02&lt;/ref&gt; He is also thought to have produced the windows from the chapel at [[Hampton Court, Herefordshire]], which are now dispersed in various collections, and seven panels in the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent]].

The Thornton 'tradition' continued in York even after the middle of the 15th century, though many of the works produced show a coarsening or loss of quality compared with Thornton's authentic creations.&lt;ref name=sge185186&gt;Marks, pp.185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linguistic anthropology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study of how language influences social life. It is a branch of [[anthropology]] that originated from the endeavor to document [[endangered language]]s, and has grown over the past century to encompass most aspects of [[language structure]] and use.&lt;ref name="Duranti2004"&gt;Duranti, Alessandro (ed.), 2004: [https://books.google.com/books?id=3jMmmQjssaEC ''Companion to Linguistic Anthropology''], Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropology explores how language shapes communication, forms social identity and group membership, organizes large-scale cultural beliefs and ideologies, and develops a common cultural representation of natural and [[social world]]s.&lt;ref name="SLA"&gt;Society for Linguistic Anthropology. n.d. [http://www.linguisticanthropology.org/about/ About the Society for Linguistic Anthropology] (accessed 7 July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct [[paradigm]]s.These paradigms set the ways of approaching linguistic anthropology: the first, now known as "[[anthropological linguistics]]", focuses on the documentation of languages; the second, known as "linguistic anthropology", engages in theoretical studies of language use; the third, developed over the past two or three decades, studies issues from other sub-fields of anthropology with linguistic tactics. Though they developed sequentially, all three paradigms are still practiced today.&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;Duranti, Alessandro. 2003. Language as Culture in U.S. Anthropology: Three Paradigms. ''Current Anthropology'' 44(3):323–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Paradigm: Anthropological linguistics===
{{main|Anthropological linguistics}}
The first paradigm is known as anthropological linguistics. The field is devoted to themes unique to the sub-discipline: documentation of [[language]]s that were then seen as doomed to [[extinction]], with special focus on the languages of native North American tribes. It is also the paradigm most focused on linguistics.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt; The themes include:

* Grammatical description,
*[[Linguistic typology|Typological classification]] and
*[[Linguistic relativity]]

===Second Paradigm: Linguistic anthropology===
 The second paradigm can be marked by the switch from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology, signalling a more anthropological focus on the study. This term was coined by [[Dell Hymes]], who was also responsible for the idea of [[ethnography]] of [[communication]].  This term was Hymes' vision for the future of linguistic anthropology, where language would be studied in the context of the situation, and relative to the community speaking it.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt; This new era would involve many of the new technological developments, such as mechanical recording.

Hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology, the first of which was a new [[unit of analysis]]. Unlike the first paradigm, which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of [[phoneme]]s and [[morpheme]]s, the second paradigm's unit of analysis was the "speech event". A speech event is an event defined by speech occurring during it (ex. a lecture, debate). This is different from a speech situation, where speech could possibly occur (ex. dinner). Hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to [[ethnopoetics]]. Hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology. However, Hymes' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Bauman"&gt;Bauman, Richard. 1977. "Verbal Art as Performance." ''American Anthropologist'' 77:290–311. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1975.77.2.02a00030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hymes1981"&gt;Hymes, Dell. 1981 [1975] Breakthrough into Performance. In ''In Vain I Tried to Tell You: Essays in Native American Ethnopoetics''. D. Hymes, ed. Pp. 79–141. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third Paradigm: Anthropological issues studied via linguistic methods and data ===
The third paradigm, which began in the late 1980s, refocused on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues. Rather than focusing on exploring language, third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture with linguistic tools. Themes include:

* investigations of personal and social [[Identity (social science)|identities]]
* shared [[Ideology|ideologies]]
* construction of [[narrative]] in interactions among individuals

Furthermore, like how the second paradigm made use of new technology in its studies, the third paradigm heavily includes use of video documentation to support research.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt;

== Areas of interest ==
Contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above: documentation of languages, study of language through context, and study of identity through linguistic means. The third paradigm, the study of anthropological issues, is a particularly rich area of study for current linguistic anthropologists.

===Identity and intersubjectivity===
A great deal of work in linguistic anthropology investigates questions of sociocultural [[cultural identity|identity]] linguistically and discursively. Linguistic anthropologist [[Don Kulick]] has done so in relation to identity, for example, in a series of settings, first in a village called Gapun in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Kulick1992&gt;Kulick, Don. 1992. ''Language Shift and Cultural Reproduction: Socialization, Self and Syncretism in a Papua New Guinea Village''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He explored how the use of two languages with and around children in Gapun village: the traditional language ([[Taiap language|Taiap]]), not spoken anywhere but in their own village and thus primordially "indexical" of Gapuner identity, and [[Tok Pisin]], the widely circulating official language of New Guinea. ("indexical" points to meanings beyond the immediate context.)&lt;ref name=Silverstein1976&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1976. Shifters, Linguistic Categories, and Cultural Description. In ''Meaning in Anthropology''. K. Basso and H.A. Selby, eds. Pp. 11–56. Albuquerque: School of American Research, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To speak the [[Taiap language]] is associated with one identity: not only local but "Backward" and also an identity based on the display of *hed* (personal autonomy). To speak Tok Pisin is to [[Indexicality|index]] a modern, Christian (Catholic) identity, based not on *hed* but on *save*, an identity linked with the will and the skill to cooperate. In later work, Kulick demonstrates that certain loud speech performances in Brazil called *um escândalo*, Brazilian ''travesti'' (roughly, 'transvestite') sex workers shame clients. The travesti community, the argument goes, ends up at least making a powerful attempt to transcend the shame the larger Brazilian public might try to foist off on them, again by loud public discourse and other modes of [[performance]].&lt;ref name=Kulick&amp;Klein&gt;Kulick, Don, and Charles H. Klein. 2003. Scandalous Acts: The Politics of Shame among Brazilian Travesti Prostitutes. In ''Recognition Struggles and Social Movements: Contested Identities, Agency and Power''. B. Hobson, ed. Pp. 215–238. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, scholars such as [[Émile Benveniste]]&lt;ref&gt;Benveniste, Emile. 1971. Problems in general linguistics. Miami: University of Miami Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Mary Bucholtz]] and [[Kira Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz, M., &amp; Hall, K. 2005. Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach. Discourse Studies, 7(4–5), 585–614.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Lee (academic)|Benjamin Lee]]&lt;ref&gt; Lee, Benjamin. 1997. Talking Heads: Language, Metalanguage, and the Semiotics of Subjectivity. Durham: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Paul Kockelman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kockelman, Paul. 2004. Stance and Subjectivity. Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 14(2), 127–150.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Stanton Wortham]]&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Stanton. 2006. Learning identity: The joint emergence of social identification and academic learning. New York, NY, US: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (among many others) have contributed to understandings of identity as "intersubjectivity" by examining the ways it is discursively constructed.

===Socialization===
In a series of studies, linguistic anthropologists [[Elinor Ochs]] and [[Bambi Schieffelin]] addressed the anthropological topic of [[socialization]] (the process by which infants, children, and foreigners become members of a community, learning to participate in its culture), using linguistic and other ethnographic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, Elinor. 1988. ''Culture and language development: Language acquisition and language socialization in a Samoan village''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
*Ochs, Elinor, and Bambi Schieffelin. 1984. Language Acquisition and Socialization: Three Developmental Stories and Their Implications. In ''Culture Theory: Essays on Mind, Self, and Emotion''. R. Shweder and R.A. LeVine, eds. Pp. 276–320. New York: Cambridge University.
*Ochs, Elinor, and Carolyn Taylor. 2001. The “Father Knows Best” Dynamic in Dinnertime Narratives. In ''Linguistic Anthropology: A Reader''. A. Duranti, ed. Pp. 431–449. Oxford. Malden, MA: Blackwell.
*Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1990. ''The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that the processes of [[enculturation]] and socialization do not occur apart from the process of [[language acquisition]], but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that [[baby talk]] is not [[universal proposition|universal]], that the direction of adaptation (whether the child is made to adapt to the ongoing situation of speech around it or vice versa) was a variable that correlated, for example, with the direction it was held vis-à-vis a caregiver's body. In many societies caregivers hold a child facing outward so as to orient it to a network of kin whom it must learn to recognize early in life.

Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that members of all societies socialize children both ''to'' and ''through'' the use of language. Ochs and Schieffelin uncovered how, through naturally occurring stories told during dinners in white [[middle class]] households in [[Southern California]], both mothers and fathers participated in replicating [[Patriarchy|male dominance]] (the "father knows best" syndrome) by the distribution of participant roles such as protagonist (often a child but sometimes mother and almost never the father) and "problematizer" (often the father, who raised uncomfortable questions or challenged the competence of the protagonist). When mothers collaborated with children to get their stories told, they unwittingly set themselves up to be subject to this process.

Schieffelin's more recent research has uncovered the socializing role of [[pastor]]s and other fairly new Bosavi converts in the [[Southern Highlands, Papua New Guinea]] community she studies.&lt;ref name=Schieffelin1995&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1995. Creating evidence: Making sense of written words in Bosavi. ''Pragmatics'' 5(2):225–244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2000. Introducing Kaluli Literacy: A Chronology of Influences. In ''Regimes of Language''. P. Kroskrity, ed. Pp. 293–327. Santa Fe: School of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2002&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2002. Marking time: The dichotomizing discourse of multiple temporalities. ''Current Anthropology'' 43(Supplement):S5-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2006&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2006. PLENARY ADDRESS: Found in translating: Reflexive language across time and texts in Bosavi, PNG. Twelve Annual Conference on Language, Interaction, and Culture, University of California, Los Angeles, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastors have introduced new ways of conveying knowledge,  new linguistic [[epistemic]] markers&lt;ref name=Schieffelin1995/&gt;—and new ways of speaking about time.&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2002/&gt; And they have struggled with and largely resisted those parts of the Bible that speak of being able to know the inner states of others (e.g. the [[gospel of Mark]], chapter 2, verses 6–8).&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2006/&gt;

===Ideologies===
In a third example of the current (third) paradigm, since [[Roman Jakobson]]'s student [[Michael Silverstein]] opened the way, there has been an efflorescence of work done by linguistic anthropologists on the major anthropological theme of [[ideologies]],&lt;ref name=Silverstein1979&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1979. Language Structure and Linguistic Ideology. In ''The Elements: A Parasession on Linguistic Units and Levels''. R. Cline, W. Hanks, and C. Hofbauer, eds. Pp. 193–247. Chicago: Chicago Linguistic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;—in this case "[[language ideology|language ideologies]]", sometimes defined as "shared bodies of [[commonsense]] notions about the nature of language in the world."&lt;ref name=Rumsey&gt;Rumsey, Alan. 1990. "Word, meaning, and linguistic ideology." ''American Anthropologist'' 92(2):346–361. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1990.92.2.02a00060}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silverstein has demonstrated that these ideologies are not mere [[false consciousness]] but actually influence the evolution of linguistic structures, including the dropping of "[[thee]]" and "[[thou]]" from everyday [[English language|English]] usage.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1985. Language and the Culture of Gender: At the Intersection of Structure, Usage, and Ideology. In ''Semiotic Mediation: Sociocultural and Psychological Perspectives''. E. Mertz and R. Parmentier, eds. Pp. 219–259. Orlando: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolard, in her overview of "[[Code-switching|code switching]]", or the systematic practice of alternating linguistic varieties within a conversation or even a single utterance, finds the underlying question anthropologists ask of the practice—Why do they do that?—reflects a dominant linguistic ideology. It is the ideology that people should "really" be monoglot and efficiently targeted toward referential clarity rather than diverting themselves with the messiness of multiple varieties in play at a single time.&lt;ref&gt;Woolard, Kathryn A. 2004. Codeswitching. In ''Companion to Linguistic Anthropology''. A. Duranti, ed. Pp. 73–94. Malden: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much research on linguistic ideologies probes subtler influences on language, such as the pull exerted on Tewa, a Kiowa-Tanoan language spoken in certain New Mexican pueblos and on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, by "kiva speech", discussed in the next section.&lt;ref&gt;Kroskrity, Paul V. 1998. Arizona Tewa Kiva Speech as a Manifestation of Linguistic Ideology. In ''Language ideologies: Practice and theory''. B.B. Schieffelin, K.A. Woolard, and P. Kroskrity, eds. Pp. 103–122. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other linguists have carried out research in the areas of [[language contact]], [[language endangerment]], and '[[English as a global language]]'. For instance, Indian linguist [[Braj Kachru]] investigated local varieties of English in South Asia, the ways in which [[English as a lingua franca|English functions as a lingua franca]] among multicultural groups in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Braj B. Kachru|title=Asian Englishes: Beyond the Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TTW-AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7|year=2005|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-665-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; British linguist David Crystal has contributed to investigations of [[language death]] attention to the effects of cultural assimilation resulting in the spread of one dominant language in situations of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Crystal|title=Language Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8K0BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-43181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social space===
In a final example of this third paradigm, a group of linguistic anthropologists have done very creative work on the idea of social space. Duranti published a groundbreaking article on [[Samoan language|Samoan]] [[greetings]] and their use and transformation of social space.&lt;ref name=Duranti1992&gt;Duranti, Alessandro. 1992. "Language and Bodies in Social Space: Samoan Greetings." ''American Anthropologist'' 94:657–691. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1992.94.3.02a00070}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, Indonesianist Joseph Errington, making use of earlier work by Indonesianists not necessarily concerned with language issues per se, brought linguistic anthropological methods (and [[semiotic]] theory) to bear on the notion of the exemplary center, the center of political and ritual power from which emanated exemplary behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Errington, J. Joseph. 1988.  ''Structure and Style in Javanese: A Semiotic View of Linguistic Etiquette''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Errington demonstrated how the [[Java]]nese *[[priyayi]]*, whose ancestors served at the Javanese royal courts, became emissaries, so to speak, long after those courts had ceased to exist, representing throughout Java the highest example of "refined speech." The work of Joel Kuipers develops this theme vis-a-vis the island of [[Sumba]], [[Indonesia]]. And, even though it pertains to [[Tewa people|Tewa]] Indians in [[Arizona]] rather than Indonesians, [[Paul Kroskrity]]'s argument that speech forms originating in the Tewa [[kiva]] (or underground ceremonial space) forms the dominant model for all Tewa speech can be seen as a direct parallel.

Silverstein tries to find the maximum theoretical significance and applicability in this idea of exemplary centers. He feels, in fact, that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology's three most important findings. He generalizes the notion thus, arguing "there are wider-scale institutional 'orders of interactionality,' historically contingent yet structured. Within such large-scale, macrosocial orders, in-effect [[ritual]] centers of [[semiosis]] come to exert a structuring, [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]-conferring influence on any particular event of discursive [[Social interaction|interaction]] with respect to the meanings and significance of the verbal and other semiotic forms used in it."&lt;ref name=Silverstein2004&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 2004. {{"'}}Cultural' Concepts and the Language-Culture Nexus." ''Current Anthropology'' 45(5):621–652.&lt;/ref&gt; Current approaches to such classic anthropological topics as ritual by linguistic anthropologists emphasize not static linguistic structures but the unfolding in realtime of a {{"'}}hypertrophic' set of parallel orders of [[iconicity]] and indexicality that seem to cause the ritual to create its own sacred space through what appears, often, to be the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] of textual and nontextual metricalizations, synchronized."&lt;ref name=Silverstein2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilce, James M. 2006. Magical Laments and Anthropological Reflections: The Production and Circulation of Anthropological Text as Ritual Activity. ''Current Anthropology''. 47(6):891–914.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race, Class, and Gender===
Addressing the broad central concerns of the subfield and drawing from its core theories, many scholars focus on the intersections of language and the particularly salient social constructs of race (and ethnicity), class, and gender (and sexuality). These works generally consider the roles of social structures (e.g., ideologies and institutions) related to race, class, and gender (e.g., marriage, labor, pop culture, education) in terms of their constructions and in terms of individuals' lived experiences. A short list of linguistic anthropological texts that address these topics follows:

'''Marine Transfer Operations''' are conducted at many ports around the world between '''tanker ships, barges, and marine terminals'''. Specifically, once the marine vessel is secure at the dock a [[loading arm]] or transfer hose is connected between a valve header on the dock and the manifold header on the vessel. A marine transfer of petroleum products cannot be conducted unless it is supervised by a '''person-in-charge (PIC)''' on the vessel who is seafarer in the [[Merchant Marine]] and another person-in-charge on the dock.

== Person-in-charge ==
The person-in-charge on the dock is called a [[Loading master]]-PIC and the person-in charge on the barge will be the '''Tankerman-PIC.''' The person-in-charge on a tanker ship will be the '''[[deck officer]]''' who monitors the transfer of product in the '''cargo control room'''. All persons-in-charge must have special training in order to obtain the proper credentials such as licensing and endorsement on their merchant mariner documents.
[[Image:TugBargesCCC17Ap06.jpg|thumb|300px|Inland Tug and Barge]]

== Marine surveyor ==

Loading Masters work closely with the marine surveyor in agreeing to the sequence of the transfer. Such as whether any product sampling will take place prior to commencement, determining if a line displacement will occur, agreeing on whether the final stop at completion will either be a shore stop or a draft stop on the vessel. The marine surveyor gauges the vessel's tanks and shore tanks to ensure the correct amount of product is transferred. Additionally, the surveyor or inspector will obtain product samples on the marine vessel and shore tank for laboratory analysis to ensure that the product meets all specifications of purity.

== Regulations ==
Transfer operations and commencement of a transfer is highly regulated throughout the world with consideration of the environment with potential of [[water pollution]] occurring if petroleum product is released into the water during the transfer. Federal, state, and local laws must be observed during marine transfer operations. 

[[Maritime Security (USCG)]], [[occupational safety and health]] regulations must be adhered to in addition to environmental regulations during marine transfer operations. These regulation's are enforced by local state port control organizations such as the United States Coast Guard in the United States.

==Marine transfer operators==

A marine transfer operation occurs between three main stakeholders which includes the Loading Master-PIC, Vessel Person-In -Charge PIC, and marine surveyor or inspector. These individuals communicate prior to the transfer agreeing on the sequence of events that will occur before, during, and after the transfer. During the course of the transfer the Loading Master is in continuous two way radio contact with the vessel Person-In-Charge and standing by to stop the transfer immediately if any problems develop such as leaks at the transfer hose or loading arm.

[[File:Christopher Walken - 1984.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Christopher Walken]] performing a monologue in the 1984 stage play ''[[Hurlyburly]]'']]
In [[theatre]], a '''monologue''' (from {{lang-el|μονόλογος}}, from μόνος ''mónos'', "alone, solitary" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech") is a speech presented by a single [[character (arts)|character]], most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the [[audience]]. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ([[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|title=The Greatest Movie Speeches/Monologues of all time!|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401000758/http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |title=Dramatic Monologue: An Introduction |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807215608/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophes]], and [[asides|asides]]. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

==Similar literary devices==
Monologues are similar to [[Poetry|poems]], epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706041614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare |publisher=Pleasanton.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902062728/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a [[dialogue]] interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|title=The Making of Theatre History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1988|isbn=978-0-13-547861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1939 |pages=1–23|jstor=264065}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=April 1939 |pages=116–126|jstor=264823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other monologue types included "entrance monologues"&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt; and exit monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exit Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology|volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 1942 |pages=1–21 |jstor=264367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt;

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geis|first=Deborah R.|title=Postmodern theatric(k)s: monologue in contemporary American drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiJaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=December 1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-10467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |title=monologue (drama and literature) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812133304/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |title=Monologue Information |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028033907/http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditions==
Actors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audition Monologues|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|website=Ace Your Audition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714084548/http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyactor.com/contemporary-monologues/|title=Monologues from Movies &amp; Plays|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2018|website=Daily Actor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">The '''National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard''' ('''NIMAS''') helps facilitate timely access to alternate formats of [[instructional materials]] for students with [[visual impairments]] or other [[print disabilities]]. NIMAS (pronounced NYE-mas) outlines a set of consistent and valid [[XML]]-based source files created by [[K-12]] [[curriculum]] [[publishers]] or other content producers. These well-structured source files can be used to create [[accessible]] specialized formats (i.e., [[braille]], audio, [[e-text]], [[large print]], etc.) of print instructional materials. The full set of files includes XML content files, a package file, [[image]]s, and a [[PDF]] file of the title page (or whichever page contains [[ISBN]] and [[copyright]] information).

In a significant step forward for students with disabilities, the [[U.S. Congress]] adopted NIMAS as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, a reauthorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8939">The vast majority of positive results about [[computational problem]]s are [[constructive proof]]s, i.e., a computational problem is proved to be solvable by showing an [[algorithm]] that solves it; a computational problem is shown to be in [[P (complexity)]] by showing an algorithm that solves it in time that is polynomial in the size of the input; etc.

However, there are several [[non-constructive]] results, where an algorithm is proved to exist without showing the algorithm itself. Several techniques are used to provide such existence proofs.

== Using an unknown finite set ==

===In combinatorial game theory===
A simple example of a non-constructive algorithm was published in 1982 by [[Elwyn R. Berlekamp]], [[John H. Conway]], and [[Richard K. Guy]], in their book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. It concerns the game of [[Sylver Coinage]], in which players take turns specifying a positive integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of previously specified values, with a player losing when they are forced to specify the number&amp;nbsp;1. There exists an algorithm (given in the book as a flow chart) for determining whether a given first move is winning or losing: if it is a [[prime number]] greater than three, or one of a finite set of [[smooth number|3-smooth numbers]], then it is a winning first move, and otherwise it is losing. However, the finite set is not known.

===In graph theory===
Non-constructive algorithm proofs  for problems in [[graph theory]] were studied beginning in 1988 by [[Michael Fellows]] and [[Michael Langston]].&lt;ref name=FellowsLangston1988&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/44483.44491| title = Nonconstructive tools for proving polynomial-time decidability| journal = Journal of the ACM| volume = 35| issue = 3| pages = 727| year = 1988| last1 = Fellows | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Langston | first2 = M. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common question in graph theory is whether a certain input graph has a certain property. For example:

:::Input: a graph ''G''.
:::Question: Can ''G'' be embedded in a 3-dimensional space, such that no two disjoint cycles of ''G'' are topologically linked (as in links of a chain)?

There is a highly exponential algorithm that decides whether two cycles embedded in a 3d-space are linked, and one could test all pairs of cycles in the graph, but it is not obvious how to account for all possible embeddings in a 3d-space. Thus, it is a-priori not clear at all if the linkedness problem is decidable.

However, there is a non-constructive proof that shows that linkedness is decidable in polynomial time. The proof relies on the following facts:

* The set of graphs for which the answer is "yes" is closed under taking [[minor (graph theory)|minors]]. I.e., if a graph G can be embedded linklessly in 3-d space, then every minor of G can also be embedded linklessly.
* For every two graphs G and H, it is possible to find in polynomial time whether H is a minor of G.
* By [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]], any set of finite graphs contains only a finite number of minor-minimal elements. In particular, the set of "yes" instances has a finite number of minor-minimal elements.

Given an input graph G, the following "algorithm" solves the above problem:
:: For every minor-minimal element H:
:::: If H is a minor of G then return "yes".
:: return "no".

The non-constructive part here is the Robertson–Seymour theorem. Although it guarantees that there is a finite number of minor-minimal elements it does not tell us what these elements are. Therefore, we cannot really execute the "algorithm" mentioned above. But, we do know that an algorithm exists and that its runtime is polynomial.

There are many more similar problems whose decidability can be proved in a similar way. In some cases, the knowledge that a problem can be proved in a polynomial time has led researchers to search and find an actual polynomial-time algorithm that solves the problem in an entirely different way. This shows that non-constructive proofs can have constructive outcomes.&lt;ref name=FellowsLangston1988 /&gt;

The main idea is that a problem can be solved using an algorithm that uses, as a parameter, an unknown set. Although the set is unknown, we know that it must be finite, and thus a polynomial-time algorithm exists.

There are many other combinatorial problems that can be solved with a similar technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00207168908803783| title = Polynomial-time self-reducibility: Theoretical motivations and practical results∗| journal = International Journal of Computer Mathematics| volume = 31| pages = 1| year = 2007| last1 = Brown | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Fellows | first2 = M. R. | last3 = Langston | first3 = M. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counting the algorithms ==

Sometimes the number of potential algorithms for a given problem is finite. We can count the number of possible algorithms and prove that only a bounded number of them are "bad", so at least one algorithm must be "good".

As an example, consider the following problem.&lt;ref name=GrebinskyKucherov2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s004530010033| title = Optimal Reconstruction of Graphs under the Additive Model| journal = Algorithmica| volume = 28| pages = 104| year = 2000| last1 = Grebinski | first1 = V.| last2 = Kucherov | first2 = G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I select a vector ''v'' composed of ''n'' elements which are integers between 0 and a certain constant ''d''.

You have to guess ''v'' by asking ''sum queries'', which are queries of the form: "what is the sum of the elements with indices ''i'' and ''j''?". A sum query can relate to any number of indices from 1 to ''n''.

How many queries do you need? Obviously, ''n'' queries are always sufficient, because you can use ''n'' queries asking for the "sum" of a single element. But when ''d'' is sufficiently small, it is possible to do better. The general idea is as follows.

Every query can be represented as a 1-by-''n'' vector whose elements are all in the set {0,1}. The response to the query is just the dot product of the query vector by ''v''.   Every set of ''k'' queries can be represented by an ''k''-by-''n'' matrix over {0,1}; the set of responses is the product of the matrix by ''v''.

A matrix ''M'' is "good" if it enables us to uniquely identify ''v''. This means that, for every vector ''v'', the product ''M v'' is different.  A matrix ''M'' is "bad" if there are two different vectors, ''v'' and ''u'', such that ''M v'' = ''M u''.

Using some algebra, it is possible to bound the number of "bad" matrices. The bound is a function of ''d'' and ''k''. Thus, for a sufficiently small ''d'', there must be a "good" matrix with a small ''k'', which corresponds to an efficient algorithm for solving the identification problem.

This proof is non-constructive in two ways: it is not known how to find a good matrix; and even if a good matrix is supplied, it is not known how to efficiently re-construct the vector from the query replies.

There are many more similar problems which can be proved to be solvable in a similar way.&lt;ref name=GrebinskyKucherov2000/&gt;

== Additional examples ==
* Some computational problems can be shown to be decidable by using the [[Law of Excluded Middle#Use in computer science proofs|Law of Excluded Middle]]. Such proofs are usually not very useful in practice, since the problems involved are quite artificial.
* An example from [[Quantum complexity theory]] (related to [[Quantum query complexity]]) is given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4086/cjtcs.2013.004| year = 2013| last1 = Kimmel | first1 = S.| title = Quantum Adversary (Upper) Bound| journal = Chicago Journal of Theoretical Computer Science| volume = 19| pages = 1–14| arxiv = 1101.0797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phnom Bakheng''' ({{lang-km|ប្រាសាទភ្នំបាខែង}}) at [[Angkor]], [[Cambodia]], is a Hindu and Buddhist temple in the form of a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Temple mountain|temple mountain]].{{sfnp|Coedès|1968|p=103}} Dedicated to [[Shiva]], it was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King [[Yasovarman I|Yasovarman]] (889-910). Located atop a hill, it is nowadays a popular tourist spot for sunset views of the much bigger temple [[Angkor Wat]], which lies amid the jungle about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km to the southeast. The large number of visitors makes Phnom Bakheng one of the most threatened monuments of Angkor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/25/travel.travelnews |title=Tourist invasion threatens to ruin glories of Angkor Wat |first=Justine |last=Smith |date= 25 February 2007 |work=[[The Observer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, [[World Monuments Fund]] has been working to conserve the temple in partnership with [[APSARA]].

==History==
Constructed more than two centuries before Angkor Wat, Phnom Bakheng was in its day the principal temple of the Angkor region, historians believe. It was the architectural centerpiece of a new capital, Yasodharapura, that Yasovarman built when he moved the court from the capital [[Hariharalaya]] in the [[Roluos]] area located to the southeast.{{sfnp|Coedès|1968|pp=112–113}}

An inscription dated 1052 AD and found at the [[Sdok Kak Thom]] temple in present-day [[Thailand]] states in [[Sanskrit]]: "When Sri Yasovardhana became king under the name of Yasovarman, the able Vamasiva continued as his guru. By the king's order, he set up a linga on Sri Yasodharagiri, a mountain equal in beauty to the king of mountains."{{sfnp|Sak-Humphry|2005|p=38}} Scholars believe that this passage refers to the consecration of the Phnom Bakheng temple approximately a century and a half earlier.{{sfnp|Coedès|1968|p=112}}

Phnom Bakheng is one of 3 hilltop temples in the Angkor region that are attributed to Yasovarman's reign. The other two are [[Phnom Krom]] to the south near the [[Tonle Sap]] lake, and [[Phnom Bok]], northeast of the [[East Baray]] reservoir.{{sfnp|Coedès|1968|p=113}}

Surrounding the mount and temple, labor teams built an outer moat. Avenues radiated out in the four cardinal directions from the mount. A causeway ran in a northwest-southeast orientation from the old capital area to the east section of the new capital's outer moat and then, turning to an east-west orientation, connected directly to the east entrance of the temple.{{sfnp|Higham|2001|p=64}}

Later in its history, Phnom Bakheng was converted into a Buddhist temple. A monumental Sitting Buddha, now lost, was created on its upper tier. Across its west side, a Reclining Buddha of similar scale was crafted in stone. The outlines of this figure are still visible.

==Symbolism==
Phnom Bakheng is a symbolic representation of [[Mount Meru]], home of the [[Hindu]] gods, a status emphasized by the temple’s location atop a steep hill 65 m above the surrounding plain. The temple is built in a pyramid form of seven levels, representing the seven heavens.{{sfnp|Higham|2014|pp=355,358–360}} At the top level, five sandstone sanctuaries, in various states of repair, stand in a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] pattern—one in the center and one at each corner of the level’s square. Originally, 108 small towers were arrayed around the temple at ground level and on various of its tiers; most of them have collapsed.{{sfnp|Rooney|2002|p=236}}

[[Jean Filliozat]] of the Ecole Francaise, a leading western authority on Indian cosmology and astronomy, interpreted the symbolism of the temple. The temple sits on a rectangular base and rises in five levels and is crowned by five main towers. One hundred four smaller towers are distributed over the lower four levels, placed so symmetrically that only 33 can be seen from the center of any side. Thirty-three is the number of gods who dwelt on Mount Meru. Phnom Bakheng's total number of towers is also significant. The center one represents the axis of the world and the 108 smaller ones represent the four lunar phases, each with 27 days. The seven levels of the monument represent the seven heavens and each terrace contains 12 towers which represent the 12-year cycle of Jupiter. According to University of Chicago scholar [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]], it is "an astronomical calendar in stone." &lt;ref&gt;Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained (1995) p.93-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Angkor's rediscovery by the outside world in the mid-19th century, decades passed before archeologists grasped Phnom Bakheng's historical significance. For many years, scholars' consensus view was that the [[Bayon]], the temple located at the center of [[Angkor Thom]] city, was the edifice to which the Sdok Kak Thom inscription referred. Later work identified the Bayon as a [[Buddhist]] site, built almost three centuries later than originally thought, in the late 12th century, and Phnom Bakheng as King Yasovarman's state temple.{{sfnp|Coedès|1968|p=112}}

:''Preliminary note: In this article "dinosaur" means "non-avian dinosaur," since birds are a [[monophyletic]] taxon within the [[clade]] Dinosauria and most experts regard birds as [[dinosaur]]s.''

The '''physiology of dinosaurs''' has historically been a controversial subject, particularly their [[thermoregulation]]. Recently, many new lines of evidence have been brought to bear on dinosaur [[physiology]] generally, including not only metabolic systems and thermoregulation, but on respiratory and cardiovascular systems as well.

During the early years of dinosaur paleontology, it was widely considered that they were sluggish, cumbersome, and sprawling [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] [[lizard]]s. However, with the discovery of much more complete skeletons in western United States, starting in the 1870s, scientists could make more informed interpretations of dinosaur biology and physiology.  [[Edward Drinker Cope]], opponent of [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in the [[Bone Wars]], propounded at least some dinosaurs as active and agile, as seen in the painting of two fighting "[[Dryptosaurus|Laelaps]]" produced under his direction by [[Charles R. Knight]].&lt;ref name=SGL00b&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lucas |first1= Spencer G. |year=1999 | title=Dinosaurs: The Textbook | edition= 3rd |publisher= McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |pages= 3–9 |isbn=0-07-303642-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, the development of [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[evolution]], and the discoveries of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and ''[[Compsognathus]]'', led [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] to propose that dinosaurs were closely related to birds.&lt;ref name=FW04&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs (2nd Edition)|year=2005|chapter=Theropoda I:Nature red in tooth and claw|veditors=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB |vauthors=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB |pages=265–299|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these considerations, the image of dinosaurs as large reptiles had already taken root,&lt;ref name=SGL00b /&gt; and most aspects of their [[paleobiology]] were interpreted as being typically reptilian for the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| doi=10.1086/395712
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1960s and with the advent of the [[Dinosaur Renaissance]], views of dinosaurs and their physiology have changed dramatically, including the discovery of [[feathered dinosaurs]] in [[Early Cretaceous]] [[Age (geology)|age]] deposits in China, indicating that [[Origin of birds|birds evolved]] from highly agile [[maniraptora]]n dinosaurs.

== History of study ==

=== Early interpretations of dinosaurs: 1820s to early 1900s ===
[[File:London - Crystal Palace - Victorian Dinosaurs 1.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of ''Megalosaurus'' from 1854, in [[The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|Crystal Palace]], London]]
[[File:Laelaps-Charles Knight-1897.jpg|thumb|right|The 1897 painting of "''Laelaps''" (now ''[[Dryptosaurus]]'') by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]
The study of dinosaurs began in the 1820s in England. Pioneers in the field, such as [[William Buckland]], [[Gideon Mantell]], and [[Richard Owen]], interpreted the first, very fragmentary remains as belonging to large [[quadruped]]al beasts.&lt;ref name=SGL00a&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Spencer G. |year=2000 |title=Dinosaurs: The Textbook |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |isbn=0-07-303642-0 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their early work can be seen today in the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]], constructed in the 1850s, which present known dinosaurs as elephantine [[lizard]]-like reptiles.&lt;ref name=HT97&gt;{{cite book |last=Torrens |first=Hugh |editor=Farlow, James O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, Michael K. |title=The Complete Dinosaur |year=1997 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington|isbn=0-253-33349-0 |pages=175–190 |chapter=Politics and Paleontology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these reptilian appearances, Owen speculated that dinosaur [[heart]] and [[respiratory system]]s were more similar to that of a mammal than a reptile.&lt;ref name=SGL00a/&gt;

=== Changing views and the dinosaur renaissance ===
In the late 1960s, similar ideas reappeared, beginning with [[John Ostrom]]'s work on ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and [[origin of birds|bird evolution]].&lt;ref name=MJB00&gt;{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J. Benton |editor=Paul, Gregory S. |title=The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-26226-4 |pages=10–44 |chapter=A brief history of dinosaur paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student, [[Robert T. Bakker|Bob Bakker]], popularized the changing thought in a series of papers beginning with ''The superiority of dinosaurs'' in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, R.T. (1968). "The superiority of dinosaurs" ''Discovery'', v. 3(2), p. 11-22&lt;/ref&gt; In these publications, he argued strenuously that dinosaurs were warm-blooded and active animals, capable of sustained periods of high activity. In most of his writings Bakker framed his arguments as new evidence leading to a revival of ideas popular in the late 19th century, frequently referring to an ongoing ''[[dinosaur renaissance]]''. He used a variety of anatomical and statistical arguments to defend his case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bakker |first1= R. T. |year= 1987 |chapter= The Return of the Dancing Dinosaurs | title=Dinosaurs Past and Present, vol. I | editor1-first= S. J. |editor1-last=Czerkas |editor2-first= E. C. |editor2-last=Olson |isbn= 0-295-96541-X | publisher= University of Washington Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakker1972AnatomicalAndEcologicalEvidenceOfEndothermy"&gt;{{cite journal | pages=81–85 | issue=5359 | last1=Bakker | volume=238 | journal=Nature | first1=Robert T. | year=1972 | title=Anatomical and ecological evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs | doi = 10.1038/238081a0 | bibcode = 1972Natur.238...81B }}&lt;/ref&gt; the methodology of which was fiercely debated among scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=R.D.K. |last1=Thomas |first2= E.C. |last2= Olson |year= 1980 |title=A Cold Look at the Warm-Blooded Dinosaurs | isbn=0-89158-464-1 | publisher= Westview Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates sparked interest in new methods for ascertaining the palaeobiology of extinct animals, such as [[Histology|bone histology]], which have been successfully applied to determining the growth-rates of many dinosaurs.

Today, it is generally thought that many or perhaps all dinosaurs had higher metabolic rates than living reptiles, but also that the situation is more complex and varied than Bakker originally proposed. For example, while smaller dinosaurs may have been true [[Warm-blooded|endotherms]], the larger forms could have been [[gigantothermy|inertial homeotherms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1= M.J. |year=2005 |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | pages= 221–223 |isbn=0-632-05637-1 | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paladino | first1 = F.V. | last2 = O'Connor | first2 = M.P. | last3 = Spotila | first3 = J.R. | year = 1990 | title = Metabolism of leatherback turtles, gigantothermy, and thermoregulation of dinosaurs | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6269| pages = 858–860 | doi = 10.1038/344858a0 |bibcode = 1990Natur.344..858P }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that many dinosaurs could have had intermediate metabolic rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrick | first1 = R.E. | last2 = Showers | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Fischer | first3 = A.G. | year = 1996 | title = Comparison of Thermoregulation of Four Ornithischian Dinosaurs and a Varanid Lizard from the Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation: Evidence from Oxygen Isotopes | url = | journal = PALAIOS | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 295–305 | doi = 10.2307/3515240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feeding and digestion ==
The earliest dinosaurs were almost certainly predators, and shared several predatory features with their nearest non-dinosaur relatives like ''[[Lagosuchus]]'', including: relatively large, curved, blade-like teeth in large, wide-opening jaws that closed like scissors; relatively small [[abdomen]]s, as carnivores do not require large [[digestive system]]s. Later dinosaurs regarded as predators sometimes grew much larger, but retained the same set of features. Instead of chewing their food, these predators swallowed it whole.&lt;ref name="Norman2001DinosaurFeeding"&gt;{{Cite book
| author=Norman, D.B. | chapter=Dinosaur Feeding | date=April 2001
| title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons | doi=10.1038/npg.els.0003321
| url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780470015902/els/article/a0003321/current/abstract
| accessdate=2009-09-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feeding habits of [[ornithomimosaur]]s and [[oviraptorosaur]]s are a mystery: although they evolved from a predatory [[theropod]] lineage, they have small jaws and lack the blade-like teeth of typical predators, but there is no evidence of their diet or how they ate and digested it.&lt;ref name="Norman2001DinosaurFeeding" /&gt;

Features of other groups of dinosaurs indicate they were herbivores. These features include:
* Jaws that only slightly opened and closed so that all the teeth met at the same time
* Large abdomens that could accommodate large amounts of vegetation and store it for the long time it takes to digest vegetation
* Guts that likely contained [[Endosymbiotic]] micro-organisms that digest [[cellulose]], as no known animal can digest this tough material directly&lt;ref name="Norman2001DinosaurFeeding" /&gt;

[[Sauropod]]s, which were herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth and jaws appear suitable only for stripping leaves off plants. [[Ornithischian]]s, also herbivores, show a variety of approaches. The armored [[ankylosaur]]s and [[stegosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, and are thought to have fed in much the same way as sauropods. The [[pachycephalosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.&lt;ref name="Norman2001DinosaurFeeding" /&gt;

On the other hand, [[ornithopod]]s such as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and various [[hadrosaur]]s had horny beaks for snipping off vegetation and jaws and teeth that were well-adapted for chewing. The horned [[ceratopsian]]s had similar mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Norman2001DinosaurFeeding" /&gt;

It has often been suggested that at least some dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as [[gastrolith]]s, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular [[gizzard]]s, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of "gastrolith". He found that swallowed hard stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential—and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with only a small percentage of sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced [[theropod]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.&lt;ref name="Wings2007ReviewOfGastrolithFunction"&gt;{{cite journal

When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/184/1/63.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This medullary bone, which is rich in [[calcium]], is used to make eggshells, and the birds that produced it absorb it when they have finished laying eggs.&lt;ref name="LeeWerning2008SexualMaturity" /&gt; Medullary bone has been found in fossils of the theropods ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and of the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name="LeeWerning2008SexualMaturity"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Andrew H. |author2=Werning, Sarah |year=2008 |title=Sexual maturity in growing dinosaurs does not fit reptilian growth models |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=582–587 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708903105|pmid=18195356 |pmc=2206579 |bibcode = 2008PNAS..105..582L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchweitzerEtAl2005GenderSpecific"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schweitzer |first=M.H. |author2=Wittmeyer, J.L. |author3= Horner, J.R.  |title=Gender-specific reproductive tissue in ratites and ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |journal=Science |volume=308 |pages=1456–1460|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/308/5727/1456 |doi=10.1126/science.1112158 |year=2005 |pmid=15933198 |issue=5727|bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1456S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, the presence of medullary bone in both groups suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. On the other hand, [[crocodilian]]s, which are dinosaurs' second closest [[Extant taxon|extant]] relatives after birds, do not produce medullary bone. This tissue may have first appeared in [[ornithodire]]s, the [[Triassic]] [[archosaur]] group from which dinosaurs are thought to have evolved.&lt;ref name="LeeWerning2008SexualMaturity" /&gt;

Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached [[sexual maturity]] before they were full-grown. Sexual maturity at sub-adult size is also found in reptiles and in medium- to large-sized mammals, but birds and small mammals reach sexual maturity only after they are full-grown—which happens within their first year. Early sexual maturity is also associated with specific features of animals' life cycles: the young are born relatively well-developed rather than helpless; and the death-rate among adults is high.&lt;ref name="LeeWerning2008SexualMaturity" /&gt;

=== Air sacs ===
[[File:BirdRespiration.svg|thumb|Birds' lungs obtain fresh air during both exhalation and inhalation, because the air sacs do all the "pumping" and the lungs simply absorb oxygen.]]
From about 1870 onwards scientists have generally agreed that the post-cranial skeletons of many dinosaurs contained many air-filled cavities ([[Skeletal pneumaticity#Postcranial pneumaticity|postcranial skeletal pneumaticity]], especially in the vertebrae. Pneumatization of the skull (such as [[paranasal sinuses]]) is found in both [[synapsids]] and [[archosaurs]], but postcranial pneumatization is found only in birds, non-avian [[saurischian]] dinosaurs, and [[pterosaurs]].

For a long time these cavities were regarded simply as weight-saving devices, but [[Robert T. Bakker|Bakker]] proposed that they were connected to [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|air sacs]] like those that make birds' [[respiratory system]]s the most efficient of all animals'.&lt;ref name="Bakker1972AnatomicalAndEcologicalEvidenceOfEndothermy"/&gt;

[[John Ruben]] ''et al.'' (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004) disputed this and suggested that dinosaurs had a "tidal" respiratory system (in and out) powered by a crocodile-like [[Lung#Reptilian lungs|hepatic piston]] mechanism&amp;nbsp;– muscles attached mainly to the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] pull the [[liver]] backwards, which makes the lungs expand to inhale; when these muscles relax, the lungs return to their previous size and shape, and the animal exhales. They also presented this as a reason for doubting that [[Origin of birds|birds descended from dinosaurs]].&lt;ref name="RubenJonesEtAl1997LungStructure"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ruben, J.A., Jones, T.D., Geist, N.R. and Hillenius, W.

In advanced sauropods ("neosauropods") the vertebrae of the lower back and hip regions show signs of air sacs. In early sauropods only the cervical (neck) vertebrae show these features.

Early [[sauropodomorph]]s, including the group traditionally called "prosauropods", may also have had air sacs. Although possible pneumatic indentations have been found in ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' and ''[[Thecodontosaurus]]'', the indentations are very small. One study in 2007 concluded that prosauropods likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded that it was impossible to determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present.&lt;ref name="Wedel"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Wedel| first =Mathew| title =What pneumaticity tells us about 'prosauropods', and vice versa| journal =Special Papers in Palaeontology| volume =77| issue =| pages =207–222| publisher =| year =2007| url =http://sauroposeidon.net/Wedel_2007_pneumaticity-and-prosauropods.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate =2007-10-31| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080705145519/http://sauroposeidon.net/Wedel_2007_pneumaticity-and-prosauropods.pdf| archivedate =5 July 2008| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further indication for the presence of air sacs and their use in lung ventilation comes from a reconstruction of the air exchange volume (the volume of air exchanged with each breath) of ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', which when expressed as a ratio of air volume per body weight at 29&amp;nbsp;ml/kg is similar to values of geese and other birds, and much higher than typical mammalian values.&lt;ref name=MallisonTDPII&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mallison | first1 = H. | year = 2010 | title = The digital ''Plateosaurus'' II: an assessment of the range of motion of the limbs and vertebral column and of previous reconstructions using a digital skeletal mount | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 433–458 | doi = 10.4202/app.2009.0075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far no evidence of air sacs has been found in [[ornithischia]]n dinosaurs. But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt;

Three explanations have been suggested for the development of air sacs in dinosaurs:&lt;ref name="SerenoMartinezEtAl2008AvianIntrathoracicAirSacsInNewPredatoryDinosaur" /&gt;
* Increase in respiratory capacity. This is probably the most common hypothesis, and fits well with the idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high [[metabolic rate]]s.
* Improving balance and maneuvrability by lowering the [[center of gravity]] and reducing [[rotational inertia]]. However this does not explain the expansion of air sacs in the quadrupedal sauropods.
* As a cooling mechanism. It seems that air sacs and feathers evolved at about the same time in [[coelurosaur]]s. If feathers retained heat, their owners would have required a means of dissipating excess heat. This idea is plausible but needs further empirical support.

Calculations of the volumes of various parts of the sauropod ''Apatosaurus''' respiratory system support the evidence of bird-like air sacs in sauropods:
* Assuming that ''Apatosaurus'', like dinosaurs' nearest surviving relatives [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, did not have a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is sucked back into the lungs on the following inhalation.
* Estimates of its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]]&amp;nbsp;– the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs in a single breath&amp;nbsp;– depend on the type of [[respiratory system]] the animal had: 904&amp;nbsp;liters if avian; 225&amp;nbsp;liters if mammalian; 19&amp;nbsp;liters if reptilian.
On this basis, ''Apatosaurus'' could not have had a reptilian respiratory system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;184&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;41&amp;nbsp;liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. ''Apatosaurus'' must therefore have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|birds]]', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&amp;nbsp;liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950&amp;nbsp;liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700&amp;nbsp;liters of space available in a 30-ton ''Apatosaurus''′ chest.&lt;ref name="PaladinoEtAlInFarlowBrettSurman1997"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P. |year=1997 |contribution=A Blueprint for Giants: Modeling the Physiology of Large Dinosaurs |editor=Farlow, J.O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K.  |title=The Complete Dinosaur |pages=491–504 |isbn=0-253-21313-4 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dinosaur respiratory systems with bird-like air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build can sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large to get rid of all the excess heat through their skins.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Reid, R.E.H. | contribution=Dinosaurian Physiology: the Case for "Intermediate" Dinosaurs  |editor=Farlow, J.O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K. |title=The Complete Dinosaur |year=1997 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington|isbn=0-253-33349-0 |pages=449–473 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FOViD-lDPy0C&amp;pg=PA449&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;dq=%22The+Complete+Dinosaur%22+%22intermediate+dinosaurs%22

The palaeontologist [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] has argued that the evolution of the air sac system, which first appears in the very earliest dinosaurs, may have been in response to the very low (11%) atmospheric oxygen of the [[Carnian]] and [[Norian]] ages of the Triassic Period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Ward, Peter]] (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=z6iG67mkfZoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Out+of+Thin+Air%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CA2RUrW7E4PykQWBxYCYBg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Out%20of%20Thin%20Air%22&amp;f=false ''Out of thin air: Dinosaurs, birds, and earth's ancient atmosphere''] Pages 159–198, National Academies Press. {{ISBN|9780309141239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncinate processes on the ribs ===
Birds have spurs called "[[Uncinate processes of ribs|uncinate processes]]" on the rear edges of their ribs, and these give the chest muscles more leverage when pumping the chest to improve oxygen supply. The size of the uncinate processes is related to the bird's lifestyle and oxygen requirements: they are shortest in walking birds and longest in diving birds, which need to replenish their oxygen reserves quickly when they surface. Non-avian [[maniraptoran]] dinosaurs also had these uncinate processes, and they were proportionately as long as in modern diving birds, which indicates that maniraptorans needed a high-capacity oxygen supply.&lt;ref name="CoddManning2008AvianlikeBreathingMechanics"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Codd, J.R., Manning, P.L., Norell, M.A., and Perry, S.F. |title=Avian-like breathing mechanics in maniraptoran dinosaurs |  journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=275 |issue=1631 |date=January 2008 |pages=157–161 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1233 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/y082l221mj5j12m0/?p=5d13436d652f494c9a12b94d21ed1eee&amp;pi=7 |pmid=17986432 |pmc=2596187 }} News summary at {{cite web |title=Why Dinosaurs Had 'Fowl' Breath |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071107074326.htm |date=7 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TickleEnnosEtAl2007FunctionalSignificanceOfUncinateProcesses"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tickle, P.G., Ennos, A.R., Lennox, L.E., Perry, S.F. and Codd, J.R. |title=Functional significance of the uncinate processes in birds |date=November 2007 |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |issue=  Pt 22|pages=3955–3961 |doi=10.1242/jeb.008953 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/210/22/3955 |volume=210 |pmid=17981863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plates that may have functioned the same way as uncinate processes have been observed in fossils of the [[ornithischian]] dinosaur ''[[Thescelosaurus]]'', and have been interpreted as evidence of high oxygen consumption and therefore high metabolic rate.&lt;ref name=PFetal00&gt;{{cite journal |  author=Fisher, P.E., Russell, D.A., Stoskopf, M.K., Barrick, R.E., Hammer, M., and Kuzmitz A.A. |title=Cardiovascular Evidence for an Intermediate or Higher Metabolic Rate in an Ornithischian Dinosaur |journal=Science |date=April 2000 |volume=288 |issue=5465|pages=503–505 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5465.503 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5465/503?ijkey=sI48bx6nH8M2Q |  pmid=10775107 | bibcode=2000Sci...288..503F}}  But note that this paper's main subject is that the fossil provided strong evidence of a 4-chambered heart, which is not widely accepted.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nasal turbinates ===
[[Nasal turbinate]]s are convoluted structures of thin bone in the [[nasal cavity]]. In most mammals and birds these are present and lined with [[mucous membrane]]s that perform two functions. They improve the sense of smell by increasing the area available to absorb airborne chemicals, and they warm and moisten inhaled air, and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air to prevent [[desiccation]] of the lungs.

[[John Ruben]] and others have argued that no evidence of nasal turbinates has been found in dinosaurs. All the dinosaurs they examined had nasal passages that were too narrow and short to accommodate nasal turbinates, so dinosaurs could not have sustained the breathing rate required for a mammal-like or bird-like metabolic rate while at rest, because their lungs would have dried out.&lt;ref name="RubenJonesEtAl1997LungStructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RubenJonesEtAl1997LungStructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruben1998&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ruben, J.A., Jones, T.D., Geist, N.R., Leitch, A., and Hillenius, W.J. |title=Lung ventilation and gas exchange in theropod dinosaurs |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1267–1270 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1267 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/278/5341/1267 |year=1997

[[File:Willoheart.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The possible heart of "Willo" the thescelosaur (center).]]
In principle one would expect dinosaurs to have had two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts, since many would have needed high blood pressure to deliver blood to their heads, which were high off the ground, but vertebrate lungs can only tolerate fairly low blood pressure.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt; In 2000, a skeleton of ''[[Thescelosaurus]]'', now on display at the [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]], was described as including the remnants of a four-chambered [[heart]] and an [[aorta]].

Regardless of the object's identity, it may have little relevance to dinosaurs' internal anatomy and metabolic rate. Both modern [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts, although modified in crocodilians, and so dinosaurs probably had them as well. However such hearts are not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.&lt;ref name=CH04&gt;Chinsamy, Anusuya; and Hillenius, Willem J. (2004). "Physiology of nonavian dinosaurs".

A 2008 study of one skeleton of the [[hadrosaur]] ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]'' concluded that this dinosaur grew even faster, reaching its full size at the age of about 15; the main evidence was the number and spacing of growth rings in its bones. The authors found this consistent with a life-cycle theory that prey species should grow faster than their predators if they lose a lot of juveniles to predators and the local environment provides enough resources for rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Metabolism ==
Scientific opinion about the life-style, [[metabolism]] and [[Thermoregulation|temperature regulation]] of dinosaurs has varied over time since the discovery of dinosaurs in the mid-19th century. The activity of metabolic enzymes varies with temperature, so temperature control is vital for any organism, whether endothermic or ectothermic. Organisms can be categorized as [[poikilotherms]] (poikilo&amp;nbsp;– changing), which are tolerant of internal temperature fluctuations, and [[homeotherms]] (homeo&amp;nbsp;– same), which must maintain a constant core temperature. Animals can be further categorized as [[endotherms]], which regulate their temperature internally, and [[ectotherms]], which regulate temperature by the use of external heat sources.

=== What the debate is about ===
{{see also|Gigantothermy}}
"[[Warm-blooded]]ness" is a complex and rather ambiguous term, because it includes some or all of:
* '''[[Homeotherm]]y''', i.e. maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. Modern endotherms maintain a variety of temperatures: {{convert|28|°C|°F}} to {{convert|30|°C|°F}} in [[monotreme]]s and [[sloth]]s;  {{convert|33|°C|°F}} to {{convert|36|°C|°F}} in [[marsupial]]s;  {{convert|36|°C|°F}} to {{convert|38|°C|°F}} in most [[placental]]s; and around {{convert|41|°C|°F}} in birds.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt;
* '''[[Tachymetabolism]]''', i.e. maintaining a high [[metabolic rate]], particularly when at rest. This requires a fairly high and stable body temperature, since biochemical processes run about half as fast if an animal's temperature drops by 10C°; most [[enzyme]]s have an optimum [[operating temperature]] and their efficiency drops rapidly outside the preferred range.&lt;ref name="McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP133To135"&gt;{{cite book
| author=McGowan, C. |title=Dinosaurs, Spitfires and Sea Dragons |year=1991 | pages=133–135
| publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-20769-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Endotherm]]y''', i.e. the ability to generate heat internally, for example by "burning" fat, rather than via behaviors such as basking or muscular activity. Although endothermy is in principle the most reliable way to maintain a fairly constant temperature, it is expensive; for example modern mammals need 10 to 13 times as much food as modern reptiles.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt;

Large dinosaurs may also have maintained their temperatures by inertial homeothermy, also known as "bulk homeothermy" or "mass homeothermy". In other words, the [[thermal capacity]] of such large animals was so high that it would take two days or more for their temperatures to change significantly, and this would have smoothed out variations caused by daily temperature cycles. This smoothing effect has been observed in large turtles and [[crocodilian]]s, but ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', which weighed about {{convert|700|kg|lb}}, may have been the smallest dinosaur in which it would have been effective. Inertial homeothermy would not have been possible for small species nor for the young of larger species.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt; Vegetation fermenting in the guts of large herbivores can also produce considerable heat, but this method of maintaining a high and stable temperature would not have been possible for carnivores or for small herbivores or the young of larger herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the internal mechanisms of extinct creatures are unknowable, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism.

Assessment of metabolic rates is complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge [[herbivorous]] [[sauropod]]s may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== Metabolic options ===
The main possibilities are that:&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt;
* Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, like modern reptiles, except that the large size of many would have stabilized their body temperatures.
* They were warm-blooded, more like modern mammals or birds than modern reptiles.
* They were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded in modern terms, but had metabolisms that were different from and in some ways intermediate between those of modern cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.
* They included animals with two or three of these types of metabolism.

Dinosaurs were around for about 150 million years, so it is very likely that different groups evolved different metabolisms and thermoregulatory regimes, and that some developed different physiologies from the first dinosaurs.

If all or some dinosaurs had intermediate metabolisms, they may have had the following features:&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt;
* Low resting metabolic rates—which would reduce the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting metabolic rates.
* Inertial homeothermy
* The ability to control heat loss by expanding and contracting blood vessels just under the skin, as many modern reptiles do.
* Two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts.
* High [[aerobic capacity]], allowing sustained activity.
Robert Reid has suggested that such animals could be regarded as "failed endotherms". He envisaged both dinosaurs and the Triassic ancestors of mammals passing through a stage with these features. Mammals were forced to become smaller as [[archosaur]]s came to dominate [[ecological niche]]s for medium to large animals. Their decreasing size made them more vulnerable to heat loss because it increased their ratios of surface area to mass, and thus forced them to increase internal heat generation and thus become full endotherms. On the other hand, dinosaurs became medium to very large animals and thus were able to retain the "intermediate" type of metabolism.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt;

=== Bone structure ===
Armand de Ricqlès discovered [[Haversian canals]] in dinosaur bones, and argued that they were evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs. These canals are common in "warm-blooded" animals and are associated with fast growth and an active life style because they help to recycle bone to facilitate rapid growth and repair damage caused by stress or injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ricqles, A. J. de. (1974). ''Evolution of endothermy: histological evidence''. Evolutionary Theory 1: 51–80&lt;/ref&gt; Dense secondary Haversian bone, which is formed during remodeling, is found in many living endotherms as well as dinosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. Secondary Haversian canals are correlated with size and age, mechanical stress and nutrient turnover. The presence of secondary Haversian canals suggests comparable bone growth and lifespans in mammals and dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="Fastovsky 2009, p.258"&gt;Fastovsky &amp; Weishampel 2009, p.258.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakker argued that the presence of fibrolamellar bone (produced quickly and having a fibrous, woven appearance) in dinosaur fossils was evidence of endothermy.&lt;ref name="Bakker1972AnatomicalAndEcologicalEvidenceOfEndothermy" /&gt;

However, as a result of other, mainly later research, bone structure is not considered a reliable indicator of metabolism in dinosaurs, mammals or reptiles:
* Dinosaur bones often contain lines of arrested growth (LAGs), formed by alternating periods of slow and fast growth; in fact many studies count growth rings to estimate the ages of dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="Curry1999OntogeneticHistologyOfApatosaurus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EricksonMakovickyEtAl2004GigantismOftyrannosaurids"/&gt; The formation of growth rings is usually driven by seasonal changes in temperature, and this seasonal influence has sometimes been regarded as a sign of slow metabolism and ectothermy. But growth rings are found in polar bears and in mammals that hibernate.&lt;ref name="ChinsamyRich1998PolarDinosaurBone"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02724634.1998.10011066 |author=Chinsamy, A., Rich, T., and Vickers-Rich, P. |year=1998 |title=Polar dinosaur bone histology |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=385–390 |url=http://www.vertpaleo.org/publications/jvp/18-385-390.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715110202/http://www.vertpaleo.org/publications/jvp/18-385-390.cfm |archivedate=15 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KMO96&gt;{{cite book |author=Klevezal, G.A., Mina, M.V., and Oreshkin, A.V. |title=Recording structures of mammals.

* Even the earliest [[archosauriformes]] may have been capable of very fast growth, which suggests they had fairly high metabolic rates. Although drawing conclusions about the earliest archosauriformes from later forms is tricky, because species-specific variations in bone structure and growth rate are very likely, there are research strategies than can minimize the risk that such factors will cause errors in the analysis.
* Archosaurs split into three main groups in the [[Triassic]]: [[ornithodira]]ns, from which dinosaurs evolved, remained committed to rapid growth; [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodilians' ancestors]] adopted more typical "reptilian" slow growth rates; and most other Triassic archosaurs had intermediate growth rates.

=== Metabolic rate, blood pressure and flow ===
[[Endotherm]]s rely highly on aerobic metabolism and have high rates of oxygen consumption during activity and rest.  The oxygen required by the tissues is carried by the blood, and consequently blood flow rates and blood pressures at the heart of warm-blooded endotherms are considerably higher than those of cold-blooded ectotherms.&lt;ref name=ancestor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Roger S.|author2=Bennett-Stamper, Christina L. |author3=Johnston, Sonya D. |author4=Carrier, David R. |author5= Grigg, Gordon C. |title=Evidence for endothermic ancestors of crocodiles at the stem of archosaur evolution|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology|year=2004|volume=77|pages=1051–1067|doi=10.1086/422766|pmid=15674775|url=http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/1933/1/hdl1933.pdf |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to measure the minimum blood pressures of dinosaurs by estimating the vertical distance between the heart and the top of the head, because this column of blood must have a pressure at the bottom equal to the [[hydrostatic pressure]] derived from the density of blood and gravity.  Added to this pressure is that required to move the blood through the circulatory system.  It was pointed out in 1976 that, because of their height, many dinosaurs had minimum blood pressures within the endothermic range, and that they must have had four-chambered hearts to separate the high pressure circuit to the body from the low pressure circuit to the lungs.&lt;ref name=BP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Roger S.|title=Dinosaurs, endothermy, and blood pressure|journal=Nature|year=1976|volume=262|issue=5565|pages=207–208|doi=10.1038/262207a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v262/n5565/abs/262207a0.html|bibcode = 1976Natur.262..207S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not clear whether these dinosaurs had high blood pressure simply to support the blood column or to support the high blood flow rates required by endothermy or both.
[[File:Foramen blood fow index.jpg|thumb|Foramen blood flow index, derived from the size of the nutrient foramen of the femurs of mammals, reptiles and dinosaurs]]
However, recent analysis of the tiny holes in fossil leg bones of dinosaurs provides a gauge for blood flow rate and hence metabolic rate.&lt;ref name=foramen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Roger S.|author2=Smith, Sarah L |author3=White, Craig R. |author4=Henderson, Donald M. |author5= Schwarz-Wings, Daniela |title=Blood flow to long bones indicates activity metabolism in mammals, reptiles and dinosaurs|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2012|volume=279|issue=1728|pages=451–456|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.0968|pmid=21733896|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/06/29/rspb.2011.0968 |pmc=3234558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holes are called nutrient foramina, and the nutrient artery is the major blood vessel passing through to the interior of the bone, where it branches into tiny vessels of the [[Haversian canal]] system.  This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion.  Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to [[stress fractures]] and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]].  The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of [[allometry]].  Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion.  Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in [[ectotherm]]ic reptiles.  Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.  Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with [[endotherm]]y.

=== Growth rates ===
Dinosaurs grew from small eggs to several tons in weight relatively quickly. A natural interpretation of this is that dinosaurs converted food into body weight very quickly, which requires a fairly fast metabolism both to forage actively and to assimilate the food quickly.&lt;ref name="Paul1988PDWp155"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul |first=G.S. |year=1988 |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World | page=155 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-61946-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing bone found in juveniles is distinctly porous, which has been linked to vascularization and bone deposition rate, all suggesting growth rates close to those observed in modern birds.

But a preliminary study of the relationship between adult size, growth rate, and body temperature concluded that larger dinosaurs had higher body temperatures than smaller ones had; ''Apatosaurus'', the largest dinosaur in the sample, was estimated to have a body temperature exceeding {{convert|41|°C|°F}}, whereas smaller dinosaurs were estimated to have body temperatures around {{convert|25|°C|°F}}&lt;ref name="GilloolyAllenCharnov2006FossilsPredictBodyTemperatures"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– for comparison, normal human body temperature is about {{convert|37|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="Mackowiaketal"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/jama.1992.03490120092034 | volume = 268 | issue = 12 | pages = 1578–1580| last = Mackowiak | first = P.

=== Oxygen isotope ratios in bone ===
The ratio of the [[isotope]]s &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in bone depends on the temperature the bone formed at: the higher the temperature, the more &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O. Barrick and Showers (1999) analyzed the isotope ratios in two [[theropod]]s that lived in temperate regions with seasonal variation in temperature, ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' (USA) and ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' (Argentina):&lt;ref name="BarrickShowers1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Barrick, R.E. |author2=Showers, W.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1999| title=Thermophysiology and biology of ''Giganotosaurus'': comparison with ''Tyrannosaurus'' | journal=Palaeontologia Electronica | volume=2 | issue=2 | url=http://palaeo-electronica.org/1999_2/gigan/issue2_99.htm | accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* dorsal vertebrae from both dinosaurs showed no sign of seasonal variation, indicating that both maintained a constant core temperature despite seasonal variations in air temperature.
* ribs and leg bones from both dinosaurs showed greater variability in temperature and a lower average temperature as the distance from the vertebrae increased.
Barrick and Showers concluded that both dinosaurs were endothermic but at lower metabolic levels than modern mammals, and that inertial homeothermy was an important part of their temperature regulation as adults. Their similar analysis of some Late Cretaceous [[ornithischia]]ns in 1996 concluded that these animals showed a similar pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

However this view has been challenged. The evidence indicates homeothermy, but by itself cannot prove endothermy. Secondly, the production of bone may not have been continuous in areas near the extremities of limbs&amp;nbsp;– in [[allosaur]] skeketons lines of arrested growth ("LAGs"; rather like [[growth ring]]s) are sparse or absent in large limb bones but common in the fingers and toes. While there is no absolute proof that LAGs are temperature-related, they could mark times when the extremities were so cool that the bones ceased to grow. If so, the data about oxygen isotope ratios would be incomplete, especially for times when the extremities were coolest. Oxygen isotope ratios may be an unreliable method of estimating temperatures if it cannot be shown that bone growth was equally continuous in all parts of the animal.&lt;ref name="ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997" /&gt;

=== Predator–prey ratios ===
[[Robert T. Bakker|Bakker]] argued that:&lt;ref name="Bakker1974DinosaurBioenergeticsReply"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bakker, R.T. |title=Dinosaur Bioenergetics&amp;nbsp;– A Reply to Bennett and Dalzell, and Feduccia |journal=Evolution |volume=28 |issue=3 |date=September 1974 |pages=497–503 |doi=10.2307/2407178 |jstor=2407178 |publisher=Society for the Study of Evolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* cold-blooded predators need much less food than warm-blooded ones, so a given mass of prey can support far more cold-blooded predators than warm-blooded ones.
* the ratio of the total mass of predators to prey in dinosaur communities was much more like that of modern and recent warm-blooded communities than that of recent or fossil cold-blooded communities.
* hence predatory dinosaurs were warm-blooded. And since the earliest dinosaurs (e.g. ''[[Staurikosaurus]]'', ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'') were predators, all dinosaurs must have been warm-blooded.

This argument was criticized on several grounds and is no longer taken seriously (the following list of criticisms is far from exhaustive):&lt;ref name="FastovskyWeishampelSibbick2005EvolutionAndExtinctionOfDinosaurs"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fastovsky, D.E., Weishampel, D.B., and Sibbick, J. |title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs

* Estimates of dinosaur weights vary widely, and even a small variation can make a large difference to the calculated predator–prey ratio.
* His [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] may not have been representative. Bakker obtained his numbers by counting museum specimens, but these have a bias towards rare or especially well-preserved specimens, and do not represent what exists in fossil beds. Even fossil beds may not accurately represent the actual populations, for example smaller and younger animals have less robust bones and are therefore less likely to be preserved.
* There are no published predator–prey ratios for large ectothermic predators, because such predators are very rare and mostly occur only on fairly small islands. Large ectothermic herbivores are equally rare. So Bakker was forced to compare mammalian predator–prey ratios with those of fish and invertebrate communities, where life expectancies are much shorter and other differences also distort the comparison.
* The concept assumes that predator populations are limited only by the availability of prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator–prey ratio.
* Ecological factors can misleadingly reduce the predator–prey ratio, for example: a predator might prey on only some of the "prey" species present;  disease, parasites and starvation might kill some of the prey animals before the predators get a chance to hunt them.
* It is very difficult to state precisely what preys on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be preyed upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are preyed on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.

=== Posture and gait ===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}
[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and limb postures.]]
Dinosaurs' limbs were erect and held under their bodies, rather than sprawling out to the sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence for this is the angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.&lt;ref&gt;This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web|title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612180650/http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df= }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |last=Desmond |first=A. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=0-385-27063-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carrier's constraint]] states that air-breathing vertebrates with two lungs that flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to move and breathe at the same time. This severely limits stamina, and forces them to spend more time resting than moving.&lt;ref name="Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods" /&gt;

Sprawling limbs require sideways flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, which are very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that spend most of their time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time—because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.

Erect limbs increase the costs of getting up and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because [[natural selection]] would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish and spent most of their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.

Additionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, the result of a rapidly functioning neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms.&lt;ref&gt;Fastovsky &amp; Weishampel 2009, p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Fastovsky &amp; Weishampel 2009, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakker and Ostrom both pointed out that all dinosaurs had erect hindlimbs and that all quadrupedal dinosaurs had erect forelimbs; and that among living animals only the endothermic ("warm-blooded") mammals and birds have erect limbs (Ostrom acknowledged that [[crocodilian]]s' occasional "high walk" was a partial exception). Bakker claimed this was clear evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs, while Ostrom regarded it as persuasive but not conclusive.&lt;ref name="Bakker1972AnatomicalAndEcologicalEvidenceOfEndothermy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostrom1980EvidenceOfEndothermyInDinosaurs"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ostrom, J.H. |year=1980 |chapter=The evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs |editor=Thomas, R.D.K. |editor2=Olson, E.C. |title=A cold look at the warm-blooded dinosaurs |pages=82–105 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Boulder, CO |url=http://bio.fsu.edu/~amarquez/Evolutionary%20Morphology%20fall%202004/Ostrom/The%20evidence%20for%20endothermy%20in%20dinosaurs%20-%20Ostrom.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527192758/http://bio.fsu.edu/~amarquez/Evolutionary%20Morphology%20fall%202004/Ostrom/The%20evidence%20for%20endothermy%20in%20dinosaurs%20-%20Ostrom.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study supported the hypothesis that endothermy was widespread in at least larger non-avian dinosaurs, and that It was plausibly ancestral for all dinosauriforms, based on the biomechanics of running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007783| pmid = 19911059| year = 2009| last1 = Pontzer | first1 = H. .| last2 = Allen | first2 = V. .| last3 = Hutchinson | first3 = J. .| title = Biomechanics of running indicates endothermy in bipedal dinosaurs| volume = 4| editor1-first = Andrew Allen| issue = 11| pages = e7783| editor1-last = Farke| pmc = 2772121| journal = PLoS ONE| last4 = Farke | first4 = A.

In fact the fossilised skin of ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' (an [[abelisaurid]] and therefore not a coelurosaur) shows an unfeathered, reptile-like skin with rows of bumps.&lt;ref name="BonaparteNovasCoria1990Carnotaurus"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bonaparte, J.F., Novas, E.E., and Coria, R.A. |year=1990 |title=''Carnotaurus sastrei'' Bonaparte, the horned, lightly built carnosaur from the Middle Cretaceous of Patagonia |journal=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County Contributions in Science |volume=416 |pages=1–42 |url=http://dinosaurs.nhm.org/staff/coriaworks.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510084320/http://dinosaurs.nhm.org/staff/coriaworks.htm |archivedate=10 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But an adult ''Carnotaurus'' weighed about 1 ton, and mammals of this size and larger have either very short hair or naked skins, so perhaps the skin of ''Carnotaurus'' tells us nothing about whether smaller non-coelurosaurid theropods had feathers.

There is a group of large theropods, the [[therizinosaurs]], which may have been covered in feathers: one of their number, ''[[Beipiaosaurus]]'', appears to have had a downy covering.

Thus insulation, and the elevated metabolic rate behind evolving them, may have been limited to the theropods, or even just a subset of theropods. Worth mentioning is that filaments similar to feathers has been found on three species of small ornithischians, those being ''[[Psittacosaurus]]'', ''[[Tianyulong]]'' and ''[[Kulindadromeus]]'', but whether these are true feathers, or the result of convergent evolution is unclear. {{clear}}

=== Polar dinosaurs ===
Dinosaur fossils have been found in regions that were close to the poles at the relevant times, notably in southeastern [[polar dinosaurs in Australia|Australia]], [[Antarctica]] and the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] of [[Alaska]]. There is no evidence of major changes in the angle of the Earth's [[Axial tilt|axis]], so polar dinosaurs and the rest of these ecosystems would have had to cope with the same extreme variation of day length through the year that occurs at similar [[latitude]]s today (up to a full day with no darkness in summer, and a full day with no sunlight in winter).&lt;ref name="RichGangloff2002PolarDinosaurs"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rich, T.H., Vickers-Rich, P., and Gangloff, R.A. |title=Polar Dinosaurs |journal=Science |date=February 2002 |volume=295 |issue=5557 |pages=979–980 |doi=10.1126/science.1068920 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/295/5557/979 |pmid=11834803 }} See also {{cite web |url=http://aprn.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/dinosaurs-antarctic.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dinosaurs of the Antarctic |author1=Vickers-Rich, P. |author2=Rich, T.H. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Scientific American |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517100516/http://aprn.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/dinosaurs-antarctic.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} and  {{cite web |url=http://aprn.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/dinosaurs-arctic-alaska.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dinosaurs of Arctic Alaska |author=Fiorillo, A.R. |publisher=Scientific American |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517100549/http://aprn.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/dinosaurs-arctic-alaska.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of fossilized vegetation suggest that the Alaska North Slope had a maximum temperature of {{convert|13|°C|°F}} and a minimum temperature of {{convert|2|°C|°F}} to {{convert|8|°C|°F}} in the last 35&amp;nbsp;million years of the [[Cretaceous]] (slightly cooler than [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon but slightly warmer than [[Calgary]], Alberta). Even so, the Alaska North Slope has no fossils of large cold-blooded animals such as lizards and crocodilians, which were common at the same time in Alberta, [[Montana]], and [[Wyoming]]. This suggests that at least some non-avian dinosaurs were warm-blooded.&lt;ref name="RichGangloff2002PolarDinosaurs" /&gt; It has been proposed that North American polar dinosaurs may have migrated to warmer regions as winter approached, which would allow them to inhabit Alaska during the summers even if they were cold-blooded.&lt;ref name="Hotton1980HappyWanderers"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hotton, N. |year=1980 |chapter=An alternative to dinosaur endothermy: The happy wanderers|editor=Thomas, R.D.K. |editor2=Olson, E.C. |title=A cold look at the warm-blooded dinosaurs |pages=311–350 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Boulder, CO |isbn=0-89158-464-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But a round trip between there and Montana would probably have used more energy than a cold-blooded land vertebrate produces in a year; in other words the Alaskan dinosaurs would have to be warm-blooded, irrespective of whether they migrated or stayed for the winter.&lt;ref name="Paul1988PDWp160"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul |first=G.S. |year=1988 |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-61946-2 | pages=160–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 paper on dinosaur migration by Phil R.

It is more difficult to determine the climate of southeastern Australia when the dinosaur fossil beds were laid down {{ma|115|105}}, towards the end of the Early Cretaceous: these deposits contain evidence of [[permafrost]], [[ice wedge]]s, and hummocky ground formed by the movement of subterranean ice, which suggests mean annual temperatures ranged between {{convert|-6|°C|°F}} and {{convert|5|°C|°F}}; [[Isotope analysis#Oxygen isotopes|oxygen isotope]] studies of these deposits give a mean annual temperature of {{convert|1.5|°C|°F}} to {{convert|2.5|°C|°F}}. However the diversity of fossil vegetation and the large size of some of fossil trees exceed what is found in such cold environments today, and no-one has explained how such vegetation could have survived in the cold temperatures suggested by the physical indicators&amp;nbsp;– for comparison [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] presently has a mean annual temperature of {{convert|2.9|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="RichGangloff2002PolarDinosaurs" /&gt; An annual migration from and to southeastern Australia would have been very difficult for fairly small dinosaurs in such as ''[[Leaellynasaura]]'', a herbivore about {{convert|60|cm|ft}} to {{convert|90|cm|ft}} long, because seaways to the north blocked the passage to warmer latitudes.&lt;ref name="RichGangloff2002PolarDinosaurs" /&gt; Bone samples from ''Leaellynasaura'' and ''[[Timimus]]'', an [[ornithomimid]] about {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} long and {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} high at the hip, suggested these two dinosaurs had different ways of surviving the cold, dark winters: the ''Timimus'' sample had lines of arrested growth (LAGs for short; similar to [[growth rings]]), and it may have [[hibernation|hibernated]]; but the ''Leaellynasaura'' sample showed no signs of LAGs, so it may have remained active throughout the winter.&lt;ref name=CRR98&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02724634.1998.10011066 |author=Chinsamy, A., Rich, T.H., and Vickers-Rich, P. |year=1998 |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=385–390 |title=Polar dinosaur bone histology |jstor=4523908 }} See also {{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/dinosaur-temperature-200712.html |title=Taking a Dinosaur's Temperature |date=December 2007 |publisher=Smithsonian magazine |author=Leslie, M. }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study focusing on hypsilophodont and theropod bones also concluded that these dinosaurs did not hibernate through the winter, but stayed active.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023339;jsessionid=4A4B8A5E7DD12BC3E642D5AE30B80069.ambra02&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence for behavioral thermoregulation ===
Some dinosaurs, e.g. ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' and ''[[Ouranosaurus]]'', had on their backs "sails" supported by spines growing up from the [[vertebra]]e.  (This was also true, incidentally, for the [[synapsid]] ''[[Dimetrodon]]''.) Such dinosaurs could have used these sails to:
* take in heat by basking with the "sails" at right angles to the sun's rays.
* to lose heat by using the "sails" as radiators while standing in the shade or while facing directly towards or away from the sun.
But these were a very small minority of known dinosaur species.
One common interpretation of the plates on stegosaurs' backs is as [[heat exchanger]]s for thermoregulation, as the plates are filled with blood vessels, which, theoretically, could absorb and dissipate heat.&lt;ref name="BufrenilFalrowRiqles1986"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Bufrenil, V., Farlow, J.O., and de Riqles, A. |title=Growth and function of ''Stegosaurus'' plates: evidence from bone histology |journal=Paleobiology |volume=12 |issue=4 |year=1986 |pages=459–473  |jstor=2400518 |publisher=Paleontological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}} This might have worked for a stegosaur with large plates, such as ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', but other stegosaurs, such as ''[[Wuerhosaurus]]'', ''[[Tuojiangosaurus]]'' and ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' possessed much smaller plates with a surface area of doubtful value for thermo-regulation. However, the idea of stegosaurian plates as heat exchangers has recently been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/biowissenschaften_chemie/bericht-44440.html |title=Stegosaur plates and spikes for looks only |date=18 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927124153/http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/biowissenschaften_chemie/bericht-44440.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other evidence ===
Endothermy demands frequent respiration, which can result in water loss. In living birds and mammals, water loss is limited by pulling moisture out of exhaled air with mucous-covered respiratory turbinates, tissue-covered bony sheets in the nasal cavity. Several dinosaurs have olfactory turbinates, used for smell, but none have yet been identified with respiratory turbinates.&lt;ref name="Fastovsky 2009, p.255"&gt;Fastovsky &amp; Weishampel 2009, p.255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because endothermy allows refined neuromuscular control, and because brain matter requires large amounts of energy to sustain, some speculate that increased brain size indicates increased activity and, thus, endothermy. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of dinosaurs, a measure of brain size calculated using brain endocasts, varies on a spectrum from bird-like to reptile-like. Using EQ alone, coelosaurs appear to have been as active as living mammals, while theropods and ornithopods fall somewhere between mammals and reptiles, and other dinosaurs resemble reptiles.&lt;ref name="Fastovsky 2009, p.255"/&gt;

A study published by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more support to the idea that dinosaurs were endothermic. After studying saltwater crocodiles, Seymour found that even if their large sizes could provide stable and high body temperatures, during activity the crocodile's ectothermic metabolism provided less aerobic abilities and generate only 14% of the total muscle power of a similar sized endothermic mammal before full fatigue. Seymour reasoned that dinosaurs would have needed to be endothermic since they would have needed better aerobic abilities and higher power generation to compete with and dominate over mammals as active land animals throughout the Mesozoic era.&lt;ref name="SeymourMetabolism"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== The crocodilian puzzle and early archosaur metabolism ===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}
It appears that the earliest dinosaurs had the features that form the basis for arguments for warm-blooded dinosaurs—especially erect limbs. This raises the question "How did dinosaurs become warm-blooded?" The most obvious possible answers are:
* "Their immediate ancestors ([[archosaur]]s) were cold-blooded, and dinosaurs began developing warm-bloodedness very early in their evolution." This implies that dinosaurs developed a significant degree of warm-bloodedness in a very short time, possibly less than 20M years. But in mammals' ancestors the evolution of warm-bloodedness seems to have taken much longer, starting with the beginnings of a [[secondary palate]] around the beginning of the mid-[[Permian]]&lt;ref name="Kermack1984MammalianCharacters"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kermack, D.M.  |author2=Kermack, K.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1984 |title=The evolution of mammalian characters |publisher=Croom Helm Kapitan Szabo Publishers |location=London |isbn=0-7099-1534-9 |page=149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and going on possibly until the appearance of hair about 164M years ago in the mid [[Jurassic]]&lt;ref name="FirstHairyFossilMammal"&gt;The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of ''[[Castorocauda]]'', from 164M years ago in the mid [[Jurassic]], {{cite journal|last=Ji|first=Q.|author2=Luo, Z-X, Yuan, C-X, and Tabrum, A.R. |date=February 2006|title=A Swimming Mammaliaform from the Middle Jurassic and Ecomorphological Diversification of Early Mammals |journal=Science |volume=311|issue=5764|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5764/1123|pmid=16497926|doi=10.1126/science.1123026|pages=1123–7|bibcode = 2006Sci...311.1123J }} See also the news item at {{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0223_060223_beaver.html |title=Jurassic "Beaver" Found; Rewrites History of Mammals}} It has been argued since the 1950s at the latest that there may be evidence of hair in early-[[Triassic]] [[cynodont]]s such as ''[[Thrinaxodon]]'': {{cite journal |last=Brink |first=A.S. |title=A study on the skeleton of ''Diademodon'' |journal=Palaeontologia Africana |volume=3 |pages=3–39 |year=1955 }} and {{cite book |last=Kemp |first=T.S. |title=Mammal-like reptiles and the origin of mammals |publisher=Academic Press |year=1982 |location=London |page=363 |isbn=0-12-404120-5}} but the foramina (small tunnels) in cynodont snout bones are ambiguous evidence at best, since similar foramina are found in a few living reptiles: {{cite journal |last=Estes |first=R. |title=Cranial anatomy of the cynodont reptile ''Thrinaxodon liorhinus'' |journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology |pages=165–180 |year=1961 |issue=1253 }} and {{cite journal |author1=Ruben, J.A. |author2=Jones, T.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Selective Factors Associated with the Origin of Fur and Feathers |journal=American Zoologist |year=2000 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=585–596 |doi=10.1093/icb/40.4.585 |url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/4/585}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
* "Dinosaurs' immediate ancestors ([[archosaur]]s) were at least fairly warm-blooded, and dinosaurs evolved further in that direction." This answer raises 2 problems: ('''A''') The early evolution of archosaurs is still very poorly understood&amp;nbsp;– large numbers of individuals and species are found from the start of the [[Triassic]] but only 2 species are known from the very late [[Permian]] (''[[Archosaurus]] rossicus'' and ''[[Protorosaurus]] speneri''); ('''B''') Crocodilians evolved shortly before dinosaurs and are closely related to them, but are cold-blooded (see below).

Crocodilians present some puzzles if one regards dinosaurs as active animals with fairly constant body temperatures. Crocodilians evolved shortly before dinosaurs and, second to birds, are dinosaurs' closest living relatives&amp;nbsp;– but modern crocodilians are cold-blooded. This raises some questions:
* If dinosaurs were to a large extent "warm-blooded", when and how fast did warm-bloodedness evolve in their lineage?
* Modern crocodilians are cold-blooded but have several features associated with warm-bloodedness. How did they acquire these features?

Modern crocodilians are cold-blooded but can move with their limbs erect, and have several features normally associated with warm-bloodedness because they improve the animal's oxygen supply:&lt;ref name="McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP151To152" /&gt;
* 4-chambered hearts. Mammals and birds have four-chambered hearts. Non-crocodilian reptiles have three-chambered hearts, which are less efficient because they allow oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood to mix and therefore send some de-oxygenated blood out to the body instead of to the lungs. Modern crocodilians' hearts are four-chambered, but are smaller relative to body size and run at lower pressure than those of modern mammals and birds. They also have a bypass that makes then functionally three-chambered when under water, conserving oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s167223.htm |title=Secret of the crocodile heart }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], which aids breathing.
* a [[secondary palate]], which allows the animal to eat and breathe at the same time.
* a [[Lung#Reptilian lungs|hepatic piston]] mechanism for pumping the lungs. This is different from the lung-pumping mechanisms of mammals and birds but similar to what some researchers claim to have found in some dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="RubenJonesEtAl1997LungStructure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RubenDalSassoEtAl1999PulmonaryFunction" /&gt;

So why did [[natural selection]] favor these features, which are important for active warm-blooded creatures but of little apparent use to cold-blooded aquatic ambush predators that spend most of their time floating in water or lying on river banks?

[[File:Terrestrisuchus BW.jpg| thumb | 300px | right | Reconstruction of ''[[Terrestrisuchus]]'', a very slim, leggy [[Triassic]] [[crocodylomorph]]. ]]
It was suggested in the late 1980s that crocodilians were originally active, warm-blooded predators and that their archosaur ancestors were warm-blooded.&lt;ref name="Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carrier |first=D.R. |title=The evolution of locomotor stamina in tetrapods: circumventing a mechanical constraint |journal=Paleobiology |volume=13 |issue= 3|pages=326–341 |year=1987 |jstor=2400734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP151To152"&gt;{{cite book

Using the principle that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], the researchers concluded that the original crocodilians had fully 4-chambered hearts and were therefore warm-blooded and that later crocodilians developed the bypass as they reverted to being cold-blooded aquatic ambush predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Summers | first1 = A.P. | year = 2005 | title = Evolution: Warm-hearted crocs | doi=10.1038/434833a | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7035| pages = 833–834 | pmid=15829945|bibcode = 2005Natur.434..833S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seymour, R.

More recent research on archosaur bone structures and their implications for growth rates also suggests that early archosaurs had fairly high metabolic rates and that the [[Triassic]] ancestors of crocodilians dropped back to more typically "reptilian" metabolic rates.&lt;ref name="deRicqlèsPadianEtAl2008HighGrowthRatesInArchosaurs" /&gt;

If this view is correct, the development of warm-bloodedness in archosaurs (reaching its peak in dinosaurs) and in mammals would have taken more similar amounts of time. It would also be consistent with the fossil evidence:
* The earliest crocodilians, e.g. ''[[Terrestrisuchus]]'', were slim, leggy terrestrial predators.
* Erect limbs appeared quite early in [[archosaur]]s' evolution, and those of [[rauisuchia]]ns are very poorly adapted for any other posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hutchinson, J.R. |title=The evolution of locomotion in archosaurs |journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol |issue=3–4 |date=March–April 2006 |pages=519–530 |doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2005.09.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6X1G-4J6WP8M-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=ff4c612aef14e51e872112989be76277 |volume=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planning''' is the [[process]] of [[thinking]] about the activities required to achieve a desired [[goal]]. It involves the creation and maintenance of a [[plan]], such as psychological aspects that require conceptual skills. There are even a couple of tests to measure someone’s capability of planning well. As such, planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior.  An important further meaning, often just called "planning" is the [[Urban planning|legal context of permitted building developments]].  

Also, planning has a specific process and is necessary for multiple occupations (particularly in fields such as [[management]], [[business]], etc.). In each field there are different types of plans that help companies achieve efficiency and effectiveness. An important, albeit often ignored aspect of planning, is the relationship it holds to [[forecasting]]. Forecasting can be described as predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like for multiple scenarios. Planning combines forecasting with [[Preparation (principle)|preparation]] of scenarios and how to react to them. Planning is one of the most important project management and time management techniques. Planning is preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some specific goal. If a person does it effectively, they can reduce much the necessary time and effort of achieving the goal. A plan is like a map. When following a plan, a person can see how much they have progressed towards their project goal and how far they are from their destination.

== Planning topics ==

=== Psychological aspects ===
[[File:Schizophrenia PET scan.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Striatum]]; part of the [[basal ganglia]]; neural pathways between the striatum and the [[frontal lobe]] have been implicated in planning function.]]
Planning is one of the [[executive function]]s of the brain, encompassing the [[neurological]] processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal.  Various studies utilizing a combination of [[neuropsychological]], neuropharmacological and functional [[neuroimaging]] approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the [[frontal lobe]].

A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as [[working memory]].

Disruption of the [[neural pathway]]s, via various mechanisms such as [[traumatic brain injury]], or the effects of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s between this area of the frontal cortex and the [[basal ganglia]] specifically the [[striatum]] (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = AM | date = Nov 1997 | title = Cognitive planning in humans: neuropsychological, neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological perspectives | url = | journal = Prog Neurobiol | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 431–50 | pmid = 9421831 | doi=10.1016/s0301-0082(97)00042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who were born Very Low Birth Weight (&lt;1500&amp;nbsp;grams) and Extremely Low BirthWeight (ELBW) are at greater risk for various cognitive deficits including planning ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = JM | last2 = O'Callaghan | first2 = MJ | last3 = Mohay | first3 = H | date = May 1999 | title = Executive function of children with extremely low birthweight: a case control study | url = | journal = Dev Med Child Neurol | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 292–7 | pmid = 10378753 | doi=10.1017/s0012162299000663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aarnoudse-Moens | first1 = CS | last2 = Weisglas-Kuperus | first2 = N | last3 = van Goudoever | first3 = JB | last4 = Oosterlaan | first4 = J | date = Aug 2009 | title = Meta-analysis of neurobehavioral outcomes in very preterm and/or very low birth weight children | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 124 | issue = 2| pages = 717–28 | pmid = 19651588 | doi=10.1542/peds.2008-2816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychological tests===
[[File:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|thumb|right|Animation of a four disc version of the [[Tower of Hanoi]].|alt=A version of the Tower of Hanoi utilizing four discs.]]
There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.

* [[Tower of Hanoi]] (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are different variations of the puzzle, the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine  discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
** Only one disk may be moved at a time.
** Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
** No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welsh | first1 = MC | last2 = Huizinga | first2 = M | date = Jun 2001 | title = The development and preliminary validation of the Tower of Hanoi-revised | url = | journal = Assessment | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 167–76 | pmid = 11428696 | doi=10.1177/107319110100800205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = JR | last2 = Albert | first2 = MV | last3 = Fincham | first3 = JM | date = Aug 2005 | title = Tracing problem solving in real time: fMRI analysis of the subject-paced Tower of Hanoi | url = | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 17 | issue = 8| pages = 1261–74 | doi = 10.1162/0898929055002427 | pmid = 16197682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PEBLTowerOfLondon.png|thumb|Screenshot of the PEBL psychology software running the Tower of London test]]

* [[Tower of London test|Tower of London]] (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1992 (Shallice 1992) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe.  Test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution).

In test participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional [[cerebral blood flow]] to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area: [[i.e.]] subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Planning in public policy ===

Public policy planning includes [[environmental planning|environmental]], [[land-use planning|land use]], [[regional planning|regional]], [[urban planning|urban]] and [[spatial planning]]. In many countries, the operation of a town and country planning system is often referred to as "planning" and the professionals which operate the system are known as "[[urban planner|planners]]".

It is a conscious as well as sub-conscious activity. It is "an anticipatory decision making process" that helps in coping with complexities. It is deciding future course of action from amongst alternatives. It is a process that involves making and evaluating each set of interrelated decisions. It is selection of missions, objectives and "translation of knowledge into action." A planned performance brings better results compared to an unplanned one. A manager's job is planning, monitoring and controlling. Planning and goal setting are important traits of an organization. It is done at all levels of the organization. Planning includes the plan, the thought process, action, and implementation. Planning gives more power over the future. Planning is deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who should do it. This bridges the gap from where the organization is to where it wants to be. The planning function involves establishing goals and arranging them in logical order. A well planned organization achieve faster goals than the ones that don't plan before implementation.

== Planning process ==
[[File:Planning proces.gif|thumb|Example of planning process framework.]]
Patrick Montana and Bruce Charnov outline a three-step result-oriented process for planning:&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Management book fourth edition, Authors: Patrick J. Montana and Bruce H. Charnov&lt;/ref&gt; 
# choosing a destination
# evaluating alternative routes
# deciding the specific course of the plan
In organizations, planning can become a management process, concerned with defining goals for a future direction and determining on the missions and resources to achieve those targets. To meet the goals, managers may develop plans such as a [[business plan]] or a [[marketing plan]]. Planning always has a purpose. The purpose may involve the achievement of certain goals or targets.

Major characteristics of planning in organizations include:

* Planning increases the efficiency of an organization.
* Planning reduces risks.
* Planning utilizes with maximum efficiency the available time and resources

The concept of planning in [[organization]]s involves identifying what an organization wants to do by using four questions: "where are we today in terms of our business or strategy planning? Where are we going? Where do we want to go? How are we going to get there?..."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

== Alternatives to planning ==
[[Opportunism]] can supplement or replace planning.&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22206">Plants produce new tissues and structures throughout their life from '''[[meristem]]s'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=961–70|pmid= 14505363|year=2003|last1=Bäurle|first1=I|last2=Laux|first2=T|title=Apical meristems: The plant's fountain of youth|volume=25|issue=10|doi=10.1002/bies.10341|journal=BioEssays}}  Review.&lt;/ref&gt; located at the tips of organs, or between mature tissues. Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues. By contrast, an animal [[embryo]] will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature.

The properties of organization seen in a plant are '''[[emergence|emergent properties]]''' which are more than the sum of the individual parts.  "The assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable on the basis of examination of the separate parts."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. C. ''Plant Growth and Development'', page 183. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Growth ==
{{further|Cellular differentiation|Morphogenesis|Plant embryogenesis}}

A [[vascular plant]] begins from a single celled [[zygote]], formed by [[fertilisation]] of an egg cell by a sperm cell.  From that point, it begins to divide to form a plant [[embryo]] through the process of '''embryogenesis'''.  As this happens, the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root while the other end forms the tip of the shoot.  In [[seed]] plants, the embryo will develop one or more "seed leaves" ([[cotyledon]]s).  By the end of embryogenesis, the young plant will have all the parts necessary to begin in its life.

Once the embryo [[germination|germinates]] from its seed or parent plant, it begins to produce additional organs (leaves, stems, and roots) through the process of '''organogenesis'''.  New roots grow from root [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the root, and new stems and leaves grow from shoot [[meristem]]s located at the tip of the shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pages=134–41 |pmid=11169586|year=2001|last1=Brand|first1=U|last2=Hobe|first2=M|last3=Simon|first3=R|title=Functional domains in plant shoot meristems|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200102)23:2&lt;134::AID-BIES1020&gt;3.0.CO;2-3|journal=BioEssays}} Review.&lt;/ref&gt;  Branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem, and which have not yet undergone [[cellular differentiation]] to form a specialized tissue, begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot.  Growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed [[primary growth]] and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot. [[Secondary growth]] results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a [[Cambium (botany)|cambium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=533–41|pmid= 15832381 |year=2005 |last1=Barlow |first1=P |title=Patterned cell determination in a plant tissue: The secondary phloem of trees |volume=27 |issue=5 |doi=10.1002/bies.20214 |journal=BioEssays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to growth by [[cell (biology)|cell]] division, a plant may grow through '''cell elongation'''. This occurs when individual cells or groups of cells grow longer. Not all plant cells grow to the same length.  When cells on one side of a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem bends to the side of the slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus, such as light ([[phototropism]]), gravity ([[gravitropism]]), water, ([[hydrotropism]]), and physical contact ([[thigmotropism]]).
[[File:Growth of a Plant.svg|thumb|This image shows the development of a normal plant. It resembles the different growth processes for a leaf, a stem, etc. On top of the gradual growth of the plant, the image reveals the true meaning of phototropism and cell elongation, meaning the light energy from the sun is causing the growing plant to bend towards the light aka elongate.]]
Plant growth and development are mediated by specific [[plant hormone]]s and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (Ross et al. 1983).&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;Ross, S.D.; Pharis, R.P.; Binder, W.D. 1983. Growth regulators and conifers: their physiology and potential uses in forestry. p. 35–78 ''in'' Nickell, L.G. (Ed.), Plant growth regulating chemicals. Vol. 2, CRC Press, Boca Raton FL.&lt;/ref&gt; Endogenous hormone levels are influenced by plant age, cold hardiness, dormancy, and other metabolic conditions; photoperiod, drought, temperature, and other external environmental conditions; and exogenous sources of PGRs, e.g., externally applied and of rhizospheric origin.

=== Morphological variation during growth ===
{{main|Plant morphology}}
Plants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure.  While all organisms vary from individual to individual, plants exhibit an additional type of variation.  Within a single individual, parts are repeated which may differ in form and structure from other similar parts.  This variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant, though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation. There are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects, environmental effects, and juvenility.

[[File:Leaf samples from the giant ragweed.jpg|thumb|right|280x|Variation in leaves from the giant ragweed illustrating positional effects. The lobed leaves come from the base of the plant, while the unlobed leaves come from the top of the plant.]]
There is variation among the parts of a mature plant resulting from the relative position where the organ is produced.  For example, along a new branch the leaves may vary in a consistent pattern along the branch. The form of leaves produced near the base of the branch differs from leaves produced at the tip of the plant, and this difference is consistent from branch to branch on a given plant and in a given species.

The way in which new structures mature as they are produced may be affected by the point in the plants life when they begin to develop, as well as by the environment to which the structures are exposed. Temperature has a multiplicity of effects on plants depending on a variety of factors, including the size and condition of the plant and the temperature and duration of exposure. The smaller and more [[Succulent plant|succulent the plant]], the greater the susceptibility to damage or death from temperatures that are too high or too low. Temperature affects the rate of biochemical and physiological processes, rates generally (within limits) increasing with temperature.

Juvenility or [[heteroblasty]] is when the organs and tissues produced by a young plant, such as a [[seedling]], are often different from those that are produced by the same plant when it is older.  For example, young trees will produce longer, leaner branches that grow upwards more than the branches they will produce as a fully grown tree.  In addition, leaves produced during early growth tend to be larger, thinner, and more irregular than leaves on the adult plant.  Specimens of juvenile plants may look so completely different from adult plants of the same species that egg-laying insects do not recognize the plant as food for their young. The transition from early to late growth forms is referred to as '[[vegetative phase change]]',
but there is some disagreement about terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1086/314215| issn = 1058-5893| volume = 160| issue = S6| pages = 105-S111| last = Jones| first = Cynthia S.| title = An Essay on Juvenility, Phase Change, and Heteroblasty in Seed Plants| journal = International Journal of Plant Sciences| accessdate = 2016-10-16| date = 1999-11-01| url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/314215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adventitious structures===

Plant structures, including, roots, buds, and shoots, that develop in unusual locations are called ''adventitious''. Such structures are common in vascular plants.

Adventitious roots and buds usually develop near the existing vascular tissues so they can connect to the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. However, the exact location varies greatly. In young stems, adventitious roots often form from [[parenchyma]] between the [[vascular bundle]]s. In stems with secondary growth, adventitious roots often originate in phloem parenchyma near the [[vascular cambium]]. In stem cuttings, adventitious roots sometimes also originate in the [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] cells that form at the cut surface. Leaf cuttings of the ''[[Crassula]]'' form adventitious roots in the epidermis.&lt;ref&gt;McVeigh, I. 1938. Regeneration in ''Crassula multicava''. ''American Journal of Botany'' 25: 7-11. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2436624]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buds and shoots====
Adventitious [[bud]]s develop from places other than a shoot [[apical meristem]], which occurs at the tip of a stem, or on a [[Node (botany)|shoot node]], at the leaf axil, the bud being left there during the primary growth. They may develop on roots or leaves, or on shoots as a new growth. Shoot apical meristems produce one or more axillary or lateral buds at each node. When stems produce considerable [[secondary growth]], the axillary buds may be destroyed. Adventitious buds may then develop on stems with secondary growth.

Adventitious buds are often formed after the stem is wounded or [[pruning|pruned]]. The adventitious buds help to replace lost branches. Adventitious buds and shoots also may develop on mature tree trunks when a shaded trunk is exposed to bright sunlight because surrounding trees are cut down. [[Sequoia sempervirens|Redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') trees often develop many adventitious buds on their lower trunks. If the main trunk dies, a new one often sprouts from one of the adventitious buds. Small pieces of redwood trunk are sold as souvenirs termed redwood burls. They are placed in a pan of water, and the adventitious buds sprout to form shoots.

Some plants normally develop adventitious buds on their roots, which can extend quite a distance from the plant. Shoots that develop from adventitious buds on roots are termed [[Basal shoot|suckers]]. They are a type of  natural [[vegetative reproduction]] in many [[species]], e.g. many grasses, [[quaking aspen]] and [[Canada thistle]]. The [[Pando (tree)|Pando quaking aspen]] grew from one trunk to 47,000 trunks via adventitious bud formation on a single root system.

Some leaves develop adventitious buds, which then form adventitious roots, as part of [[vegetative reproduction]]; e.g. piggyback plant (''[[Tolmiea menziesii]]'') and mother-of-thousands (''[[Kalanchoe daigremontiana]]''). The adventitious plantlets then drop off the parent plant and develop as separate [[Cloning|clone]]s of the parent.

[[Coppicing]] is the practice of cutting [[tree]] stems to the ground to promote rapid growth of adventitious shoots. It is traditionally used to produce poles, fence material or firewood. It is also practiced for [[biomass]] crops grown for fuel, such as [[Populus|poplar]] or willow.

====Roots====
[[File:Adventitious roots on Odontonema aka Firespike.jpg|thumb|Roots forming above ground on a cutting of Odontonema aka Firespike]]
Adventitious rooting may be a stress-avoidance acclimation for some species, driven by such inputs as [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/u7685t29p062vw50/ Drew et al. 1979 Ethylene-promoted adventitious rooting and development of cortical air spaces (aerenchyma) in roots may be adaptive responses to flooding in Zea mays L. Planta 147 1; 83-88]), (Visser et al. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; or nutrient deficiency.  Another ecologically important function of adventitious rooting is the vegetative propagation of tree species such as ''Salix'' and ''Sequoia'' in [[riparian]] settings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2952507 Naiman and Decamps, 1997, The Ecology of Interfaces: Riparian Zones]. ''Annual Reviews in Ecological Systems''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of plant stems to form adventitious roots is utilised in commercial propagation by [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]]s. Understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind adventitious rooting has allowed some progress to be made in improving the rooting of cuttings by the application of synthetic auxins as rooting powders and by the use of selective basal wounding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/hl8635j07441247g/ Klerk et al. 1999 Review the formation of adventitious roots: new concepts, new possibilities]. In Vitro Cell &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant 35 3;189-199&lt;/ref&gt; Further progress can be made in future years by applying research into other regulatory mechanisms to commercial propagation and by the comparative analysis of molecular and ecophysiological control of adventitious rooting in 'hard to root' vs. 'easy to root' species.

Adventitious roots and buds are very important when people propagate plants via cuttings, [[layering]], [[plant tissue culture|tissue culture]]. [[Plant hormones]], termed [[auxin]]s, are often applied to stem, [[shoot]] or [[leaf]] cuttings to promote adventitious root formation, e.g. [[African violet]] and [[sedum]] leaves and shoots of [[poinsettia]] and [[coleus]]. Propagation via root cuttings requires adventitious bud formation, e.g. in [[horseradish]] and [[apple]]. In layering, adventitious roots are formed on aerial stems before the stem section is removed to make a new plant. Large houseplants are often propagated by [[air layering]]. Adventitious roots and buds must develop in tissue culture propagation of plants.

=====Modified forms=====
*'''Tuberous roots''' lack a definite shape; example: [[sweet potato]].
*'''Fasciculated root''' (tuberous root) occur in clusters at the base of the stem; examples: [[asparagus]], [[dahlia]].
*'''Nodulose roots''' become swollen near the tips; example: [[turmeric]].
*'''Stilt roots''' arise from the first few nodes of the stem. These penetrate obliquely down into the soil and give support to the plant; examples: [[maize]], [[sugarcane]].
*'''Prop roots''' give mechanical support to aerial branches. The lateral branches grow vertically downward into the soil and act as pillars; example: [[banyan]].
*'''Climbing roots''' arising from nodes attach themselves to some support and climb over it;  example: [[Epipremnum aureum|money plant]].
*'''Moniliform or beaded roots'''  the fleshy roots give a beaded appearance, e.g.: [[bitter gourd]], [[Portulaca]], [[some grasses]]

==Leaf development==
The genetics behind leaf shape development in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' has been broken down into three stages: The initiation of the [[leaf primordium]], the establishment of [[dorsiventrality]], and the development of a marginal [[meristem]]. Leaf primordium is initiated by the suppression of the genes and proteins of the class I ''[[Evolutionary history of plants|KNOX]]'' family (such as ''SHOOT APICAL MERISTEMLESS''). These class I KNOX proteins directly suppress [[gibberellin]] biosynthesis in the leaf primodium. Many genetic factors were found to be involved in the suppression of these genes in leaf primordia (such as ''ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1,'' ''BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1'', ''SAWTOOTH1'', etc.). Thus, with this suppression, the levels of gibberellin increase and leaf primorium initiates growth.

==Flower development==
{{Further|ABC model of flower development}}
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|Anatomy of the flower.]]
[[Image:ABC flower development.svg|thumb|A diagram illustrating flower development in ''[[Arabidopsis]].]]

Flower development is the process by which [[angiosperms]] produce a pattern of [[gene expression]] in [[meristem]]s that leads to the appearance of an organ oriented towards [[sexual reproduction]], the flower. There are three [[physiology|physiological]] developments that must occur in order for this to take place: firstly, the plant must pass from sexual immaturity into a sexually mature state (i.e. a transition towards flowering); secondly, the transformation of the [[apical meristem|apical meristem’s]] function from a vegetative meristem into a floral meristem or [[inflorescence]]; and finally the growth of the flower’s individual organs. The latter phase has been [[scientific model|modelled]] using the ''ABC model'', which describes the biological basis of the process from the perspective of [[molecular genetics|molecular]] and [[developmental genetics|developmental]] genetics.

An external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is required in order to trigger the [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate [[mitosis|mitotic]] cell division in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new [[primordium|primordia]] are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a [[biological development|developmental]] pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) [[phyllotaxis]], that is, the absence of [[plant stem|stem]] elongation among the successive [[whorl (botany)|whorls]] or [[whorl (botany)|verticils]] of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, [[stamen]]s and [[carpel]]s. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer [[cell cycle|divide]].&lt;ref name="azcón-bieto"&gt;{{cite book| author = Azcón-Bieto | title = Fundamentos de fisiología vegetal | year = 2000 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Interamericana de España, SAU | isbn = 84-486-0258-7|display-authors=etal}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the organs present in the four floral verticils is a consequence of the interaction of at least three types of [[gene products]], each with distinct functions. According to the ABC model, functions A and C are required in order to determine the identity of the verticils of the [[perianth]] and the reproductive verticils, respectively. These functions are exclusive and the absence of one of them means that the other will determine the identity of all the floral verticils. The B function allows the differentiation of petals from sepals in the secondary verticil, as well as the differentiation of the stamen from the carpel on the tertiary verticil.

===Floral fragrance===
Plants use floral form, flower, and scent to attract different insects for [[pollination]]. Certain compounds within the emitted scent appeal to particular [[Pollinator|pollinators]]. In ''[[Petunia]]'' ''hybrid''a, volatile [[benzenoids]] are produced to give off the floral smell. While components of the benzenoid biosynthetic pathway are known, the enzymes within the pathway, and subsequent regulation of those enzymes, are yet to be discovered.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schuurink, R.C., Haring, M. A., Clark, D. G. (2006) “Regulation of volatile benzenoid biosynthesis in petunia ﬂowers.” ''Trends Plant Sci'', '''11''' (1). doi: 10.1016/j.tplants.2005.09.009&lt;/ref&gt; 

To determine pathway regulation, ''P. hybrida'' Mitchell flowers were used in a petal-specific [[Microarray analysis techniques|microarray]] to compare the flowers that were just about to produce the scent, to the ''P. hybrida'' cultivar W138 flowers that produce few volatile benzenoids. cDNAs of genes of both plants were sequenced. The results demonstrated that there is a transcription factor upregulated in the Mitchell flowers, but not in the W138 flowers lacking the floral aroma. This gene was named ODORANT1 (ODO1). To determine expression of ODO1 throughout the day, [[Northern blot|RNA gel blot analysis]] was done. The gel showed that ODO1 transcript levels began increasing between 1300 and 1600 h, peaked at 2200 h and were lowest at 1000 h. These ODO1 transcript levels directly correspond to the timeline of volatile benzenoid emission. Additionally, the gel supported the previous finding that W138 non-fragrant flowers have only one-tenth the ODO1 transcript levels of the Mitchell flowers. Thus, the amount of ODO1 made corresponds to the amount of volatile benzenoid emitted, indicating that ODO1 regulates benzenoid biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Additional genes contributing to the biosynthesis of major scent compounds are OOMT1 and OOMT2. OOMT1 and OOMT2 help to synthesize orcinol O-methyltransferases (OOMT), which catalyze the last two steps of the DMT pathway, creating 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (DMT). DMT is a scent compound produced by many different roses yet, some rose varieties, like [[Rose|''Rosa'']] ''gallica'' and Damask rose [[Rose|''Rosa'']] ''damascene'', do not emit DMT. It has been suggested that these varieties do not make DMT because they do not have the OOMT genes. However, following an immunolocalization experiment, OOMT was found in the petal epidermis. To study this further, rose petals were subjected to [[ultracentrifugation]]. Supernatants and pellets were inspected by [[western blot]]. Detection of OOMT protein at 150,000g in the supernatant and the pellet allowed for researchers to conclude that OOMT protein is tightly associated with petal epidermis membranes. Such experiments determined that OOMT genes do exist within ''Rosa gallica'' and Damask rose ''Rosa damascene'' varieties, but the OOMT genes are not expressed in the flower tissues where DMT is made.&lt;ref&gt;Scalliet, G., Lionnet, C., Le Bechec, M., Dutron, L., Magnard, J. L., Baudino, S., Bergougnoux, V., Jullien, F., Chambrier, P., Vergne, P., Dumas, C., Cock, J. M., Hugueney, P. (2006).  “Role of Petal-Specific Orcinol O-Methyltransferases in the Evolution of Rose Scent.” ''Plant Physiol'', '''140''': 18-29. doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.105.070961&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of policy networks ==

Although the number of definitions is almost as large as the number of approaches of analysis, [[R. A. W. Rhodes|Rhodes]]&lt;ref name="rhodes2008" /&gt;{{rp|426}} aims to offer a minimally exclusive starting point: "Policy networks are sets of formal institutional and informal linkages between governmental and other actors structured around shared if endlessly negotiated beliefs and interests in public policy making and implementation."

== Possible typologies of policy networks ==

As Thatcher&lt;ref name="thatcher1998" /&gt;{{rp|391}} notes, policy network approaches initially aimed to model specific forms of state-interest group relations, without giving exhaustive typologies.

=== Policy communities vs. Issue networks ===

The most widely used paradigm of the 1970s and 1980s only analyzed two specific types of policy networks: policy communities and issue networks. Justifications of the usage of these concepts were deduced from empirical case studies.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Thatcher | first = Mark | title = The development of policy network analyses: from modest origins to overarching frameworks | journal = [[Journal of Theoretical Politics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 389–416 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0951692898010004002 | date = October 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0951692898010004002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy Communities in which you refer to relatively slowly changing networks defining the context of policy-making in specific policy segments. The network links are generally perceived as the relational ties between bureaucrats, politicians and interest groups. The main characteristic of policy communities – compared to issue networks – is that the boundaries of the networks are more stable and more clearly defined. This concept was studied in the context of policy-making in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"/&gt;

In contrast, [[issue networks]] – a concept established in literature about United States government - refer to a looser system, where a relatively large number of stakeholders are involved. Non-government actors in these networks usually include not only interest group representatives but also professional or academic experts.  An important characteristic of issue network is that membership is constantly changing, interdependence is often asymmetric and – compared to policy communities – it is harder to identify dominant actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Heclo | first = Hugh | contribution = Issue networks and the executive establishment | editor-last = King | editor-first = Anthony | title = The new American political system | pages = 87–124 | publisher = American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research | location = Washington | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780844733159 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other possible typologies ===

New typological approaches appeared in the early 1990s and late 1980s with the aim of grouping policy networks into a system of mutually exclusive and commonly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"/&gt; One possible logic of typology is based on the degree of integration, membership size and distribution of resources in the network.  This categorization – perhaps most importantly represented by R. A. W. Rhodes – allows the combination of policy communities and issue networks with categories like professional network, intragovernmental network and producer network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marsh | first1 = David | last2 = Rhodes | first2 = R.A.W. | author-link2 = R. A. W. Rhodes | title = Policy networks in British government | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxford New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780198278528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches identify categories based on distinct patterns of state-interest group relations. Patterns include corporatism and pluralism, [[Iron triangle (US politics)|iron triangles]], subgovernment and [[clientelism]] while the differentiation is based on membership, stability and sectorality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = Grant | last2 = Schubert | first2 = Klaus | title = A preliminary ordering of policy network labels | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 7–27 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00286.x | date = February 1992 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00286.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles of policy network analysis ==

As the field of policy network analysis grew since the late 20th century, scholars developed competing descriptive, theoretical and prescriptive accounts. Each type gives different specific content for the term policy network and uses different research methodologies.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

=== Descriptive usage ===

For several authors, policy networks describe specific forms of government policy-making. The three most important forms are interest intermediation, interorganizational analysis, and governance.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Interest intermediation ====

An approach developed from the literature on US pluralism, policy networks are often analyzed in order to identify the most important actors influencing governmental decision-making. From this perspective, a network-based assessment is useful to describe power positions, the structure of [[oligopoly]] in political markets, and the institutions of interest negotiation.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Interorganizational analysis ====

Another branch of descriptive literature, which emerged from the study of European politics, aims to understand the interdependency in decision-making between formal political institutions and the corresponding organizational structures. This viewpoint emphasizes the importance of overlapping organizational responsibilities and the distribution of power in shaping specific policy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = R.A.W. | author-link = R. A. W. Rhodes | title = Control and power in central-local government relations | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot, Hants, England Brookfield, Vermont | edition = revised | year = 1999 | isbn = 9781840147780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governance ====

A third direction of descriptive scholarship is to describe general patterns of policy-making – the formal institutions of power-sharing between government, independent state bodies and the representatives of employer and labor interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = Klaus | last2 = Pedersen | first2 = Ove K. | title = The negotiated economy: ideal and history | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | page = 101 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00361.x | date = June 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00361.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/view/12990/24777 Text.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Peter A. | last2 = Soskice | first2 = David W. | title = Varieties of capitalism : the institutional foundations of comparative advantage | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780199247752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical usage ===

The two most important theoretical approaches aiming to understand and explain actor's behavior in policy networks are the following: power dependence and rational choice.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Power dependence ====

In power dependence models, policy networks are understood as mechanism of exchanging resources between organizations in the networks. The dynamic of exchange is determined by the comparative value of resources (f.e. legal, political or financial in nature) and individual capacities to deploy them in order create better bargaining positions and achieve higher degrees of autonomy.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Rational Choice ====

In policy network analysis, theorists complement standard rational choice arguments with the insights of [[new institutionalism]]. This "actor-centered institutionalism" is used to describe policy networks as structural arrangements between relatively stable sets of public and private players. Rational choice theorists identify [[Node (networking)|links]] between network actors as channels to exchange multiple goods (f.e. knowledge, resources and information).&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

=== Prescriptive usage ===

The prescriptive literature on policy networks focuses on the phenomenon's role in constraining or enabling certain governmental action. From this viewpoint, networks are seen as central elements of the realm of policy-making at least partially defining the desirability of status quo – thus a possible target of reform initiatives.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt; The three most common network management approaches are the following: instrumental (a focus on altering dependency relation), institutional (a focus on rules, incentives and culture) and interactive (a focus on communication and negotiation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kickert | first1 = Walter J.M. | last2 = Klijn | first2 = Erik-Hans | last3 = Koppenjan | first3 = Joop F.M. | author-link1 = Walter Kickert | title = Managing complex networks strategies for the public sector | publisher = Sage | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781446217658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New directions and debates ==

As Rhodes&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt; points out, there is a long-lasting debate in the field about general theories predicting the emergence of specific networks and corresponding policy outcomes depending on specific conditions. No theories have succeeded in achieving this level of generality yet and some scholars doubt they ever will. Other debates are focusing on describing and theorizing change in policy networks. While some political scientists state that this might not be possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Richardson | first = Jeremy | title = Government, interest groups and policy change | journal = [[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]] | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 1006–1025 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9248.00292 | date = December 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.00292 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have made efforts towards the understanding of policy network dynamics. One example is the advocacy coalition framework, which aims to analyze the effect of commonly represented beliefs (in coalitions) on policy outcomes.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nedergaard | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Nedergaard | title = The reform of the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy: an advocacy coalition explanation | journal = Policy Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–195 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01442870802033464 | date = June 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442870802033464 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
{{genetic genealogy}}
'''Population genetics''' is a subfield of [[genetics]] that deals with genetic differences within and between [[population]]s, and is a part of [[evolutionary biology]]. Studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptation]], [[speciation]], and [[population stratification|population structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/subjects/population-genetics|title=Population genetics - Latest research and news {{!}} Nature|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population genetics was a vital ingredient in the [[emergence]] of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Its primary founders were [[Sewall Wright]], [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Ronald Fisher]], who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of [[quantitative genetics]]. Traditionally a highly mathematical discipline, modern population genetics encompasses theoretical, lab, and field work. Population genetic models are used both for [[statistical inference]] from DNA sequence data and for proof/disproof of concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Servedio | first1=Maria R. | last2=Brandvain | first2=Yaniv | last3=Dhole | first3=Sumit | last4=Fitzpatrick | first4=Courtney L. | last5=Goldberg | first5=Emma E. | last6=Stern | first6=Caitlin A. | last7=Van Cleve | first7=Jeremy | last8=Yeh | first8=D.

What sets population genetics apart today from newer, more phenotypic approaches to modelling evolution, such as [[evolutionary game theory]] and [[evolutionary invasion analysis|adaptive dynamics]], is its emphasis on genetic phenomena as [[dominance (genetics)|dominance]], [[epistasis]], and the degree to which [[genetic recombination]] breaks up [[linkage disequilibrium]]. This makes it appropriate for comparison to [[population genomics]] data.

==History==

Population genetics began as a reconciliation of [[Mendelian inheritance]] and [[biostatistics]] models. [[Natural selection]] will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of [[Mendelian genetics]], one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, [[genetic variance]] would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural or sexual selection implausible. The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with [[Mendelian inheritance]]. According to this principle, the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.&lt;ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ewens W.J. | year=2004 | title=Mathematical Population Genetics (2nd Edition) | publisher=Springer-Verlag, New York | isbn=0-387-20191-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician [[Ronald Fisher]]. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change allele frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, [[J.B.S. Haldane]], worked out the mathematics of allele frequency change at a single gene [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] under a broad range of conditions. Haldane also applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as [[peppered moth evolution]] and [[industrial melanism]], and showed that [[selection coefficient]]s could be larger than Fisher assumed, leading to more rapid adaptive evolution as a camouflage strategy following increased pollution.&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bowler | first=Peter J. | title=Evolution : the history of an idea | year=2003 | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 | edition=3rd | pp=325–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"&gt;{{cite book | last=Larson | first=Edward J. | title=Evolution : the remarkable history of a scientific theory | year=2004 | publisher=Modern Library | location=New York | isbn=978-0-679-64288-6 | edition=Modern Library | pp=221–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American biologist [[Sewall Wright]], who had a background in [[animal breeding]] experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, and the effects of [[inbreeding]] on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932 Wright introduced the concept of an [[Fitness landscape|adaptive landscape]] and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks.

The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt; [[John Maynard Smith]] was Haldane's pupil, whilst [[W.D. Hamilton]] was heavily influenced by the writings of Fisher. The American [[George R. Price]] worked with both Hamilton and Maynard Smith. American [[Richard Lewontin]] and Japanese [[Motoo Kimura]] were heavily influenced by Wright.

===Modern synthesis===
{{main | Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

The mathematics of population genetics were originally developed as the beginning of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. Authors such as Beatty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Beatty | first1=John | title=Integrating Scientific Disciplines | publisher=Springer Netherlands | isbn=9789024733422 | pages=125–135 | url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-010-9435-1_7 | language=en | chapter=The Synthesis and the Synthetic Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; have asserted that population genetics defines the core of the modern synthesis. For the first few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists continued to believe that [[Lamarckism]] and [[orthogenesis]] provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Mayr | first1=edited by Ernst | last2=Mayer | first2=William B. Provine ; with a new preface by Ernst | title=The Evolutionary synthesis : perspectives on the unification of biology | date=1998 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn=9780674272262 | pages=295–298 | edition=[New ed].}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the modern synthesis, these ideas were purged, and only evolutionary causes that could be expressed in the mathematical framework of population genetics were retained.&lt;ref name="Provine88"&gt;{{cite book | last=Provine | first=W. B. | year=1988 | title=Evolutionary progress | chapter= Progress in evolution and meaning in life | pages=49–79 | publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus was reached as to which evolutionary factors might influence evolution, but not as to the relative importance of the various factors.&lt;ref name="Provine88" /&gt;

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], a postdoctoral worker in T. H. Morgan's lab, had been influenced by the work on [[genetic diversity]] by [[Russia]]n geneticists such as [[Sergei Chetverikov]]. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of [[microevolution]] developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of [[macroevolution]] observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]''. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. Many more biologists were influenced by population genetics via Dobzhansky than were able to read the highly mathematical works in the original.&lt;ref name="Provine78"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Provine | first=William B. | year=1978 | title=The role of mathematical population geneticists in the evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s | journal=Studies of the History of Biology | volume=2 | pages=167–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain [[E.B. Ford]], the pioneer of [[ecological genetics]], continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to empirically demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] such as human [[blood type]]s. Ford's work, in collaboration with Fisher, contributed to a shift in emphasis during the course of the modern synthesis towards natural selection as the dominant force.&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mayr | first=Ernst | authorlink=Ernst Mayr | year=1988 | title=[[Toward a New Philosophy of Biology | Toward a New Philosophy of Biology: Observations of an Evolutionist]] | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | publisher=[[Harvard University Press|Belknap Press of Harvard University Press]] | page=402 | isbn=0-674-89665-3 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Mayr | first1=edited by Ernst | last2=Mayer | first2=William B.

===Neutral theory and origin-fixation dynamics===

The original, modern synthesis view of population genetics assumes that mutations provide ample raw material, and focuses only on the change in [[allele frequency|frequency of alleles]] within [[population]]s.&lt;ref name="McCandlish-2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McCandlish | first1=David M. | last2=Stoltzfus | first2=Arlin | title=Modeling Evolution Using the Probability of Fixation: History and Implications | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | date=September 2014 | volume=89 | issue=3 | pages=225–252 | doi=10.1086/677571}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main processes influencing allele frequencies are [[natural selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[gene flow]] and recurrent [[mutation]]. Fisher and Wright had some fundamental disagreements about the relative roles of selection and drift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/184/3/609.full Wright and Fisher on Inbreeding and Random Drift by James F. Crow, published in [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] Published 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of molecular data on all genetic differences led to the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]]. In this view, many mutations are deleterious and so never observed, and most of the remainder are neutral, i.e. are not under selection. With the fate of each neutral mutation left to chance (genetic drift), the direction of evolutionary change is driven by which mutations occur, and so cannot be captured by models of change in the frequency of (existing) alleles alone.&lt;ref name="McCandlish-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CasillasBarbadilla2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Casillas | first1=Sònia | last2=Barbadilla | first2=Antonio | title=Molecular Population Genetics | journal=Genetics | date=2017 | volume=205 | issue=3 | pages=1003–1035 | doi=10.1534/genetics.116.196493| pmc=5340319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin-fixation view of population genetics generalizes this approach beyond strictly neutral mutations, and sees the rate at which a particular change happens as the product of the mutation rate and the [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation probability]].&lt;ref name="McCandlish-2014" /&gt;

==Four processes==

===Selection===
[[Natural selection]], which includes [[sexual selection]], is the fact that some [[trait (biology)|traits]] make it more likely for an [[organism]] to survive and [[reproduction|reproduce]]. Population genetics describes natural selection by defining [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] as a [[propensity probability|propensity or probability]] of survival and reproduction in a particular environment. The fitness is normally given by the symbol '''w'''=1-'''s''' where '''s''' is the [[selection coefficient]]. Natural selection acts on [[phenotype]]s, so population genetic models assume relatively simple relationships to predict the phenotype and hence fitness from the [[allele]] at one or a small number of loci. In this way, natural selection converts differences in the fitness of individuals with different phenotypes into changes in allele frequency in a [[population]] over successive generations.

Before the advent of population genetics, many biologists doubted that small differences in fitness were sufficient to make a large difference to evolution.&lt;ref name="Provine78"/&gt; Population geneticists addressed this concern in part by comparing selection to [[genetic drift]]. Selection can overcome genetic drift when '''s''' is greater than 1 divided by the [[effective population size]]. When this criterion is met, the probability that a new advantageous mutant becomes [[fixation (population genetics)|fixed]] is approximately equal to '''2s'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=JBS Haldane | title=A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection, Part V: Selection and Mutation | journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | year=1927 | volume=23 | pages=838–844 | bibcode=1927PCPS...23..838H | doi=10.1017/S0305004100015644 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Orr | first1=H.

====Dominance====

[[Dominance (genetics)|Dominance]] means that the phenotypic and/or fitness effect of one allele at a locus depends on which allele is present in the second copy for that locus. Consider three genotypes at one locus, with the following fitness values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillespie | first=John | authorlink=John_H._Gillespie | title=Population Genetics: A Concise Guide |edition=2nd | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | year=2004 | isbn=0-8018-8008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

s is the [[selection coefficient]] and h is the dominance coefficient. The value of h yields the following information:

====Epistasis====
[[File:Synergistic versus antagonistic epistasis.svg | thumb | 200px | The [[logarithm]] of fitness as a function of the number of deleterious mutations. Synergistic epistasis is represented by the red line - each subsequent deleterious mutation has a larger proportionate effect on the organism's fitness. Antagonistic epistasis is in blue. The black line shows the non-epistatic case, where fitness is the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the contributions from each of its loci.]]

[[Epistasis]] means that the phenotypic and/or fitness effect of an allele at one locus depends on which alleles are present at other loci. Selection does not act on a single locus, but on a phenotype that arises through development from a complete genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miko, I. | date=2008 | title=Epistasis: Gene interaction and phenotype effects | journal=Nature Education | volume=1 | issue=1 | page=197 | url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/epistasis-gene-interaction-and-phenotype-effects-460}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many population genetics models of sexual species are "single locus" models, where the fitness of an individual is calculated as the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the contributions from each of its loci—effectively assuming no epistasis.

In fact, the [[fitness landscape|genotype to fitness landscape]] is more complex. Population genetics must either model this complexity in detail, or capture it by some simpler average rule. Empirically, beneficial mutations tend to have a smaller fitness benefit when added to a genetic background that already has high fitness: this is known as diminishing returns epistasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Berger | first1=D. | last2=Postma | first2=E. | title=Biased Estimates of Diminishing-Returns Epistasis? Empirical Evidence Revisited | journal=Genetics | date=13 October 2014 | volume=198 | issue=4 | pages=1417–1420 | doi=10.1534/genetics.114.169870 | pmid=25313131 | pmc=4256761}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deleterious mutations also have a smaller fitness effect on high fitness backgrounds, this is known as "synergistic epistasis". However, the effect of deleterious mutations tends on average to be very close to multiplicative, or can even show the opposite pattern, known as "antagonistic epistasis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kouyos | first1=Roger D. | last2=Silander | first2=Olin K. | last3=Bonhoeffer | first3=Sebastian | title=Epistasis between deleterious mutations and the evolution of recombination | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | date=June 2007 | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=308–315 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2007.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synergistic epistasis is central to some theories of the purging of [[genetic load|mutation load]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Crow | first1=JF | title=The high spontaneous mutation rate: is it a health risk? | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | date=5 August 1997 | volume=94 | issue=16 | pages=8380–8386 | pmid=9237985 | doi=10.1073/pnas.94.16.8380 | pmc=33757| bibcode=1997PNAS...94.8380C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]].

===Mutation===
{{Main | Mutation}}
[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg | thumb|right | 240px | ''Drosophila melanogaster'']]
Mutation is the ultimate source of [[genetic variation]] in the form of new alleles. In addition, mutation may influence the direction of evolution when there is mutation bias, i.e. different probabilities for different mutations to occur. For example, recurrent mutation that tends to be in the opposite direction to selection can lead to [[mutation-selection balance]]. At the molecular level, if mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Deterministic Mutation Rate Variation in the Human Genome | journal=Genome Research | author= Smith N.G.C., Webster M.T., Ellegren, H. | year=2002 | volume=12 | pages=1350–1356 | doi=10.1101/gr.220502 | url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/9/1350.abstract | issue=9 | pmid=12213772 | pmc=186654 | last2=Webster | last3=Ellegren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Petrov DA, Sangster TA, Johnston JS, Hartl DL, Shaw KL | year=2000 | title=Evidence for DNA loss as a determinant of genome size | journal=Science | volume=287 | pages=1060–1062 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5455.1060 | issue=5455 | bibcode=2000Sci...287.1060P | pmid=10669421 | last2=Sangster | last3=Johnston | last4=Hartl | last5=Shaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Petrov DA | year=2002 | title=DNA loss and evolution of genome size in Drosophila | journal=Genetica | volume=115 | pages=81–91 | doi=10.1023/A:1016076215168 | issue=1 | pmid=12188050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kiontke K, Barriere A, Kolotuev I, Podbilewicz B, Sommer R, Fitch DHA, Felix MA | year=2007 | title=Trends, stasis, and drift in the evolution of nematode vulva development | journal=Current Biology | volume=17 | pages=1925–1937 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.061 | issue=22 | pmid=18024125 | last2=Barrière | last3=Kolotuev | last4=Podbilewicz | last5=Sommer | last6=Fitch | last7=Félix }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Braendle C, Baer CF, Felix MA | year=2010 | title=Bias and Evolution of the Mutationally Accessible Phenotypic Space in a Developmental System | journal=PLoS Genetics | volume=6 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000877 | issue=3 | pmid=20300655 | pmc=2837400 | editor1-last=Barsh | editor1-first=Gregory S | pages=e1000877 | last2=Baer | last3=Félix }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the [[Baldwin effect|phenotype-first theory of evolution]], mutations can eventually cause the [[genetic assimilation]] of traits that were previously [[phenotypic plasticity|induced by the environment]].&lt;ref name="Palmer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Palmer | first=RA | title=Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | year=2004 | pages=828–833 | volume=306 | doi=10.1126/science.1103707 | pmid=15514148 | issue=5697 | bibcode=2004Sci...306..828P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=West-Eberhard | first=M-J. | year=2003 | title=Developmental plasticity and evolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-19-512235-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes. If selection would favor either one out of two mutations, but there is no extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Stoltzfus, A | author2=Yampolsky, L.Y. | lastauthoramp=yes | year=2009 | title=Climbing Mount Probable: Mutation as a Cause of Nonrandomness in Evolution | journal=J Hered | volume=100 | pages=637–647 | doi=10.1093/jhered/esp048 | pmid=19625453 | issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Yampolsky, L.Y. | author2=Stoltzfus, A | lastauthoramp=yes | year=2001 | title=Bias in the introduction of variation as an orienting factor in evolution | journal=Evol Dev | volume=3 | pages=73–83 | doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.003002073.x | pmid=11341676 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutation can have no effect, alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning. Studies in the fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70 percent of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sawyer SA, Parsch J, Zhang Z, Hartl DL | title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in Drosophila | journal=Proc.

Loss of [[endospore|sporulation]] ability in a [[Bacillus subtilis|bacterium]] during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Maughan H, Masel J, Birky WC, Nicholson WL | title=The roles of mutation accumulation and selection in loss of sporulation in experimental populations of Bacillus subtilis | doi= 10.1534/genetics.107.075663 | journal=Genetics | volume=177 | pages=937–948 | year=2007 | pmid=17720926 | pmc=2034656 | issue=2 | last2=Masel | last3=Birky Jr | last4=Nicholson }}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the [[effective population size]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Masel J, King OD, Maughan H | title=The loss of adaptive plasticity during long periods of environmental stasis | doi= 10.1086/510212 | journal=American Naturalist | volume=169 | issue=1 | pages=38–46 | year=2007 | pmid=17206583 | pmc=1766558 | last2=King | last3=Maughan }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift.

===Genetic drift===
{{Main | Genetic drift}}
''Genetic drift'' is a change in [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]] caused by [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]].&lt;ref name="Masel 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume=21 | pages=R837–R838  | author=Masel, J. | title=Genetic drift | journal=Current Biology | year=2011 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.007 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008827 | issue=20 | pmid=22032182}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the alleles in the offspring are a random sample of those in the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Futuyma | first=Douglas
 | title=Evolutionary Biology | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=1998 | isbn=0-87893-189-9 | page=Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely, and thereby reduce genetic variability. In contrast to natural selection, which makes gene variants more common or less common depending on their reproductive success,&lt;ref name=avers&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Avers | first=Charlotte | year=1989 | title=Process and Pattern in Evolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; the changes due to genetic drift are not driven by environmental or adaptive pressures, and are equally likely to make an allele more common as less common.

The effect of genetic drift is larger for alleles present in few copies than when an allele is present in many copies. The population genetics of genetic drift are described using either [[branching process]]es or a [[diffusion equation]] describing changes in allele frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume=188 | pages=783–785 | author=Wahl L.M. | title=Fixation when N and s Vary: Classic Approaches Give Elegant New Results  | journal=Genetics | year=2011 | doi=10.1534/genetics.111.131748  | url=http://www.genetics.org/content/188/4/783.full | issue=4 | pmid=21828279 | pmc=3176088}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are usually applied to the Wright-Fisher and [[Moran process|Moran]] models of population genetics. Assuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after t generations in many replicated populations, starting with allele frequencies of p and q, the variance in allele frequency across those populations is

:&lt;math&gt;
V_t \approx pq\left(1-\exp\left\{-\frac{t}{2N_e} \right\}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Nicholas H. Barton | author2=Derek E. G. Briggs | author3=Jonathan A. Eisen | author4=David B. Goldstein | author5=Nipam H. Patel | title=Evolution | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | year=2007 | isbn=0-87969-684-2
 | page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Fisher]] held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. No population genetics perspective have ever given genetic drift a central role by itself, but some have made genetic drift important in combination with another non-selective force. The [[shifting balance theory]] of [[Sewall Wright]] held that the combination of population structure and genetic drift was important. [[Motoo Kimura]]'s [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] claims that most genetic differences within and between populations are caused by the combination of neutral mutations and genetic drift.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 1998 320"&gt;{{cite book | last=Futuyma | first=Douglas | title=Evolutionary Biology | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] |  year=1998 |  isbn=0-87893-189-9 | page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of genetic drift by means of [[sampling error]] in evolution has been criticized by [[John H Gillespie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gillespie, J.H. | title=Genetic Drift in an Infinite Population: The Pseudohitchhiking Model | journal=Genetics | volume=155 | issue=2 | pages=909–919 | year=2000 | pmid=10835409 | pmc=1461093}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Will Provine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Provine | first1=William B. | title=The "Random Genetic Drift" Fallacy | publisher=CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that selection on linked sites is a more important stochastic force, doing the work traditionally ascribed to genetic drift by means of sampling error. The mathematical properties of genetic draft are different from those of genetic drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Neher | first1=Richard A. | last2=Shraiman | first2=Boris I. | date=August 2011 | title=Genetic Draft and Quasi-Neutrality in Large Facultatively Sexual Populations | journal=Genetics | location=Bethesda, MD | publisher=Genetics Society of America | volume=188 | issue=4 | pages=975–996 | doi=10.1534/genetics.111.128876 | issn=0016-6731 | pmc=3176096 | pmid=21625002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direction of the random change in allele frequency is [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] across generations.&lt;ref name="Masel 2011" /&gt;

===Gene flow===
[[File:Gene flow final.png | right | thumb | 300px | Gene flow is the transfer of [[allele]]s from one [[population]] to another population through immigration of individuals. In this example, one of the birds from population A [[immigrate]]s to population B, which has fewer of the dominant alleles, and through mating incorporates its alleles into the other population.]]
[[Image:Greatwall large.jpg | thumb | left | 220px | The [[Great Wall of China]] is an obstacle to gene flow of some terrestrial species.]]
{{Main | Gene flow}}

Because of physical barriers to migration, along with the limited tendency for individuals to move or spread ([[wiktionary:vagility|vagility]]), and tendency to remain or come back to natal place ([[philopatry]]), natural populations rarely all interbreed as may be assumed in theoretical random models ([[panmixy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Buston | first1=P.

This is described as the extent to which a population is genetically structured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Repaci | first1=V. | author2=Stow, A.J. | author3=Briscoe, D.A. | year=2007 | title=Fine-scale genetic structure, co-founding and multiple mating in the Australian allodapine bee (''Ramphocinclus brachyurus'') | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=270 | pages=687–691 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00191.x | ref=harv | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic structuring can be caused by migration due to historical [[climate change]], species [[range expansion]] or current availability of [[habitat]]. Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures such as the [[Great Wall of China]], which has hindered the flow of plant genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Su, H.; Qu, L.; He, K., Zhang, Z.; Wang, J.; Chen, Z.; Gu, H. | title=The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow? | journal=Heredity | volume=90 | issue=3 | pages=212–9 | year=2003 | pmid=12634804 | doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800237 | ref=harv | last2=Qu | last3=He | last4=Zhang | last5=Wang | last6=Chen | last7=Gu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene flow]] is the exchange of genes between populations or species, breaking down the structure. Examples of gene flow within a species include the migration and then breeding of organisms, or the exchange of [[pollen]]. Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Population genetic models can be used to identify which populations show significant genetic isolation from one another, and to reconstruct their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gravel, S. | title=Population Genetics Models of Local Ancestry | year=2012 | bibcode=2012arXiv1202.4811G | volume=1202 | pages=4811 | arxiv=1202.4811 | doi=10.1534/genetics.112.139808 | first1=S. | journal=Genetics | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjecting a population to isolation leads to [[inbreeding depression]]. Migration into a population can introduce new genetic variants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morjan, C.; Rieseberg, L. | title=How species evolve collectively: implications of gene flow and selection for the spread of advantageous alleles | journal=Mol. Ecol. | volume=13 | issue=6 | pages=1341–56 | year=2004 | pmid=15140081 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02164.x | pmc=2600545 | ref=harv | last2=Rieseberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially contributing to [[evolutionary rescue]]. If a significant proportion of individuals or gametes migrate, it can also change allele frequencies, e.g. giving rise to [[Genetic load#Migration load|migration load]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bolnick | first1=Daniel I. | last2=Nosil | first2=Patrik | title=Natural Selection in Populations Subject to a Migration Load | journal=Evolution | date=September 2007 | volume=61 | issue=9 | pages=2229–2243 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00179.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presence of gene flow, other [[reproductive isolation|barriers to hybridization]] between two diverging populations of an [[outcrossing]] species are required for the populations to [[speciation|become new species]].

====Horizontal gene transfer====
[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|Current tree of life showing vertical and horizontal gene transfers.]]
{{Main | Horizontal gene transfer}}

Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among [[prokaryote]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boucher, Y.; Douady, C.J.; Papke, R.T.; Walsh, D.A.; Boudreau, M.E.; Nesbo, C.L.; Case, R.J.; Doolittle, W.F. | title=Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups | doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247 | journal=Annu Rev Genet | volume=37 | pages=283–328 | year=2003 | pmid=14616063 | last2=Douady | last3=Papke | last4=Walsh | last5=Boudreau | last6=Nesbø | last7=Case | last8=Doolittle }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, this contributes to the spread of [[antibiotic resistance]], as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Walsh T | title=Combinatorial genetic evolution of multiresistance | journal=Curr.

==Linkage==

If all genes are in [[linkage equilibrium]], the effect of an allele at one locus can be averaged across the [[gene pool]] at other loci. In reality, one allele is frequently found in [[linkage disequilibrium]] with genes at other loci, especially with genes located nearby on the same chromosome. [[Recombination (biology)|Recombination]] breaks up this linkage disequilibrium too slowly to avoid [[genetic hitchhiking]], where an allele at one locus rises to high frequency because it is [[genetic linkage|linked]] to an allele under selection at a nearby locus. Linkage also slows down the rate of adaptation, even in sexual populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Weissman | first1=D. B. | last2=Hallatschek | first2=O. | title=The Rate of Adaptation in Large Sexual Populations with Linear Chromosomes | journal=Genetics | date=15 January 2014 | volume=196 | issue=4 | pages=1167–1183 | doi=10.1534/genetics.113.160705 | pmid=24429280 | pmc=3982688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Weissman | first1=Daniel B. | last2=Barton | first2=Nicholas H. | last3=McVean | first3=Gil | title=Limits to the Rate of Adaptive Substitution in Sexual Populations | journal=PLoS Genetics | date=7 June 2012 | volume=8 | issue=6 | pages=e1002740 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002740 | pmid=22685419 | pmc=3369949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Neher | first1=R.

Linkage is a problem for population genetic models that treat one gene locus at a time. It can, however, be exploited as a method for detecting the action of [[natural selection]] via [[selective sweep]]s.

In the extreme case of an [[asexual reproduction|asexual population]], linkage is complete, and population genetic equations can be derived and solved in terms of a travelling [[wave]] of genotype frequencies along a simple [[fitness landscape]].&lt;ref name="Desai"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michael M. Desai, Daniel S. Fisher | title=Beneficial Mutation Selection Balance and the Effect of Linkage on Positive Selection | journal=Genetics | volume=176 | issue=3 | pages=1759–1798 | year=2007 | doi=10.1534/genetics.106.067678 | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/176/3/1759 | pmid=17483432 | pmc=1931526 | last2=Fisher }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[microorganisms|microbes]], such as [[bacteria]], are asexual. The population genetics of their [[adaptation]] have two contrasting regimes. When the product of the beneficial mutation rate and population size is small, asexual populations follow a "successional regime" of origin-fixation dynamics, with adaptation rate strongly dependent on this product. When the product is much larger, asexual populations follow a "concurrent mutations" regime with adaptation rate less dependent on the product, characterized by [[clonal interference]] and the appearance of a new beneficial mutation before the last one has [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixed]].

==Applications==

===Explaining levels of genetic variation===
[[neutral theory of molecular evolution|Neutral theory]] predicts that the level of [[nucleotide diversity]] in a population will be proportional to the product of the population size and the neutral mutation rate. The fact that levels of genetic diversity vary much less than population sizes do is known as the "paradox of variation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lewontin | first1=[by] R. C. | title=The genetic basis of evolutionary change | date=1973 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0231033923 | edition=[4th printing.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While high levels of genetic diversity were one of the original arguments in favor of neutral theory, the paradox of variation has been one of the strongest arguments against neutral theory.

It is clear that levels of genetic diversity vary greatly within a species as a function of local recombination rate, due to both [[genetic hitchhiking]] and [[background selection]]. Most current solutions to the paradox of variation invoke some level of selection at linked sites.&lt;ref name="ellegren"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ellegren | first1=Hans | last2=Galtier | first2=Nicolas | title=Determinants of genetic diversity | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | date=6 June 2016 | volume=17 | issue=7 | pages=422–433 | doi=10.1038/nrg.2016.58}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one analysis suggests that larger populations have more selective sweeps, which remove more neutral genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Corbett-Detig | first1=Russell B. | last2=Hartl | first2=Daniel L. | last3=Sackton | first3=Timothy B. | last4=Barton | first4=Nick H. | title=Natural Selection Constrains Neutral Diversity across A Wide Range of Species | journal=PLOS Biology | date=10 April 2015 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=e1002112 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A negative correlation between mutation rate and population size may also contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sung | first1=W. | last2=Ackerman | first2=M.

Life history affects genetic diversity more than population history does, e.g. [[r/K selection theory|r-strategists]] have more genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=ellegren /&gt;

===Detecting selection===

Population genetics models are used to infer which genes are undergoing selection. One common approach is to look for regions of high [[linkage disequilibrium]] and low genetic variance along the chromosome, to detect recent [[selective sweep]]s.

A second common approach is the [[McDonald–Kreitman test]]. The McDonald–Kreitman test compares the amount of variation within a species ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) to the divergence between species (substitutions) at two types of sites, one assumed to be neutral. Typically, [[synonymous substitution|synonymous]] sites are assumed to be neutral.&lt;ref name=charlesworth&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Charlesworth | first1=J. Eyre-Walker | year=2008 | title=The McDonald–Kreitman Test and Slightly Deleterious Mutations | url=| journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=25 | issue=6 | pages=1007–1015 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msn005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes undergoing positive selection have an excess of divergent sites relative to polymorphic sites. The test can also be use to obtain a genome-wide estimate of the proportion of substitutions that are fixed by positive selection, α.&lt;ref name=eyrewalker&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Eyre-Walker | first1=A | year=2006 | title=The genomic rate of adaptive evolution | url=http://www.zoology.wisc.edu/courses/611/Part2/Readings/3eyre-walker_tree2006.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume=21 | issue=10 | pages=569–575 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.06.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alpha&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Smith | first1=N.

===Demographic inference===

The simplest test for population structure in a sexually reproducing, diploid species, is to see whether genotype frequencies follow Hardy-Weinberg proportions as a function of allele frequencies. For example, in the simplest case of a single locus with two [[allele]]s denoted '''A''' and '''a''' at frequencies ''p'' and ''q'', random mating predicts freq('''AA''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the '''AA''' [[homozygote]]s, freq('''aa''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the '''aa''' homozygotes, and freq('''Aa''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''pq'' for the [[heterozygote]]s. In the absence of population structure, Hardy-Weinberg proportions are reached within 1-2 generations of random mating. More typically, there is an excess of homozygotes, indicative of population structure. The extent of this excess can be quantified as the [[F-statistics|inbreeding coefficient, F]]. When individuals can be assigned to different subpopulations, the degree of population structure is usually calculated using [[Fixation index|F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;]], which is a measure of the proportion of genetic variance that can be explained by population structure.

[[Coalescent theory]] relates genetic diversity in a sample to demographic history of the population from which it was taken. It normally assumes [[neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutrality]], and so sequences from more neutrally-evolving portions of genomes are therefore selected for such analyses. It can be used to infer both the relationships between species ([[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetics]]) and the population structure, demographic history (e.g. [[population bottlenecks]] or [[population growth]]), and [[introgression]] within a species.

Another approach to demographic inference relies on the [[allele frequency spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gutenkunst | first1=Ryan N. | last2=Hernandez | first2=Ryan D. | last3=Williamson | first3=Scott H. | last4=Bustamante | first4=Carlos D. | last5=McVean | first5=Gil | title=Inferring the Joint Demographic History of Multiple Populations from Multidimensional SNP Frequency Data | journal=PLoS Genetics | date=23 October 2009 | volume=5 | issue=10 | pages=e1000695 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695 | pmid=19851460 | pmc=2760211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of genetic systems===

By assuming that there are loci that control the genetic system itself, population genetic models are created to describe the [[evolution of dominance]] and other forms of [[robustness (evolution)|robustness]], the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] and recombination rates, the evolution of [[mutation rate]]s, the evolution of [[evolutionary capacitance|evolutionary capacitors]], the evolution of [[Signalling theory|costly signalling traits]], the [[evolution of ageing]], and the evolution of [[co-operation (evolution)|co-operation]]. For example, most mutations are deleterious, so the optimal [[mutation rate]] for a species may be a trade-off between the damage from a high deleterious mutation rate and the [[metabolism|metabolic]] costs of maintaining systems to reduce the mutation rate, such as DNA repair enzymes.&lt;ref name=Sniegowski&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sniegowski P, Gerrish P, Johnson T, Shaver A | title=The evolution of mutation rates: separating causes from consequences | journal=BioEssays | volume=22 | issue=12 | pages=1057–1066 | year=2000 | pmid=11084621 | doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200012)22:12&lt;1057::AID-BIES3&gt;3.0.CO;2-W | last2=Gerrish | last3=Johnson | last4=Shaver }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important aspect of such models is that selection is only strong enough to purge deleterious mutations and hence overpower mutational bias towards degradation if the selection coefficient s is greater than the inverse of the [[effective population size]]. This is known as the drift barrier and is related to the [[nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution]]. Drift barrier theory predicts that species with large effective population sizes will have highly streamlined, efficient genetic systems, while those with small population sizes will have bloated and complex [[genome]]s containing for example [[intron]]s and [[transposable element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lynch, Michael, John S. Conery | year=2003 | title=The origins of genome complexity | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=302 | pages=1401–1404 | pmid=14631042 | doi=10.1126/science.1089370 | issue=5649 | bibcode=2003Sci...302.1401L | last2=Conery }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, somewhat paradoxically, species with large population sizes might be so tolerant to the consequences of certain types of errors that they evolve higher error rates, e.g. in [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]], than small populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rajon | first1=E. | last2=Masel | first2=J. | title=Evolution of molecular error rates and the consequences for evolvability | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | date=3 January 2011 | volume=108 | issue=3 | pages=1082–1087 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1012918108 | pmid=21199946 | pmc=3024668| bibcode=2011PNAS..108.1082R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5711">In [[computer science]], a '''property testing''' algorithm for a [[decision problem]] is an [[algorithm]] whose [[query complexity]] to its input is much smaller than the [[Computational complexity theory#Measuring the size of an instance|instance size]] of the problem.  Typically property testing algorithms are used to decide if some mathematical object (such as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] or a [[boolean function]]) has a "global" property, or is "far" from having this property, using only a small number of "local" queries to the object.

For example, the following [[promise problem]] admits an algorithm whose query complexity is independent of the instance size (for an arbitrary constant ε &gt; 0):

:"Given a graph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices, decide if ''G'' is [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]], or ''G'' cannot be made bipartite even after removing an arbitrary subset of at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\tbinom n2&lt;/math&gt; edges of ''G''."

Property testing algorithms are central to the definition of [[probabilistically checkable proof]]s, as a probabilistically checkable proof is essentially a proof that can be verified by a property testing algorithm.

==Definition and variants==

Formally, a '''property testing algorithm''' with query complexity ''q''(''n'') and ''proximity parameter'' ε for a decision problem ''L''  is a [[randomized algorithm]] that, on input ''x'' (an instance of ''L'') makes at most ''q''(|''x''|) queries to ''x'' and behaves as follows:
* If ''x'' is in ''L'', the algorithm accepts ''x'' with probability at least ⅔.
* If ''x'' is ε-far from ''L'', the algorithm rejects ''x'' with probability at least ⅔.

Here, "''x'' is ε-far from ''L''" means that the Hamming distance between ''x'' and any string in ''L'' is at least ε|''x''|.

A property testing algorithm is said to have ''one-sided error'' if it satisfies the stronger condition that the accepting probability for instances ''x ∈ L'' is 1 instead of ⅔.

A property testing algorithm is said be ''non-adaptive'' if it performs all its queries before it "observes" any answers to previous queries. Such an algorithm can be viewed as operating in the following manner.  First the algorithm receives its input.  Before looking at the input, using its internal randomness, the algorithm decides which symbols of the input are to be queried.  Next, the algorithm observes these symbols.  Finally, without making any additional queries (but possibly using its randomness), the algorithm decides whether to accept or reject the input.

==Features and limitations==

The main efficiency parameter of a property testing algorithm is its query complexity, which is the maximum number of input symbols inspected over all inputs of a given length (and all random choices made by the algorithm).  One is interested in designing algorithms whose query complexity is as small as possible. In many cases the running time of property testing algorithms is [[Time complexity#Sub-linear time|sublinear]] in the instance length.  Typically, the goal is first to make the query complexity as small as possible as a function of the instance size ''n'', and then study the dependency on the proximity parameter ε.

Unlike other complexity-theoretic settings, the asymptotic query complexity of property testing algorithms is affected dramatically by the representation of instances.  For example, when ε = 0.01, the problem of testing bipartiteness of ''dense graphs'' (which are represented by their adjacency matrix) admits an algorithm of constant query complexity. In contrast, sparse graphs on ''n'' vertices (which are represented by their adjacency list) require property testing algorithms of query complexity &lt;math&gt;\Omega(\sqrt{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

The query complexity of property testing algorithms grows as the proximity parameter ε becomes smaller for all non-trivial properties.  This dependence on ε is necessary as a change of fewer than ε symbols in the input cannot be detected with constant probability using fewer than O(1/ε) queries.  Many interesting properties of dense graphs can be tested using query complexity that depends only on ε and not on the graph size ''n''.  However, the query complexity can grow enormously fast as a function of ε.  For example, for a long time the best known algorithm for testing if a graph does not [[Triangle-free graph|contain any triangle]] had a query complexity which is a [[Tetration|tower function]] of ''poly''(1/ε), and only in 2010 this has been improved to a tower function of ''log''(1/ε).  One of the reasons for this enormous growth in bounds is that many of the positive results for property testing of graphs are established using the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], which also has tower-type bounds in its conclusions.

The '''Reference Daily Intake''' ('''RDI''') is the daily intake level of a [[nutrient]] that is considered to be sufficient to meet the [[Dietary requirements|requirements]] of 97–98% of healthy individuals in every [[demographic]] in the [[United States]]. While developed for the [[US population]], it has been adopted by other countries, though not universally.

The RDI is used to determine the '''Daily Value''' ('''DV''') of foods, which is printed on [[nutrition facts label]]s (as '''% DV''') in the United States and [[Canada]], and is regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Health Canada]]. The labels "high", "rich in", or "excellent source of" may be used for a food if it contains 20% or more of the RDI. The labels "good source", "contains", or "provides" may be used on a food if it contains between 10% and 20% of the RDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims for 'good source', 'high', 'more', and 'high potency', Specific Requirements for Nutrient Content Claims. Food Labeling, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter I, Subchapter B, Part 101, Subpart D, Section 101.54|url= https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=101&amp;showFR=1&amp;subpartNode=21:2.0.1.1.2.4|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=April 1, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Recommended Dietary Allowances''' ('''RDAs''') were a set of nutrition recommendations that evolved into both the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] (DRI) system of nutrition recommendations (which still defines RDA values) and the RDIs used for food labelling.  The first regulations governing U.S. nutrition labels specified a ''% U.S. RDA'' declaration based on the current RDA values, which had been published in 1968. Later, the % U.S. RDA was renamed the %DV and the RDA values that the %DVs were based on became the RDIs.

The RDAs (and later the RDA values within the DRI) were regularly revised to reflect the latest scientific information, but although the [[nutrition labeling]] regulations were occasionally updated, the existing RDI values were not changed, so that until 2016 many of the DVs used on nutrition facts labels were still based on the outdated RDAs from 1968. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published changes to the regulations including updated RDIs and DVs based primarily on the RDAs in the current DRI.

== History ==
The RDI is derived from the RDAs, which were first developed during [[World War II]] by [[Lydia J. Roberts]], [[Hazel Stiebeling]] and [[Helen S. Mitchell]], all part of a committee established by the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] to investigate issues of nutrition that might "affect national defense" (Nestle, 35).{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, for civilians, and for overseas population who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for "energy and eight nutrients", and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, 35).{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, were accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a "margin of safety". Because of food rationing during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens' nutritional intake also took food availability into account.

The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In 1973, the FDA introduced regulations to specify the format of nutrition labels when present, although the inclusion of such labels was largely voluntary, only being required if nutrition claims were made or if nutritional supplements were added to the food. The nutrition labels were to include percent U.S. RDA based on the 1968 RDAs in effect at the time. The RDAs continued to be updated (in 1974, 1980 and 1989) but the values specified for nutrition labelling remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"&gt;{{cite book | title=Front-of-Package Nutrition Rating Systems and Symbols: Phase I Report | chapter=2 History of Nutrition Labeling | author=Institute of Medicine | date=2010 | doi=10.17226/12957 | chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12957/chapter/4 | publisher=The National Academies Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the FDA published new regulations mandating the inclusion of a [[nutrition facts label]] on most packaged foods. Originally the FDA had proposed replacing the percent U.S. RDAs with percent daily values based on the 1989 RDAs but the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 prevented it from doing so. Instead it introduced the RDI to be the basis of the new daily values. The RDI consisted of the existing U.S. RDA values (still based on the 1968 RDAs as the FDA was not allowed to change them at the time) and new values for additional nutrients not included in the 1968 RDAs.&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"/&gt;

In 1997, at the suggestion of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the National Academy, the RDAs became one part of a broader set of dietary guidelines called the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] used by both the United States and Canada. As part of the DRI, the RDAs continued to be updated.

On May 27, 2016, the FDA updated the regulations to change the RDI and Daily Values to reflect current scientific information.&lt;ref name=fda16/&gt;&lt;ref name=FedReg/&gt; Until this time, the Daily Values were still largely based on the 1968 RDAs.

In 2010, the U.S. [[Institute of Medicine]] determined that the government should establish new consumption standards for salt to reduce the amount of [[sodium]] in the typical American diet below levels associated with higher risk of several [[cardiovascular diseases]], yet maintain consumer preferences for salt-flavored food.&lt;ref name="iom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12818 |title=FDA should set standards for salt added to processed foods, prepared meals|publisher=U.S. National Academies of Science |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily maximum for sodium in the United States had been above estimated minimums for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/salt_up2.htm |title=Statement from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program |publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD |date=1999-10-14 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320182203/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/salt_up2.htm |archivedate=2011-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] found that 500 milligrams of sodium per day (approximately 1,250 milligrams of table salt) is a safe minimum level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1349&amp;page=253 |title=Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition |publisher=The National Academies Press, Washington, DC |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the daily allowance for salt is 6&amp;nbsp;g (approximately 2.5 teaspoons, about the upper limit in the U.S.), an amount considered "too high".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8376701.stm |title=Daily salt intake allowances 'were set too high' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3650578.stm |title=Britons told to cut salt intake |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Medicine advisory stated (daily intake basis): "Americans consume more than 3,400 milligrams of sodium &amp;ndash; the amount in about 1.5 teaspoons of salt (8.7&amp;nbsp;g) – each day. The recommended maximum daily intake of sodium – the amount above which health problems appear – is 2,300 milligrams per day for adults, about 1 teaspoon of salt (5.9&amp;nbsp;g). The recommended adequate intake of sodium is 1,500 milligrams (3.9&amp;nbsp;g salt) per day, and people over 50 need even less."&lt;ref name=iom/&gt;

In [[sociology of religion]], '''religious capital''' is the investment an individual makes into their [[Faith|religious faith]]. The investment is the time and physical work involved with the religious faith, as well as the personal investment in ideology, doctrine, and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, R. (2007). The Victory of Reason: how Christianity led to freedom, capitalism, and Western success. Random House.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPkWXgokYLgC&amp;pg=PR56&amp;dq=%22religious+capital%22+stark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p3w1UdL5NsbJyAGnooHQAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20capital%22%20stark&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodney Stark]] has defined it as "(the) degree of mastery of and attachment to a particular religious culture", and has used this theory to explain conversion experiences in a number of his books, notably ''The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success '' and ''The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force''.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J. Z., &amp; Baker, J. (2007). What would Jesus buy: American consumption of religious and spiritual material goods. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 46(4), 501-517.[https://www.academia.edu/366064/What_Would_Jesus_Buy_American_Consumption_of_Religious_and_Spiritual_Material_Goods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the realm of conversion, religious capital theory predicts that individuals will attempt to conserve their religious capital.  Large doctrinal or behavioral changes lose more religious capital than small ones, thus an [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] is more likely to become [[Catholic]] than [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, F.

On Christmas Day 1950, four Scottish students from the [[University of Glasgow]] ([[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]], [[Gavin Vernon]], Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart) removed the [[Stone of Scone]] from [[Westminster Abbey]] in [[London]] and took the Stone back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1457731/Gavin-Vernon.html |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/defining-our-destiny-1-519098 |title=Defining our destiny |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students were members of the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a group that supported [[Scottish Home Rule|home rule]] for Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; In 2008 the incident was made into a film called ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''.&lt;ref name="scotsman2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/film-review-stone-of-destiny-1-1438029 |title=Film review: Stone of Destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Stone of Scone, the ancient Stone upon which Scottish monarchs had been crowned, was taken from [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland by King [[Edward I of England]] (Longshanks) in 1296 during the struggles against English invasion, which historians call the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]] as a [[looting|spoil of war]], kept in Westminster Abbey in London and fitted into [[King Edward's Chair]].&lt;ref name="destiny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/highlights-stone-of-destiny |title=Stone of Destiny |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |year=2012 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent [[England|English]] and then [[United Kingdom|British]] monarchs were crowned sitting upon the chair and Stone.&lt;ref name="destiny" /&gt;  At the time, the Stone was viewed as a symbol of Scottish nationhood; by removing the Stone to London, Edward I was declaring himself 'King of the Scots'.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In 1950, Ian Hamilton, a student at the [[University of Glasgow]], approached Gavin Vernon with a plan to remove the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey in London and return it to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The plan was funded by a [[Glasgow]] businessman, Robert Gray, who was a councillor on the [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways|Glasgow Corporation]].&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/first-stone-raider-meets-his-final-destiny-1-519088 |title=First Stone raider meets his final destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vernon agreed to participate in the plan along with Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart who were also students in Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  By removing the Stone the group hoped to promote their cause for Scottish [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] and to reawaken a sense of national identity amongst the Scottish people.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;

==Removal of the Stone of Scone==
In December 1950, a few days before Christmas, the four students from Glasgow drove to London in two [[Ford Anglia]]s, a journey which took them eighteen hours.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/gavin-vernon-engineer-who-helped-return-the-stone-of-destiny-to-scotland-1.89326 |title=Gavin Vernon Engineer who helped return the Stone of Destiny to Scotland |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]] |date=1 April 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On arrival in London they had a brief meeting at [[Lyons Corner House]] and decided to make an immediate attempt at removing the Stone from the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Later that day Ian Hamilton hid under a trolley in the Abbey, but was caught by a nightwatchman after the Abbey doors had been closed, briefly questioned, and then let go.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The following day Vernon and Stuart returned to Westminster Abbey and learned some information on the watchmen's shifts.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  In the middle of that night, the three men entered a works yard and gained entrance into [[Poet's Corner]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Reaching the Chapel containing the tomb of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and [[King Edward's Chair]], they pulled down the barrier.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On removing the Stone from under the Chair, it crashed to the floor and broke into two pieces&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The three men, using Hamilton's coat, dragged the larger piece down the high altar steps, then Hamilton took the smaller piece to one of the cars waiting outside.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

Ian Hamilton placed the small piece of Stone in the boot of the car and got into the passenger seat.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he did this, Kay Matheson noticed a policeman in the gaslight; Hamilton and Matheson immediately fell into a lovers' clinch.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The policeman stopped and the three proceeded to have a conversation even though it was 5 A.M.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Having shared some jokes and a cigarette Matheson and Hamilton drove off to [[Victoria, London|Victoria]], Hamilton getting out on the way to walk back to the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

On his arrival there was no sign of Vernon and Stuart, so he proceeded to drag the large piece of stone to the car himself.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he was driving away he saw Vernon and Stuart walking towards him.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The stone was so heavy that the springs on the car were sagging, so Vernon, fearing the alarm had been raised, made his way to [[Rugby, Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Hamilton and Stuart drove to [[Kent]], hid the large piece of stone in a field and made their way back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Matheson left her car, containing the small piece of the Stone, with a friend in the Midlands, and like Vernon made her way back to Scotland by train.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On discovering that the Stone was missing, the authorities closed the border between Scotland and England for the first time in four hundred years.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

A fortnight later Hamilton and some friends – including John Josselyn, whose 21st great grandfather was, ironically, Edward I &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/25017403/person/1650035497 | title=John Rodney Josselyn - Overview - Ancestry.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; – recovered the two pieces of stone and brought them to Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  They hired a stonemason, Baillie [[Robert Gray (Scottish politician)|Robert Gray]], to mend the Stone.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  Gray placed a brass rod inside the Stone containing a piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  To this day, nobody knows what was written on the piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In April 1951 the police received a tip-off and the Stone was found on the site of the High Altar at [[Arbroath Abbey]] where in 1320 the assertion of Scottish nationhood was made in the [[Declaration of Arbroath]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The Stone was returned to Westminster Abbey in February 1952.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

The police conducted an investigation with specific focus on Scotland.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  All four of the group were interviewed and all later confessed to their involvement with the exception of Ian Hamilton.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The authorities decided not to prosecute as the potential for the event to become politicised was far too great.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  [[Hartley Shawcross, Baron Shawcross|Sir Hartley Shawcross]], addressing Parliament on the matter, said: "The clandestine removal of the Stone from Westminster Abbey, and the manifest disregard for the sanctity of the abbey, were vulgar acts of vandalism which have caused great distress and offence both in England and Scotland.  I do not think, however, that the public interest required criminal proceedings to be taken."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/319077062/13B6B8FC20016577E13/1?accountid=15842 |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2 April 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
To understand the implications of the raid, one must understand the political landscape in the United Kingdom just after the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny: I felt I was holding Scotland's soul |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Kingdom was a unified nation and even in an era of post-war austerity, devolution was not on the political agenda.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  At the time, the [[Scottish National Party]] had 0.7% of the vote, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had withdrawn its commitment to devolution, and the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Conservative Party]] was at the high point of its popularity in Scotland.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The raid was completely unexpected and gave the cause of Scottish devolution and nationalism a brief sense of prominence in the public conscience throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

The students became notorious for the daring heist and in Scotland they achieved nigh-on hero status, while in contrast the English were somewhat bewildered.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The heist and the students became synonymous with the devolution and [[Scottish National Party|nationalist]] political movements in Scotland from 1950 onwards.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

Over time the incident encouraged a belief in change, throwing open to scrutiny the Union, which had existed since [[Acts of union 1707|1707]].&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;   Long before the Stone was officially returned to Scotland in 1996 and the Scottish people voted for devolution in 1997, the removal of the Stone of Scone in 1950 contributed to those events.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

== Portrayals in popular culture ==

The removal of the stone was the subject of a contemporary [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] song by Donald MacIntyre, "''[[Òran na Cloiche]]''" ("The Song of the Stone"). Its return to England was the subject of an accompanying [[lament]], "''Nuair a Chaidh a' Chlach a Thilleadh''" ("When the Stone Was Returned").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacMillan |first=Somerled |date=1968 |title=Sporan Dhòmhnaill - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre, the Paisley Bard |trans-title=Donald's Purse - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre |url= |language=gd |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |isbn= |page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hamilton's book, ''The Taking of the Stone of Destiny'', was made into a film entitled ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''. The film depicted Hamilton (played by [[Charlie Cox]]) as the protagonist leading a team of students to reclaim the [[Stone of Scone]]. Additionally, Hamilton had a small, [[cameo role]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037156/ Stone of Destiny]," ''[[The Internet Movie Database]]''. ''(Retrieved 2010-01-09.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Alba]] released an hourlong bilingual (Scottish Gaelic and English) dramatization of Kay Matheson's (played by [[Kathleen MacInnes]]) interrogation by the police. In this version Matheson pretends not to speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNJgudcRi64|title=AN CEASNACHADH - Interrogation of a Highland Lass|first=|last=Gaelic Filmz|date=19 February 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' the episode "The Stone of Scone" (1997) reveals the Stone of Destiny was swiped and duplicated by immortals: the Scotsman [[Duncan MacLeod]] and his friends [[Hugh Fitzcairn]] and [[Amanda (Highlander)|Amanda Darieux]]. A cover story involving students was concocted to conceal their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/highlander/the-stone-of-scone-55212/|title=Highlander: The Stone of Scone|first=|last=TV.com|website=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Basic Phase Converter.jpg|thumb|200px|A simple homemade phase converter]]

A '''rotary phase converter''', abbreviated '''RPC''', is an [[electrical machine]] that converts power from one [[polyphase system]] (including frequency) to another, converting through rotary motion. Typically, [[single-phase electric power]] is used to produce [[three-phase electric power]] locally to run three-phase loads (any industrial machinery with three-phase motors) in premises (often residential or consumer) where only single-phase is available.

==Operation==
The main principles of RPC operation are as follows:

Three-phase induction motors have three terminals called "legs", usually numbered (arbitrarily) L1, L2, and L3.

A three-phase induction motor can be run at two-thirds of its rated horsepower on single-phase power applied to any pair of legs, once spun up by some means.

A three-phase induction motor that is spinning under single-phase power applied to legs L1 and L2, generates an electric potential (and can deliver power through) leg L3, although without some form of current injection, special windings in the idler, or other means the voltage will sag when a load is applied.

[[Power factor correction#Power factor correction in non-linear loads|Power factor correction]] is a very important consideration when building or choosing an RPC. This is desirable because an RPC that has power factor correction will consume less current from the single-phase service supplying power to the phase converter and its loads.

Balanced voltage between the three legs of power is important for operational life of the equipment receiving that power. Unbalanced three-phase power can damage the equipment that it is meant to operate.

==History==
[[File:V50.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first locomotive with a phase converter (only for demonstration purposes)]]
[[File:Kandó-féle fázisváltó 1933-ban.jpg|thumb|right|262px|The Kandó phase converter (1933)]]
[[File:Kando mozdony.jpg|thumbnail|right|The "Kandó" locomotive, the first locomotive using a phase converter system]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, there were two main principles of electric railway [[traction current]] systems:
# DC system
# 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz [[single phase]] system
These systems used [[Universal motor|series-wound traction motors]]. All of them needed a separated supply system or converters to take power from the standard 50&amp;nbsp;Hz electric network.

=== Kandó synchronous phase converter ===
[[Kálmán Kandó]] recognized that the electric traction system must be supplied by single-phase 50&amp;nbsp;Hz power from the standard electric network, and it must be converted in the locomotive to three-phase power for traction motors.
&lt;!-- 
Clarify. Series motors, and why 1 phase on the supply? The series motor needs 16 1/3 Hz network. The single phase needs because a single overhead line can supply only a single-phase. More overhead lines increases expenses and decreases the speed
--&gt;

He created an electric machine called a synchronous phase converter, which was a single-phase [[synchronous motor]] and a three-phase [[synchronous generator]] with common stator and rotor.

It had two independent windings:
* The outer winding is a single-phase synchronous motor. The motor takes the power from the [[overhead line]].
* The inner winding is a three-phase (or variable-phase) synchronous generator, which provides the power for the three- (or more) phase traction motors.

=== Single-phase supply ===
The direct feed from a standard electric network makes the system less complicated than the earlier systems and makes possible simple recuperation.

The single-phase feed makes it possible to use a single overhead line. More overhead lines increase the costs, and restrict the maximum speed of train.

=== Speed control ===
The asynchronous traction motor can run on a single RPM determined by the frequency of the feeding current and the loading torque.

The solution was to use more secondary windings on phase converter, and more windings on motor different number of magnetic poles.

A rotary phase converter (RPC) may be built as a [[motor-generator]] set. These completely isolate the load from the single-phase supply and produce balanced three-phase output. However, due to weight, cost, and efficiency concerns, most RPCs are not built this way.

Instead, they are built out of a three-phase induction motor or generator, called an idler, on which two of the terminals (the idler inputs) are powered from the single-phase line.  The [[Magnetic flux|rotating flux]] in the motor produces a voltage on the third terminal. A voltage is induced in the third terminal that is shifted by 120° from the voltage between the first two terminals. In a three-winding motor, two of the windings are acting as a motor, and the third winding is acting as a generator.

===Power quality===
A common measure of the quality of the power produced by an RPC or any phase converter is the voltage balance, which may be measured while the RPC is driving a balanced load such as a three-phase motor. Other quality measures include the harmonic content of the power produced and the [[power factor]] of the RPC motor combination as seen by the utility. Selection of the best phase converter for any application depends on the sensitivity of the load to these factors.   Three-phase [[induction motor]]s are very sensitive to voltage imbalances.

The quality of three-phase power generated by such a phase converter depends upon a number of factors including:
* Power capacity of the phase converter (idler horsepower rating).
* Power level demands of the equipment being supplied. For instance, "hard starting" loads such as heavily loaded machinery or well pumps may have higher requirements than other loads rated at the same horsepower.
* Power quality demands of the equipment being supplied ([[Numerical control|CNC equipment]] may have more stringent power quality requirements than a [[Arc welding|welding machine]])
* Use of techniques to balance the voltage between the three legs.

===Quality improvement===
RPC manufacturers use a variety of techniques to deal with these problems. Some of the techniques include,

*  The insertion of capacitors between the terminals to balance the power at a particular load.
*  The use of idlers with higher power ratings than the loads.
*  The construction of special idler motors with more windings on the third terminal to boost the voltage and compensate for the sag caused by the load.
*  The use of electronics to switch in capacitors, during start up or otherwise, based on the load.
*  The use of filters.

==Uses==

===General===
Demand exists for phase converters due to the use of three-phase motors. With increasing power output, three-phase motors have preferable characteristics to single-phase motors; the latter not being available in sizes over {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} and, though available, rarely seen larger than {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. (Three-phase motors have higher efficiency, reduced complexity, with regards to starting, and three-phase power is significantly available where they are used.)

===Electric railways===
Rotary phase converters are used to produce a single-phase for the single overhead conductor in [[railway electrification system|electric railways]].  Five European countries ([[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]), where electricity is three-phase AC as 50&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], have standardised on single-phase AC at 15&amp;nbsp;kV 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz for railway electrification; phase converters are, therefore, used to change both phases and [[frequency changer|frequency]].  In the [[Soviet Union]], they were used on AC locomotives to convert single phase, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz to 3-phase for driving [[induction motors]] for [[traction motor]] cooling blowers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Захарченко Д.Д., Ротанов Н.А. "Тяговые электрические машины" (Traction electrical мachinery) Москва, Транспорт, 1991 - 343 p., p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to rotary converters ==
Alternatives exist to rotary phase converters for operation of three-phase equipment on a single-phase power supply.

=== Static phase converters ===
These may be an alternative where the issue at hand is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less).  Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so.  (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.)  An oversized static converter can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.

=== Three-phase inverters ===
Three-phase inverters and related [[variable frequency drive]]s, may, under certain circumstances,  produce large amounts of harmonic distortion in their output, and the efficiency of the inverter-motor combination can be poor.

When poor efficiency in a VFD powered motor has been investigated, in every case documented to date, the root cause for the loss in efficiency was either improper installation or a failure to adhere to best practices.   Almost universally,  a VFD increases the efficiency of a system and reduces operating costs.

=== Inverter drives (VFDs) ===
Inverter drives (VFDs) can damage some motors not rated for use with an inverter, but this is not a concern when motor voltages are less than 440 VAC.  Motor manufacturers may void warranties on non-inverter rated motors if they are run at a variable speed or with an inverter, but most three-phase motors over {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} sold today are rated for use with an inverter drive.

This damage can be prevented by the use of load and [[line reactor]]s or in Europe a DU/DT filter. This reactor or filter reduces the voltage stack up that can occur on older high impedance motors such as wound rotor motors. The filter prevents the windings of the motor form insulation breakdown caused by voltage stack up.

VFDs that have a capacity greater than 3&amp;nbsp;hp can be costly, thus making the RPC an attractive option.

A '''shallow foundation''' is a type of building [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] that transfers [[structural load|building loads]] to the earth very near to the surface, rather than to a subsurface layer or a range of depths as does a [[deep foundation]]. Shallow foundations include spread footing foundations, mat-slab foundations, slab-on-grade foundations, pad foundations, [[rubble trench foundation]]s and earthbag foundations.

==Spread footing foundation==
[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017) 00140 (37506832366).jpg|thumb|right|200px|a foundation of what would become a one-story house in the United States circa 1955]]
[[Image:Wall-foundation.jpg|thumb|right|In ground reinforced concrete foundation in cyclonic area, Northern [[Australia]].]]
[[Image:In-ground-foundation.gif|thumb|left|In ground reinforced concrete foundation in cyclonic area, Northern [[Australia]].]]

A spread footing foundation, which is common in residential buildings, has a wider bottom portion than the load-bearing foundation walls it supports. This wider part "spreads" the weight of the structure over more area for greater stability.

The design and layout of spread footings is controlled by several factors, foremost of which is the weight (load) of the structure it must support, penetration of soft near-surface layers, and penetration through near-surface layers likely to change volume due to [[frost heave]] or [[Shrink-swell capacity|shrink-swell]].

These foundations are common in residential construction that includes a basement, and in many commercial structures.
But for high rise buildings they are not sufficient. A spread footing that changes elevation in a series of vertical steps so that it follows the contours of a sloping site or accommodates changes in soil strata, is called a ''stepped footing''.

==Mat-slab foundations==
Mat-slab foundations distribute heavy column and wall loads across the entire building area, to lower the contact pressure compared to conventional spread footings. Mat-slab foundations can be constructed near the ground surface, or at the bottom of basements. In high-rise buildings, mat-slab foundations can be several meters thick, with extensive reinforcing to ensure relatively uniform load transfer.

==Slab-on-grade foundation==
&lt;!--Slab-on-Grade foundation redirects here--&gt;
[[Image:Slab on grade.JPG|thumb|right|Example of slab on grade foundation]]

[[Image:Raft-slab.gif|thumb|right|Raft slab house foundation in cyclonic area, Northern [[Australia]].]]

''Slab-on-grade'' or ''floating slab'' foundations are a [[structural engineering]] practice whereby the [[concrete]] slab that is to serve as the foundation for the structure is formed from a mold set into the ground. The concrete is then placed into the mold, leaving no space between the ground and the structure.  This type of construction is most often seen in warmer climates, where ground freezing and thawing is less of a concern and where there is no need for heat ducting underneath the floor.

The advantages of the slab technique are that it is cheap and sturdy, and is considered less vulnerable to [[termite]] infestation because there are no hollow spaces or [[wood]] channels leading from the ground to the structure (assuming wood siding, etc., is not carried all the way to the ground on the outer walls).

The disadvantages are the lack of access from below for utility lines, the potential for large heat losses where ground temperatures fall significantly below the interior temperature, and a very low elevation that exposes the building to [[flood]] damage in even moderate rains.  Remodeling or extending such a structure may also be more difficult.  Over the long term, ground settling (or [[subsidence]]) may be a problem, as a slab foundation cannot be readily jacked up to compensate; proper soil compaction prior to pour can minimize this.  The slab can be decoupled from ground temperatures by insulation, with the concrete poured directly over insulation (for example, [[Extruded polystyrene|extruded polystyrene foam]] panels), or heating provisions (such as [[hydronic heating]]) can be built into the slab.

Slab-on-grade foundations are commonly used in areas with [[expansive clay]] soil. While elevated structural slabs actually perform better on expansive clays, it is generally accepted by the engineering community that slab-on-grade foundations offer the greatest cost-to-performance ratio for [[tract home|tract]] homes. Elevated structural slabs are generally only found on custom homes or homes with basements.

[[Copper]] piping, commonly used to carry [[natural gas]] and [[water]], reacts with concrete over a long period, slowly degrading until the pipe fails. This can lead to what is commonly referred to as slab leaks.  These occur when pipes begin to leak from within the slab.  Signs of a slab leak range from unexplained dampened carpet spots, to drops in water pressure and wet discoloration on exterior foundation walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hacklerplumbingmckinney.com/slab-leak-repair/ |title=Slab Leak Repair McKinney, Frisco, and Allen Tx - Hackler Plumbing |publisher=Hacklerplumbingmckinney.com |date=2013-11-08 |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Copper pipes must be ''lagged'' (that is, ''[[Building insulation|insulated]]'') or run through a [[Water pipe|conduit]] or [[plumbing|plumbed]] into the building above the slab.  Electrical conduits through the slab must be water-tight, as they extend below ground level and can potentially expose wiring to [[groundwater]].

==Rubble trench foundation==

[[Image:Rubbletrench.png|thumb|right|A cross section view of a rubble trench foundation]]
The [[rubble trench foundation]], a construction approach popularized by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], is a type of [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] that uses loose stone or rubble to minimize the use of [[concrete]] and improve drainage. It is considered more environmentally friendly than other types of foundation because cement manufacturing requires the use of enormous amounts of energy. However, some soil environments (such as particularly expansive or poor load-bearing (&lt; 1 ton/sf) soils) are not suitable for this kind of foundation.

A foundation must bear the structural loads imposed upon it and allow proper drainage of ground water to prevent expansion or weakening of soils and frost heaving. While the far more common concrete foundation requires separate measures to ensure good soil drainage, the rubble trench foundation serves both foundation functions at once.

To construct a rubble trench foundation a narrow trench is dug down below the [[frost line]]. The bottom of the trench would ideally be gently sloped to an outlet. Drainage tile, graded 1:8 to daylight, is then placed at the bottom of the trench in a bed of washed stone protected by filter fabric. The trench is then filled with either screened stone (typically 1-1/2") or recycled rubble. A [[stem wall]] is then constructed, or a steel-reinforced concrete daro beam is poured at the surface to provide ground clearance for the structure.

The rubble-trench foundation is a relatively simple, low-cost, and environmentally-friendly alternative to a conventional foundation, but may require an engineer's approval if building officials are not familiar with it. Frank Lloyd Wright used them successfully for more than 50 years in the first half of the 20th century, and there is a revival of this style of foundation with the increased interest in green building.

==Earthbag foundation==

The basic construction method begins by digging a trench down to undisturbed mineral subsoil. Rows of woven bags (or tubes) are filled with available material, placed into this trench, compacted with a pounder to around 1/3 thickness of pre-pounded thickness, and form a foundation. Each successive layer has one or more strands of [[barbed wire]] placed on top. This digs into the bag's weave to prevent subsequent layers from slipping, and also resists any tendency for the outward expansion of walls. The next row of bags is offset by half a bag's width to form a staggered pattern. These are either pre-filled with material and delivered, or filled in place (often the case with [[Superadobe]]). The weight of this earth-filled bag pushes down on the barbed wire strands, locking the bag in place on the row below. The same process continues layer upon layer, forming walls. A roof can be formed by gradually sloping the walls inward to construct a dome. Traditional types of roof can also be made.

'''Junior Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers''' or '''JPIIE''' (former name: Society of Industrial Engineering) is an [[academic organization]] based in [[University of Perpetual Help System DALTA - Calamba Campus]] exclusive for BS [[Industrial Engineering]] students, faculty and alumni of the said university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uphsdsie.webs.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831233320/http://uphsdsie.webs.com/ |archivedate=2011-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the seven student organizations under the College of Engineering of the university which includes MES (Mechanical Engineering Society) for BS [[Mechanical Engineering]] students and ACES ([[Association of Civil Engineering]] Students) for BS [[Civil Engineering]] among others. The organization is also a member of PIIE (Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://piie.org/aboutus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820043857/http://www.piie.org/aboutus.htm |archivedate=2009-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a premier organization of BS Industrial Engineering graduates and students, and IE professionals in the [[Philippines]]. Engr. Philip Ermita, PIE, ASEAN Engr. is the organization's adviser aside from being the Dean of Collge of Engineering in the university.

== History ==
The society was first recognized by the university and its school director-then Rey Dalde in 2002 on the month of August with the efforts of its first student officers for the school year 2002-2003 (June 2002-March 2003) being headed by their president-then, Maria Fe dela Cruz.
The society's [[by-laws]] has been written mainly by Cherryl C. Marudo. According to the by-laws, the name of the organization is Society of Industrial Engineering Students (or SIES). But, for some reasons, it became locally known as SIE (without the second S which means Students) probably because its name structure has been compared to the university's College of Engineering.
Aside from SIE, the society is also known in the acronym UPHSDSIE, with UPHSD, the university's acronym just to know that the society is in that said university. But still, SIE would do.
By the year 2016, the SIE renamed as the Junior Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers or JPIIE.

The '''Statue of Hope''' is an [[allegorical figure]] that is typically a private [[memorial]] or [[monument]] displayed in a [[graveyard]] or [[cemetery]]. [[Hope]] is one of the [[Seven Virtues]] of the [[Christian religion]].

==History==

Most commonly used in the [[Victorian era]] and believed to be popularized by the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s dedication in 1886. Prior to this, other images such as [[Saint Philomena]] whose authorization of devotion began in 1837 &lt;ref&gt;''It is Time to Meet St. Philomena'' By Dr. Mark Miravalle 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s Goddess of Hope statue sculpted in 1817,&lt;ref&gt;''Kierkegaard and His Contemporaries'': Pages 375–405; Thorvaldsen: An Introduction to his Work 2003&lt;/ref&gt; displayed similar characteristics.

One of the earliest signed Statue of Hope memorials was carved by [[Odoardo Fantacchiotti]] in 1863 for the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] of Samuel Reginald Routh of [[England]] in the [[Protestant]] Cemetery of [[Florence]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunders of White Silence, the Protestant cemetery of Florence, Italy'', Julia Bolton Holloway 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation was completed in 1791. The [[Custom House, Dublin]] [[Ireland]] features a 16 foot (about 5 meter) tall statue of a female resting on an anchor atop the dome. This statue has been called both the Statue of Hope&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic World", The Catholic Publication House, New York, Page 831, Vol. XIX April–September 1874&lt;/ref&gt; and the Statue of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;"The Encyclopædia Britannica", The Sixth Edition, Page 367, Vol. VII, 1823&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

In the [[United States]], these statues were commonly carved out of limestone or [[marble]] and were usually unsigned. The Wilson memorial pictured on the right was sculpted using [[Indiana Limestone]] which was quarried nearby. Towards the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century, some were cast with [[zinc]], commonly referred to as [[White Bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;The Foundry Magazine, Vol.35 No. 5, January 1910, Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious symbolism==

A female, typically shown wearing [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stola]] and [[Palla (garment)|Palla]] garments, stands with one arm resting on or holding an [[anchor]]. This is often an [[Anchored cross]] meaning hope&lt;ref&gt;Keister, Douglas, ''Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography''. Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith Publishers, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary symbol of the statue. Further, the [[New Testament]], Hebrews 6:19 states ''Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William and Cheetam, Samuel, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', London, England: J. R Burr Publishing Co., Page 81, Vol.1, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the opposite arm is raised with the index finger of the hand pointing towards the sky. This symbolizes the pathway to heaven. A hand held over the heart symbolizes faith. Other key elements can be a broken chain attached to the anchor or sometimes hanging from the neck. This symbolizes the cessation of life. Many statues have a single [[five pointed star]] rather than a [[circle of stars]]. The [[Star (heraldry)|star]] is on the top of the forehead, usually on a [[Crown of Immortality]] or [[diadem]], and represents the immortal [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial Art, Ancient and Modern'', Harry A Bliss 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits''''' (sometimes shortened to ''Worms'') is an 1881 book by [[Charles Darwin]] on [[earthworms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the action of Worms, with observations on their Habits''|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1882|pages=179–202|volume=153|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092526755;view=1up;seq=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his last scientific book, and was published shortly before his death (see [[Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms]]). Exploring earthworm behaviour and ecology, it continued the theme common throughout his work that gradual changes over long periods of time can lead to large and sometimes surprising consequences. It was the first significant work on soil [[bioturbation]], although that term was not used by Darwin (it first appeared in the soil and geomorphic literature one hundred years later).

==Paper "On the Formation of Mould"==
After returning from the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey expedition]] in October 1836, Darwin was intensively occupied with further establishing his reputation as an innovative geologist, as well as finding suitable experts to describe his [[natural history]] collections and arranging for publication of their work as the multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]''. Near the outset of the voyage he had planned a book on geology, and during it extracts from his letters on geology had been privately published by his tutor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. Darwin now published papers on "proofs of recent elevation on the coast of Chili", "deposits containing extinct Mammalia" and "coral formations". He also rewrote his journal to incorporate observations from his notebooks as the book now called ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', and began brain-storming in his notebooks about [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref name=vw&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin’s health suffered from the pressure of work, and on 20 September 1837 having been urged by his doctors "knock off all work" he visited his home in [[Shrewsbury]] then went on to stay with his relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, home of his uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah Wedgwood]]. Uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[cinders]] spread years previously had vanished into the soil, forming layers under a top layer of [[loam]]. Jos suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, but apparently thought that this would be of little interest to his nephew, who was working on continental scale geological problems.&lt;ref name=dm233&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, Charles did find it interesting and throughout his life he sustained an interest in this "unsung creature which, in its untold millions, transformed the land as the [[coral]] polyps did the tropical sea".&lt;!-- Add citation --&gt;

He returned to London on October 21st, and prepared a paper on worms forming mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|2006|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR158.1–76&amp;pageseq=22 12 verso–13 recto]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper on the role of earthworms in [[Pedogenesis|soil formation]] was read out by Darwin at the [[Geological Society of London]] on 1 November 1837.&lt;ref name=ew38&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an uncommonly mundane subject for the society, and his peers may have hoped to hear of something more grandiose, even seeing this paper as highlighting Darwin's growing idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=dm233/&gt; The leading geologist [[William Buckland]] subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as "a new &amp; important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth—in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.&lt;ref name=Letter404&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 404 – Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838 |accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper appeared in the ''Proceedings of the Geological Society of London'' in 1838,&lt;ref name=ew38/&gt; and was published with a [[woodcut]] illustration in the ''Transactions of the Geological Society'' in 1840.&lt;ref name=ew40&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed work on earthworms==
From his brain-storming about transmutation towards the end of 1838, Darwin conceived of his theory of [[natural selection]] "by which to work", as his "prime hobby". His main work on the ''Beagle'' collections continued, and in 1842 he published the first of three volumes on geology, ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. He then allowed himself to write out the first "pencil sketch" of his theory. Subsequently, in September 1842, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] where he had space for experimental plant and animal breeding, and surroundings to observe nature.&lt;ref name=vw/&gt; In December of that year he had a quantity of broken chalk spread over a part of a long established pasture field near the house, "for the sake of observing at some future period to what depth it would become buried."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1881|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1357&amp;pageseq=154 139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 he was having disagreements with [[St George Mivart]] about ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Darwin cut communication with Mivart {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and went the less controversial direction of the lowly worm. His network of [[correspondence of Charles Darwin|correspondents]] and fans responded to his interest and "earthworm anecdotes began surfacing in his mountain of mail". He had been interested in earthworms "since his first fishing days at The Mount and flirting days at Maer". Still, other work constrained him. Broken off from ''Descent'', he had to finish his next work ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge 1877.JPG|left|thumb|His research included a railway trip to [[Stonehenge]]]]
By 1876, with his [[Bernard Darwin|first grandson]] on the way, he felt his writing life was nearly over, with so much unfinished. He wanted to write on earthworms "before joining them", but also had two more plant books in mind, and a revision of ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' to work on. He also began an [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|autobiographical work]] intended for his family's eyes only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 622}}&lt;/ref&gt; After turning away a request to support a controversial book on contraception (''[[Fruits of Philosophy]]'') – Darwin was opposed to it – he got back to work on flowers and worms. As with much of his geological and [[evolution]]ary work, worms were a case of [[gradualism|gradual]], barely noticeable changes accumulating over time into large effects. He even went on a two-hour excursion to [[Stonehenge]] to see how its monoliths had been buried by earthworm castings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was occupied by worms at [[Downe]] in 1880, his work coming first. He had help from the family, even receiving soil samples from [[Abinger]]'s Roman ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 643}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told Vladimir Kovalevsky (his Russian translator) of slow progress with his new book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earthworm klitellum copulation beentree.jpg|thumb|Earthworms mate in daylight, but are generally [[nocturnal]] above ground.]]
Darwin calculated that there were 53,767 earthworms recycling away per acre. He carried out experiments indoors, where they worked the earth inside pots in a worm-littered room. He experimented with stimuli at night: strong light would send them into their burrows ("like a rabbit" said Darwin's grandson Bernard), but heat and sound had no effect. Their food preferences were also tested, raw carrots being their favourite.&lt;ref name="Moore1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A photograph of Darwin around the time the book was published.]]
Darwin was fascinated by their [[ethology|behaviour]], from enjoying "the pleasure of eating" (based on their eagerness for certain foods) to their [[mating|sexual passions]], "strong enough to overcome... their dread of light", even to their social feelings ("crawling over each other's bodies").&lt;ref name="Moore1991a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[foraging]] was especially intriguing: they dragged leaves into their burrows, pulling them in the most efficient way, by their pointed end. On these semi-intelligent creatures Darwin wrote that they obtained a "notion, however rude, of the shape of an object", perhaps by feeling it out. Worms, "five or six feet" below the ground ploughed farmers fields. Darwin felt we "ought to be grateful" to these little recyclers, which he compared to "a man... born blind and deaf". He was wondering how long it would be until he would be consumed by worms himself{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. It would surely be his last major work; he told German translator [[Julius Victor Carus|Victor Carus]] "I have little strength &amp; feel very old".&lt;ref name="Moore1991" /&gt;

By 1881 he was unable to summon the strength for revisions and handed ''Worms'' on to [[Francis Darwin|Frank]]. His [[illness of Charles Darwin|health]] gave him troubles; he complained to his long-time friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] that he looked forward to "Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the book he had been anticipating for decades, he hurried his publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] to hasten publication of ''Worms'' even at the risk of not making a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a dinner with [[Edward Aveling]] (soon the son-in-law of [[Karl Marx]]) and other [[atheist]]s, he was asked how he had turned to such an "insignificant" subject as worms, to which he replied "I have been studying their habits for forty years." As with his [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|religious views]], the old naturalist did not see things the same way as Aveling. In Darwin's view, the "insignificant" was the foundation of much greater phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Darwin. Earthworm, Fig. 4B.JPG|thumb|A casting from the Nilgiri Mountains in South India]]
Worms are found in many places, from the forest floor to mountains, and in many locations around the world. Though they are considered terrestrial animals, they are really semi-aquatic, like other [[annelid]]s; they die quickly in air but survive for months in water. Though inactive during the day, they sometimes come out of their burrows at night. They are eaten by [[thrush (bird)|thrush]]es and other birds in large numbers because they lie close to the surface. They have well developed muscular, nervous, circulatory and digestive systems, the latter being quite unique. Though eyeless, they respond to the intensity and duration of light. They also slowly respond to temperature. They have no hearing, but are sensitive to vibrations. Their sense of smell is feeble, but they are able to find their preferred foods. [[Omnivorous]] animals, they swallow much earth and extract food from it. Worms live chiefly on half decayed [[leaf|leaves]], partially digested by a [[Pancreatic juice|pancreatic solution]] before ingestion. This extra-stomachal digestion is not unlike that which Darwin had previously described as occurring in [[Insectivorous Plants (book)|''Insectivorous Plants'']]. The structure and physiology of the [[Oligochaeta#Internal anatomy|calciferous glands]] of earthworms are described. Many hypotheses had been advanced for their function; Darwin believed them to be primarily for [[excretion]] and secondarily a [[digestion]] aid.

Thin leaves are seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by creating a vacuum. Leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. This may deter predators, keep out water and/or keep out chilled air (the latter is Darwin's preferred function). Leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. They drag [[pine needle]] clusters in by the base. [[Petiole (botany)|Petiole]]s are used to plug up burrows, and for food. Worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on [[trial and error]]. Worms excavate burrows by consuming material or, preferably, pushing it away. They mainly consume [[soil]] for nutrients. They are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. Burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or seeds. Worms are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. Darwin draws on correspondence with people from around the world such as [[Fritz Müller]] in Brazil.

[[File:Darwin, Earthworm, Fig.  7.JPG|thumb|Figure from the book showing a sunken stone from Stonehenge]]
The amount of earth brought to the surface by worms can be estimated by the rate at which objects on the surface are buried and by weighing the earth brought up in a given time. Information from farmers on marl, cinders etc. sinking into the ground allowed Darwin to make calculations. He conducted a 29-year experiment on chalk at a field near his house. Objects of all sorts "work themselves downards" as farmers say. Large stones sink because worms fill up any hollows with castings, then eject them beyond the perimeter and the ground around them starts to rise. He visited [[Stonehenge]] and found some outer stones partly buried, the turf sloping up to meet them (see figure 7). Darwin weighed castings and had friends do so in other countries. He also weighed castings per unit area per year, then worked out how thick a layer castings would make, compared with rates of sinking. Additionally, he worked out casting weight per worm per year.

[[File:Darwins Wurmstein im Gras, Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.jpg|thumb|Darwin's experiments included measuring the speed with which stones slowly settle into the earth.]]
Worms have preserved many ancient objects under the ground. Darwin describes an ancient [[Roman villa]] in [[Abinger]], Surrey. Worms have penetrated the concrete walls and even mortar. Similar subsidence occurred at [[Beaulieu Abbey]], Hampshire, with worms penetrating gaps between the tiles. His sons [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] and [[Horace Darwin|Horace]] visited [[Chedworth Roman Villa]] in Gloucestershire, while William reported on [[Brading Roman Villa]], Isle of Wight. Darwin goes into some detail on the well preserved ruins of [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester Roman Town]], Hampshire, with the help of the Rev. J. G. Joyce. Finally he discusses the case of the [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]] Roman town ruins at [[Wroxeter]], Shropshire, with the help of Dr. H. Johnson, who made observations including depth of vegetable mould. He concludes that both worms and other causes, such as dust deposition and washing down of soil, have buried such ruins.

[[Denudation]] (removal of matter to a lower level) is caused mainly by air and water movement. [[Humic acid]]s generated by worms disintegrate rock; their burrowing behaviour speeds this up. But as the soil layer thickens, this process is slowed down. Worms swallow hard objects (e.g. stones) to aid digestion, which causes attrition to such objects. This has geological significance, especially for the smaller particles which otherwise are eroded very slowly.

Rain causes castings to move down an incline; Darwin worked out the weight moving a certain distance in a given time. Some also roll down, and collect in drains etc., or get blown. There is a greater effect on casting movement in the tropics, because of increased rain. The finest earth is washed away. Ledges on hillsides, formerly believed to be caused by grazing mammals, are partly due to casting accumulations. High winds, especially gales, are almost as effective as the slope/rain in moving castings. Crowns and furrows of formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish when under [[pasture]], due to worms, but more slowly when there is no incline. Fine earth is washed down from slopes, making a shallow layer. Dissolving of chalk supplies new earth.

Darwin writes in the conclusion that worms "have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would at first suppose."&lt;ref&gt;p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; They are important for many reasons, including their role in decomposition of rocks, gradual denudation of the land, preservation of archaeological remains, and improving soil conditions for plant growth. Despite their rudimentary sense organs, they show complex, flexible behaviour.

==Reception==
[[File:Man is But a Worm.jpg|thumb|"Man is but a worm" caricature published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' at the end of 1881 ]]
''Worms'' became available in October 1881 and sold thousands of copies in its first few weeks, despite Darwin's comment to Carus that it was "a small book of little moment".&lt;ref name="Moore1991a" /&gt; Darwin received a "laughable" number of letters containing questions, observations and ideas, even "idiotic" ones. A week's holiday with [[Emma Darwin|Emma]] in [[Cambridge]] was to follow. Darwin [[Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms#Death|died]] the next year on 19 April 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vegetation''' is an assemblage of [[plant]] species and the [[ground cover]] they provide.&lt;ref name=Burrows&gt;{{Cite book|last=Burrows|first=Colin J.|year=1990|title=Processes of vegetation change.|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|isbn=0045800138|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a general term, without specific reference to particular taxa, life forms, structure, [[Spatial ecology|spatial]] extent, or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. It is broader than the term ''[[Flora (plants)|flora]]'' which refers to species composition. Perhaps the closest synonym is [[plant community]], but ''vegetation'' can, and often does, refer to a wider range of spatial scales than that term does, including scales as large as the global. Primeval [[redwood forest]]s, coastal [[mangrove]] stands, [[sphagnum bog]]s, [[desert]] [[soil crust]]s, [[Road verge|roadside]] weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated [[garden]]s and lawns; all are encompassed by the term ''vegetation''.

The [[vegetation type]] is defined by characteristic dominant species, or a common aspect of the assemblage, such as an elevation range or environmental commonality.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to California Plant Life; Robert Ornduff, Phyllis M. Faber, Todd Keeler-Wolf; 2003 ed.; p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary use of ''vegetation'' approximates that of ecologist [[Frederic Clements|Frederic Clements']] term '''earth cover''', an expression still used by the [[Bureau of Land Management]]. Natural vegetation refers to plant life undisturbed by humans in its growth and which is controlled by the [[climate|climatic]] conditions of that region.{{clarify|date=November 2016}}

==History of definition==
The distinction between vegetation (the general appearance of a community) and [[flora]] (the taxonomic composition of a community) was first made by [[Jules Thurmann]] (1849). Prior to this, the two terms (vegetation and flora) were used indiscriminately,&lt;ref&gt;Thurmann, J. (1849). ''Essai de Phytostatique appliqué à la chaîne du Jura et aux contrées voisines.'' Berne: Jent et Gassmann, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51540#/summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002105310/http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51540 |date=2017-10-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;Martins, F. R. &amp; Batalha, M. A. (2011). Formas de vida, espectro biológico de Raunkiaer e fisionomia da vegetação. In: Felfili, J. M., Eisenlohr, P. V.; Fiuza de Melo, M. M. R.; Andrade, L.

[[Augustin de Candolle]] (1820) also made a similar distinction, but he used the terms "station" ([[habitat]] type) and "habitation" ([[phytochorion|botanical region]]).&lt;ref&gt;de Candolle, Augustin (1820). Essai Élémentaire de Géographie Botanique. In: ''Dictionnaire des sciences naturelles'', Vol. 18. Flevrault, Strasbourg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7J3yRwiLLcC].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lomolino, M. V., &amp; Brown, J. H. (2004). ''Foundations of biogeography: classic papers with commentaries''. University of Chicago Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the concept of vegetation would influence the usage of the term [[biome]], with the inclusion of the animal element.&lt;ref name="Coutinho"&gt;Coutinho, L. M. (2006). O conceito de bioma. ''Acta Bot. Bras.'' 20(1): 13-23, {{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-33062006000100002 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007001409/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-33062006000100002 |archivedate=2016-10-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other concepts similar to vegetation are "[[physiognomy]] of vegetation" ([[A. von Humboldt|Humboldt]], 1805, 1807) and "formation" ([[August Grisebach|Grisebach]], 1838, derived from "''Vegetationsform''", [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius|Martius]], 1824).&lt;ref name="Martins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, A. von &amp; Bonpland, A. 1805. ''Essai sur la geographie des plantes. Accompagné d'un tableau physique des régions équinoxiales fondé sur des mesures exécutées, depuis le dixiéme degré de latitude boréale jusqu'au dixiéme degré de latitude australe, pendant les années 1799, 1800, 1801, 1802 et 1803''. Paris: Schöll, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/9309#/summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504023415/https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/9309 |date=2018-05-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, A. von &amp; Bonpland, A. 1807.

F. P. von. 1824. ''Die Physiognomie des Pflanzenreiches in Brasilien. Eine Rede, gelesen in der am 14. Febr. 1824 gehaltnen Sitzung der Königlichen Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften.'' München, Lindauer, [http://www.brasiliana.usp.br/handle/1918/01305200#page/5/mode/1up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012193530/http://www.brasiliana.usp.br/handle/1918/01305200 |date=2016-10-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Departing from [[Linnean taxonomy]], Humboldt established a new science, dividing [[plant geography]] between taxonomists who studied plants as taxa and geographers who studied plants as vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Ebach, M.C. (2015). ''Origins of biogeography. The role of biological classification in early plant and animal geography''. Dordrecht: Springer, p. 89, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K7UYCgAAQBAJ].
&lt;/ref&gt; The physiognomic approach in the study of vegetation is common among biogeographers working on vegetation on a world scale, or when there is a lack of taxonomic knowledge of some place (e.g., in the tropics, where biodiversity is commonly high).&lt;ref name="Beard"&gt;Beard J.S. (1978). The Physiognomic Approach. In: R. H. Whittaker (editor). ''Classification of Plant Communities'', pp 33-64, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yFr-CAAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "[[vegetation type]]" is more ambiguous. The definition of a specific vegetation type may include not only physiognomy, but also floristic and habitat aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Eiten, G. 1992. How names are used for vegetation.

{{Main|Vegetation classification}}
There are many approaches for the classification of vegetation (physiognomy, flora, ecology, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;de Laubenfels, D. J. 1975. ''Mapping the World's Vegetation: Regionalization of Formation and Flora''. Syracuse University Press: Syracuse, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küchler, A.W. (1988). The classification of vegetation. In: Küchler, A.W., Zonneveld, I.S. (eds). ''Vegetation mapping''. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, pp 67–80, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HGzyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, P. D. (2009). ''Ecology and Environment''. Rastogi: Meerut, p. 140, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fjmhn4g5VHkC&amp;pg=PA140].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller-Dombois, D. 1984. Classification and Mapping of Plant Communities: a Review with Emphasis on Tropical Vegetation. In: G. M. Woodwell (ed.) ''The Role of Terrestrial Vegetation in the Global Carbon Cycle: Measurement by Remote Sensing'', J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 21-88, {{cite web |url=http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_23/SCOPE_23_2.1_chapter2_21-88.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717052018/http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_23/SCOPE_23_2.1_chapter2_21-88.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work on vegetation classification comes from European and North American ecologists, and they have fundamentally different approaches. In North America, vegetation types are based on a combination of the following criteria: climate pattern, [[plant habit]], [[phenology]] and/or growth form, and dominant species. In the [[U.S. National Vegetation Classification|current US standard]] (adopted by the [[Federal Geographic Data Committee]] (FGDC), and originally developed by [[UNESCO]] and [[The Nature Conservancy]]), the classification is [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] and incorporates the non-floristic criteria into the upper (most general) five levels and limited floristic criteria only into the lower (most specific) two levels. In Europe, classification often relies much more heavily, sometimes entirely, on floristic (species) composition alone, without explicit reference to climate, phenology or growth forms. It often emphasizes [[Indicator value|indicator or diagnostic species]] which may distinguish one classification from another.

In the FGDC standard, the hierarchy levels, from most general to most specific, are: ''system, class, subclass, group, formation, alliance, ''and'' association''. The lowest level, or association, is thus the most precisely defined, and incorporates the names of the dominant one to three (usually two) species of a type. An example of a vegetation type defined at the level of class might be "''Forest, canopy cover &gt; 60%''"; at the level of a formation as "''Winter-rain, broad-leaved, evergreen, sclerophyllous, closed-canopy forest''"; at the level of alliance as "''Arbutus menziesii'' forest"; and at the level of association as "''Arbutus menziesii-Lithocarpus densiflora'' forest", referring to Pacific madrone-tanoak forests which occur in California and Oregon, USA. In practice, the levels of the alliance and/or association are the most often used, particularly in vegetation mapping, just as the Latin binomial is most often used in discussing particular species in taxonomy and in general communication.

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in [[Australia]] classifies its vegetation by [[ecological vegetation class]].

==Dynamics==
Like all the biological systems, plant communities are temporally and spatially dynamic; they change at all possible scales. Dynamism in vegetation is defined primarily as changes in species composition and/or vegetation structure.

===Temporal dynamics===
[[File:Last Glacial Maximum Vegetation Map.svg|thumb|Vegetation types at time of [[Last Glacial Maximum]]]]
Temporally, a large number of processes or events can cause change, but for sake of simplicity they can be categorized roughly as either abrupt or gradual. Abrupt changes are generally referred to as [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]]; these include things like [[wildfire]]s, high [[winds]], [[landslide]]s, [[flood]]s, [[avalanche]]s and the like. Their causes are usually external ([[exogenous]]) to the community—they are natural processes occurring (mostly) independently of the natural processes of the community (such as germination, growth, death, etc.). Such events can change vegetation structure and composition very quickly and for long time periods, and they can do so over large areas. Very few ecosystems are without some type of disturbance as a regular and recurring part of the long term [[system]] dynamic. [[Fire]] and wind disturbances are particularly common throughout many vegetation types worldwide. Fire is particularly potent because of its ability to destroy not only living plants, but also the seeds, spores, and living [[meristem]]s representing the potential next generation, and because of fire's impact on fauna populations, [[soil]] characteristics and other ecosystem elements and processes (for further discussion of this topic see [[fire ecology]]).

Temporal change at a slower pace is ubiquitous; it comprises the field of [[ecological succession]]. Succession is the relatively gradual change in structure and taxonomic composition that arises as the vegetation itself modifies various environmental variables over time, including light, water and [[nutrient]] levels. These modifications change the suite of species most adapted to grow, survive and reproduce in an area, causing floristic changes. These floristic changes contribute to structural changes that are inherent in plant growth even in the absence of species changes (especially where plants have a large maximum size, i.e. trees), causing slow and broadly predictable changes in the vegetation. Succession can be interrupted at any time by disturbance, setting the system either back to a previous state, or off on another [[trajectory]] altogether. Because of this, successional processes may or may not lead to some static, [[climax community|final state]]. Moreover, accurately predicting the characteristics of such a state, even if it does arise, is not always possible. In short, vegetative communities are subject to many variables that together set limits on the predictability of future conditions.

===Spatial dynamics===
As a general rule, the larger an area under consideration, the more likely the vegetation will be heterogeneous across it. Two main factors are at work. First, the temporal dynamics of disturbance and succession are increasingly unlikely to be in synchrony across any area as the size of that area increases. That is, different areas will be at different developmental stages due to different local histories, particularly their times since last major disturbance. This fact interacts with inherent environmental variability (e.g. in soils, climate, topography, etc.), which is also a function of area. Environmental variability constrains the suite of species that can occupy a given area, and the two factors together interact to create a mosaic of vegetation conditions across the landscape. Only in [[agricultural]] or [[horticultural]] systems does vegetation ever approach perfect uniformity. In natural systems, there is always heterogeneity, although its scale and intensity will vary widely.
