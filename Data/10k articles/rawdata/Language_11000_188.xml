      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">"'''A rose by any other name would smell as sweet'''" is a popular reference to [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family's rival house of Montague, that is, that he is named "Montague". The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are. This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language. Juliet compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he were not named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's love. This states that if he were not Romeo, then he would not be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all.

==Origin==
In Act II, Scene II&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/romeo_juliet.2.2.html ''Romeo and Juliet''] on [[MIT]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; of the play, the line is said by Juliet in reference to Romeo's house: [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#House of Montague|Montague]]. The line implies that his name means nothing and they should be together. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Juliet:'''

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?&lt;br/&gt;
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;&lt;br/&gt;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,&lt;br/&gt;
And I'll no longer be a Capulet

'''Romeo:'''

[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

'''Juliet:'''

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;&lt;br/&gt;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.&lt;br/&gt;
What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,&lt;br/&gt;
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part&lt;br/&gt;
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;What's in a name? That which we call a rose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;By any other word would smell as sweet&lt;/u&gt;;&lt;br/&gt;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,&lt;br/&gt;
Retain that dear perfection which he owes&lt;br/&gt;
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,&lt;br/&gt;
And for that name which is no part of thee&lt;br/&gt;
Take all myself.

'''Romeo:'''

I take thee at thy word:&lt;br/&gt;
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;&lt;br/&gt;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Original texts==
Although it is one of the most famous quotes from the work of Shakespeare, no printing in Shakespeare's lifetime presents the text in the form known to modern readers: it is a skillful amalgam assembled by [[Edmond Malone]], an editor in the eighteenth century. 

''Romeo and Juliet'' was published twice, in two very different versions. The first version of 1597, named "Q1", is believed to have been an unauthorised pirate copy or [[bad quarto]] provided to the printer by actors off the books: a [[memorial reconstruction]]. It may also, separately, represent a version of the play improved and trimmed after rehearsals for more dramatic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belsey|first1=Catherine|title=Romeo and Juliet Language and Writing.|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=9781472539441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It runs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
’Tis but thy name that is mine enemy:&lt;br/&gt;
What’s Montague? It is not hand nor foot,&lt;br/&gt;
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part.&lt;br/&gt;
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose,&lt;br/&gt;
By any other name would smell as sweet.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Q2, a superior 1599 printing, is believed to be a more official version printed from Shakespeare's original manuscript although perhaps not with Shakespeare's personal input. This is believed since there are textual oddities such as "false starts" for speeches that were presumably not clearly crossed out enough for the printer to spot.

It uses the text:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy:&lt;br/&gt;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague,&lt;br/&gt;
What’s Montague? It is not hand nor foot,&lt;br/&gt;
Nor arm nor face. O be some other name,&lt;br/&gt;
belonging to a man!&lt;br/&gt;
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose,&lt;br/&gt;
By any other word would smell as sweet.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Malone reasoned that the awkward half-line of ‘belonging to a man’ could be reconnected into verse through correction with Q1. Modern editors have generally concurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1664">The term '''All-in rate''' is used in both [[Construction]] and the [[Finance|Financial]] sector. It essentially just means "full costs charged for a service".

== Financial Definition ==
In general [[finance]] terminology, an all-in rate is the rate that a financial institution uses in charging [[customers]] for accepting [[bankers' acceptance]]s, consisting of the [[bankers' acceptance rate]] (here considered as actually an amount of money, not an amount of money per unit of time, although it may happen to coincide with a rate per unit of time if the time to maturity happens to equal the unit of time used to calculate the rate) plus the [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/All-in-rate Definition of all-in rate at the Financial Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction Estimate Definition ==
In construction terminology, an all-in rate is the total cost of an item including all direct and indirect costs for that item. These costs would include the gross hourly cost of employing the site operative, based upon the standard working week for the country, including items such as [[insurance]]s, statutory contributions and [[taxes]]. The all-in labour rate for the Middle East includes the cost of importing labour and for food and accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.building.co.uk/story_attachment.asp?storycode=3047616&amp;seq=2&amp;type=T&amp;c=1 Building International Costs 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: All-In Labor Rate = (Total Direct Cost of Labor + Total Indirect Cost of Labor) / Total work hours

In [[linguistics]], an '''alphaphonetic pronunciation''' is the pronunciation of an [[alphabet]]ical glyph ("[[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]") with the canonical pronunciation employed in learning the alphabet, rather than in accord with other [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] variants. It is a concept within [[phonemic orthography]], particularly with the pronunciation of [[vowel]]s, in which the alphabetic pronunciation of a letter name is taken as a default and employed in the pronunciation of particular [[word]]s spelled with that letter. [[Phonological change]] may be constrained by the influence of canonical [[alphabet#Pronunciation|alphabet pronunciation]].

== Overview ==
In languages such as [[English language|English]] in which many words have several [[morphophonemic]] variants, the pronunciation of the letters of the alphabet influences an invariant "alphaphonemic pronunciation" of words. The concept is less relevant to languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in which the phonemic orthographies are always alphaphonemic, and thus no distinctions are relevant. The latter type of languages may be said to have "good" or "1:1" grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence.

For example, the letter "a," in English alphaphonemic pronunciation, is pronounced {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} and not {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} as in [[Latin]]-based languages. 
Hence a word like "[[amen]]," which in its original Latin alphaphonemic pronunciation is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("ah-men"), in English it is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("A-men"). In both American and British English, the English alphaphonemic pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} is colloquially (if not formally) dominant, while the {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} pronunciation is typically regarded as "Latin" or "Latinized" (which, in context of Protestantism, may carry a certain negative connotation of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] culture and influence).

The English alphaphonemic pronunciation of many words can be confusing to non-English speakers. The letter "i" in English words like "light" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|t}}, "bicycle" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|s|ᵻ|k|əl}}, "triad" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|.|æ|d}}, "final" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|aɪ|n|əl}}, and "spike" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|aɪ|k}} are all pronounced alphaphonemically, and thus differ particularly from other orthographies. (The historic basis for this is in the [[Great Vowel Shift]].) For example, with Latin-based language speakers, a Latin-based pronunciation of "i" is constant, and considers "i" to always indicate {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|iː}}. In Latin orthography, the English alphaphonemic "I" {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is spelled "ai," not "i," thus the Latin orthographic transcription of English pronunciations would be close the IPA examples above, while their native pronunciations of these English words would unintelligible (variations from English [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], etc. isolated in [brackets],): "light" {{IPA|/ˈliː[x]t/}}, "bicycle" {{IPA|/ˈbiːsikl[ɛ]/}}, "triad" {{IPA|/ˈtriː[aː]d/}}, "final" {{IPA|/ˈfiːn[aː]l/}}, and "spike" {{IPA|/ˈspiːk[ɛ]/}}.

As these examples show, because English alphaphonemics deviate significantly from Latinate pronunciations, the correspondence of English word spellings with their correct English pronunciations are not intuitively obvious to a learner.

'''Alphonse (Alfons) Olterdissen''' ([[Maastricht]], December 12, 1865 - Maastricht, February 24, 1923) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer, poet and composer who wrote extensively in the [[Maastrichtian dialect]]. The final stanza of his opera ''Trijn de Begijn'' eventually became the [[Maastricht#Local anthem|local anthem of Maastricht]] loosely copy of the Romanian composer [[Ciprian Porumbescu]]'s (1853-1883)  "Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire”.

==Biography==
Olterdissen was born to a [[Germany|German]] father and a mother from the [[Zeeland|province of Zeeland]] and grew up speaking [[Dutch language|Dutch]], only learning the Maastricht dialect socially. In 1883 he moved to [[Amsterdam]] to attend the [[Rijksschool voor de Kunstnijverheid]] in order to develop his abilities in painting. After graduating from the Rijksschool he set up a school in Maastricht, without success. Hereafter, Olterdissen focused on promoting tourism to Maastricht.

Olterdissen's lack of business skill led him to gather a significant debt which he tried to alleviate by writing [[play (theatre)|plays]] and [[operetta]]s. Initially not achieving much success, his fortunes increased in 1907 with ''De kaptein vaan Köpenick''. This was a play about the then popular [[Wilhelm Voigt]] (also known as ''Hauptmann von Köpenick''). A second success story was the comical opera ''Trijn de Begijn'' in 1910.

==Local anthem==
This is the text of the final stanza of ''Trijn de Begijn'', which was adopted in 2002 as the official anthem of the city of Maastricht by its municipal government .&lt;ref name="Municipality of Maastricht"&gt;{{cite web |title=Municipality of Maastricht: Maastrichts Volkslied|year=2008 |publisher=N.A.

'''Asceticism''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|t|ɪ|s|ɪ|z|əm}}; from the {{lang-el|[[Wiktionary:ἄσκησις|ἄσκησις]]}} ''áskesis'', "exercise, training") is a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from [[sensual]] [[pleasure]]s, often for the purpose of pursuing spiritual goals. Ascetics may withdraw from the world for their practices or continue to be part of their society, but typically adopt a frugal lifestyle, characterised by the renunciation of material possessions and physical pleasures, and time spent fasting while concentrating on the practice of religion or reflection upon spiritual matters.&lt;ref name="Finn2009p94"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Finn |title=Asceticism in the Graeco-Roman World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EAgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94 |year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-48066-6 |pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asceticism has been historically observed in many [[religious]] traditions, including [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]]. Contemporary mainstream [[Islam]] practices asceticism in the form of fasting during [[Ramadan]] by abstaining from all sensual pleasures, including food and water from sunrise until sunset. The observation of fasting during Ramadan is purely done for God and to increase one's spiritual connection with God; it is compulsory for all Muslims to fast as it is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. [[Sufi]] tradition has included strict asceticism throughout history.&lt;ref name=tucker176&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dionysian Mysteries]], as well as more modern [[Left-Hand Path|Left Hand]] traditions, openly reject ascetic practises and focus on various types of [[hedonism]].

==Etymology and meaning==
The adjective "ascetic" derives from the ancient Greek term ''askēsis'', which means "training" or "exercise". The original usage did not refer to [[self-denial]], but to the physical training required for [[Athletics (physical culture) | athletic]] events. Its usage later extended to rigorous practices used in many major religious traditions, in varying degrees, to attain redemption and higher spirituality.&lt;ref name="TF"&gt;{{cite book|last= Clarke|first= Paul A. B.|author2= Andrew Linzey|title= Dictionary of ethics, theology and society|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|year= 1996|series= Routledge Reference|page= 58|isbn= 978-0-415-06212-1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=idsNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dom [[Cuthbert Butler]] classified asceticism into natural and unnatural forms:&lt;ref name="WimbushValantasis2002p9"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIqym5Pw_O8C|title=Asceticism|author1=Vincent L. Wimbush|author2=Richard Valantasis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-803451-3|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Natural asceticism" involves a [[lifestyle (sociology) | lifestyle]] which reduces material aspects of life to the utmost simplicity and to a minimum. This may include minimal, simple clothing, sleeping on a floor or in caves, and eating a simple minimal amount of food.&lt;ref name="WimbushValantasis2002p9"/&gt; Natural asceticism, state Wimbush and Valantasis, does not include maiming the body or harsher austerities that make the body suffer.&lt;ref name="WimbushValantasis2002p9"/&gt;
* "Unnatural asceticism", in contrast, covers practices that go further, and involves body mortification, punishing one's own flesh, and habitual self-infliction of pain - such as by sleeping on a bed of nails.&lt;ref name="WimbushValantasis2002p9"/&gt;

==Religions==
[[Self-discipline]] and abstinence in some form and degree are parts of religious practice within many religious and spiritual traditions. Ascetic lifestyle is associated particularly with [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, [[fakir]]s in Abrahamic religions, and [[bhikkhu]]s, [[Jain monasticism|munis]], [[sannyasa|sannyasi]]s, [[yogi]]s in Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Waite|title=Oxford Thesaurus of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaCcAQAAQBAJ |year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-956081-3 |pages=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G.

====Christianity====

{{see also|Ascetical theology|Degrees of Orthodox monasticism}}

Christian authors of late antiquity such as [[Origen]], [[St. Jerome]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01767c.htm New Advent – Catholic Encyclopedia: Asceticism, quoting St. Jerome]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellopos.net/notebook/ignatius.asp?pg=5 From Chapter 1 of a letter from Ignatius to Polycarp]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chrysostom]], and [[St. Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] interpreted meanings of [[Biblical]] texts within a highly asceticized religious environment. Scriptural examples of asceticism could be found in the lives of [[John the Baptist]], [[Jesus]], the [[twelve apostles]] and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]]. The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] revealed ascetic practices of the ancient Jewish sect of [[Essenes]] who took vows of abstinence to prepare for a holy war. An emphasis on an ascetic religious life was evident in both early Christian writings (see the [[Philokalia]]) and practices (see [[hesychasm]]). Other Christian practitioners of asceticism include individuals such as [[Simeon Stylites]], [[Saint David]] of Wales and [[Francis of Assisi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Finn, much of early Christian asceticism has been traced to Judaism, but not to traditions within Greek asceticism.&lt;ref name="Finn2009p94"/&gt; Some of the ascetic thoughts in Christianity nevertheless, Finn states, have roots in Greek moral thought.&lt;ref name="Finn2009p94"/&gt; Virtuous living is not possible when an individual is craving bodily pleasures with desire and passion. Morality is not seen in the ancient theology as a balancing act between right and wrong, but a form of spiritual transformation, where the simple is sufficient, the bliss is within, the frugal is plenty.&lt;ref name="Finn2009p94"/&gt;

The deserts of the [[Middle East]] were at one time inhabited by thousands of Christian [[hermit]]s&lt;ref&gt;for a study of the continuation of this early tradition in the Middle Ages, see Marina Miladinov, ''Margins of Solitude: Eremitism in Central Europe between East and West'' (Zagreb: Leykam International, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; including St. [[Anthony the Great]] (aka St. Anthony of the Desert), St. [[Mary of Egypt]], and St. [[Simeon Stylites]]. In 963 CE, an association of monasteries called ''Lavra'' was formed on [[Mount Athos]], in [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013p548"/&gt; This became the most important center of orthodox Christian ascetic groups in the centuries that followed.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013p548"&gt;{{cite book|author=William M.

[[celibacy|Sexual abstinence]] such as those of the [[Encratites]] sect of Christians was only one aspect of ascetic renunciation, and both natural and unnatural asceticism have been part of Christian asceticism. The natural ascetic practices have included simple living, begging,&lt;ref name=jbarrier163/&gt; fasting and ethical practices such as humility, [[compassion]], patience and [[prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A.

=====Evagrius Ponticus: monastic teaching=====
{{ see also|Evagrius Ponticus|Origen|Clement of Alexandria }}
[[Evagrius Ponticus]], also called Evagrius the Solitary (345-399 AD) was a highly educated monastic teacher who produced a large theological body of work, mainly ascetic, including the ''Gnostikos'' (from Ancient Greek: γνωστικός gnostikos, "learned", from γνῶσις gnōsis, knowledge), also known as ''The Gnostic: To the One Made Worthy of Gnosis''. The ''Gnostikos'' is the second volume of a trilogy containing the ''Praktikos'', intended for young monks to achieve ''apatheia'',  i.e. " a state of calm which is the prerequisite for love and knowledge ",&lt;ref&gt;Robin Darling Young, Evagrius the Iconographer: Monastic Pedagogy in the Gnostikos, Journal of Early Christian Studies, Volume 9, Number 1, Spring 2001, pp. 53-71 (Article), (Johns Hopkins University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to purify their intellect and make it impassible to reveal the truth hidden in every being.  The third book, ''Kephalaia Gnostika'', was meant for meditation by advanced monks. Those writings made him one of the most recognized ascetic teachers and scriptural interpreters of his time, which include [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]].

The ascetic literature of early Christianity was influenced by pre-Christian Greek philosophical traditions, especially [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], looking for the perfect spiritual way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Rubenson,''The Cambridge History of Christianity'', (Edited by Augustine Casiday, Frederick W. Norris), Chapter 27 - Asceticism and monasticism, I: Eastern pp. 637-668, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clement of Alexandria, Philosophy and Scriptures can be seen as "double expressions of one pattern of knowledge ".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Darling Young,  Evagrius the Iconographer: Monastic Pedagogy in the Gnostikos, Journal of Early Christian Studies, Volume 9, Number 1, Spring 2001, pp. 53-71 (Article), (Johns Hopkins University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Evagrius, " body and the soul are there to help the intellect and not to hinder it ".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Plested, The Macarian Legacy: The Place of Macarius-Symeon in the Eastern Christian Tradition, (Oxford Theology and Religion Monographs), 2004, p67&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
[[File:Portrait of a Muslim ascetic (fakir) in Eastern Bengal in the 1860s.jpg|thumb|190px|A Sufi Muslim ascetic (fakir) in [[Bengal]] in the 1860s.]]
Scholars in the field of [[Sufi]] studies have argued that asceticism (''zuhd'') served as a precursor to the later doctrinal formations of Sufis that began to emerge in the 10th century through the works of individuals such as [[Junayd of Baghdad|al-Junayd]], [[al-Qushayri|al-Qushayrī]], al-Sarrāj, [[Hujwiri|al-Hujwīrī]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Knysh, Alexander.

Sufism grew as a mystical, somewhat hidden tradition in the mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam, state Eric Hanson and Karen Armstrong, likely in reaction to "the growing worldliness of Ummayyad and 'Abassid societies".&lt;ref name=hanson104&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric O.

The [[Ashkenazi Hasidim]] ({{lang-he|חסידי אשכנז}}, ''Chassidei Ashkenaz'') were a [[Judaism|Jewish]] mystical, ascetic movement in the German [[Rhineland]] whose practices are documented in the texts of the 12th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name="Shokek2013p132"/&gt; Peter Meister states that this Jewish asceticism emerged in the 10th century, grew much wider with prevalence in southern Europe and the Middle East through the Jewish pietistic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Meister |title=German Literature Between Faiths: Jew and Christian at Odds and in Harmony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJ4scIsXRtcC |year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03910-174-0 |pages=41–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shimon Shokek, these ascetic practices were the result of an influence of medieval Christianity on Ashkenazi Hasidism. The Jewish faithful of this Hasidic tradition practiced the punishment of body, self-torture by starvation, sitting in the open in freezing snow, or in the sun with fleas in summer, all with the goal of purifying the soul and turning one's attention away from the body unto the soul.&lt;ref name="Shokek2013p132"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimon Shokek |title=Kabbalah and the Art of Being: The Smithsonian Lectures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad62AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-79738-8|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant school of Jewish asceticism appeared in the 16th-century led from [[Safed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wolfson | first=Elliot R. | title=Asceticism, Mysticism, and Messianism: A Reappraisal of Schechter’s Portrait of Sixteenth-Century Safed | journal=Jewish Quarterly Review | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | volume=106 | issue=2 | year=2016 | doi=10.1353/jqr.2016.0007 | pages=165–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mystics engaged in radical material abstentions and self-mortification with the belief that this helps them transcend the created material world, reach and exist in the mystical spiritual world. A studied example of this group was [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]], and their rules of ascetic lifestyle (''Hanhagoth'')  are documented.&lt;ref name=nadler78/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yūrō Teshima|title=Zen Buddhism and Hasidism: A Comparative Study|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3sAKAAAAYAAJ|year =1995|publisher =University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0003-3|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bahá'í Faith====
According to Shoghi Effendi, in Bahai faith, the maintenance of a high standard of moral conduct is not to be associated or confused with any form of asceticism, or of excessive and bigoted puritanism. The standard inculcated by Bahá’u’lláh seeks, under no circumstances, to deny anyone the legitimate right and privilege to derive the fullest advantage and benefit from the manifold joys, beauties, and pleasures with which the world has been so plentifully enriched by an All-Loving Creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Advent of Divine Justice]] | author=Effendi, Shoghi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

===Indian religions===
Asceticism is found in both non-theistic and theistic traditions within Indian religions. The origins of the practice are ancient and a heritage shared by major Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. These probably developed from a syncretism of [[Vedic]] and [[Śramaṇa|Sramanic]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Axel Michaels|author2=Barbara Harshav|title=Hinduism: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jID3TuoiOMQC |year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08952-3|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asceticism in Indian religions includes a spectrum of diverse practices, ranging from the mild self-discipline, self-imposed poverty and simple living typical of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard F.

According to Hajime Nakamura and other scholars, some early Buddhist texts suggest that asceticism was a part of Buddhist practice in its early days.&lt;ref name="Nakamura1980p73"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura |title=Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0A7y4TCeVQC |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0272-8 |pages=73 with footnote 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiuAllinson1988p99"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shuxian Liu|author2=Robert Elliott Allinson|title=Harmony and Strife: Contemporary Perspectives, East &amp; West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Je1UbD8Dyj4C |year=1988|publisher=Chinese University Press|isbn=978-962-201-412-1 |pages=99 with footnote 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in practice, records from about the start of the common era through the 19th century CE suggest that asceticism has been a part of Buddhism, both in Theravada and Mahayana traditions.

=====Theravada=====
Textual evidence suggests that ascetic practices were a part of the Buddhist tradition in [[Sri Lanka]] by the 3rd century BCE, and this tradition continued through the medieval era in parallel to ''sangha'' style monastic tradition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2000p90"&gt;{{cite book|author=William M.

=====Mahayana=====
In the Mahayana tradition, asceticism with esoteric and mystical meanings became an accepted practice, such as in the Tendai and Shingon schools of Japanese Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Johnston2000p90"/&gt; These Japanese practices included penance, austerities, ablutions under a waterfall, and rituals to purify oneself.&lt;ref name="Johnston2000p90"/&gt; Japanese records from the 12th century record stories of monks undertaking severe asceticism, while records suggest that 19th century [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]] monks woke up at midnight or 2:00 AM daily, and performed ascetic water purification rituals under cold waterfalls.&lt;ref name="Johnston2000p90"/&gt; Other practices include the extreme ascetic practices of eating only pine needles, resins, seeds and ultimately self-mummification, while alive, or ''[[Sokushinbutsu]]'' (''miira'') in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Ichiro Hori (1962), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062053 Self-Mummified Buddhas in Japan.

The Chinese Buddhist asceticism practices, states James Benn, were not an adaptation or import of Indian ascetic practices, but an invention of Chinese Buddhists, based on their unique interpretations of ''Saddharmapuṇḍarīka'' or ''Lotus Sūtra''.&lt;ref name=bennret207&gt;James A Benn (2012), Multiple Meanings of Buddhist Self-Immolation in China – A Historical Perspective, ''Revue des Études Tibétaines'', no. 25, pages 203–212, '''Quote:''' "Of all the forms of self-immolation, auto-cremation in particular seems to have been primarily created by medieval Chinese Buddhists.

Renunciation from the worldly life, and a pursuit of spiritual life either as a part of monastic community or as a loner, has been a historic tradition of Hinduism since ancient times. The renunciation tradition is called [[Sannyasa]], and this is not the same as asceticism – which typically connotes severe self-denial and self-mortification. ''Sannyasa'' often involved a simple life, one with minimal or no material possessions, study, meditation and ethical living. Those who undertook this lifestyle were called ''Sannyasi'', ''[[Sadhu]]'', ''Yati'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=yatin&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 yatin] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhiksu'', ''Pravrajita/Pravrajitā'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pravrajitA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 pravrajitA] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; and Parivrajaka in Hindu texts.&lt;ref name=olivelleshs265&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1981), Contributions to the Semantic History of Saṃnyāsa, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 101, No. 3, pages 265-274&lt;/ref&gt; The term with a meaning closer to asceticism in Hindu texts is [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]], but it too spans a spectrum of meanings ranging from inner heat, to self-mortification and penance with austerities, to meditation and self-discipline.&lt;ref name=brsmith144&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin R Smith|editor=Mark Singleton and Jean Byrne|title=Yoga in the Modern World: Contemporary Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XF6AVGsz_YwC&amp;pg=PA144 |year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-05520-3 |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaelber&gt;Kaelber, W.

Asceticism-like practices are hinted in the [[Vedas]], but these hymns have been variously interpreted as referring to early [[Yogi]]s and loner renouncers.

The Keśin does not live a normal life of convention. His hair and beard grow longer, he spends long periods of time in absorption, musing and meditating and therefore he is called "sage" (muni). They wear clothes made of yellow rags fluttering in the wind, or perhaps more likely, they go naked, clad only in the yellow dust of the Indian soil. But their personalities are not bound to earth, for they follow the path of the mysterious wind when the gods enter them. He is someone lost in thoughts: he is miles away.

Similarly, the [[Nirvana Upanishad]] asserts that the Hindu ascetic should hold, according to [[Patrick Olivelle]], that "the sky is his belief, his knowledge is of the absolute, union is his initiation, compassion alone is his pastime, bliss is his garland, the cave of solitude is his fellowship", and so on, as he proceeds in his effort to gain self-knowledge (or soul-knowledge) and its identity with the Hindu metaphysical concept of [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patrick| last=Olivelle|year=1992|title= The Samnyasa Upanisads|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0195070453|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fB8uneM7q1cC&amp;pg=PA230|pages =227–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other behavioral characteristics of the ''Sannyasi'' include: [[ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[akrodha]] (not become angry even if you are abused by others),&lt;ref&gt;P. 134 ''The rule of Saint Benedict and the ascetic traditions from Asia to the West'' By Mayeul de Dreuille&lt;/ref&gt; disarmament (no weapons), chastity, bachelorhood (no marriage), avyati (non-desirous), amati (poverty), self-restraint, truthfulness, sarvabhutahita (kindness to all creatures), [[asteya]] (non-stealing), [[aparigraha]] (non-acceptance of gifts, non-possessiveness) and [[shaucha]] (purity of body speech and mind).&lt;ref name=mdh&gt;Mariasusai Dhavamony (2002), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives, {{ISBN|978-9042015104}}, page 96-97, 111-114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Powell (2010), Windows Into the Infinite: A Guide to the Hindu Scriptures, Asian Humanities Press, {{ISBN|978-0875730714}}, pages 292-297&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jainism====
{{Main|Jain monasticism}}
Asceticism in one of its most intense forms can be found in one of the oldest religions, known as [[Jainism]]. Ascetic life may include nakedness symbolizing non-possession of even clothes, fasting, body mortification, penance and other austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed in Jainism to be essential for reaching ''siddha'' and ''moksha'' (liberation from rebirths, salvation).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=118-122}}{{sfn|Fujinaga|2003|pp=205-212 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=144–150}} In Jainism, the ultimate goal of life is to achieve the liberation of soul from endless cycle of rebirths ([[moksha]] from [[samsara]]), which requires ethical living and asceticism. Most of the austerities and ascetic practices can be traced back to Vardhaman [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth "fordmaker" or [[Tirthankara]] who practiced 12 years of asceticism before reaching enlightenment.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=549}}{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=408–409}}

Jain texts such as ''Tattvartha Sutra'' and ''Uttaradhyayana Sutra'' discuss ascetic austerities to great lengths and formulations. Six outer and six inner practices are most common, and oft repeated in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-121}} According to John Cort, outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}} Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}}

The Jain text of [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]] describes Mahavira's asceticism in detail, whose life is a source of guidance on most of the ascetic practices in Jainism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =F.

Both Mahavira and his ancient Jaina followers are described in Jainism texts as practicing body mortification and being abused by animals as well as people, but never retaliating and never initiating harm or injury ([[ahimsa]]) to any other being.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=180}} With such ascetic practices, he burnt off his past [[Karma]], gained spiritual knowledge, and became a [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=180}} These austere practices are part of the monastic path in Jainism.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=210}} The practice of body mortification is called ''kaya klesha'' in Jainism, and is found in verse 9.19 of the ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'' by [[Umaswati]], the most authoritative oldest surviving Jaina philosophical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

=====Monastic practice=====
[[File:Mahavratas.jpg|thumb|190px|Five Mahavratas of Jain ascetics]]

In Jain monastic practice, the monks and nuns take ascetic vows, after renouncing all relations and possessions. The vows include a complete commitment to [[nonviolence]] (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]''). They travel from city to city, often crossing forests and deserts, and always barefoot. Jain ascetics do not stay in a single place for more than two months to prevent attachment to any place.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Jacobi, "Sacred Books of the East", vol. 22: Gaina Sutras Part I. 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm |title=Jaina Sutras, Part I (SBE22) Index |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the four months of monsoon (rainy season) known as ''chaturmaas'', they stay at a single place to avoid killing life forms that thrive during the rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D. Ryan|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA208|year=2006|publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5 |pages=207–208, see Jain Festivals }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain monks and nuns practice complete celibacy. They do not touch or share a sitting platform with a person of the opposite sex.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Jain ascetics follow a strict [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet without root vegetables. Prof. Pushpendra K. Jain explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Clearly enough, to procure such vegetables and fruits, one must pull out the plant from the root, thus destroying the entire plant, and with it all the other micro organisms around the root. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be plucked only when ripe and ready to fall off, or ideally after they have fallen off the plant. In case they are plucked from the plants, only as much as required should be procured and consumed without waste.&lt;ref name="Prof.Jain" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The monks of [[Shvetambara]] sub-tradition within Jainism do not cook food, but solicit [[alms]] from householders. [[Digambara]] monks have only a single meal a day.&lt;ref name="Tobias1995p102"/&gt; Neither group will beg for food, but a Jain ascetic may accept a meal from a householder, provided that the latter is pure of mind and body, and offers the food of his own volition and in the prescribed manner. During such an encounter, the monk remains standing and eats only a measured amount. [[Fasting]] (i.e., abstinence from food and sometimes water) is a routine feature of Jain asceticism. Fasts last for a day or longer, up to a month. Some monks avoid (or limit) medicine and/or hospitalization out of disregard for the physical body.&lt;ref name="Prof.Jain"&gt;{{cite web|last=P.K. Jain|title=Dietary code of practice among the Jains|url=http://www.ivu.org/congress/2000/jainism.html|publisher=34th World Vegetarian Congress Toronto, Canada, July 10th to 16th 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shvetambara]] monks and nuns wear only unstitched white robes (an upper and lower garment), and own one bowl they use for eating and collecting alms. Male [[Digambara]] sect monks do not wear any clothes, carry nothing with them except a soft broom made of shed peacock feathers (''pinchi'') to gently remove any insect or living creature in their way or bowl, and they eat with their hands.&lt;ref name="Tobias1995p102"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Tobias |title=A Vision of Nature: Traces of the Original World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNmB-GsVAFEC |year=1995|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=978-0-87338-483-4|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sleep on the floor without blankets, and sit on wooden platforms. Other austerities include meditation in seated or standing posture near river banks in the cold wind, or meditation atop hills and mountains, especially at noon when the sun is at its fiercest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Key Chapple |title=Yoga in Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqbbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199 |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-57218-3 |pages=199–200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such austerities are undertaken according to the physical and mental limits of the individual ascetic.

When death is imminent from an advanced age or terminal disease, many Jain ascetics take a final vow of [[Santhara]] or [[Sallekhana]], a fast to peaceful and detached death, by first reducing intake of and then ultimately abandoning all medicines, food, and water.&lt;ref name=battin47/&gt; Scholars state that this ascetic practice is not a suicide, but a form of natural death, done without passion or turmoil or suddenness, and because it is done without active violence to the body.&lt;ref name=battin47&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Pabst Battin|title=The Ethics of Suicide: Historical Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJJZCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47 |year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513599-2 |pages=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions===
====Inca religion====
In Inca religion of medieval South America, asceticism was practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Classen | first=Constance | title=Aesthetics and Asceticism in Inca Religion | journal=Anthropologica | volume=32 | issue=1 | year=1990 | page=101 | doi=10.2307/25605560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high priests of the Inca people lived an ascetic life, which included fasting, chastity and eating simple food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Baudin|title=Daily Life of the Incas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IFUK08sA_8C&amp;pg=PA136 |year=1961| publisher=Courier |isbn=978-0-486-42800-0 |pages=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] records report Christian missionaries encountering ascetic Inca hermits in the Andean mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabine Hyland|title=The Jesuit and the Incas: The Extraordinary Life of Padre Blas Valera, S.J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AnQpJYpg-n4C&amp;pg=PA164|year=2003|publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-11353-4 |pages=164–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taoism====
Historical evidence suggest that the monastic tradition in Taoism practiced asceticism, and the most common ascetic practices included fasting, complete sexual abstinence, self-imposed poverty, sleep deprivation, and secluding oneself in the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Eskildsen|title=Asceticism in Early Taoist Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1S6Xq9B1ucC&amp;pg=PA157 |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3956-2 |pages=24, 153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian F.

According to Stephen Eskildsen, asceticism continues to be a part of modern Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Eskildsen|title=Asceticism in Early Taoist Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1S6Xq9B1ucC&amp;pg=PA157 |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3956-2 |pages=157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WR Garrett (1992), The Ascetic Conundrum: The Confucian Ethic and Taoism in Chinese Culture, in William Swatos (ed.), Twentieth-Century World Religious Movements in Neo-Weberian Perspective, Edwin Mellen Press, {{ISBN|978-0773495500}}, pages 21-30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zoroastrianism====
In [[Zoroastrianism]], active participation in life through good thoughts, good words and good deeds is necessary to ensure happiness and to keep the chaos at bay. This ''active'' participation is a central element in [[Zoroaster]]'s concept of [[free will]]. In the Avesta, the sacred scriptures of Zoroastrianism, fasting and mortification are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37864/asceticism/433/Forms-of-religious-asceticism "In Zoroastrianism (founded by the Persian prophet Zoroaster, 7th century bc), there is officially no place for asceticism. In the Avesta, the sacred scriptures of Zoroastrianism, fasting and mortification are forbidden, but ascetics were not entirely absent even in Persia." article "Asceticism" in Encyclopædia Britannica accessed June 21, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological and psychological views==
Early 20th-century German sociologist [[Max Weber]] made a distinction between ''innerweltliche'' and ''ausserweltliche'' asceticism, which means (roughly) "inside the world" and "outside the world", respectively. [[Talcott Parsons]] translated these as "worldly" and "otherworldly"—however, some translators use "inner-worldly", and this is more in line with inner world explorations of mysticism, a common purpose of asceticism. "Inner- or Other-worldly" asceticism is practised by people who withdraw from the world to live an ascetic life (this includes monks who live communally in monasteries, as well as hermits who live alone). "Worldly" asceticism refers to people who live ascetic lives but do not withdraw from the world.
{{quote|text=Wealth is thus bad ethically only in so far as it is a temptation to idleness and sinful enjoyment of life, and its acquisition is bad only when it is with the purpose of later living merrily and without care.| sign=[[Max Weber]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weber |first=Max |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism |url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/weber/protestant-ethic/ch05.htm |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism}}

Weber claimed this distinction originated in the [[Protestant Reformation]], but later became secularized, so the concept can be applied to both religious and secular ascetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]] | author=Parsons, Talcott (translator) | chapter= Chapter 2}}See translator's note on Weber's footnote 9 in chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th-century American psychological theorist [[David McClelland]] suggested worldly asceticism is specifically targeting worldly pleasures that "distract" people from their calling and may accept worldly pleasures that are not distracting. As an example, he pointed out [[Quakers]] have historically objected to bright-coloured clothing, but wealthy Quakers often made their drab clothing out of expensive materials. The color was considered distracting, but the materials were not. [[Amish]] groups use similar criteria to make decisions about which modern technologies to use and which to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Achieving Society | author=McClelland | year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nietzsche's view==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
In the third essay ("[[On the Genealogy of Morals#Third Treatise: "What do ascetic ideals mean?"|What Do Ascetic Ideals Mean?]]") from his book ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discusses what he terms the "ascetic ideal" and its role in the formulation of morality along with the history of the will. In the essay, Nietzsche describes how such a paradoxical action as asceticism might serve the interests of life: through asceticism one can overcome their desire to perish from pain and despair and attain mastery over oneself. In this way one can express both [[ressentiment]] and [[the will to power]]. Nietzsche describes the morality of the ascetic priest as characterized by [[Christianity]] as one where, finding oneself in pain or despair and desiring to perish from it, the will to live causes one to place oneself in a state of hibernation and denial of the material world in order to minimize that pain and thus preserve life, a technique which Nietzsche locates at the very origin of secular science as well as of religion. He associated the "ascetic ideal" with Christian [[decadence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8547">'''Asian handicap''' betting is a form of betting on [[association football|football]] in which teams are handicapped according to their form, so that a stronger team must win by more goals for a punter betting on them to win. The system originated in Indonesia and has gained popularity in the early 21st century. It is a form of [[spread betting]]. Handicaps typically range from one-quarter goal to several goals, in increments of half- or even quarter-goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1211405/games-without-frontiers Games without frontiers], SCMP Post Magazine[http://sbo88live.com], David Eimer, 14 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most importantly, Asian handicap betting reduces the possible number of outcomes from three (in traditional 1X2 wagering) to two by eliminating the draw outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.topbettingreviews.com/arbitrage-betting-asian-handicap/ | title=An Introduction to Arbitrage Betting and the Asian Handicap | publisher=TBR | date=25 January 2014 | accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simplification delivers two betting options that each have a near 50% chance of success.

Asian handicaps are both good and bad for [[bookmakers]]. On one hand, they help bookmakers minimize risk by facilitating trading with parity or balancing the amount of wagering on each side of the match. This enables bookmakers to take larger positions on major matches. On the other hand, Asian handicap markets are typically low margin offerings that do not contribute as significantly to the gross win as higher [[vigorish]] betting options like 1X2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Charles | first = Gillespie | publisher = WSN | date = 2007-12-04 | url = http://www.wsn.com/2007/12/04/football/editorial/football-betting/asian-handicap-betting-basics_324721/ | accessdate = 2009-04-02 | title = Asian Handicap Betting Basics| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234028/http://www.wsn.com/2007/12/04/football/editorial/football-betting/asian-handicap-betting-basics_324721/| archivedate= 3 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Asian handicap" was coined by journalist Joe Saumarez Smith in November 1998. He was asked by an Indonesian bookmaker, Joe Phan, to provide a translation of the betting method that was termed 'hang cheng betting' by bookmakers in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = George | first = Haggett | publisher = BetAsia | date = 2002-05-14 | url = http://www.betasia.com/features/how-to-win/general/5874/origin-of-asian-handicap.html | accessdate = 2009-10-20 | title = Origin of Asian Handicap| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091031041314/http://www.betasia.com/features/how-to-win/general/5874/origin-of-asian-handicap.html| archivedate= 31 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Football (soccer)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url= http://www.unogoallive.com/ |title=UnoGoal Livescore Terbaru Real Time Match Soccer Results|accessdate= 26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the few sports in the world where a draw is a fairly common outcome. With traditional fixed odds, draws are treated as an additional outcome to the game. In other words, bettors lose when they place a wager on either team to win and the game draws. With Asian handicaps, however, the chance for a draw is eliminated by use of a handicap that forces a winner. This creates a situation where each team has a 50-50 chance of winning; similar to the odds for a basketball or football spread handicap typically offered by Las Vegas sportsbooks.

Asian handicap is a form of betting that creates a more level betting environment between two mismatched competing teams by giving a "handicap" (expressed in goals or points) to the teams before kick-off. In Asian handicap, a goal deficit is given to the team more likely to win (i.e. the Favourite) and a head start is given to the team less favoured to win (i.e. the Underdog).

This system works in a straightforward manner. The [[bookmaker]]'s aim is to create a handicap or "line" that will make the chance of either team winning (considering the handicap) as close to 50% as possible. Since the odds are as close to 50% as possible, [[bookmakers]] offer payouts close to [[even money]], or 1.90 to 2.00. Asian handicaps start at a quarter goal and can go as high as 2.5 or 3 goals in matches with a huge disparity in ability. What makes Asian handicaps most interesting is the use of quarter goals to get the "line" as close as possible. Taken in conjunction with the posted total for the game, the handicap essentially predicts the game's final score.

==Quarter-goal or two-way handicaps==
Subsequently, many matches are handicapped in ½ and ¼ intervals; both of which eliminate the possibility of a push since no one can score a half-goal.  Quarter (¼) handicaps split the bet between the two closest ½ intervals. For instance, a $1000 bet with a handicap of 1¾ is the same as betting $500 at 1½ and $500 at 2. With ¼ handicap bets, you can win and draw (win ½ of wager) or lose and draw (lose ½ wager). The ¼-goal handicap may be expressed by some bookmakers as "0 and ½", or as "pk and ½" (for "pick-em") - especially for bookmakers whose systems are designed for sports like [[American football]] and [[basketball]], where bets have a handicap that is designed to make the odds as close to even as possible.

The bettor's stake is automatically divided equally and placed as 2 separate bets. This means that with a handicap point of 0-0.5 or 0 and ½, half of your stake is on the 0 point handicap and the other half is on the 0.5 handicap.

Match: Everton vs. Newcastle United

Handicap: Newcastle +1.0, +1.5

Explained: This handicap states that half of your bet goes on Newcastle to win, draw, or lose by less than 1 goal; and half on Newcastle to win, draw, or lose by less than 1.5 goals.

If the final score is Everton 1-0 Newcastle, half your bet would be refunded due to draw (Everton 1 - +1 Newcastle, i.e: Newcastle lost by exactly one goal). The second half would win (Everton 1 - +1.5 Newcastle, i.e: Newcastle lost by less than 1.5 goals).

==Whole handicaps and draws==
In the event that a whole number is used for the handicap, the handicap adjusted final score could result in a draw. This situation is not a draw, but a push. With a push, all bettors have their original wagers returned as there is no winner. The plus signs in the Team result columns indicate "or more", eg. "2+" means "by 2 goals or more".

'''Bala''' (''Lobala'') is a [[Bantu language]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].  According to Maho (2009), it includes '''Boko''' (''Iboko'').&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

==Distribution and status==
Bala is spoken in the northwest corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo west of the [[Congo River]] by about 60,000 people.  Most of these are not monolingual, but the language is being passed on to the next generation, especially in more remote areas.  ''[[Ethnologue]]'' classifies the language as "vigorous", meaning that it is sustainable.&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;Lobala at Ethnologue (18th ed., 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four dialects of Bala: Likoka, Poko (''Iboko''), South Lobala, and Tanda.&lt;ref name=Ethnologue/&gt;

==Negation==
Like many languages in the [[Benue–Congo languages|Benue-Congo group]], Bala forms negatives by adding an affix to the [[verb]]al phrase.  However, Bala is unusual in that it adds two affixes to form negatives.  These are added as a prefix and an suffix to the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] affix. For example,
:''ba-tub-aka''
::They sang
:''te-ba-ik-aka tuba''
::They did not sing
Here the ''te'' and the ''ik'' elements are the double affixes indicating negation, attached to the ''ba'' affix indicating third party plural.  The ''tub'' element is the verb "to sing" and the ''aka'' affix indicates the [[past tense]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Heine, Derek Nurse, ''African Languages: An Introduction'', p. 206, Cambridge University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0521666295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''moto me t-a-iká mo-phé ná baphalnágà ná ntóma
::The man didn't give him money or food
In a similar way the ''t'' and ''iká'' negation elements are affixed to the verbal affix element ''a'' (indicating third person singular).&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay J. Whaley, ''Introduction to Typology: The Unity and Diversity of Language'', p. 4, SAGE Publications, 1996 {{ISBN|1506317855}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balti''' ({{bo|t=སྦལ་ཏི།}}, {{bo|w=bal ti skad}}; [[Nastaʿlīq script]]: {{nq|بلتی}}) is a [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic language]] spoken in the [[Baltistan]] region of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Nubra Valley]] of [[Leh district]], and in the [[Kargil district]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="General"&gt;{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1961: Jammu and Kashmir|accessdate=18 August 2017|year=1961|publisher=[[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]]|language=English|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite different from [[Standard Tibetan]]. Many sounds of [[Old Tibetan]] that were lost in Standard Tibetan are retained in the Balti language. It also has a simple [[pitch accent]] system only in multi-syllabic words&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sprigg|first1=R. K.|title=Lepcha and Balti Tibetan: Tonal or Non-Tonal Languages?|journal=Asia Major|date=1966|volume=12|pages=185–201|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Standard Tibetan has a complex and distinct pitch system that includes [[tone contour]].

== Ethnography ==

All people living in [[Baltistan]] may be referred to as ''Balti''. The [[Greeks]] derived ''Byaltae'' from {{bo|t=སྦལ་ཏིའི་|w=sbal-ti}}, which, in Tibetan, means "water gorge." The historian [[Ptolemy (general)|Ptolemy]], also a general in the army of [[Alexander the Great]], named the region "Byaltae" in his book.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In fact, [[Baltistan]] is the [[Persian language|Persian]] translation of ''Baltiyul'', "homeland of Balti." [[Balti people]] are settled on both banks of the [[Indus River]] from [[Kargil district]] in the east to [[Haramosh Peak]] in the west and from the [[Karakoram]] in the north to [[Deosai National Park]] in the south.

The Balti ethnicity is primarily [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] in origin, with some [[Dardic people|Dardic]] admixture. Balti is a Tibetic language.

In some rural areas, the [[Shina people]] still speak the [[Shina language]] but they are very few in number. Also, their language has many loan words from Balti, as Balti is the majority language in Baltistan . To develop Balti, local intellectuals like [[Yusuf Hussain Abadi]] have worked on the language, rediscovering the history and reviving the Tibetan script in Baltistan after six centuries (1980).

He wrote the book 'Balti Zabaan' in 1990, the first book on the language. Abadi translated the Quran into Balti in 1995. Later on, many people inspired by him worked on Balti. [[Ghulam Hassan Lobsang]] wrote a book 'Balti Grammar' in both English and Urdu versions: "Balti Grammar" and "Balti English Grammar". The latter was published by Bern University Switzerland in 1995.

The Balti have a reputation for being very forbearing, cheerful and hospitable people. During the [[Maqpon dynasty]] (from the twelfth century to 1840), the Balti invaded [[Ladakh]] and [[Tibet]] in the east and [[Gilgit]] and [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]] many times, thus making these people acknowledge the martial abilities of the Balti.

The modern population of Baltistan is a heterogeneous mixture of ethnic groups. Tibetans form the principal ethnic group in the area accounting for 75 percent of the population. Outside Baltistan, there are several Balti communities located in Pakistan's urban and rural areas.

==Classification==
Tournadre (2005)&lt;ref&gt;*N. Tournadre (2005) "L'aire linguistique tibétaine et ses divers dialectes." ''Lalies'', 2005, n°25, p.&amp;nbsp;7–56 [http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2005-aire.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; considers Balti, [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]], and [[Purgi language|Purgi]] to be distinct languages because they do not have [[mutual intelligibility]]. As a group, they are termed Ladakhi–Balti or Western Archaic Tibetan, as opposed to Western Innovative Tibetan languages, such as [[Lahuli–Spiti language|Lahuli–Spiti]].
[[File:Balti language speaking areas.png|thumb|Geographical distribution of Balti language speaking area (including Purigi dialect, sometimes considered as different from Balti language)]]

The missionary, orientalist and linguist [[Heinrich August Jäschke]] (1817–1883) classified Balti as one of the westernmost [[Tibetic languages]]. In his ''Tibetan–English Dictionary'', he defines it as "Bal (Balti), the most westerly of the districts in which the Tibetan language is spoken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Heinrich|first=Heinrich August|authorlink=Heinrich August Jäschke|title=A Tibetan-English Dictionary, with Special Reference to the Prevailing Dialects: To which is Added an English-Tibetan Vocabulary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RQTAAAAYAAJ|year=1881|publisher=Unger Brothers (T. Grimm)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Script ==
The predominant writing system currently in use for Balti is the Perso-Arabic script, although there have been attempts to revive the Tibetan script, which was used between the 8th and the 16th centuries.{{sfn|Bashir|2016|pp=808–09}}. Additionally, there are two, nowadays possibly extinct, indigenous writing systems,{{sfn|Pandey|2010}} and there have been proposals for the adoption of [[Roman script|Roman]]–{{sfn|Bashir|2016|p=808}} as well as [[Devanagari]]-based orthographies.{{sfn|Pandey|2010|p=1}}

The main script for writing Balti is the local adaptation of the [[Tibetan alphabet]] which is called yige in baltiyul [[baltistan]], but it is often written in the [[Persian alphabet]], especially within Pakistan.

In 1985, Abadi added four new letters to the Tibetan script and seven new letters to the [[Persian script]] to adapt both of them according to the need of Balti language. Two of the four added letters now stand included in the Tibetan Unicode alphabet.

The Tibetan script had been in vogue in Baltistan until the last quarter of the 14th century, when the Baltis converted to Islam. Since then, Persian script replaced the Tibetan script, but the former had no letters for seven Balti sounds and was in vogue in spite of the fact that it was defective. Adding the seven new letters has now made it a complete script for Balti.

Recently, a number of Balti scholars and social activists have attempted to promote the use of the Tibetan Balti or "Yige" alphabet with the aim of helping to preserve indigenous Balti and Ladakhi culture and ethnic identity. Following a request from this community, the September 2006 Tokyo meeting of ISO/IEC 10646 WG2 agreed to encode two characters which are invented by Abadi (U+0F6B TIBETAN LETTER KKA and TIBETAN U+0F6C LETTER RRA) in the [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] and [[Unicode]] standards in order to support rendering Urdu loanwords present in modern Balti using the Yige alphabet.

== Areas ==
Now, Balti is spoken in the whole of Baltistan in the northern Pakistan and some parts of Northern India in Jammu and Kashmir. It is said that Purki-dialect of [[Purgi language|Purgi]] and Suru-Kartse valleys come into the Balti group linguistically to some extent. However, Balti is spoken by people living in Baltistan (Pakistan), different parts of the states of northern India like Dehradun, Masoorie, Kalsigate, Chakrotta, Ambadi in Uttrakhand and parts of Jammu and Kashmir like Jammu and Ramban in Jammu region, Hariparbat, Dalgate and Tral in Kashmir region. In the twin districts of Ladakh region (Kargil &amp; Leh) it is spoken in Kargil city and its surrounding villages like Hardass, Lato, Karkitchhoo and Balti Bazar, and in Leh- Turtuk, Bogdang, Tyakshi including Leh city and nearby villages.

== Evolution ==
Since Pakistan gained control of the region in 1948, Urdu words have been introduced into local dialects and languages, including Balti. In modern times, Balti has no native names or vocabulary for dozens of newly invented and introduced things; instead, Urdu and English words are being used in Balti.

Balti has retained many honorific words that are characteristic of Tibetan dialects and many other languages.

The first Balti grammar was written in Urdu by Ghulam Hassan Lobsang. Below are a few examples:

== Literature ==
No prose literature except proverb collections have been found written in Balti. Some epics and sagas appear in oral literature such as the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]'', and the stories of ''rgya lu cho lo bzang'' and ''rgya lu sras bu''. All other literature is in verse. Balti literature has adopted numerous [[Persian language|Persian]] styles of verse and vocables which amplify the beauty and melody of its poetry.

Nearly all the languages and dialects of the mountain region in the north of Pakistan such as [[Pashto]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]] and Shina are [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] or [[Iranian languages|Iranic]] languages, but Balti is one of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. As such, it has nothing in common with neighboring languages except some loanwords absorbed as a result of linguistic contact. Balti and [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] are closely related.

The major issue facing the development of Balti literature is its centuries-long isolation from [[Tibet]], owing to political divisions and strong religious differences and even from its immediate neighbor Ladakh for the last 50 years. Separated from its linguistic kin, Balti is under pressure from more dominant languages such as [[Urdu]]. This is compounded by the lack of a suitable means of transcribing the language following the abandonment of its original Tibetan script. The Baltis do not have the awareness to revive their original script and there is no institution that could restore it and persuade the people to use it again. Even if the script is revived, it would need modification to express certain Urdu phonemes that occur in common loanwords within Balti.

Examples of poetry:
{{quote|&lt;center&gt;
تھونما زینب قتلگاہ عباس چھوزورکھا سھوکفامید&lt;br /&gt;
تھون نارے ستریمو لا تعزیم چی بیک پارگولا نین مہ مید&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}

{{quote|&lt;center&gt;

'''Bangime''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|æ|ŋ|ɡ|i|ˈ|m|eɪ}} (''bàŋɡí–mɛ̀'', or, in full, ''Bàŋgɛ́rí-mɛ̀''&lt;ref&gt;/Vr/ sequences are frequently dropped. The language has also been called ''Numadaw'', which is part of a greeting.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[language isolate]] spoken by 1,500 ethnic [[Dogon people|Dogon]] in seven villages in southern [[Mali]], who call themselves the ''bàŋɡá–ndɛ̀'' ("hidden people"). Long known to be highly divergent from (other) [[Dogon languages]], it was first proposed as a possible isolate by [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2005). Research since then has confirmed that it appears to be unrelated to neighbouring languages.

Roger Blench, who discovered the language was not a [[Dogon languages|Dogon language]], notes, 
:''This language contains some Niger–Congo roots but is lexically very remote from all other languages in West Africa. It is presumably the last remaining representative of the languages spoken prior to the expansion of the Dogon proper,''
which he dates to 3,000–4,000 years ago.

Bangime has been characterised as an [[anti-language]], i.e., a language that serves to prevent its speakers from being understood by outsiders, possibly associated with the Bangande villages having been a refuge for escapees from slave [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0262-4079(14)61070-8| volume = 222| issue = 2971| pages = 42–45| last = Bradley| first = Matthew Timothy| title = The 'secret ones': tales from Mali's anti-language| journal = New Scientist| date = 2014-05-31| url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229710.700-people-of-secrets-the-slave-sanctuary-antilanguage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blench (2015) suggests that Bangime and Dogon languages may have a substratum from a "missing" branch of [[Nilo-Saharan]] that had split off relatively early from [[Proto-Nilo-Saharan]], and tentatively calls that branch "Plateau".&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/15754234/Was_there_a_now-vanished_branch_of_Nilo-Saharan_on_the_Dogon_Plateau_Evidence_from_substrate_vocabulary_in_Bangime_and_Dogon Was there a now-vanished branch of Nilo-Saharan on the Dogon Plateau? Evidence from substrate vocabulary in Bangime and Dogon].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Bangime is spoken in 7 villages east of Karge, near [[Bandiagara]], [[Mopti Region]], central [[Mali]] (Blench 2007). The villages are:
*Bara ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[bara]}})
*Bounou ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[bunu]}})
*Niana ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ɲana]}})
*Die'ni ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[jene]}})
*Digari ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[diɡarɔ]}})
*Doro ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[dɔrɔ]}})
*Due ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ʔjeni]}})

==Morphology==
Bangime is an [[isolating language]]. The only productive affixes are the plural and a [[diminutive]], which are seen in the words for the people and language above.

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
Vowels have an [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|±ATR]] distinction, which affects neighbouring consonants, but unusually for such systems, there is no ATR [[vowel harmony]] in Bangime. Vowels may be long or [[Nasalised vowel|nasalised]].

=== Consonants ===

NC sequences tend to drop the plosive, and often [[lenition|lenite]] to a nasalized sonorant: {{IPA|[búndà] ~ [búr̃a] ~ [bún]}} 'finish', {{IPA|[támbà] ~ [táw̃à] ~ [támà]}} 'chew'.

{{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} appear as {{IPA|[ʋ]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, depending on the ATR status of the adjacent vowels.

{{IPA|/s/}} appears as {{IPA|[ʃ]}} before non-low vowels, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} as {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} before either of the high front vowels. {{IPA|/j/}} is realized as {{IPA|[dʒ]}} after a nasal.

=== Tone ===
There are three tones on [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]s (short syllables): high, low and rising. In addition, falling tone may occur on long (bimoraic) syllables. Syllables may also have no inherent tone.

In the area of [[cognitive neuroscience]] Brogaard is best known for her work on [[synesthesia]] and [[savant syndrome]].&lt;ref name="04/27/2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Case Study of Accidental Genius|newspaper=Danish National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Becomes Genius After Head Injury|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/man-genius-head-injury-16233262?tab=9482930&amp;section=1206872&amp;playlist=1887643|newspaper=ABC Nightline|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karlinsky|first=Neal|title=Real ‘Beautiful Mind’: College Dropout Became Mathematical Genius After Mugging|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/04/27/real-beautiful-mind-accidental-genius-draws-complex-math-formulas-photos/|newspaper=ABC News|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=College Dropout Jason Padgett Becomes Accidental Mathematical Genius After Brutal Mugging|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/30/college-dropout-jason-pad_n_1464835.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2012-04-30|first=Dominique|last=Mosbergen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edgington|first=Katy|title=Synaesthesia and savant syndrome: are we all superhuman?|url=http://www.scienceomega.com/article/678/synaesthesia-and-savant-syndrome-are-we-all-superhuman|newspaper=Science Omega|date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marsh|first=Don|title=Seeing Sounds, Hearing Colors: UMSL Professor Researches Rare Condition|url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/seeing-sounds-hearing-colors-umsl-professor-researches-rare-condition|newspaper=NPR|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piore|first=Adam|title=When Brain Damage Unlocks The Genius Within|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-02/when-brain-damage-unlocks-genius-within|newspaper=Popular Science|date=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/18473864/846497944/name/Fractals+and+the+Mind.pdf Fractals and the Mind, Explorations September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Her team, which consists of colleagues from the Brogaard Lab for Multisensory Research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brogaardlab.com|title=Brogaard Lab for Multisensory Research - Synesthesia - Savant Syndrome - Autism|work=Brogaard Lab for Multisensory Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Visual Awareness and Cognition Group, Brain Research Unit, Low Temperature Laboratory, Aalto University School of Science, Finland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/BRU/Vision_Systems_Neuroscience|title=Vision Systems Neuroscience|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; just completed a series of studies on Jason Padgett,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.struckbygenius.com/ | title= Struck By Genius}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has acquired savant syndrome and acquired synesthesia. Jason Padgett was mugged in 2002.&lt;ref name="A Brain Injury Turned A Regular Guy Into A Mathematical Genius"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/brain-injury-created-mathematical-genius-2014-5?nr_email_referer=1 | title=A Brain Injury Turned A Regular Guy Into A Mathematical Genius | publisher=Business Insider | date=6 May 2014 | accessdate=7 May 2014 | author=Lewis, Tanya}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hit on his head and developed a form of synesthesia and savant syndrome.&lt;ref name="A Brain Injury Turned A Regular Guy Into A Mathematical Genius"/&gt; Certain objects and mathematical formulas trigger synesthetic mathematical fractals in him.&lt;ref name="A Brain Injury Turned A Regular Guy Into A Mathematical Genius"/&gt; He is the first to hand-draw mathematical fractals, an ability he acquired after the incident.&lt;ref name="A Brain Injury Turned A Regular Guy Into A Mathematical Genius"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/jason-padgett.html|title=Jason Padgett|work=Fine Art America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantastic-fractals.com/Make-a-Fractal.html|title=How to Make a Fractal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of functional [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies in [[Finland]], Brogaard's team found uni-lateral left-side activity in the parietal and frontal areas when Padgett is exposed to well-formed mathematical formulas that give rise to synesthetic fractals in him and bi-lateral activation when he is exposed to nonsense formulas or formulas that don't give rise to synesthetic fractals.

They re-tested the results from the [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] using [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)]]. In the TMS study, Padgett was shown formulas and asked to rate his synesthetic sensation on a scale 1-10, relative to his "baseline" percept (i.e. without TMS). They applied TMS over the brain areas that were activated in the fMRI scan with the formulas that give rise to synesthetic experiences and found the TMS modulated two central areas.

The results establish for the first time that synesthetic imagery may be generated in areas of the brain not normally used for the creation of visual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/12/1376.abstract|title=Mental Visual Synthesis is Originated in the Fronto-temporal Network of the Left Hemisphere|author=Yukihito Yomogida|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Padgett has since then published an autobiography with Maureen Seaberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.struckbygenius.com|title=Struck by Genius|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is being turned into a major Hollywood movie, starring Channing Tatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/channing-tatum-tackling-struck-by-732971 | title= Channing Tatum Tackling 'Struck by Genius' Adaptation (Exclusive) |publisher= The Hollywood Reporter | date= 2014-09-17 | accessdate= Feb 7, 2015 | author= Boris Kit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brogaard's lab has also studied the cognitive mechanisms underlying grapheme-color synesthesia, one of the most common forms of synesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The LTP Model for Grapheme-Color Binding in Synesthesia. In: Sensory Integration and the Unity of Consciousness|year=2013|publisher=MIT Press|editor1=Bennet D |editor2=Hill C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a novel visual search paradigm to examine whether synesthetic colors guide the subject’s attention to the location of the target they found that synesthetic experience requires selective attention to occur. In light of this they propose a new long term potentiation model for grapheme-color projector synesthesia.

Brogaard has also contributed to the topic of whether there are unconscious perceptual processes, arguing that cases of blindsight and visual for action involve unconscious perceptual processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overgaard|first=Morten|author2=Grünbaum, Thor|title=Consciousness and modality: On the possible preserved visual consciousness in blindsight subjects|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1 December 2011|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1855–1859|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2011.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brogaard|first=Berit|title=Non-visual consciousness and visual images in blindsight|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=9 Jan 2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=595–596|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy of mind ===

In the area of philosophy of mind, Brogaard is the first to provide a thorough analysis of perceptual words such as 'look', 'sound', 'feel', 'taste', 'smell', 'seem', 'appear', 'see' and 'hear'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B0GEjtSycjTKZGM2MjkxZmQtMmMxOS00Y2ZiLWIxM2YtOWZjOGE5YTM5YzEy&amp;hl=en_US|title=PerceptualReports.pdf|work=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that perceptual reports containing these words reflect the content of perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/de/itunes-u/center-for-mathematical-philosophy/id439913748?ls=1|title=„MCMP – Mathematical Philosophy (Archive 2011/12)“ - Kostenloser Podcast von Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München in iTunes|work=iTunes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deroy|first=Ophelia|title=Synesthesia: An experience of the third kind?. In: Consciousness Inside and Out: Phenomenology, Neuroscience, and the Nature of Experience.|year=2013|publisher=Springer|editor=Brown R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brogaard is also the first researcher to show that consciousness comes in degrees and that there can be borderline cases of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B0GEjtSycjTKZGY2NDUwNmItYzkzNi00ODA1LTkxOGEtNzU5OWEyZjQyYjY4&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJuan98N|title=Is Conscious a Gradable Adjective.pdf|work=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a case where we slowly destroy the primary visual cortex of a subject, one neuron at a time in an arbitrary fashion. Plausibly such an individual would proceed slowly from perceiving her surroundings normally to perceiving them unconsciously. In this process, the brightness of the perceived content would gradually decrease until a point at which it would be unclear whether the perception counted as weakly conscious.

Or consider [[George Sperling]]'s classic experiment in which a 3 x 3 array of letters was briefly flashed to the test subjects. Most subjects said that they were aware of all the letters, even though they could report only about half of them. To test whether the subjects were right, Sperling used a tone after the presentation of the stimulus to signal which row the subjects should report (high tone = top row, medium tone = middle row and low tone = the bottom row). The subjects were able to name the letters in the indicated row but they were unable to report any other numbers. The fact that the subjects were able to report any signaled row indicates that they were phenomenally conscious of all the rows but did not have access consciousness to all of them. But suppose we were to flash a 4 x 4 array of letters, then a 5 x 5 array of letters, then 6 x 6 array of letters, and so on, to subjects in an experiment. In that case, it would naturally become harder and harder for them to report the rows as the array became increasingly more complicated. There would, however, be no precise cut-off at which the subjects would go from being weakly conscious to not being weakly conscious of all the rows.

=== Philosophy of language ===

Brogaard is also a well known contributor to the philosophy of language. Brogaard's book, Transient Truths provides the first book-length exposition and defense of temporalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/36173-transient-truths-an-essay-in-the-metaphysics-of-propositions/|title=Transient Truths: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Propositions|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pacific Division of the APA|title=Author-Meets-Critics: Brit Brogaard, Transient Truths: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Propositions|url=http://apa-pacific.org/current/main-program.php|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that contents can change their truth-values along with changes in the world. Brogaard argues that temporal contents are contents and propositions in the full sense. This project involves a thorough analysis of how we talk about and retain mental states over time, an examination of how the phenomenology of mental states bear on the content of mental states, an analysis of how we pass on information in temporally extended conversations, and a revival of a Priorian tense logic. The view suggests a broader view according to which some types of representation have a determinate truth-value only relative to features about the subject who does the representing. If this view is right, successful semantic representation requires an eye on our own position in the world. Brogaard has also offered well known philosophical accounts of moral permissibility,&lt;ref name="bioethics.georgetown.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brogaard|first=Berit|title=MORAL CONTEXTUALISM AND MORAL RELATIVISM|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|date=1 July 2008|volume=58|issue=232|pages=385–409|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9213.2007.543.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Binderup|first=Lars|title=BROGAARD'S MORAL CONTEXTUALISM|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|date=1 July 2008|volume=58|issue=232|pages=410–415|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9213.2007.544.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damschen|first=G|author2=Gómez-Lobo, A |author3=Schönecker, D |title=Sixteen days?

Brogaard is furthermore the first to develop a dynamic two-dimensional semantics that can account for cognitive significance in a dynamic setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B0GEjtSycjTKMTEwMTkyZmUtZjZiZi00MDU5LThmYTQtZDJlNThlOWFkNzI0&amp;hl=en|title=Context and Content.pdf|work=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Transient Truths: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Propositions'' ===
Transient Truths provides the first book-length exposition and defense temporalism, the philosophical theory that the contents of propositions can change their truth-values along with changes in the world. Brogaard argues that temporal contents are contents and propositions in the full sense. The project involves an analysis of how we talk about and retain mental states over time, an examination of how the phenomenology of mental states bear on the content of mental states, an analysis of how we pass on information in temporally extended conversations, and a revival of a Priorian tense logic.

=== ''On Romantic Love: Simple Truths About a Complex Emotion'' ===
Brogaard argues that love is an emotion; that it can be, at turns, both rational and irrational; and that it can be manifested in degrees. We can love one person more than another and we can love a person a little or a lot or not at all and love is not always something we consciously feel. However, love—like other emotions, both conscious and unconscious—is subject to rational control, and falling in or out of it can be a deliberate choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Romantic-Love-Complex-Emotion-Philosophy/dp/0199370737/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440718229&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=on+romantic+love|title=On Romantic Love: Simple Truths about a Complex Emotion (Philosophy in Action): Berit Brogaard: 9780199370733: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Superhuman Mind: Free the Genius in Your Brain'' ===
Brogaard and co-author Kristian Marlow argue that our brains constantly process a huge amount of information below our awareness, and what individuals with [[savant syndrome]] have in common is that through practice, injury, an innate brain disorder, or even more unusual circumstances, they have managed to gain a degree of conscious access to the brain's innate potent processing power. Delving into the neurological underpinnings of savant syndrome, the authors reveal how we can acquire some of these skills ourselves—from perfect pitch and lightning fast math skills to supercharged creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Superhuman-Mind-Free-Genius-Brain/dp/1594633681/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440718358&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+superhuman+mind|title=The Superhuman Mind: Free the Genius in Your Brain: Berit Brogaard PhD PhD, Kristian Marlow MA MA: 9781594633683: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editor of journals and magazines==
Deka was first offered the editorship of a literary journal ''Ami'' in the year 1948 when he was an eighth standard school student at Barpeta Government High School. His first foray into editing was a tremendous success, leading to more such editing offers during later years in his life. Because of his love and dedication to the cause of Assamese literature, he accepted several such editing offers while he was at the peak of his professional career as a leading college professor and India government's top bureaucrat. He jointly edited an iconic literary journal ''Udaygiri'' in 1964 while he was a college teacher. Almost all the top Assamese poets, essayists and story-writers of the time were regular contributors in this famous journal. He also discovered several new literary talents and established them in the literary world by highlighting their works in his edited journal. His co-editor of this iconic journal was famous Assamese literary critic Prof. Rammal Thakuria. He was also the editor of several other literary and philosophical journals and magazines including ''Rastrajyoti'' and ''Gobinda''. ''Rashtrajyoti'' was the first bilingual literary journal combining two of major Indian languages Hindi and Assam, and it received nationwide success for its innovative journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA1V7sICaIwC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=bhabananda+deka&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iZp394WNEb&amp;sig=bB-_FszVyyWFPRM-ars1PyZ92wI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RtnvSfe7DKbm6gOI5pnhAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 |title=Who's who of Indian Writers, 1999: A-M – Google Books |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |year=1999 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical appreciation==
Principal Bhabananda Deka's scholarly works have been critically acclaimed from early 1960s, largely in Assamese language media. Even posthumously, his literary contributions are continuously being critically evaluated. In the most recent critical evaluation, Northeast India's oldest and most prestigious top English daily [[The Assam Tribune]] wrote about him and his works thus-- "Prof Bhabananda Deka, noted author, scholar and a pioneer economist of Assam has been credited with a plethora of scholarly books on Assam's heritage, literature, sociology, economy etc. He had always been active in projecting the motherland in all its glory through its rich legacy of literature and culture. One such marvellous work of his, the biography of Srimanta Sankardev, is actually a treasure for Indian art and literature. Prof Deka's book has beautifully encapsulated Sankardev's enriching works on every aspect of literature and art." The critical review further continued-- "The author not only emphasises on the works of Sankardev, but also on the works of the various other Sankarite scholars, past and present. Prof Deka beautifully exemplifies Sankardev's principles and teachings on how to live peacefully, despite the growing religious and racial intolerances prevalent then. I am sure that the re-publication of this book will bring Prof Bhabananda Deka's monumental work into focus, and pave the way for more extensive study and research on Sankardev, and his impact on the society at large."&lt;ref name="The Saint's story"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another leading daily ''The Sentinel'' further illustrates diverse quality of his masterly works with this description-- "Principal Bhabananda Deka was the first Assamese economist–litterateur to initiate Assam–specific study and research of local economy and other social aspects. Apart from authoring total 115 books, he wrote in famous literary journals like Awahon, Ramdhenu, Amar Protinidhi, Manideep, Natun Asomiya, Asam Bami, Dainik Asam etc., right from mid–1950s. Just before his death on December 4, 2006 he finished English prose–translation of timeless Assamese classic ‘Kirtan Ghosa’ of Srimanta Sankardev." The same writing further focuses on other areas of his social activities pivotal to further propagation of Assamese literature and culture outside Assam's geographical and political boundaries-- "During his Delhi stint as senior bureaucrat, he played a pivotal role in setting up Assamese departments in the UPSC and Delhi University during 1968–69. He was instrumental in bringing Hollywood personalities to Guwahati in 1995 and subsequent production of first one-hour documentary film on life and works of Srimanta Sankardev in 1996. Because of his untiring efforts, this film was screened in the USA, Canada and other countries, and preserved in the National Museum of Switzerland. In recognition of his pioneering role as economist his death anniversary is observed every year as ‘Artha Divas’ or Day of Economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sentinel|first1=The|title=Documentary film, books on Bhabananda–Nalini Prava|url=http://www.sentinelassam.com/ghy_city/story.php?sec=1&amp;subsec=0&amp;id=211080&amp;dtP=2014-12-04&amp;ppr=1#.VhoCUeyqqko|accessdate=11 October 2015|publisher=Omega Publishers Pvt Ltd|date=4 Dec 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100737/http://www.sentinelassam.com/ghy_city/story.php?sec=1&amp;subsec=0&amp;id=211080&amp;dtP=2014-12-04&amp;ppr=1#.VhoCUeyqqko|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conway Stewart &amp; Company Ltd''' was a British manufacturer of writing instruments, founded in 1905 by Frank Jarvis and Thomas Garner in London.

==History==
Jarvis and Garner had previously worked for the [[De La Rue]] Company, the leading British [[fountain pen]] manufacturer of the time.  Drawing on the experience they had gained at De La Rue, the two started their own business, initially reselling fountain pens manufactured by other companies.  The name "Conway Stewart" was apparently derived from a popular music hall act of the time.

The fountain pen market in Britain at that time was dominated by De La Rue and it was clear to Jarvis and Garner that only a very limited market share could be gained by reselling un-branded fountain pens.  At the same time, De La Rue was embarking on a substantial marketing campaign by re-branding its products "[[Onoto pens|Onoto]]".  Jarvis and Garner identified a market niche for attractive and reliable writing instruments at an affordable price.

The 1920s saw rapid development of the Conway Stewart product line.  Pens of several different types of filling mechanisms, materials and sizes were offered for sale.  The business model proved successful for Conway Stewart and its market share increased at the expense of other established manufacturers.  As a result, Conway Stewart had outgrown its initial premises and in 1927 the company relocated to a larger facility which would serve as its home for the next two decades.

During the depression years, the company was able to remain profitable, helped by the public's perception of good value products.  In 1935, Conway Stewart went public, raising additional capital at the same time by offering shares.  The years of [[World War II]] proved difficult for Conway Stewart and many other manufacturers; there were shortages of materials but the company managed to survive by continuing to offer good reliable pens at reasonable prices.

Emerging from post-war austerity in Britain, the 1950s proved to be golden years for Conway Stewart, with the creative use of coloured plastic reaching its peak.  The company once again relocated to new premises, but the golden age proved to be short-lived.  At the same time, the [[ballpoint pen]] was being developed and while initially unreliable and more expensive than comparably finished fountain pens, soon decreased rapidly in price.  Conway Stewart, along with most other fountain pen manufacturers of the time, failed to anticipate the effect that this innovative product would have on fountain pen sales.

In the 1960s, fountain pen sales declined very quickly and Conway Stewart began to feel the effect of falling revenues.  The company tried to compete by offering lower priced fountain pens and also introduced ball point pens to its range.  The company relocated to [[Crumlin, Caerphilly|Crumlin]] in Wales in 1968, taking advantage of regional development grants, but its financial health continued to deteriorate.  In 1975, the company was [[liquidation|wound-up]] and production ceased.

The company was revived in the 1990s with headquarters in [[Plymouth]], UK. Sales started in 1998, although some models had been produced for special occasions before that, including for the Heads of State attending the [[24th G8 summit|1998 G8 Summit]] in Birmingham.

On 28 August 2014, the company was placed in receivership.  The remaining stock, as well as the machinery and tooling, were sold off and its offices closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/plymouth-luxury-pen-maker-queen-goes/story-22909298-detail/story.html|title=Luxury Plymouth pen maker to the Queen goes into administration – again|date=11 September 2014|work=''plymouthherald.co.uk''|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bespoke British Pens went on to acquire the stock of components from the Conway Stewart factory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bespokebritishpens.co.uk/about/history/ History of Conway Stewart] from Bespoke British Pens. Retrieved 12 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 2014, Mr Caltagirone Emmanuel registered the trademark Conway Stewart for the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/864/50/conway-86450393.html|title=CONWAY STEWART Trademark of CALTAGIRONE EMMANUEL – Registration Number 4978892 – Serial Number 86450393 :: Justia Trademarks|work=''justia.com''|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models: 1905–1975==
[[Image:conway stewart pens.jpg|thumb|Conway Stewart fountain pens|300px|right|Conway Stewart fountain pens from the 1950s]]Early models marketed by Conway Stewart were sourced from other manufacturers, were made of hard rubber and were indistinguishable from many other pens available at that time.  By the mid-1920s, the company was establishing its own design style, helped by the use of colourful celluloid and casein plastics.

Conway Stewart's model designation is a combination of names and numbers.  Important named models with approximate age ranges include:

1920s – 1960s: Dinkie (540–550)

1930s – 1940s: Duro (various numbers), Dandie (720, 728), Scribe (336), International (356), Universal (470, 479)

During the 1940s, model names were dropped for all product lines apart from the Dinkie.  The model numbering is not chronological and the same pen may appear with a different numbers depending on whether it was sold in Britain or exported.  Major model numbers include:

1920s – 1940s: 200, 217, 286, 380, 388

1950s – early 1960s: 12, 14, 15, 16, 22, 27, 28, 36, 58, 60, 73–77, 84, 85, 100,

early 1960s – 1975: 65–69, 94–98, 107

The plastics of the 1940s to 1960s were produced in a variety of styles and colours and while never specifically named by Conway Stewart, they have become known informally by collectors by names such as cracked ice, herringbone, tiger’s eye and crosshatch and the more common marbled finish.  Of particular note is the model 22 which was produced in the 1950s in a floral pattern.  This was produced in very small numbers compared to other models of the time.  There is some uncertainty as to the number produced; estimates range from 200 to 2000.

After the early 1960s injection moulded plastic of a uniform colour was used for the manufacture of pens.  Nibs, which had been [[carat (purity)|14ct]] gold until this time, were generally replaced by [[stainless steel]].

==Models: 1990s to present==
Models produced in this era are made for the “high-end” of the market and feature precious metals, enamels and casein or celluloid plastics and 18ct gold nibs. Notable models include the Churchill. 58 series, the Duro series, the Dinkie series and the 100 series, all styled after the original models. The Churchill being based on the larger red ripple hard rubber versions from the vintage conway stewarts. The brand was purchased by Don Yendle over a period of 3 years from 1994 to 1997.

The Conway Stewart trademark in the UK was purchased by Helix from the liquidators in 1975. The trademark was then purchased by another company with a view to relaunching the brand on a range of fibre tipped pen for the mass market, only limited numbers were produced and in 1994 Don Yendle purchased the UK tradename from the company.  The USA trademark was purchased from Stuart Edwards of Palo Alto in 1994. In 1995 Don Yendle met with the directors of Shaeffer Australia who had registered the name with a view to relaunching a cheap range of Chinese pens for the Australian market.  A meeting was held in Hong Kong in early 1995 whereby Don Yendle purchased the rights to the CS tradename for Australia.

Having formed Conway Stewart as a Limited Company in the UK the trademark was registered in Europe and Asia to ensure worldwide security for the brand. Having researched Conway Stewarts previous manufacturing history and techniques Don Yendle wanted to keep true to its core values from 1905.  What followed were 3 years of research into Casein and plastics including vulcanite for barrels and feeders for nibs. The company even used a Birmingham-based company who still used a 1-metre pantograph to make the miniature moulds for the pen clips in order to keep the detail in the clips.  All of the new clips were exactly the same size as the originals so pen collectors would have spares for the vintage pens they wished to repair.
After much experimentation with slabs of casein from uk and some very old stock from Japan Conway Stewart re-launched in 1997.  At that first exhibition the Foreign Office chose Conwasy Stewart as a supplier of gifts for Number 10 Downing Street and gifts from the  government to visiting Dignitaries.  The first collections (58 series and Dinkies) were all made from casein with solid gold rings swaged on to each cap. Each slab of casein had to be cured for at least 3 months in drying room with just the right humidity. Returning the barrels to the drying room after each process in order to train the material to be 'round'. Each collection was limited to 500 pcs based on material and colour. 
Each pen code and number laser engraved on to each barrel.
The company then introduced designs (Churchill series, 58, Dinkie)in acrylic, solid silver, and solid gold. The first solid gold pens were made for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and HRH Prince Philip on the celebration of their golden wedding anniversary 20 November 1997.  Two pieces were made in 18ct solid gold. The queen wrote a letter of thanks for the gift stating they were 'useful to boot'.
The pens were originally made in Horrabridge and the company moved to its Plymouth premises in 2001 having outgrown the original premises.
The company continued to produce pens for the Prime Ministers Office, supplying birthday presents of a Conway Stewart Churchill to 
Bill Clinton, George Bush, Jacque Chirac, Vladimir Putin to name but a few. The pens were also selected by the Foreign Office as gifts to all world leaders at the G8 and G20 summits, along with pens for Prince Charles, Princess Diana and Barbara Cartland.
Conway Stewart introduced a few prototype celluloid pens, mainly as overlays on solid silver Duro pens.
The company supplied another set of gold pens for the celebration of Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee featuring a hard rubber Churchill with an 18ct Overlay. Only a few pieces were sold. Don Yendle sold the company to an investor in October 2003 having established worldwide distribution.

A '''Daddy''' in [[LGBT culture|gay culture]] is a [[LGBT slang|slang]] term meaning an (typically) older man sexually involved in a relationship or wanting sex with a younger male. The age gap may differ, but the relationship involves the traditional parental hierarchy of father-son dynamics, the daddy providing emotional support and guidance along with sexual encouragement and nurturing to the inexperienced and vulnerable partner.

Often these relationships are categorized as either "DADDY and [[Boi (slang)|boi]]" or "DAD and son," although this is not absolute, and some relationships prefer no labels.  Dad, or Daddy, are completely different from the similarly labeled [[wikt:sugar daddy|sugar daddy]], although this can sometimes lead to some confusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3613">'''Delia Graff Fara''' (1969-2017) was an American philosopher who was professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]]. She specialized in [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[philosophical logic]].

==Education and career==
A 1991 graduate of [[Harvard University]], Graff Fara earned her Ph.D. at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1997 under the supervision of [[George Boolos]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~dfara/delia-fara-cv.pdf |format=PDF |title=Delia Graff Fara : CV |website=Princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She joined the Princeton faculty the same year as an [[assistant professor]], moving to [[Cornell University]] in 2001 and then returning to Princeton as a tenured associate professor in 2005.

==Philosophical work==
Graff Fara is best known for her work on the problem of [[vagueness]], where she defends an interest-relative theory of "contextualism." In her most influential article, ''Shifting sands: An interest-relative theory of vagueness'', she argues that the meanings of vague expressions render the truth conditions of utterances of sentences containing them sensitive to our interests. On her view, "interest relativity extends to all vague words. For instance, ‘child’ means a degree of immaturity that is significant to the speaker. Since the interests of the speaker shifts over time, there is an opportunity for a shift in the extension of ‘child’."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vagueness/#Con |title=Vagueness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3380">A '''diagnosis of exclusion''' (''per exclusionem'') is a [[diagnosis]] of a medical condition reached by a [[process of elimination]], which may be necessary if presence cannot be established with complete confidence from history, examination or testing. Such elimination of other reasonable possibilities is a major component in performing a [[differential diagnosis]].

The largest category of diagnosis by exclusion is seen among psychiatric disorders where the presence of physical or organic disease must be excluded as a prerequisite for making a functional diagnosis. Diagnosis by exclusion tends to occur where scientific knowledge is scarce, specifically where the means to verify a diagnosis by an objective method is absent. As a specific diagnosis cannot be confirmed, a fall back position is to exclude that group of known causes that may cause a similar clinical presentation.

==Examples==
An example of such a diagnosis is "[[fever of unknown origin]]": to explain the cause of elevated temperature the most common causes of unexplained fever (infection, [[neoplasm]], or collagen vascular disease) must be ruled out.

'''Digital literacy''' is a component of media literacy. It refers to an individual's ability to find, evaluate, produce and communicate clear information through writing and other forms of communication on various digital platforms. Digital literacy showcases an individual's grammar, computer, writing, and typing skills on platforms, such as social media and blog sites. Digital Literacy also includes other devices, such as, smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://connect.ala.org/node/181197|title=Digital Literacy Definition {{!}} ALA Connect|website=connect.ala.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While digital literacy initially focused on digital skills and stand-alone computers, its focus has shifted to network devices including the Internet and use of social media. Digital literacy does not replace traditional forms of literacy, instead building upon the skills that form the foundation of traditional forms of literacy.&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/free_download/9780262513623_Confronting_the_Challenges.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203213008/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/free_download/9780262513623_Confronting_the_Challenges.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-03|title=Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2009|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Society for Technology in Education maintains parameters for digital literacy around six benchmarks. These consist of “''innovation, communication and cooperation, research and information, critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making, digital citizenship, and technology concepts and operations''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iste.org/standards|title=ISTE Standards|website=www.iste.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and pedagogical concepts==
From a competency perspective, digital literacy is framed with literacy, fluency, and mastery of skills needed to use the internet. From an academic perspective, digital literacy is a part of the computing subject area alongside [[computer science]] and [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Furber, S. (2012). [https://royalsociety.org/~/media/education/computing-in-schools/2012-01-12-computing-in-schools.pdf ''Shut down or restart?: The way forward for computing in UK schools''.]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Digital literacy is a [[New literacies|new literacy]] and can be decomposed into several sub-literacies. One such decomposition considers digital literacy as embracing [[computer literacy]], [[network literacy]], [[information literacy]] and [[social media]] literacy. Previous conceptualizations of digital literacy focused on the practical skills associated with using computers (now considered [[computer literacy]]). These include hardware skills, such as connecting devices, and software skills, such as using application packages. Contemporary conceptualizations of digital literacy add to these traditional skills, and embrace knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviors, particularly with respect to networked devices (which include smartphones, tablets and personal computers).
Digital literacy differs from computer literacy in a number of significant ways. While it embraces the practical skills that computer literacy incorporates, there is a much greater focus on sociological, political, cultural, economic and behavioral aspects of digital technologies.

As a pedagogical approach in curriculum design, the implementation of digital literacy affords far-reaching advantages. The internet is both a source of information and communication that has increased exponentially internationally. Subsequently, integrating technology into the classroom in a meaningful way, exposes students to a range of literacy practices called multi-literacies which broadens their outlook and widens vistas of information and knowledge which is highly constructive. This methodology embraces the constructivist theory of learning (Bruner, 1978) wherein learners draw from their existing knowledge in order to construct new learning.

Given the many varied implications that digital literacy has on students and educators, pedagogy has responded by emphasizing four specific models of engaging with digital mediums. Those four models are text participating, code breaking, text analyzing, and text using. These methods present students (and other learners) with the ability to fully engage with the media, but also enhance the way the individual is able to relate the digital text to their lived experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinrichsen|first=Juliet|last2=Coombs|first2=Antony|date=2014-01-31|title=The five resources of critical digital literacy: a framework for curriculum integration|url=https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/1433|journal=Research in Learning Technology|language=en|volume=21|issue=0|doi=10.3402/rlt.v21.21334|issn=2156-7077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital and media literacy==
Media literacy education began in the United Kingdom and the United States as a result of war propaganda in the 1930s and the rise of advertising in the 1960s, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens|last=Boyd|first=Danah|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-300-16631-6|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=177–194|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulative messaging and the increase in various forms of media further concerned educators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Educators began to promote media literacy education in order to teach individuals how to judge and access the media messages they were receiving.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ability to critique digital and media content allows individuals to identify biases and evaluate messages independently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Danah boyd|Danah Boyd]] stresses the importance of critical media literacy, especially for teens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She advocates that critical media literacy skills are the first step in identifying biases in media content, such as online or print advertising.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Technical skills and knowledge of navigating computer systems further helps individuals in evaluating information on their own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Barriers in acquiring technical skills and computer knowledge set forth a limit for individuals in fully participating in the digital world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In order for individuals to evaluate digital and media messages independently, they must demonstrate digital and media literacy competence. Renee Hobbs, professor of Communication and Media at the University of Rhode Island, developed a list of skills that demonstrate digital and media literacy competence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Renee|last2=Martens|first2=Hans|year=2015|title=How media literacy supports civic engagement in a digital age|url=|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=23|issue=2|pages=120–137|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.961636|via=Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital and media literacy involves knowing how to retrieve, distribute, and understand information found in digital environments such as the internet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Digital and media literacy includes the ability to examine and comprehend the meaning of messages, judging credibility, and assessing the quality of the digital work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The individual is capable of analyzing digital and media messages by recognizing the author's perspective and overall purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A digital and media literate individual has the aptitude to create diverse forms of digital content and possesses technology skills to create digital content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The individual becomes a socially responsible member of their community by spreading awareness and helping others find digital solutions at home, work, or on a national platform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 21st-century skills ===
{{main article|21st century skills}}
Digital literacy requires certain skill sets that are interdisciplinary in nature. Warschauer and Matuchniak (2010) list three skill sets, or [[21st century skills]],&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, Mark; Matuchniak, Tina (2010). "New Technology and Digital Worlds: Analyzing Evidence of Equity in Access, Use, and Outcomes". ''Review of Research in Education''. '''34''': 179–225. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.3102/0091732X09349791|10.3102/0091732X09349791]].&lt;/ref&gt;  that individuals need to master in order to be digitally literate: information, media, and technology; learning and innovation skills; and life and career skills. In order to achieve information, media, and technology skills, one needs to achieve competency in information literacy, media literacy and [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] (information communicative technologies). Encompassed within Learning and Innovation Skills, one must also be able to exercise their creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration skills (the "[[Four Cs of 21st century learning]]"). In order to be competent in Life and Career Skills, it is also necessary to be able to exercise flexibility and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural skills, productivity and accountability, leadership and responsibility.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Aviram, A., &amp; Eshet-Alkalai, Y. (2006). Towards a theory of digital literacy: Three scenarios for the next steps. European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning. Retrieved from http://www.eurodl.org/index.php?p=archives&amp;year=2006&amp;halfyear=1&amp;abstract=223
&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviram &amp; Eshet-Alkalai contend that there are five types of literacies that are encompassed in the umbrella term that is digital literacy.
# Photo-visual literacy is the ability to read and deduce information from visuals.
# Reproduction literacy is the ability to use digital technology to create a new piece of work or combine existing pieces of work together to make it your own.
# Branching literacy is the ability to successfully navigate in the non-linear medium of digital space.
# Information literacy is the ability to search, locate, assess and critically evaluate information found on the web and on-shelf in libraries. 
# Socio-emotional literacy refers to the social and emotional aspects of being present online, whether it may be through socializing, and collaborating, or simply consuming content.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications of digital literacy ==

=== In education ===
Schools are continuously updating their curricula to keep up with accelerating technological developments. This often includes [[computers in the classroom]], the use of educational software to teach curricula, and course materials being made available to students online. Students are often taught literacy skills such as how to verify [[source criticism|credible sources]] online, [[citation|cite]] web sites, and prevent plagiarism in a technological world. Google and Wikipedia are frequently used by students "for everyday life research,"&lt;ref&gt;Head, A., &amp; Eisenberg, M. (2009, December). ''[http://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/how_students_seek_information_in_the_digital_age.pdf How college students seek information in the digital age]''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/how_students_seek_information_in_the_digital_age.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; and are just two common tools that facilitate modern education.  Digital technology has impacted the way material is taught in the classroom. With the use of technology rising over the past decade, educators are enhancing traditional forms of learning with digital literacy through different platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HyIsDAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=education+and+social+media+toward+a+digital+future+pdf+jstor&amp;ots=-qZgodm78j&amp;sig=RO_xIij2Nfsh_4HmY87FP1ADcPM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Education and Social Media: Toward a Digital Future|last1=Greenhow|first1=Christine|last2=Sonnevend|first2=Julia|date=6 May 2016|publisher=MIT Press|language=en|last3=Agur|first3=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several websites are assisting in these efforts such as [[Google Docs]], [[Prezi]], and, [[Easybib]]. Each service has assisted students by teaching collaboration, allowing students to use pre-made, creative presentation templates, and helping generate citations in any given format. Additionally, educators have also turned to social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Edmodo]], [[Schoology]] and even [[Instagram]] to communicate and share ideas with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.com/2013/03/facebook-edmodo-schoology-oh-my.html|title=Lisa Nielsen: The Innovative Educator: Facebook, Edmodo, &amp; Schoology.

Choosing a social network platform for learning|last1=Nielsen|first1=Lisa|date=21 March 2013|website=Lisa Nielsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HyIsDAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=education+and+social+media+toward+a+digital+future+pdf+jstor&amp;ots=-qZgodm78j&amp;sig=RO_xIij2Nfsh_4HmY87FP1ADcPM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Education and Social Media: Toward a Digital Future|last1=Greenhow|first1=Christine|last2=Sonnevend|first2=Julia|date=6 May 2016|publisher=MIT Press|language=en|last3=Agur|first3=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt; New standards have been put into place as digital technology has augmented classrooms, with many classrooms being designed to use [[smartboard]]s and [[audience response|audience response systems]] in replacement of traditional chalkboards or whiteboards.

====Digital writing====
University of Southern Mississippi professor, Dr. Suzanne Mckee-Waddell&lt;ref&gt;Mckee-Waddell, S. s. (2015). Digital Literacy: Bridging the Gap with Digital Writing Tools. ''[[Delta Kappa Gamma]] Bulletin'', ''82''(1), 26-31.
&lt;/ref&gt;  conceptualized the idea of digital composition as the ability to integrate multiple forms of communication technologies and research to create a better understanding of a topic. Digital composition keeps educators and students connected through modern teaching techniques. Digital writing in particular is a new type of digital composition being taught increasingly within universities. Digital writing is a [[pedagogy]] focused on the impact technology has had on various writing environments; it is not simply the process of using a computer to write. Rather than the traditional print perspective, digital writing enables students to explore modern technologies and learn how different writing spaces affect the meaning, [[audience]], and [[readability]] of text. Educators in favor of digital writing argue that it is necessary because "technology fundamentally changes how writing is produced, delivered, and received."&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davidson, Bill; Cushman, Ellen; Grabill, Jeff; DeVoss, Danielle Nicole; Porter, Jim (2005). [http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/10.1/binder2.html?coverweb/wide/index.html "Why teach digital writing?"]. ''Kairos''. '''10''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of teaching digital writing is that students will increase their ability to produce a relevant, high-quality product, instead of just a standard academic paper.&lt;ref&gt;Beers, Kylene; Probst, Robert; Rief, Linda (2007). ''Adolescent Literacy: Turning Promise into Practice.'' UK: Heinemann Publishing. {{ISBN|9780325011288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of digital writing is the use of [[hypertext]]. As opposed to printed text, hypertext invites readers to explore information in a non-linear fashion. Hypertext consists of traditional text and [[hyperlinks]] that send readers to other texts. These links may refer to related terms or concepts (such is the case on [[Wikipedia]]), or they may enable readers to choose the order in which they read. The process of digital writing requires the composer to make unique "decisions regarding linking and omission." These decisions "give rise to questions about the author's responsibilities to the [text] and to objectivity."&lt;ref&gt;McAdams, Mindy; Berger, Stephanie. ''[http://www.journalofelectronicpublishing.org/hypertext/index.html "Hypertext"]''. Journal of Electronic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In society===
Digital literacy is present within society by allowing people to communicate through the use of various digital platforms. Literacy in [[social network service]]s and [[Web 2.0]] sites helps people stay in contact with others, pass timely information, and even buy and sell [[goods and services]]. Digital literacy can also prevent people from being taken advantage of online, as [[photo manipulation]], [[E-mail fraud]]s and [[phishing]] often can fool the digitally illiterate, costing victims money and making them vulnerable to [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/16/the-growing-need-for-technical-and-digital-literacy|title=US News|last=Longardner|first=Tara|date=2015|work=The Growing Need for Technical and Digital Literacy|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those using technology and the internet to commit these manipulations and fraudulent acts possess the digital literacy abilities to fool victims by understanding the technical trends and consistencies; it becomes important to be digitally literate to always think one step ahead when utilizing the digital world. 

With the emergence of [[social media]], individuals who are digitally literate now have a major voice online.&lt;ref&gt;nashoa (January 6, 2014). ''[https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-socialcollab/ "Social networks using web 2.0"]''. IBM.&lt;/ref&gt; Websites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as personal websites and [[blogs]], have enabled a new type of journalism that is subjective, personal, and "represents a global conversation that is connected through its community of readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cameron/cv/pubs/04-01.pdf|title=Audience, Structure, and Authority in the Weblog Community|last=Marlow|first=Cameron|publisher=MIT Media Laboratory|accessdate=2 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These online communities foster group interactivity among the digitally literate. Social media also help users establish a [[digital identity]] or a "symbolic digital representation of identity attributes."&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Mark (2005). [https://blogs.oracle.com/identity/entry/identity_map_core_identity "Identity Map"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126133624/https://blogs.oracle.com/identity/entry/identity_map_core_identity |date=2016-11-26 }}. Oracle.&lt;/ref&gt;  Without digital literacy or the assistance of someone who is digitally literate, one cannot possess a personal digital identity (this is closely allied to web literacy).

Research has demonstrated that the differences in the level of digital literacy depend mainly on age and education level, while the influence of gender is decreasing (Hargittai, 2002; van Dijk, 2005; van Dijk and van Deursen, 2009). Among young people, digital literacy is high in its operational dimension. Young people rapidly move through hypertext and have a familiarity with different kinds of online resources. However, the skills to critically evaluate content found online show a deficit (Gui and Argentin, 2011).

=== In the workforce ===
The [[Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (H.R. 803; 113th Congress)|2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)]] defines digital literacy skills as a workforce preparation activity.&lt;ref&gt;IMLS press release: [http://www.imls.gov/2.2_billion_reasons_to_pay_attention_to_wioa.aspx $2.2 Billion Reasons to Pay Attention to WIOA]. 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are digitally literate are more likely to be economically secure,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Wynne, M., &amp; Cooper, L. (2007). ''[http://www.digitalaccess.org/pdf/White_Paper.pdf Digital Inclusion Imperatives Offer Municipalities New Social and Economic Opportunities]''. Retrieved from POWER UP: The Campaign for Digital Inclusion.&lt;/ref&gt; as many jobs require a working knowledge of computers and the Internet to perform basic tasks. 

[[White-collar worker|White collar]] jobs are today performed primarily on computers and portable devices. Many of these jobs require proof of digital literacy to be hired or promoted. Sometimes companies will administer their own tests to employees, or official certification will be required.

As technology has become cheaper and more readily available, more [[blue-collar]] jobs have required digital literacy as well. Manufacturers and retailers, for example, are expected to collect and analyze data about productivity and market trends to stay competitive. Construction workers often use computers to increase employee safety.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Job recruiters often use [[employment website|employment Web sites]] to find potential employees, thus magnifying the importance of digital literacy in securing a job. [[LinkedIn]] is one of the most popular employment sites, in which professionals can connect with others in their field, search for potential employment opportunities, or put out feelers for jobs they may need filled. 

Possessing advanced and capable digital literacy serves as an essential skill allowing individuals to compete in the workforce. Socially, it has become almost necessary to possess a degree of digital literacy on all job levels, as society has become a technology based one and will continue to be such.

== Digital divide ==
{{main article|Digital divide}}
Digital literacy and digital access have become increasingly important competitive differentiators for individuals using the internet meaningfully.&lt;ref&gt;Celik, A. (2007). [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/gaid/unpan032783.pdf ''Our Common Humanity in the Information Age: Principles and Values for Development''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridging the economic and developmental divides is in large measure a matter of increasing digital literacy and access for peoples who have been left out of the information and communications technology (ICT) revolutions.

Research published in 2012 found that the digital divide, as defined by access to information technology, does not exist amongst youth in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cohen, C. J. 2011"&gt;Cohen, C. J., &amp; Kahne, J. (2011). Participatory Politics: New Media and Youth Political Action. Chicago, IL: MacArthur Network on Youth and Participatory Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; Young people of all races and ethnicities report being connected to the internet at rates of 94-98%.&lt;ref name="Cohen, C. J. 2011"/&gt; There remains, however, a [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|civic opportunity gap]], where youth from poorer families and those attending lower socioeconomic status schools are less likely to encounter opportunities to apply their digital literacies toward civic ends.&lt;ref&gt;Kahne, Joseph and Middaugh, Ellen (2008). As technology has become cheaper and more readily available, more blue-collar jobs have required digital literacy as well. "Democracy for some: The civic opportunity gap in high school", Circle Working Paper, retrieved 2013-09-25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Community Informatics|Community informatics]] overlaps to a considerable degree with digital literacy by being concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level, but also according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the "effective use" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.&lt;ref&gt;Gurstein, Michael (2003). [http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027 "Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide"]. ''First Monday''. '''8''' (12). [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107]].&lt;/ref&gt; Digital literacy is, of course, one of the significant elements in this process.

The United Nations Global Alliance for ICT and Development ([[GAID]]) seeks to address this set of issues at an international and global level. Many organizations (e.g. [[Per Scholas|''Per'' Scholas]] for underserved communities in the United States and [http://interconnection.org/ InterConnection] for underserved communities around the world as well as the U.S.) focus on addressing this concern at national, local and community levels.

=== Definition ===
The digital divide was first widely discussed by journalists, academics, and governmental agencies in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The digital divide was used to distinguish between the digital accessibility of wealthy and lower-income groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Jessamyn West (librarian)|Jessamyn C. West]] defines the digital divide as the gap between individuals who can and cannot easily access technology, or the haves and have-nots.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohron|first=Madalyn|year=2016|title=The Continuing Digital Divide in the United States|url=|journal=The Serials Librarian|volume=69|issue=1|pages=77–78|doi=10.1080/0361526X.2015.1036195|via=Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/741453556|title=Without a Net : Librarians Bridging the Digital Divide.|date=2011|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|others=West, Jessamyn C.|isbn=1283134527|oclc=741453556}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide highlights the privileges individuals have in accessing technology.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Expanding on the definition of the digital divide, [[Howard Besser]] argues that the digital divide means more than technology access between the haves and have-nots. The digital divide encompasses aspects such as information literacy, appropriateness of content, and access to content.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Besser, Howard (2001). ''[https://tcla.gseis.ucla.edu/divide/politics/besser.html "The Next Digital Divides"]''. Teaching to Change LA. 1 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond access, a digital divide exists between those who have the ability to apply critical thinking to technology.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Language and English fluency creates a barrier in the digital divide as well, as most content online is written in English.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The digital divide includes a gap between individuals who have the ability to create digital content or are merely consumers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Socioeconomic factors ===
In 1994 the United States Department of Commerce began investigating the causes of the digital divide. The [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)]] conducted the survey, Falling Through the Net.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The NTIA discovered that many socioeconomic factors, such as income, geographical location, age, and education were the driving forces of the digital divide.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Older, less educated, and lower-income individuals were less likely to own a telephone or computer in their homes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The NTIA conducted a second survey in 1999 and found that statistics of the digital divide improved.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Computer ownership and internet access increased across every demographic group and geographic area. However, the research found that certain groups were advancing faster in regards to internet access.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Those who had easy access to technology were growing more information rich than the have-not group.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The research revealed that the socioeconomic factors found in the first survey are still present in growing the digital divide, although access to computers and internet use increased.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Digital natives and digital immigrants ===
[[Marc Prensky]] invented and popularized the terms digital natives and digital immigrants. A digital native, according to Marc Prensky, is an individual born into the digital age.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Prensky, Marc (2001). "Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants". ''On the Horizon''. '''9''' (5): 1–6. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1108/10748120110424816|10.1108/10748120110424816]].&lt;/ref&gt; A digital immigrant refers to an individual who adopts technology later in life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These terms aid in understanding the issues of teaching digital literacy, however, simply being a digital native does not make one digitally literate.

Digital immigrants, although they adapt to the same technology as natives, possess a sort of accent which restricts them from communicating the way natives do. In fact, research shows that, due to the brain's malleable nature, technology has changed the way today's students read, perceive, and process information.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Nicholas (2008). "Is Google Making Us Stupid?". The Atlantic. 107 (2). doi:10.1111/j.1744-7984.2008.00172.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that today's educators may struggle to find effective teaching methods for digital natives. Digital immigrants might resist teaching digital literacy because they themselves were not taught that way. Marc Prensky believes this is a problem because today's students speak a new language that educators do not understand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Statistics and popular representations of the elderly portray them as digital immigrants. For example, Canada in 2010 found that 29% of its citizens 75 years of age and older, and 60% of its citizens between the ages of 65-74 had browsed the internet in the past month.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Conversely, internet activity reached almost 100% among its 15 through 24-year-old citizens.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Allen, Mary (2013). [http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11768-eng.htm "Cultural consumption on the Internet by older Canadians"]. Statistics Canada. Perspectives on Canadian Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene Loos identifies the most common assumptions about digital technologies and the elderly, all of which contribute to portray them as digital immigrants and to perpetuate digital ageism.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Senior citizens may be regarded as a homogenous group, however, this group does not want or is not able to make use of digital information sources.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Eugene Loos claims this is not a problem because as time passes, these generations will be succeeded by new generations that have no problem at all with digital technologies.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Loos, Eugene (2012). [http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/131944 "Senior citizens: Digital immigrants in their own country?"]. ''Observatorio''. '''6''' (1): 1–23. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.7458/obs612012513|10.7458/obs612012513]].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research has suggested much variation in the digital literacy of older adults, providing a six-fold typology: Non-Users (the smallest category), Reluctants, Apprehensives, Basic Users, Go-Getters, and Savvy Users. There does not seem to be a strong relationship between the amount of use and digital skills, although older adults tend to disparage their literacy compared to younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;Anabel Quan-Haase, Carly Williams, Maria Kicevski, Isioma Elueze, &amp; [[Barry Wellman]]. 2018. “Dividing the Grey Divide: Deconstructing Myths about Older Adults’ Online Activities, Skills, and Attitudes.” ''American Behavioral Scientist'' 62,9 (August): 1207-1228  [https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764218777572]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Marc Prensky is credited as the originator of digital natives and digital immigrants because he popularized the concepts, Poet and cyberlibertarian [[John Perry Barlow]] and media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] have also been cited to have coined the terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John Perry Barlow used the concepts in his statement entitled ''A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'', for the 1996 World Economic Forum in Davos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John Perry Barlow's poetry showcases the generational gap that grew with the rise of technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John Perry Barlow metaphorically suggested that children are natives in the growing digital world and parents are fearful of the growing generational gap in regard to technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Douglas Rushkoff employed the concepts of digital natives and digital immigrants in his book, ''Playing the Future''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Douglas Rushkoff praises children's progress and growing competence with technology and labels youth as digital natives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Ahn, Juyeon, &amp; Jung, Yoonhyuka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-eds.a.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=b53ae3ba-2bcb-424b-833f-10f2aa4f0077@sessionmgr4006&amp;hid=4108&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=117311175&amp;db=edb|title=Library Log in|website=0-eds.a.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu|access-date=2016-11-29}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a digital native is someone who has grown up with technologies. For example, a pager, the first cell-phone, and an oversized cube computer. They also have different understandings of digital use. While digital immigrants, who have been exposed to digital technology later in life. Prensky states, "digital natives” indicates the young generation born after the 1980s, “digital immigrants” designates the parent generation of DN. Because DN have been growing with diverse digital technologies, they are inclined to adopt and be favorable to emerging technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahn|first=J|last2=Jung|first2=Y|year=2016|title=The common sense of dependence on smartphone: A comparison between digital natives and digital immigrants.|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1236–1256|doi=10.1177/1461444814554902|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital visitors and digital residents ===
In contrast to Marc Prensky, David S. White has been publicizing his concept of [[Digital Visitor and Resident|digital visitors and residents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=White |first=David |last2=Le Cornu |first2=Alison |title=Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement |url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171/3049 |publisher=First Monday |publication-date=2011-09-05 |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=775–786 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x |issn=1396-0466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, D. (2013, May 31). ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sFBadv04eY Visitors and residents]'' Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sFBadv04eY
&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, the concept is that visitors leave no online social trace whereas residents live a portion of their lives online. These are not two separate categories of people, but rather a description of a continuum of behaviors. It is probable that many individuals demonstrate both visitor and residential behaviors in different contexts. Dave White has developed a mapping tool which explores this concept.&lt;ref&gt;White, D. (2013, June 5). ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9IMObcyKbo Visitors and residents mapping activity].'' Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9IMObcyKbo.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participation gap ===
Media theorist [[Henry Jenkins]] coined the term participation gap and distinguished the participation gap from the digital divide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Henry Jenkins, the participation gap describes the gap in skills that emerge when individuals have different levels of access to technology.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/15468.htm|title=The Participation Gap: A Conversation with media expert and MIT Professor Henry Jenkins|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2008|website=National Education Association|publisher=|access-date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Jenkins states that students learn different sets of technology skills if they only have access to the internet in a library or school.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Students who have access to the internet at home have more opportunities to develop their skills and have fewer limitations, such as computer time limits and website filters commonly used in libraries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

The effects of the participation gap were studied by Danah Boyd, who observed and conducted fieldwork on teens in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Danah Boyd observed privileged and disadvantaged teens' different experiences with technology. In New York, she observed a teen girl use her Android phone for texting and using mobile applications. The teen girl was able to use technology to participate in social media, but the internet was too slow on her phone to complete homework assignments. Although the teen girl had full access to the internet, the slow internet and mobile device itself limited her experience in further improving her competence with technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The teen girl's limited access to technology highlights the participatory gap in skills that individuals experience when they have limited access to the internet and various modes of technology.

==Global impact==
{{Globalize |date=November 2016}}
Government officials around the world have emphasized the importance of digital literacy for their [[economy]]. According to HotChalk, an Online resource for educators: "Nations with centralized education systems, such as China, are leading the charge and implementing digital literacy training programs faster than anyone else. For those countries, the news is good."

Many [[developing nations]] are also focusing on digital literacy education to compete globally.

Economically, socially and regionally marginalised people have benefited from the ECDL Foundation’s ECDL / ICDL programme through funding and support from [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] initiatives, international development agency funding and [[NGO|non-governmental organisations]].

The [[Philippines]]' [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Education Secretary]] [[Jesli Lapus]] has emphasized the importance of digital literacy in Filipino education. He claims a resistance to change is the main obstacle to improving the nation's education in the [[globalized]] world. In 2008, Lapus was inducted into Certiport's "Champions of Digital Literacy" Hall of Fame for his work to emphasize digital literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Philippine Information Agency. (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090626063509/http://www.pia.gov.ph/default.asp?m=12&amp;fi=p080826.htm&amp;no=19 ''DepEd: Use ICT to improve learning outcomes''&lt;nowiki&gt; [Press Release]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in 2011 by the Southern African Linguistics &amp; Applied Language Studies program observed some South African university students regarding their digital literacy.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Kajee, L; Balfour, R (2011). "Students' access to digital literacy at a South African university: Privilege and marginalisation". ''Southern African Linguistics &amp; Applied Language Studies''. '''29''': 187. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.2989/16073614.2011.633365|10.2989/16073614.2011.633365]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that while their courses did require some sort of digital literacy, very few students actually had access to a computer. Many had to pay others to type any work, as they their digital literacy was almost nonexistent. Findings show that class, ignorance, and inexperience still affect any access to learning South African university students may need.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 2011, the EU Kids Online conducted a study that examined the amount of time children in Europe spent on the computer.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Matyjas, B (2015). "Mass Media and Children. Globality in Everyday Life". Procedia - Social And Behavioral Sciences. 174: 2898–2904. doi:[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281501085X 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.1026.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that roughly 85% of European children use a computer without the supervision of a teacher or parent, showing that these children have acquired some form of digital literacy.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3177">The '''Eifel dialects''' ({{lang-de|Eifeler Mundarten}}) are those [[dialect]]s spoken in the [[Eifel mountains]] of [[Germany]]. They divide into two language regions: the dialects spoken in the southern Eifel (''Eifelisch'') are part of the [[Moselle Franconian dialect group]] and closely resemble [[Luxembourgish]]. In the northern Eifel, by contrast, the dialects (''Eifelplatt'') belong to the [[Ripuarian dialect group]] and are more like ''[[Öcher Platt]]'' or ''[[Kölsch (language)|Kölsch]]''. In between there is a [[dialect continuum]] of typical transitions, whereby more or less every village speaks a little differently from its neighbours.

== Linguistic geography ==

The development of territorial structures in the [[Eifel]] since the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] is reflected in the development of the Eifel dialects. From a linguistic point of view, the Eifel can be divided into the Moselle Franconian and the Ripuarian dialect regions. The "Eifel language barrier", which separates the two dialects along a broad strip of territory, extends from the northern part of the [[Bitburg-Prüm]], via [[Dahlem, North Rhine-Westphalia|Kronenburg]], [[Blankenheim (Ahr)|Blankenheim]], [[Nettersheim]], [[Altenahr]] and [[Ahrweiler]] along the [[Vinxtbach]] to its confluence with the [[Rhine]] at [[Bad Breisig]]. The old Roman border between [[Germania superior]] and [[Germania inferior]] ran here too. In the [[feudal period]], the border between the [[Electorate of Trier]] and [[Electorate of Cologne]] also followed this line and, today, the border between [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] runs within this strip of land, which in linguistics is also referred to as the Vinxtbach Line or Dorp-Dorf Line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rheinische-landeskunde.lvr.de/sprache/namen/ortsnamen/ on 3 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Eifel dialect is also spoken in the neighbouring [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]. Especially in the southern part of this region, which is also called the [[Belgian Eifel]], the dialect has been able to preserve its importance in everyday life. Historically, these territories belonged mainly to the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] (until 1815), while smaller elements belonged to the Electorate of Trier.

'''Herbert "Herbie" Coleridge''' (7 October 1830 – 23 April 1861) was a [[England|British]] [[philologist]], technically the first editor of what ultimately became the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. He was a grandson of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

==Biography==
He was the son of [[Sara Coleridge|Sara]] and [[Henry Nelson Coleridge]]. He earned a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|double first]] in [[Classics]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. After graduation, he became a [[barrister]], but, living off a small [[Life annuity|annuity]], devoted most of his time and energy to linguistics studies. At age 27, as a member of the [[Philological Society]], he formed a committee with [[Richard Chenevix Trench]] and [[Frederick James Furnivall|Frederick Furnivall]] to identify and research words unlisted and undefined in English dictionaries of the period. The efforts of this committee eventually led to the development of the ''Oxford English Dictionary''. A dedicated editor, he died of [[tuberculosis]] at age 30 after completing some fundamental work for the project.

      <comment>It is not a form of lithography. It's a relief or embossing/debossing process. It's primarily known as foil stamping and should really be combined with that entry. I also corrected some grammatical errors.</comment>

'''Hot stamping''' or [[Foil stamping]] is a printing method of [[relief printing]] in which predried ink or foils are transferred to a surface at high temperatures. The non-polluting method has diversified since its rise to prominence in the 19th century to include a variety of colors and processes. After 1970s, hot stamping became one of the important methods of decoration on the surface of Plastic Products. Hot Stamping technology for plastic is now using for Electric Components (including TV frame, Audio components, Refrigerators etc.,) cosmetic containers (lipstick, cream, mascara, shampoo bottle etc), automobile parts (interior and exterior materials). 

==History==
In the 19th century, hot stamping became a popular method of applying gold tooling or [[Paper embossing|embossing]] in book printing.&lt;ref name="Cambras2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambras|first=Josep|title=The Complete Book of Bookbinding|year=2004|publisher=Lark Books|isbn=978-1-57990-646-7|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first patent for hot stamping was recorded in Germany by Ernst Oeser in 1892.&lt;ref name="Benedek2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benedek|first=Istvan|title=Developments In Pressure-Sensitive Products, 2nd Edition|date=12 December 2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-57444-542-8|page=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally used on leather and paper, the method became a popular means of marking plastic from the 1950s on.&lt;ref name="MitchellDrozda1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Philip|author2=Tom Drozda|author3=Philip E. Mitchell|title=Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook: Plastic part manufacturing|year=1996|publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers|isbn=978-0-87263-456-5|page=9-6,9-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the most commonly used methods of [[security printing]].&lt;ref name="Couchman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Couchman|first=Ivan|title=Interpol: 75 Years of International Police Co-operation|year=1998|publisher=Kensington Publications|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
In a hot stamping machine, a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] is mounted and heated, with the product to be stamped placed beneath it.&lt;ref name="Harper2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harper|first=Charles A.|title=Handbook of Plastic Processes|date=26 May 2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-78657-3|page=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metallized or painted roll-leaf carrier is inserted between the two, and the die presses down through it. The dry paint or foil used is impressed into the surface of the product. The dye-stamping process itself is non-polluting because the materials involved are dry.&lt;ref name="Benedek2010"/&gt;

==Tools==
Along with foil stamping machines, among the commonly used tools in hot stamping are dies and foil.&lt;ref name="MitchellDrozda1996"/&gt; Dies may be made of metal or silicone rubber, and they may be shaped directly or [[Casting|cast]]. They can carry high levels of detail to be transferred to the surface and may be shaped to accommodate irregularities in the surface.

Foils are multilayered coatings that transfer to the surface of the product.&lt;ref name="MitchellDrozda1996"/&gt; Non-metallic foils consist of an adherence base, a color layer, and a release layer. Metallic foils replace the color layer with a layer of chrome or vacuum-metallized aluminum. Metallic foil construction has a metal-like sheen and is available in different metal shades such as gold, silver, bronze, and copper. Pigment foil does not have a metallic sheen but may be glossy or matte. Holographic foil paper includes a 3-dimensional image to provide a distinctive appearance to specific areas of a digitally printed application. Printing is often done on leather or paper.

Different hot stamping machines serve different purposes, but the most common hot stamping machines are simple up-and-down presses.&lt;ref name="Benedek2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MitchellDrozda1996"/&gt; Three of the most common brands are Kwikprint, Kingsley, and Howard. However, for more industrial applications Kluge and Heidelberg presses are more commonly used.

'''Josep Romaguera''' ({{IPA-ca|ʒuˈzɛb ruməˈɣeɾə}}; 1642–1723) is the author of the only [[emblem book]] ever published in the [[Catalan language]], the [[Atheneo de Grandesa]].  His work consists of [[prose]], [[poetry]] and [[sermons]].   His writing is typical of [[Baroque]] style.  

Romaguera was born in [[Barcelona]] during the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] (Guerra dels Segadors) against [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in 1642 and lived until 1723, according to the epitaph of him published in the manuscript ''Historia Eclesiástica del principado de Cataluña'' by the [[Mercedarian]] historian Pere Serra i Postius.  There is no known mention of him in public life until he began his ecclesiastical career in 1661, the date of his first benefice;  he served both in the [[Inquisition]] and as a [[Canon Law]] Professor at the [[University of Barcelona]].  Romaguera’s publications, apart from the ''Atheneo'', include sermons preached in [[Spanish language|Castilian]] on various Saints’ festival days; his other works, including apparently the second and/or third volumes of the ''Atheneo'', are lost.  According to the epitaph by Postius, Romaguera was a renowned preacher and intellectual, and also represented the [[Catholic Church]] in the [[Courts]] convened by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] in 1701–1702.  For Postius, Romaguera was a unique individual, "One of the most famous men that Catalonia has had in Letters, Prudence and Government at the end of the previous Century and beginning of the present one.  For he was a very elegant orator in Verse as well as Prose.  He was an ingenious, sententious, sweet, gallant and brilliant Catalan poet, as his book shows" [translation of Spanish original] (f.104r).  

Romaguera was known as a defender of the Catalan language, and indeed in the Prologue to the ''Atheneo'' he states that his book is an attempt to give "an inspiration to Catalan pens."

'''Juk''' (also known as '''Suai''', '''Souei''', '''Xuay''') is a [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer language]] of the [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch spoken in [[Sekong Province]], [[Laos]]. According to Sidwell (2003), it was probably a northern dialect of Jru' that had differentiated through separation by migration.

The Juk language was discovered by Thai linguist Therapan L-Thongkum. Juk speakers live in the village Ban Nyôkthông (Gnôkthông), located about 12 km north of Ban Kafe. It is located halfway between the towns of Tateng and Sekong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2418">'''Luís Manuel Júlio Frederico Gonçalves''' (1846 in [[Panjim|Nova Goa]] – 1896), who usually wrote simply as J. Gonçalves, was a [[Goa]]n writer. Referred to by his contemporaries as the [[Alexandre Herculano]] of Goa,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. ''Lengthening Shadows''. 2 vols. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. I p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Gonçalves had a foundational role in developing Portuguese-language writing in the Portuguese colony of Goa.&lt;ref&gt;Mário Cordeiro, ''Júlio Gonçalves: De Goa a Lisboa'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawyer by training, Gonçalves served in public administration, most significantly as librarian of [[Goa Central Library|Panjim's public library]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. ''Lengthening Shadows''. 2 vols. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. I pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's [[Regeneration (Portugal)|Regeneration]] saw the reintroduction of the press to Goa, along with expanded Portuguese education, and in its wake, Gonçalves founded and ran the monthly journal ''[[Ilustração Goana]]'' from 1864-66. 'It focussed on literary and historical themes, with some incursions into the natural sciences' and carried Gonçalves's 'Bosquejos Literários', literary critical pieces, perhaps the first pieces of modern literary criticism in Goa.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. ''Lengthening Shadows''. 2 vols. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. I pp. 9-10 (quoting p. 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gonçalves is noted today as a writer of short stories, which he wrote in two series: ''Contos da Minha Terra'' and ''Aventuras de um Simplício''. They are reckoned 'some of the very first efforts to European-style literary fiction to a Goan setting' and show the influence of European [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro.

'''Laxmanshastri Balaji Joshi''' (27 January 1901&amp;nbsp;– 27 May 1994) was a  Sanskritist, Vedic scholar, thinker and  [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

==Biography==
He was born in a [[Deshastha Brahmin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AsU7R69gqDIC|title=The Illustrated Weekly of India, Volume 95|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Company, Limited, at the Times of India Press|page=31|year=1974|quote=Marathi literature is strewn with Deshastha writers. Some of the luminaries are B. S. Murdhekar, the neo classical poet and critic; the popular dramatists Acharya P. K. Atre, V.V.Shirwadkar; the poet and story writer G.D.Madgulkar popularly known as the "Modern Walmiki” of Maharashtra, Sahitya Akademi Award winners G. T. Deshpande, Laxmanshastri Joshi, S. N. Banhatti, V. K. Gokak and Mugali all belong to this community.}}&lt;/ref&gt; family in the town of Pimpalner in [[Dhule District]] on 27 January 1901. He, along with others fought for socio-religious reforms, without which he felt, India would not achieve her goals of swaraj.  As a supporter of Indian independence, he joined Mahatma Gandhi. In Yerawada prison he helped Gandhi, who had chosen him to be his principal advisor in his campaign against untouchability, with analysis and arguments from the smritis and other dharmashastras to support Gandhi's campaign for untouchability.  Around the time India gained independence, he came under the influence of many reformist intellectuals including M. N. Roy and quickly assimilated and embraced western philosophical systems. He questioned whether those that had the knowledge had wisdom to lead, and recognized those that followed had inadequate knowledge, and he wrote Vaidik Sankriti-cha Vikas in 1951. This treatise was based on six lectures he delivered at the University of Pune, where he traced the evolution of "Vedic" culture and its influence on modern India. He wrote a critique arguing that modern Indians became conflicted between meeting material needs and attaining spiritual enlightenment, thus fostering a collective weakness, disharmony and allowing caste differences to prevail. For his outstanding contribution, he received the Sahitya Akademi award from India's National Academy of Letters in 1955. This and other critical inquiries into India’s Hindu religious traditions drew the ire of the contemporary Hindu orthodoxy.

He had been granted the title ''Tarkatirtha'' (तर्कतीर्थ) (or literally, ("Master of Logic").

In 1954, he presided over [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]], which was held in [[New Delhi]]. In 1955, he received a [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for his work ''Waidik Sanskruticha Wikas'' (वैदिक संस्कृतीचा विकास).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa10313.htm#marathi Sahitya Akademi awards in Marathi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331234040/http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa10313.htm |date=31 March 2009 }} Official Site for [[Sahitya Akademi Award]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as the first president of Maharashtra State Board of Literature and Culture when it was established in 1960, and starting from that year, served for a large number of years as the president of the project of compiling Vishwakosha, a 20-volume Marathi encyclopedia under the sponsorship of the above Board. He also spearheaded compilation of Dharmakosha, a Marathi transliteration of the ancient Vedic/Hindu Sanskritic hymns.

In 1973, he received the National Sanskrit Pandit Award, and in 1976, the government of India conferred on him the [[Padma Bhushan]] title for excellence in Literature and Education.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his continued contributions, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1992.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards" /&gt;

In 1989, Joshi received a [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]], the highest award for lifetime achievement given by the [[Sahitya Akademi|Akademi]], which is India's National Academy of Letters.

Joshi was equally a pragmatist, endorsing Nehru’s investments in higher education and heavy industry. He died at the age of 94, near the birth spring of the Krishna river.

The following is a list of Joshi's major works:
* Waidik Sanskruticha Wikas

{{Template: English language}}
'''Liberian English''' refers to the varieties of [[English language|English]] spoken in [[Liberia]]. There are five such varieties:
* Standard Liberian English or Liberian Settler English (similar to [[American English]])
* [[Kru Pidgin English]]
* [[Liberian Kreyol language]] (Vernacular Liberian English) from [[African American Vernacular English]]
* [[Merico language]] (Americo-Liberian settlers from the [[United States|United States of America]])
* [[Caribbean English]] (ex-Caribbean slaves settlers from the [[Caribbean islands]])
Normally, Liberians use these terms refer to all such varieties simply as 'English.'  Additionally, the term 'Liberian English' is sometimes used for all varieties except the standard.

==Standard Liberian English==
Standard Liberian English is the language of those people whose [[African American]] ancestors from the [[United States]] and the Caribbean islands immigrated to Liberia in the nineteenth century. This variety is a transplanted variety of [[African American Vernacular English]] from the southern part of the [[United States]].  It is most distinctive in isolated settlements such as [[Louisiana, Liberia|Louisiana]], [[Lexington, Liberia|Lexington]], and [[Bluntsville]], small communities upriver from [[Greenville, Liberia|Greenville]] in [[Sinoe County]]. According to 1993 statistics, approximately 69,000 people, or 2.5% of the population, spoke Standard Liberian English as a first language.

The vowel system is more elaborate than in other [[West Africa]]n variants; Standard Liberian English distinguishes {{IPA|[i]}} from {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, and {{IPA|[u]}} from {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, and uses the diphthongs {{IPA|[aɪ]}}, {{IPA|[aʊ]}}, and {{IPA|[əɪ]}}. Vowels can be nasalized. The final vowel of ''happy'' is {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. It favors open syllables, usually omitting syllable-final {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, or a fricative. The interdental fricatives {{IPA|[θ, ð]}} appear as {{IPA|[t, d]}} in syllable-initial position, and as {{IPA|[f, v]}} finally.

==Kru Pidgin English==
Kru Pidgin English is a moribund variety that was spoken historically by [[Krumen people|Krumen]].  These were individuals, most often from the [[Klao]] [[Mandinka people|Madingoes]] and [[Grebo people|Grebo]] ethnic groups, who worked as sailors on ships along the West African coast and also as migrant workers and domestics in such British colonies as the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (Ghana) and [[Nigeria]].  The Krumen tradition dates back to the end of the eighteenth century. With the end of the British colonial presence in West Africa in the mid-twentieth century, however, the tradition came to an end, and with it the ongoing use of Kru Pidgin English.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Liberian Kreyol language==
[[Liberian Kreyol language]] (Vernacular Liberian English), or Liberian creole the most common variety, developed from [[Liberian Interior Pidgin English]], the Liberian version of [[West African Pidgin English]] though it has been significantly influenced by the [[Americo-Liberian]] and the Caribbean slaves Settler English. Its phonology owes much to Liberia's [[Kru languages]].  Vernacular Liberian English has been analysed having a [[post-creole continuum]].  As such, rather than being a [[pidgin]] wholly distinct from English, it is a range of varieties that extend from the [[Caribbean English]] to the highly pidginized [[Americo-Liberian]] English and [[African American Vernacular English]] to one that shows many similarities to English as spoken elsewhere in [[West Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

'''Luobohe Miao''' (罗泊河 ''Luóbóhé'' Miao, Luobo River Miao, Luopohe Hmong; Xijia Miao 西家苗), a.k.a. '''Hmjo''' or '''A-Hmyo''', is a [[Miao languages|Miao language]] of China.

==Distribution==
According to Chen Qiguang (2013), there are more than 50,000 ''ʔə55 m̥ø31'' (Flowery Miao 花苗) speakers in Kaiyang, Fuquan, Longli, Guiding, Weng'an, and other counties of southeastern Guizhou.

==Phonology==
Luobo River Miao has an unusually small number of tones for a Hmongic language, with just three: high {{IPA|˥}} 5, rising {{IPA|˨˦}} 24, and falling {{IPA|˧˩}} 31.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150420085819/http://218.249.224.102/upfile/20115613035615353.pdf 兼谈苗族英雄史诗《亚鲁王》的记译整理问题], 民族翻译, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xijia==
Xijia 西家, a variety of Luobohe Miao, had 1,300 speakers as of 2000 in 21 villages surrounding [[Kaili City|Kaili]] City, Guizhou, and in Pingzhai Village 平寨村 of Longchang Township 龙厂乡, and Xiangma 响马村, Loumiao 娄苗菜, and Fuzhuang  Villages of Lushan Township 卢山乡.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/X/Xi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is also spoken in Majiatun Township 马家屯乡 and Dabaomu Township 大保姆乡 of Kaili City.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/X/Xi.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; The Xijia of Shiban Village 石板寨村, Dafengdong Township 大风洞乡, [[Kaili City|Kaili]] cannot communicate with the neighboring Ge ([[Gejia language|Gejia]]) people.

According to Chen Qiguang (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Chen Qiguang [陈其光] (2007). [http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/article/MZYW200704013.htm 西家苗语. 《民族语文》2007年第04期.]&lt;/ref&gt; the Xijia (autonym: ''qo0 mjo31'') numbered 1,941 people as of 1983, and were distributed in Laojunzhai 老君寨, Majiatun 马家屯, Shibanzhai 石板寨, and Daxiao Baoben 大小泡 of [[Kaili City]].

Within Luobohe, Xijia is classified as "Dialect 1" (第一土语). while Yejipo Miao 野鸡坡话 is classified as "Dialect 2" (第二土语). Chen's (2007) data was collected by Luo Daoqin 罗道钦 from Shibanzhai 石板寨 in 1983. Additionally, a Miao variety spoken in Gusa 谷撒寨, Sizhai Village 四寨村, Xinpu Township 新铺乡, [[Guiding County]], Guizhou belongs to the "Dialect 2" cluster.&lt;ref&gt;栗华益. 2011. 谷撒苗语的声调特点. 中国语文2011年第3期(总第342期).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">In sailing, '''lying ahull''' is a controversial method of weathering a storm, executed by downing all sails, battening the hatches and locking the tiller to [[leeward]] so the boat tries to point to windward but this is balanced by the force of wind and waves. A [[sea anchor]] is not used, allowing the boat to drift freely, completely at the mercy of the storm. Ideally the boat should rest with the wind just forward of the beam so the boat is not broadside onto the waves. Modern boats with fin keels may have too much windage at the bows for this technique and come to rest broadside on or may not be stable at all.

Along with English, it is the co-official language of Norfolk Island.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'', 21 April 2005 (page B3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/04/19/waust19.xml Save our dialect, say Bounty islanders], retrieved 6 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As travel to and from Norfolk Island becomes more common, Norfuk is falling into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;Feizkhah, Elizabeth, [http://www.time.com/time/pacific/magazine/20010806/pb.html Keeping Norfolk Alive], ''TIME Pacific'', 6 August 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013085754/http://www.time.com/time/pacific/magazine/20010806/pb.html |date=13 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts are being made to restore the language to more common usage, such as the education of children, the publication of English–Norfuk dictionaries, the use of the language in signage, and the renaming of some tourist attractions – most notably the [[rainforest]] walk "A Trip Ina Stik" – to their Norfuk equivalents.  In 2007, the United Nations added Norfuk to its list of [[endangered language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = UN adds Norfolk language to endangered list | publisher = ABC News | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/17/2008195.htm | accessdate = 5 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 1970s the Norfolk community and specialist from mainland Australia noted that the Norfuk language was falling into decline and talks about how to implement Norfolk into the school system were underway.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mühlhäusler|first=Peter|date=2007|title=The Pitkern-Norf’k language and education|url=https://doi.org/10.1075/eww.28.3.02muh|journal=English World-Wide|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=215–247|doi=10.1075/eww.28.3.02muh|issn=0172-8865}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in time Norfuk did not have a standardized writing system and was mostly an oral language. Several other individuals and groups took it upon themselves to help craft the necessary tools to help promote the Norfolk language. One of the first noted instances in which Norfolk was being taught in schools was in the 1980s, by Faye Bataille. Additionally the Society of the Descendants of Pitcairn Islanders was founded in 1977 and they proved to be a large driving force for the campaign to include Norfuk language as a teachable subject in schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first Norfolk dictionary was compiled in 1986 by Beryl Nobbs-Palmer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It was titled “''A Dictionary of Norfolk words and usages”'' and contained examples of words in the Norfuk language and how to use them.

The book “''Speak Norfuk Today”'' was written by [[Alice Buffett]] and Dr.[[Donald Laycock]]. It is an encyclopedia incorporating a large majority of the information about the Norfuk language and was one of the first instances in which the orthography of Norfuk was documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Norfuk became a co-official language of Norfolk Island in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900333013|title=Pidgins, Creoles and mixed languages : an introduction|last=1974-|first=Velupillai, Viveka,|isbn=9789027268846|location=Amsterdam|oclc=900333013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to Pitkern==
Norfuk is descended predominantly from the [[Pitkern]] (Pitcairnese or Pi'kern) spoken by settlers from the Pitcairn Islands. The relative ease of travel from English-speaking countries such as Australia and [[New Zealand]] to Norfolk Island, particularly when compared with that of travel to the Pitcairn Islands, has meant that Norfuk has been exposed to much greater contact with English relative to Pitkern. The difficulties in accessing the Pitcairn population have meant that a serious comparison of the two languages for mutual intelligibility has proven difficult.

==Classification==
Norfuk has been classified as an [[English-based creole languages|Atlantic Creole language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Avram|first=Andrei|authorlink=Andrei A. Avram|year=2003|title=Pitkern and Norfolk revisited|journal=[[English Today]]|volume=19|issue=1|pages=44–49|doi=10.1017/S0266078403003092|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=163683#|accessdate = 9 April 2007|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the island's location in the Pacific Ocean.

The language is closely related to Pitkern, but has no other close relatives other than its parent tongues of English and Tahitian.  It is generally considered that English has had more of an influence upon the language than Tahitian, with words of Tahitian extraction being confined largely to [[taboo]] subjects, negative characterisations, and adjectives indicating that something is undesirable.&lt;ref name="emsah.uq.edu.au"&gt;Ingram, John.  [http://emsah.uq.edu.au/linguistics/teaching/norfolk/Varieties-Norfolk-Phon-Ingram&amp;Muhl.pdf Norfolk Island-Pitcairn English (Pitkern Norfolk)], ''[[University of Queensland]]'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Many expressions which are not commonly used in the modern English that is spoken in most areas of the world carry on in Pitkern. These expressions include words from British maritime culture in the age of sailing ships. The influence of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] missionaries and the [[King James Version of the Bible]] are also notable. 

In the mid-19th century, the people of Pitcairn resettled on Norfolk Island; later some moved back. Most speakers of Pitkern today are the descendants of those who stayed. Pitkern and [[Norfuk dialect|Norfuk dialects]] are mutually intelligible. 

Additionally the Norfolk language is ordered in subject verb object &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daval-Markussen|first=Aymeric|date=2015-02-27|title=Book Review: 2013.

==Orthography==
{{main|Norfolk/Pitcairnese alphabet}}
The language is largely a spoken rather than written language,&lt;ref&gt;Buffett, Alice, ''An Encyclopædia of the Norfolk Island Language, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a lack of standardisation.&lt;ref name="emsah.uq.edu.au"/&gt; However, a number of attempts have been made at developing an [[orthography]] for the language.  Early attempts either attempted to enforce English spelling onto the Norfuk words,&lt;ref&gt;Buffett, Alice, ''An Encyclopædia of the Norfolk Island Language, 1999, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; or used [[Diacritic|diacritical marks]] to represent sounds distinct to the language.

[[Alice Buffett]], a Norfolk Island [[Norfolk Legislative Assembly|parliamentarian]] and Australian-trained linguist, developed a codified grammar and [[orthography]] for the language in the 1980s, assisted by Dr [[Donald Laycock]], an [[Australian National University]] academic.  Their book, ''Speak Norfuk Today,'' was published in 1988.  This orthography has won the endorsement of the Norfolk Island government, and its use is becoming prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Buffett, David E., ''An Encyclopædia of the Norfolk Island Language, 1999, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==

===Depth===

The language itself does not have words to express some concepts, particularly those having to do with science and technology. Some Islanders believe that the only solution is to create a committee charged with creating [[neologism|new words]] in Norfuk rather than simply adopting English words for new technological advances. For example, Norfuk recently adopted the word ''kompyuuta'', a Norfuk-ised version of ''computer''. Processes similar to this exist in relation to other languages around the world, such as the [[Māori language]] in New Zealand and the [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] languages. Some languages already have official bodies, such as New Zealand's [[Māori Language Commission]] or France's [[Académie française]], for creating new words.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norfolkonlinenews.com/NON-local-stories.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to Environment ===
Norfuk is a language that is heavily embedded in the ecologically of Norfolk Island. Many words are created for specific animals or plants on the island and the way in which these things are named is very unique to the Island of Norfolk.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nash|first=Joshua|last2=Mühlhäusler|first2=Peter|date=2014-01-01|title=Linking language and the environment: the case of Norf’k and Norfolk Island|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.langsci.2013.08.004|journal=Language Sciences|volume=41|pages=26–33|doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2013.08.004|issn=0388-0001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example many fish that are indigenous to the island were named either by the people who caught them or whom received them when dividing the catch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One such instance is the naming of the fish ''Sandford'' which received its name by a man named Sandford Warren after receiving the fish in his share. This fish is known in the community as a ''Sandford.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Osage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|s|eɪ|dʒ|,_|oʊ|ˈ|s|eɪ|dʒ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Osage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osage: 𐓏𐓘𐓻𐓘𐓻𐓟 𐒻𐓟, ''Wazhazhe ie'') is a [[Siouan language]] spoken by the [[Osage (tribe)|Osage]] people of [[Oklahoma]].

Osage has an inventory of sounds very similar to that of [[Dakota language|Dakota]], plus vowel length, [[preaspirated]] [[obstruent]]s and an [[interdental fricative]] (like "th" in English "then"). In contrast to Dakota, [[phoneme|phonemically]] [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] obstruents appear [[allophone|phonetically]] as [[affricate]]s, and the high back vowel *u has been fronted to {{IPA|[y]}}.

Osage is written primarily using the [[Latin alphabet]] with diacritics. In 2006, the new [[Osage alphabet]] was created for it; the revised 2014 version was included in [[Unicode]] version 9.0 in June 2016 in the [[Osage (Unicode block)|Osage block]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/versions/9.0.0.html Unicode version 9.0.0]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language revitalization ==
As of 2009, about 15-20 elders were second language speakers of Osage. The Osage Language Program, created in 2003, provides audio and video learning materials on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Phonology==
Osage phonology is quite similar to that of [[Kansa language|Kansa]]. However, it preserves many historical alternations that have been leveled out in Kansa; for example, Kansa *u has merged with *i, whereas it is still largely distinct in Osage.

===Vowels===

====Basic vowels====
Osage has five plain vowels:

{|class="wikitable IPA"
!Front!!Front!!Central!!Back
|-align=center
|i ||colspan=2|y ~ ʉ||
|-align=center
|colspan=2|e|| ||o
|-align=center
|colspan=2| ||colspan=2|ə ~ ɑ
|}
These are written {{angle bracket|i u e o a}}. 
*{{IPA|/i/}} is a high front vowel: like English ''i'' in ''ski''.
*{{IPA|/u/}} is a high non-back rounded vowel, like California or New Zealand English ''u'' in ''dude''.
*{{IPA|/e/}} is a half-open front vowel: like English ''e'' in ''get''.
*{{IPA|/o/}} is a mid-back rounded vowel: like English ''o'' in ''bolt''.
*{{IPA|/ɑ/}} is an open back vowel: like English ''a'' in ''bra''.

{{IPA|/u/}} varies between central and front, {{IPA|[ʉ ~ y]}}, and frequently unrounds to {{IPA|/i/}}. It is especially far front {{IPA|[y]}} following a velar obstruent and when it is near a front vowel with no intervening obstruent. It most commonly conflates with {{IPA|/i/}} following ''ð'' and ''n''.

Usually in fast speech, the /a/ is pronounced {{IPA|[ə]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Quintero, 2009, p.xv&lt;/ref&gt; This assimilation occurs after a stressed syllable, or at the end of a word. For example: {{IPA|céska [tsɛ́skə]}} ‘cow’, {{IPA|tóa [tóe]}} ‘this one’.

====Nasalized vowels====
There are three vowels that carry this feature: {{IPA|[ɑ̃] [ĩ] [õ]}}. It is quite common for nasalized {{IPA|[ɑ̃]}} to become a nasal {{IPA|[õ]}} and vice versa. Non-nasalized vowels can be heard as nasalized as well. In general, vowels tend to become nasalized adjacent to another nasal vowel or consonant when there is no intervening obstruent. On the other hand, final nasal vowels tend to become oral. However, nasal vowels are always short, regardless of their position. 
Examples: {{IPA|[ʃímĩʒɛ]}} ‘girl’ and {{IPA|[paˑɣõ]}} ‘mountain’

====Vowel clusters and long vowels====
According to Hans Wolff &lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolff|first=Hans|title=Osage I: Phonemes and Historical Phonology|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=April 1952|volume=18|issue=2|pages=63–68|doi=10.1086/464151}}&lt;/ref&gt; (65), common Osage vowel clusters are:
*iu {{IPA|[iü]}} for example: niuʒõ ‘Neosho River’
*íe {{IPA|[íɛ]~[íi]}} for example: wíe ‘I’
*íĩ {{IPA|[íĩ]}} for example: kasíĩte ‘tomorrow’
*iuĩ {{IPA|[üĩ]}} for example: ékiuĩka ‘don’t’
*éa {{IPA|[ɛ́a]~[ɛ́ə]}} for example: cʼéaðe ‘I killed him’
*aĩ {{IPA|[ɛ̃]}} for example: hówaĩke ‘where?’
*óa {{IPA|[óə]}} for example: tóa ‘this one’.

Vowel length is important in Osage, but it is hard to perceive and has a good deal of variation. For example, long vowels are often reduced to short ones when they are not accented.&lt;ref name="Quintero, 2009, p.xvi"&gt;Quintero, 2009, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Quintero took long vowels to be the underlying form in such situations. There is not enough information to specify exactly how the accent system works in Osage, and there is still uncertainty about Osage vowel length.

Oral vowels are long before non-stop consonants and in final stressed position. When they are unstressed in final position, they are always short.

Lengthening of short vowels often occurs in questions.&lt;ref name="Quintero, 2009, p.xvi"&gt;Quintero, 2009, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;
:Example: {{IPA|/ʃkó̃ʃta/}} ‘you want’ becomes {{IPA|[ʃkó̃õʃta]}}?

Long vowels also arise when ð is omitted between identical vowels.&lt;ref name="Quintero, 2009, p.xvi"/&gt;

:Example: ðakʼéwaða ‘be kind to them’ may become ðakʼéwaa.

When e(e) changes to a(a), an immediately preceding c is often replaced by t (thought not always)&lt;ref&gt;Quintero, 2009, p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

:Example: océ 'look for, hunt for' becomes otá 'look for it!'

====Diphthongs====

The vowel sequences {{IPA|/aĩ/}} {{IPA|/eĩ/}} {{IPA|/oĩ/}} and {{IPA|/ai/}} are almost certainly diphthongs. The Osage alphabet has letters to represent each of the diphthongs [[Osage alphabet|(See the Osage Alphabet)]]. Seeing that these four sounds have single unique letters in the orthography system of the language emphasizes how frequent and important they are in the phonology.

===Consonants===

There are thirty-one consonant phonemes in Osage,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; twenty-two of which are voiceless and nine are voiced. However, Osage has a unique system of sounds, which to English speakers might seem very similar but are actually quite distinctive to an Osage native speaker or listener. This system is known as the stop series, or the stop sequence. (See below)

{|class="wikitable IPA"
!colspan=2|
!Bilabial!!Dentalveolar!!Postalveolar!!Velar!!Glottal
|-
!colspan=2|Nasals
|m||n|| || ||

|-
!colspan=2|Fricatives
| ||s, z||ʃ, ʒ||x, ɣ||h
|-
!colspan=2|Approximants
| ||ð, l, (r)|| ||w||
|}

====Stop series====

The stop series is a vital part of Osage phonology. The series can be grouped according to five categories:

*Voiceless preaspirated or fortis: which may be pronounced as geminates or preaspirated. As in other Siouan languages they sometimes derive from h-C sequences, but not always.
*Voiceless plain or lenis: which are tenuis, and often lightly voiced.
*Postaspirated: which never appear as a surface form.&lt;ref name="Quintero, 2004, p.19"&gt;Quintero, 2004, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ejective {{IPA|/p’/, /c’/, /k’/}}. They cannot appear as the second member of a consonant cluster. Historical *t’ is {{IPA|/c’/}} in Osage.&lt;ref&gt;Quintero, 2004, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;
*Voiced: with b being the only member in this category. The only environment this sound may appear in is in the cluster {{IPA|[br]}}. The cluster itself generally appears in the first verb form, otherwise it is somewhat infrequent.&lt;ref name="Quintero, 2004, p.19"/&gt;(see historical phonology section).
The ejective, fortis, and lenis series of the alphabet are not distinguished in Osage orthography.

Listed below is some features and phonological alternations of Osage:

*{{IPA|[px], [tx], [kx]}} occur before back vowels, {{IPA|[pʃ], [tsʰ], [kʃ]}} (usually) before the other vowels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Quintero, 2004, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;
*The voiceless unaspirated affricate {{IPA|/ts/}} has two allophones: {{IPA|[tʃ]}} after {{IPA|[ʃ]}}; elsewhere it is {{IPA|[ts]}}.&lt;ref name="article"/&gt;
:{{IPA|/ts/ → [tʃ]/_[ʃ]}}

:Examples:
::::íðotse 'be open'
::::ihtṍtse 'son-in-law'
::::ðekṍõce 'now'
::::{{IPA|[mɑ̃ʃtʃĩ́kɛ]}} 'rabbit'
::::{{IPA|[ʃtʃɛ́]}} 'you went'

*The glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} appears in clusters only after p, c, k, and it is not considered a true consonant of Osage. It is best thought of as a phonetic device used occasionally at utterance level, and it is typically to separate vowels that would otherwise contract.&lt;ref&gt;Quintero, 2009, p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPA|/x/}} has two allophones, {{IPA|[x]}} and [ɣ]. {{IPA|[ɣ]}} occurs between vowels, elsewhere it is {{IPA|[x]}}.
:{{IPA|/x/ → [ɣ]/V__V}}

:Examples:
::::{{IPA|[hóxpe]}} 'cough'
::::{{IPA|[hpéɣe]}} 'gourd'
::::{{IPA|[nɑ̃́ɑ̃ɣe]}} 'spirit'
::::{{IPA|[hkáɣe]}} 'crow'

*The phoneme {{IPA|/h/}} is always voiceless.
*{{IPA|/ð/}} usually has a single allophone {{IPA|[ð]}}, but in the Hominy dialect it has two allophones: {{IPA|[d]}} initially before {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|[ð]}} elsewhere.&lt;ref name="article"/&gt;
:{{IPA|/ð/ → [d]/#__a}}
 
:Examples:
::::ðɑ̃lĩ {{IPA|[dɑ̃dlĩ]}} 'good'
::::ðɑ̃brĩ {{IPA|[dɑ̃bəðĩ]}} 'three'
::::ðĩe {{IPA|[ðĩɛ]}} 'you'
::::cʼéðe {{IPA|[tsʼɛˑðɛ]}} 'he killed it'

*The {{IPA|/br/}} cluster also depends on dialect. It is sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[bəl]}} or {{IPA|[bər]}}.&lt;ref name="article"/&gt;
*In some instances, due to morphologically complex formations, {{IPA|[r]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/ð/}}&lt;ref name="Quintero, 2004, p.19"/&gt;

:Examples:
:::: {{IPA|brĩiʃtɑ̃}} 'I'm finished'
:::: {{IPA|abrĩ}} 'I have'
:::: {{IPA|waabrṍ}} 'I am unable'
:

The dentalveolar obstruents are often fricated: the ejective always (though it has other sources as well), and the other series before the front vowels {{IPA|/i ĩ e u/}}. Exceptions occur due to compounding and other derivational processes. For example, from ''hką́ą́ce'' 'fruit' and ''oolá'' 'put in' is ''hkąącóla'' 'pie'. (The fricated allophone is written ''c''.)

''Č, hč'' are rare, and only found in diminutives: ''č'' only in two words, ''čóopa'' 'a little', ''čáahpa'' 'squat', and ''hč'' for ''hc'' in endearment forms of kin terms like ''wihčóšpa'' 'my grandchild'. In Hominy, ''šc'' is pronounced ''šč''.

====Consonant clusters====

Osage has a simple expanded CV syllabic template: (C(C)) V (V).&lt;ref&gt;Quintero, 2004, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; All consonants occur initially and medially; they never occur in final position. Consonant clusters of the type CC only occur in initial and medial positions. Furthermore, only voiceless consonants form clusters, with the exception of {{IPA|[br]}}.&lt;ref name="article"/&gt; 
The initial clusters are {{IPA|[pʃ] [kʃ] [ts’] [st] [sts] [sk] [ʃt] [ʃk] [br]}}, excluding aspirated stops.

:
:Examples:
::::          pʃĩta 'I'll come (to your house)'
::::          kʃí 'he reached home'
::::          ʰtséka 'crazy'
::::          stúʒa 'you wash it'
::::          stséce 'long'
::::          skɑ̃ 'white'
::::          ʃtátɑ̃ 'you drank it'
::::          ʃkṍʃta 'you wanted it'
::::          bráze ‘torn’
:
Medial clusters may be divided into two groups:

*Cluster whose first C is p, t, c, or k

:
:Examples:
::::          tapʼõkʼe 'he hit it'
::::          wécʼa 'snake'
::::          nɑ̃ḱṍ 'he heard it'
::::          aṍpha 'I understand it'
::::          áthɑ̃ 'he kicked it'
::::          áððikhɑ̃ 'he lay down'
::::          épʃe 'I spoke'
::::          ðacpé 'to eat'
::::          nĩ́kʃe 'you are here'
::::          nã́kwĩ 'both, we two'
:
*Cluster whose first C is s, ʃ, x, or h
:
:Examples:

::::          ðaxtáke 'to bite'
::::          mõĩ́xka 'soil/dirt'
::::          wĩ́xci 'one'

===Historical phonology===

The historically [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] series *pʰ *tʰ *kʰ is seldom realized with aspiration today. Before back vowels they are {{IPA|[px tx kx]}}, and before front vowels {{IPA|[pʃ tsʰ kʃ]}} (written ''pš ch kš''). Some speakers from Hominy assimilate ''tx'' to {{IPA|[tkx]}} or {{IPA|[kx]}}.

''Đ, n, r'' all derive from historic *r, and ''l'' from *kr and *xr. The latter is a recent phenomenon; in the 1930s words with modern ''l'' were transcribed ''xth'' and ''gth''. Historically *r became ''ð'' before oral vowels and ''n'' before nasal vowels, but since the nasalization has often been lost, there are minimal pairs and {{IPA|/l, n/}} are now separate phonemes. Nonetheless, intervocalic ''ð'' is optionally pronounced {{IPA|[n]}} in many words. It is also sometimes strongly palatalized intervocalically, to the point of becoming {{IPA|[j]}}.

In words with ''l'', this is sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[hl]}} or {{IPA|[dl]}}. The former derives from historic *xl, the latter from *kð and *gð; these sequences have largely merged with simple *l. This is productive; ''ð'' in verbs may become ''l'' when prefixed with ''k''.

The ''r'' is apparently an approximant like English {{IPA|[ɹ]}}. ''Br'' is most common in first-person forms of verbs beginning with ''ð'', where the 1sg agent prefix ''w(a)-'' assimilates to {{IPA|[b]}} before the ''ð'', and indeed this was written ''bth'' in the 1930s. However, in rarer cases the origin of ''br'' is opaque.

'''Pichinglis''', commonly referred to by its speakers as '''''Pichi''''' and formally known as '''Fernando Po Creole English''' (''Fernandino''), is an Atlantic [[English language|English]]-lexicon [[Creole language]] spoken on the island of [[Bioko]], [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It is an offshoot of the [[Krio language]] of [[Sierra Leone]], and was brought to Bioko by [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krios]] who immigrated to the island during the colonial era in the 19th century.

Pichi is the most widely spoken language of the capital [[Malabo]], next to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and it serves as a primary language to probably the majority of the capital’s inhabitants. Pichi is also used as a primary language in a number of villages and towns along the Coast of Bioko – amongst them Sampaca, Fiston, Basupú, Barrio las Palmas and Luba (Morgades 2004), and is spoken as a [[lingua franca]] throughout Bioko. It is also spoken by a sizable community of people originating from Bioko in [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], the largest town on the continental part of the country.

== Size of speaker community ==
Pichi descends from [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Krio]], which first arrived in Bioko, the former Fernando Po, with African settlers from [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]] in 1827 (Fyfe 1962: 165). No official figures exist, but there is good reason to assume that Pichi is today the second most widely spoken African language of the country behind [[Fang language|Fang]], closely followed by [[Bubi language|Bubi]]. It is safe to assume that at least 100,000 people of the country’s population of around one million (2007 UN estimate) use Pichi regularly as a primary or secondary language.

Next to Fang, Pichi and Bubi, over ten other African languages are spoken by the peoples of Equatorial Guinea (Gordon 2005, cf. “Equatorial Guinea”).

One of these is another Creole, the Portuguese-lexicon Creole [[Fá d'Ambô]], spoken by the people of the island of [[Annobón]] (cf. Map 1). Fa d’Ambô shares historical and linguistic ties with the other Portuguese-lexicon Creoles of the Gulf of Guinea (cf. e.g. Post 1994), namely [[Lungwa Santome]] and [[Angolar]] in [[São Tomé Island]] and [[Lun'gwiye]] in [[Principe Island]] (but also cf. Granda 1985 on the influence of Pichi on Fa d’Ambô).

The other languages traditionally spoken in Equatorial Guinea belong to the [[Bantu language|Bantu]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo language family|Niger–Congo]] family. In the literature, Pichi is known under the names Fernando Po Creole English (e.g. Gordon 2005), Fernando Po Krio (e.g. Berry 1970, Holm  1989), Fernandino Creole English (e.g. Holm 1989), Pidgin (English) (Morgades 2004), Broken English (e.g. de Zarco 1938) and Pichinglis (e.g. Lipski 1992). While many older speakers refer to the language as Krio or Pidgin, most present-day speakers refer to it as Pichinglis, Pichin with a nasalised final vowel or Pichi tout court.

== Present status ==
The lexical similarity between Pichi and English and the supposed simplification of English structures that European observers believed to recognise in a language they did not master, lent additional weight to racist notions about a generally assumed superiority of European languages and their speakers. As a consequence, Pichi was considered an impoverished, debased form of English by Spanish colonial administrators and missionaries (cf. Zarco 1938: 5-7 for a pungent exposition of this view). Pichi, like the other Creole languages of the Atlantic Basin, still has to struggle with this difficult legacy. In spite of its great importance as a community language, and as a national and international lingua franca, Pichi enjoys no official recognition nor support, is conspicuously absent from public discourse and the official media, and has no place in the educational policy of Equatorial Guinea.

== Linguistic affiliation ==
Pichi is a member of the African branch of the family of Atlantic English-lexicon Creoles. It descends directly from Krio, the English-lexicon Creole that rose to become the language of the Creole community of Freetown, Sierra Leone in the late 18th century (cf. Huber 1999). Throughout the better part of the 19th century, this community, which had emerged from the horrors of slavery and the slave trade, began to forge a vibrant African-European culture and economy along the West African seaboard (cf. e.g. Fyle 1962; Wyse 1989). Mutual intelligibility within the African branch is quite high. However, an impediment to fluid communication between speakers of Pichi and its sister languages is the divergent path of development of Pichi since 1857. In that year, Spain began to actively enforce colonial rule in Equatorial Guinea. From then onwards, Pichi was cut off from the direct influence of English, the language from which it inherited the largest part of its lexicon. Some of the present-day differences between Pichi and its sister languages can be attributed to internal developments in Pichi. But without doubt, an equally important reason for the separate development of Pichi is the extensive degree of language contact with Spanish, the colonial and present-day official language of Equatorial Guinea.

== Language contact between Pichi and Spanish ==
Spanish has left a deep imprint on the lexicon and grammar of Pichi. Code-mixing is an integral part of the linguistic system of Pichi. The pervasive influence of Spanish on Pichi is for one part, the consequence of language policy. Since colonial rule, Spanish has remained the sole medium of instruction at all levels of the educational system (cf. e.g. Lipski 1991: 35-36). There is a widespread competence in different registers of Spanish by Pichi speakers in Malabo (cf. Lipski 1985, 1992). In Malabo, The acquisition of Spanish begins in early childhood, even for many working-class Equatoguineans with little or no school education. Equally, the burgeoning oil economy of Equatorial Guinea has led to increased urbanisation, extending multi-ethnic social networks and the spread of Pichi as a native language. In such a socio-economic environment and amidst a high general competence in the official language Spanish, code-mixing between Pichi and Spanish, rather than being exceptional, is consciously and confidently articulated in daily life.

=== Some examples of Pichi–Spanish code-mixing ===
Spanish words are in bold in the following Pichi sentences (examples from Yakpo 2009)

Afta ùna bay dì '''bloques ''' dɛ̀n tumara.&lt;br /&gt;
then 2PL buy DEF bricks PL tomorrow&lt;br /&gt;
'Then buy [plural] the bricks tomorrow.'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
À '''raya '''in wèt '''rayador'''.&lt;br /&gt;
1SG.SBJ grate 3SG.EMP with grater&lt;br /&gt;
'I grated it with a grater.' &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
À gò '''sigue''' chɔp.&lt;br /&gt;
1SG.SBJ POT continue eat&lt;br /&gt;
'I'll continue eating.'

== Overview of Pichi grammar ==

Pichi has a seven vowel system featuring the phonemes {{IPA|/i, e, ɛ, a, ɔ, o, u/}}. The consonant phonemes of Pichi are twenty-two: {{IPA|/p, b, t, d, tʃ, dʒ, k, ɡ, f, v, s, ʁ, h, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, l, w, j, kp, ɡb/}}. The co-articulated labiovelar plosives {{IPA|/kp/}} and {{IPA|/ɡb/}} are marginal and only occur in ideophones.&lt;br /&gt;
The language features a mixed prosodic system which employs both pitch-accent and tone. Pichi has two distinctive tones, a high (H) and a low (L) tone. In pitch-accented words, a phonetic (L) tone is the default realisation of a toneless syllable (X). Examples follow with the four possible tonal configurations for bisyllabic words (examples from Yakpo 2009:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Word
! Pitch class
! Gloss
|-
| human
| H.X
| 'woman'
|-
| wàtá
| X.H
| 'water'
|-
| nyɔní
| H.H
| 'ant'
|-
|bàta
|L.L
|'buttocks'
|}

The morphological structure of Pichi is largely isolating. However, there is a limited use of inflectional and derivational morphology in which affixation, tone and suppletive forms are put to use. For example, the categories of tense, modality and aspect are expressed through phonologically distinct preverbal particles. The verb stem is not altered:

Dan awa à '''bìn''' '''dɔn''' '''dè''' slip.&lt;br /&gt;
that hour 1SG.SBJ PST PRF IPFV sleep&lt;br /&gt;
'(At) that time, I was already sleeping.'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Besides that, there is a limited use of inflectional morphology in the pronominal system, in which both tone and suppletive forms are used to express case relations. For example, the dependent subject pronoun à ‘1SG.SBJ’ has the allomorphs mì ‘1SG.POSS’ and mi ‘3SG.EMP’. In the following example, tone alone distinguishes possessive from objective case of the 1SG personal pronoun: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dɛ̀n tif '''mi''' '''mì''' sus.&lt;br /&gt;
3PL steal 1SG.EMP 1SG.POSS shoe&lt;br /&gt;
'They stole my shoes from me.'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pichi is an aspect-prominent language in which aspect (and mood), rather than tense plays a dominant role in expressing temporal relations. Besides that, the modal system includes an indicative-subjunctive opposition. Subjunctive mood is instantiated in the modal complementiser mek ‘SBJV’ and occurs in contexts characterised by the presence of deontic modality, i.e. in directive main clauses such as imperatives and other ‘mands’ as well as in the subordinate clauses of deontic modality inducing main predicates (see the first example below). Subjunctive mood also occurs in purpose clauses (see the second example below):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
È nak dì plet pàn dì tebul bìkɔs è '''want''' '''mek''' dì plet brok.&lt;br /&gt;
3SG.SBJ hit DEF plate on DEF table because 3SG.SBJ want SBJV DEF plate break&lt;br /&gt;
'He hit the plate on the table because he wanted the plate to break.'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dɛ̀n kan kɛr mi nà Madrid '''fɔ̀''' '''mek''' dɛ̀n go opera mi.&lt;br /&gt;
3pl PFV carry 1SG.EMP LOC Madrid ASS SBJV 3pl go operate 1SG.EMP&lt;br /&gt;
‘They took me to Madrid in order to go and operate on me.’&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The language exhibits a subject–verb word order in intransitive clauses and a subject–verb–object order in transitive clauses. Content questions are formed by way of a mixed question-word system which involves transparent (e.g. ''us=tin'' 'which=thing' = 'what') and opaque question elements (''udat'' 'who').

Clause linkage is characterised by a large variety of strategies and forms, in which the subordinator ''we'', the quotative marker ''se'', and the two modal complementisers ''fɔ̀'' and ''mek'' stand out as multifunctional elements with overlapping functions. The language also features various types of multiverb and serial verb constructions. Amongst the latter figure instrumental serial verb constructions involving the verb ''tek'' 'take' as well as comparative constructions featuring the verb ''pas'' '(sur)pass'.

'''Podium sweep''' (or '''clean sweep''') comes from the word [[Whitewash (sport)|sweep]] that is used in 'American' sports such as baseball, basketball and ice hockey. One speaks of a sweep when a team wins all matches of a playoff series. This is the case, for example, with a 4–0 victory in a [[best-of-seven series]].

==Overview==
The term is used nowadays in a broader sense when a country, team or athlete wins all possible prizes in a certain competition, as when a team wins all available medals in a single discipline during a sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/meaning/podium+sweep|title=Meaning of podium sweep - Bangkok Post: Learning English channel - เรียนภาษาอังกฤษจากคำศัพท์ ""|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|website=www.bangkokpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the highest level, that would be when one nation wins all the medals in the [[Olympics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">[[File:Vogala.png|thumb|right|A tenth-century probatio pennae: one of the first known Dutch language fragments ([[Hebban olla vogala]]).]]

'''Probatio pennae''' (also written ''probatio pennę;'' in [[Medieval Latin]]; literally "pen test") is the medieval term for breaking in a new pen, and used to refer to text written to test a newly cut pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A [[scribe]] would normally  test a newly cut pen to see if it wrote well by writing a few lines of text on a piece of [[blotting paper]]. Sometimes these blotting papers survived due to being used afterwards as book binding material; they often provide unique, less "serious" textual material that would otherwise have been lost. A famous example is "[[Hebban olla vogala]]", one of the first fragments of [[Dutch literature]], which survived from a tenth-century ''probatio pennae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology==
The word ''prosponsive'' is a [[portmanteau]] of "proactive", in terms of reaching out to something proactively, and "responsive", in the terms of being proactively responsive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Right Place, Right Time|journal=The Gem of the Southeast: Georgia|date=March 2016|issue=Inbound logistics|pages=75, 78|url=http://resources.inboundlogistics.com/digital/georgia_supplement_digital_0316.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The term can also be used to mean to preempt the need for a change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Usage==
The term was coined by Russell Caudell and Jeff Lantz, the co-founders of C. L. Services, Inc, who aspired to provide high end [[customer satisfaction]] and proactively solve their problems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Power of Prosponsive|last=Russell Caudell, Jeff Lantz|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They registered the term and branded it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The term has caught on to by others and is used to explain initiatives in a business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term refers to the simple fact that, as a business person or a sales person, one should always be the one to initiate calls before the customer expects them to instead of waiting for the customer to call as having to wait and call the person who wants to make the sale would annoy the customer and show him lack of interest on part of the business resulting in loss of good faith.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is noted that once the customer has to call the sales person or the business that wants to sell a product of service, it is already a failure on part of the business that it neglected its obligation to call the customer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A customer would not refer or even buy from such a business which lacks initiative and a proactive approach as lack of proactiveness, to a customer, implies that the same would be the level of the customer service once they make the purchase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Right Place, Right Time|journal=The Gem of the Southeast: Georgia|date=March 2016|issue=Inbound logistics|pages=75, 78|url=http://resources.inboundlogistics.com/digital/georgia_supplement_digital_0316.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Reality Hunger: A Manifesto''''' is a non-fiction book by American writer [[David Shields]], published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] on February 23, 2010. The book is written in a [[collage]] style, mixing quotations by the author with those from a variety of other sources. The book's [[manifesto]] is directed toward increasing art's engagement with the reality of contemporary life through the exploration of hybrid genres such as [[prose poetry]] and literary collage. In ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Elissa Schappell called ''Reality Hunger'' "a rousing call to arms for all artists to reject the laws governing appropriation, obliterate the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, and give rise to a new modern form for a new century."


==Structure==
''Reality Hunger'' consists of 618 numbered passages divided into twenty-six chapters. Approximately half of the book's words come from sources other than the author.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last=Sante |first=Luc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/books/review/Sante-t.html |title=Book Review – 'Reality Hunger – A Manifesto,' by David Shields – Review |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of ''Random House'' lawyers, attribution for the quotes is given in a fine print appendix at the end of the book, but with Shields's encouragement to cut those pages from the book so as to preserve the book's intended disorienting effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shields 2010, p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==
The title of ''Reality Hunger'' comes from Shields's idea that people today, living in an increasingly fragmentary culture, are experiencing a growing "hunger" for doses of real life injected into the art they experience. According to his argument, traditional genres, such as [[realist fiction]], are failing to adequately reflect lived reality because they have gone largely unchanged since their early development, and are therefore obsessed with current events because society rarely experiences any.

The role of plagiarism in art also constitutes a major theme. Shields argues that plagiarism is something that artists have always partaken in, and that only recently has the act acquired the stigma it has, due in large part to copyright legislation and the culture surrounding it. Rather than shy away from wholesale appropriation, Shields encourages it, stating that “reality-based art hijacks its material and doesn’t apologize.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this argument, the work includes a chapter on hip-hop, which, in addition to examining other facets of the genre, discusses the genre's use of [[DJing]], [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], and [[Remix|remixing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shields also discusses, at length, the distinction between memoir and fiction-a distinction that, Shields argues, is mostly imaginary. Because writers of fiction implement a great deal of material directly from their lives, and because writers of memoir must rely on memories that don’t necessarily reflect the truth of what occurred, it would seem absurd to hold the two different kinds of writer to such different standards. “Anything processed by memory is fiction,” Shields writes, indicating that anything written by a writer supposedly doing memoir has necessarily already been fictionalized; thus, determining whether certain events in the book actually happened or not is not the correct way to determine the book's value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal surrounding [[James Frey]]’s [[A Million Little Pieces]] figures largely in one chapter, as Shields argues that Frey's mistake was not lying in his so-called memoir but apologizing about it afterwards. “I’m disappointed not that Frey is a liar but that he isn’t a better one,” Shields writes. “He should have said, ‘Everyone who writes about himself is a liar. I created a person meaner, funnier, more filled with life than I could ever be’. . . Instead, he showed up for his whipping.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shields also places great importance on working in and creating new artistic forms, emphasizing in particular that the boundaries of genre (which he refers to as a “minimum-security prison”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;) should constantly be bent and broken. An entire chapter is devoted to [[collage]] (a genre or "antigenre" of which ''Reality Hunger'' itself is explicitly a member), which Shields praises as “an evolution beyond narrative&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;” because it does not, he argues, reinforce false ideas about the world such as the inevitability of resolution that traditional narrative does: “Story seems to say that everything happens for a reason and I want to say, No, it doesn’t.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shields|2010|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews of ''Reality Hunger'' were generally favorable. Shortly after its release, [[Chuck Klosterman]] tweeted that it ‘‘might be the most intense, thought-accelerating book of the last 10 years.” Luc Sante wrote in the [[New York Times Book Review]] that the book “urgently and succinctly addresses matters that have been in the air, have relentlessly gathered momentum, and have just been waiting for someone to link them together. . . .

The book also evoked a substantial amount of controversy, most of which centered around Shields's claims about the death of the novel and his advocacy of artistic plagiarism. [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] was one of the book's most prominent critics, describing it in his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as "highly problematic" in its “unexamined promotion of what he insists on calling 'reality' over narrative.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood |first=James |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/03/15/100315crat_atlarge_wood?currentPage=2 |title=Chang-Rae Lee's “The Surrendered,” review |publisher=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program''' ('''SPOHP''') is the official [[oral history]] program at the [[University of Florida]]. With over 6,500 interviews and more than 150,000 pages of transcribed material, it is one of the premier oral history programs in the United States. SPOHP's mission is "to gather, preserve, and promote living histories of individuals from all walks of life." The program involves staff, undergraduate and graduate students, and community volunteers in its operation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, [http://oral.history.ufl.edu/about.html "About"], University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oral History Association, [http://www.oralhistory.org/2014/09/04/featured-member-spotlight-the-samuel-proctor-oral-history-program-at-the-university-of-florida/ "Featured Member Spotlight: The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program"], November 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==


The program was founded by Dr. [[Samuel Proctor]] in 1967 as the University of Florida Oral History Program. Its original projects were collections centered around [[Florida history]] with the purpose of preserving eyewitness accounts of economic, social, political, religious and intellectual life in [[Florida]] and the [[South]]. Major projects focused on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[African American]], [[military]], and Florida county-specific history. Much of SPOHP's early work was initiated by grants and support from the [[Doris Duke Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40170355  | year = |author=Kathryn L.

[[File:Dr. Samuel Proctor, with student at the University of Florida Oral History Program in 1980.jpg|thumb|Dr. Samuel Proctor, with a student at the University of Florida Oral History Program in 1980.]]

Dr. Samuel Proctor, the UF Oral History Program's original founder, was a prominent scholar of Florida history and a pioneer in the field of oral history in the United States. Dr. Proctor taught in the History Department at the University of Florida for fifty years, serving as the first official University of Florida Historian and Archivist and holding chairs as Distinguished Service Professor of History and [[Julian C. Yonge]] Professor of History. He was also the Director of the Center for Florida Studies and the History Curator at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, [http://clasnews.clas.ufl.edu/_styles/images/portfolio/newsletters/2005proctormemorial.pdf "Remembering Dr. Samuel Proctor"], University of Florida, October 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Arndorfer, [http://www.gainesville.com/article/20050711/LOCAL/207110320 "'Dean of state history' dies at Gainesville Home"], ''The Gainesville Sun'', July 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Dr. Proctor's tenure, the directorship of the program was taken up by Dr. Julian Pleasants, who renamed the program in Proctor's honor and lead the program from 1996 to 2007. The program's current director is Dr. Paul Ortíz. Dr. Ortíz is an associate professor in the History Department and affiliated faculty with the [http://www.latam.ufl.edu/ Center For Latin American Studies] and [http://afam.clas.ufl.edu/ African American Studies Program] who has also served as the President of the [[Oral History Association]].

==Mission==


The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program strives to promote the thousands of oral narratives entrusted in its care, making existing and emerging collections accessible to a wide audience by uploading transcripts of interviews, maintaining digital archives, creating educational podcasts, and organizing public programs and events. SPOHP also produces a newsletter, featuring new research and student work, that is published each semester.

== Recent Grants and Awards ==


Dr. Paul Ortiz and SPOHP will take part in developing UF undergrad courses on '''Intersections of Global Blackness and Latinx Identity''' through an '''2018 Intersections Research-Into-Teaching Grant''' awarded from the Center for the Humanities and the Public Sphere &amp; Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. This Intersections group will emphasize how popular culture, visual arts, and performance reverberate globally through media consumption to (re)produce Black &amp; Latinx cultures.

== Fieldwork Research Trips ==




'''Remembering Refugees in Jacksonville: Oral Histories of Resettled Refugees:''' Our program has been collecting oral histories of resettled refugees in Jacksonville, Florida, in partnership with World Relief Jacksonville. Our project director Seyeon Hwang has spearheaded the project by documenting and recording the personal stories of refugees who have resettled in Jacksonville both recently and over the past decades. Our team is committed to listening to these stories and having them heard by a broader audience through this project. Every story that has been recorded will be permanently stored in the University of Florida archives.


'''The Latino Diaspora in the Americas Project''' seeks to understand the movements of Latinx peoples and their struggles in Gainesville, the United States, and abroad. LDAP covers a wide range of subject matter, including projects on undocumented students, Hispanic alumni, and Christian communities.
This year, the LDAP team worked with the University to create training programs for administration on undocumented students and built a research platform on La Casita and safe spaces for Latinx students on campus. We presented at several conferences including the Southwest Oral History Association and UF's Social Justice Summit. LDAP also expanded its research into the lives of agricultural workers, Hispanic alumni at UF, and Latinx religious communities in Gainesville.


'''The Seahorse Key Marine Lab Oral History Project''' is preserving the faculty, staff, student, and community memory of UF's history on the island. In 1952, the University of Florida established its marine laboratory on Seahorse Key, part of the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge.  It was convened by a generous grant by the UF Center for the Humanities and the Public Sphere. Join us at the island's open houses or check out our videos on our YouTube channel to view the work products of this grant in person: an informational display banner and video-recorded oral histories.


'''The Poarch Creek Project''' is in its fourth year of working with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Office of Archives and Records Management to process archival audio materials in an effort to document their tribal history and federal recognition effort. This collaboration, originating from an oral history project conducted in the 1970s by Dr. Anthony Paredes, focuses on the audiocassette recordings of Judge Hugh Rozelle, an attorney involved in the tribe's federal recognition efforts. Students participate in conducting archival research, transcribing audio materials, and preservation. In addition, this summer will mark the second consecutive trip to Alabama in which students will conduct oral histories with tribal elders in the community to supplement the archival records of the tribe. This project has produced multiple presentations at the Oral History Association's Annual Meeting and hopes to encourage further student research and projects through podcasts and video presentations.

Eddie Tullis is the Treasurer and former Tribal Chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Atmore, Alabama. Tullis has served as Vice President of the National Congress of American Indians, President of United South and Eastern Tribes (USET), and Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Indian Education. Mr. Tullis' interview during our 2017 fieldwork trip to Alabama renews an oral history collaboration that started with the Poarch Band in the 1970s, and supports our collaboration with Dr. Deidra Dees and the Poarch Creek Office of Archives and Records Management on the Hugh Rozelle Collection.


'''Ottoman Greeks in the United States Project:''' In March 2018, the UF Asian Alumni Association (AAA) hosted a weekend of events for both alumni and current students to attend. SPOHP staff collaborated with the AAA to interview alumni and record their presidential panel event. The Asian American History Project will continue to work with the Association of Asian Alumni to fill gaps in the history of Asian students and student organizations at the University of Florida. These stories shed light on immigration experiences, the creation and growth of student groups, various forms of student activism, the creation of multicultural spaces and supports for students, the struggle to keep Asian language programs, and the development of the Asian American Studies minor at UF.


'''The Tidewater Main Street Project''' is dedicated to documenting the traditions, folklore, and history of the rural communities in the tidewater region of Virginia via student fieldwork and community engagement. This year marks the fifth year SPOHP plans on traveling to Virginia to build upon its 200+ oral history collection, which are available online at ufdc.ufl.edu/tmp. In addition, project coordinators Patrick Daglaris and Dr. Jessica Taylor collaborated with the Southern Foodways Alliance in May to conduct interviews focusing on how local foodways define and affect rural communities throughout the tidewater region. This project has produced student video productions and podcasts, presentations for the Oral History Association's Annual Meeting, photo essays, and would not be successful without extensive support and collaboration with several public history organizations in Virginia. Students of the Virginia Tidewater Project brought together the stories of men who fish, crab, oyster, clam, and conch for a livelihood and as a calling in Mathews and Middlesex Counties, Virginia. 


'''The Mississippi Freedom Project (MFP)''' was established in 2008 to give students the opportunity to engage in oral history research that centers on activism and the civil rights movement. The project archive contains more than 200 interviews that tell the stories of activists and organizers in the Mississippi Delta and other parts of the South. In 2014, SPOHP published "I Will Never Forget," an edited volume that was compiled by MFP coordinator Sarah Blanc, to commemorate the project. Each year, SPOHP organizes an MFP panel to share stories and fieldwork experiences from each year's MFP trip. This year's MFP trip is scheduled to begin on July 15th and end on July 22nd. Students on this year's trip will have the opportunity to visit the newly opened Equal Justice Initiative Legacy Museum and Lynching Memorial in Montgomery Alabama. As with all MFP trips, this year's trip will give students the opportunity to meet numerous social activists that have done tremendous work to advance racial equity in this nation.

Ms. Margaret Block was a lifelong civil rights activist, teacher, and friend. Her efforts to organize, agitate, and educate for social justice inspired men and women across the country to work together for freedom in America, including students of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program's Mississippi Freedom Project, whom she led for many years.

In Summer 2013, UF's [[George A. Smathers Libraries]] approved a mini-grant proposal to transcribe the SPOHP's Mississippi Freedom Project collection. The completion of this project was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer during the summer of 2014, when SPOHP presented the completed transcripts to veterans of the Mississippi Freedom Summer at their 50th anniversary reunion. This processing project leveraged existing knowledge, resources, and partnerships to promote online access to the Mississippi Freedom Project collection, including the development of a Freedom Summer LibGuide, two new podcasts, and a second phase which involves continuing transcription, Google Optimization of transcripts, and expanded Mississippi Freedom Project content on SPOHP's website.&lt;ref&gt;Bess de Farber, Dr. Paul Ortíz, Jana Ronan, Barbara Hood, [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00019512/00001 Mississippi Freedom Project Interviews to be Available on University of Florida Digital Collections for MLK Celebration, Freedom Summer Anniversary], University of Florida Digital Collections, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==


SPOHP is continuously engaged in active research projects designed to broaden the scope and scale of its collections, using contributions from undergraduate and graduate students as well as trained volunteers. SPOHP's collections house more than 6,500 oral history interviews on hundreds of different topics. The program also transcribes a portion of its interviews, which are available at the [[University of Florida Digital Collections]] online [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/oral Samuel Proctor Oral History Program Digital Collection] archive.&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida Digital Collections, {{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/ |title=UFDC Home - All Collection Groups |publisher=Ufdc.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Veterans History Project'''

In 2000, SPOHP was approached by the [[Library of Congress]] to assist in efforts with collecting oral history interviews of World War II veterans. Since that time, SPOHP has been conducting interviews for the Library's [https://www.loc.gov/vets/ Veterans History Project], which is a project of its [[American Folklife Center]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida News, {{cite web |url=http://news.ufl.edu/2010/11/08/vet-history/ |title=UF to collaborate with Library of Congress on veterans' oral histories &amp;#124; University of Florida News |publisher=News.ufl.edu |date=2010-11-08 |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205130857/http://news.ufl.edu/2010/11/08/vet-history/ |archivedate=2010-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, {{cite web |url=http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/vhp/vhp-mission-and-staff/ |title=SPOHP's Veterans History Project |publisher=Oral.history.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414115331/http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/vhp/vhp-mission-and-staff/ |archivedate=2014-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Smith, a longtime SPOHP volunteer, is the project director.

The Veterans History Project obtained 45 new oral histories since June 2017. The highest number continues to be from the WWII era with continued interest from students, volunteers, and the public. Additional interviews came from the Vietnam War, Korean Conflict, and Iraq. In February 2018, a public program was presented in the Ocora of Pugh Hall to commemorate the fifty-year anniversary of the Tet Offensive. A panel of speakers presented to a generous crowd with active discussion following the initial remarks.

Transcription and the finalization of oral histories continues on the entire collection by volunteers and students. Our collaboration with the Library of Congress and Matheson Museum continues.
In September 2016, the UF Oral History Program conducted an interview with the late Marine Veteran Mr. Ernest Sneed in Monticello, Florida. His story is preserved in the SPOHP archives and available in the video below.

'''African American History Project'''

SPOHP's [https://web.archive.org/web/20140413162904/http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/aahp/aahp-mission/ African American History Project] (AAHP) began in January 2010 with the mission of collecting 400 interviews on local [[African American history]], giving particular attention to narratives on segregation under [[Jim Crow]], as well as [[Racial integration|integration]] and [[Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida News, {{cite web |url=http://news.ufl.edu/2010/01/14/provost-grant/ |title=UF awards $150,000 grant to preserve oral histories of local African-Americans &amp;#124; University of Florida News |publisher=News.ufl.edu |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813170839/http://news.ufl.edu/2010/01/14/provost-grant/ |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally conceived as the [[Alachua County]] African American History Project, AAHP quickly expanded into other parts of North and Central Florida, and now contains over 300 interviews with elders, leaders, activists, and other community members. A list of themes in the collection include: pre-integration [[black high schools]] and their contemporary legacies and significance; previously silenced narratives of racially motivated violence and repression; the quotidian socio-economics of providing for families and maintaining communities under Jim Crow; and the conflicted history of the University of Florida's interactions with and influence on local African American communities.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, [http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/aahp/aahp-mission/ African American History Project Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413162904/http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/aahp/aahp-mission/ |date=2014-04-13 }}, University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Ensley, [http://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/columnists/ensley/2014/10/28/gerald-ensley-still-making-world-better/18052187/ John Due, still making the world a better place], ''Tallahassee Democrat'', October 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The Art of Aging Project''' was co-founded by SPOHP and partners in the College of Medicine in September 2017 to advance good communication skills in medical education. As part of the Geriatrics Clerkship rotation for fourth-year MD students, a core goal of the collaboration is to help future clinicians see older adults in their full personhood. Each month, students receive training in the methods of oral history from SPOHP staff and volunteers; interview a narrator who has been recruited through community partners like the Oak Hammock retirement community and the Community Coalition for Older Adults; and present to colleagues a vignette of their interview along with their impressions of the process. Since the project began, 101 students have interviewed 52 narrators. A clip featuring AOAP interview highlights was shared with 2018 College of Medicine graduates. Initial findings from the collaboration were presented at the 2018 International Health Humanities Consortium Conference at Stanford University.


'''The Florida Queer History Project''' presented a symposia session titled, "Queer in the Capitals," joined by South African Fulbrightscholar Mandisa Haarhoff, at the UF Social Justice Summit in January 2018. The presentation shared the panelists' intersectional research from Pride weekend in Washington, D.C. as well as the politics of Pride in South Africa. In March 2018, FQH led a fieldwork trip with UF students to document the March for Our Lives in Orlando, Florida. SPOHP coordinator Robert Baez interviewed organizers with Gays Against Guns, in addition to Pulse shooting survivors Kate Maini, Brian Wood, and Tommy Connelly. FQH coordinator Holland Hall performed in the play, Voices from the March, at several conferences both at UF and at the Southwest Oral History Association Annual Conference at California State, Fullerton. Holland incorporated contemporary queer issues through sharing her personal narrative regarding queer identity in the play. In June 2017 student researchers from the Florida Queer History Project attended Capital Pride, an annual LGBT pride festival held in early June each year in Washington, D.C., as well as the No Justice No Pride protest of Capital Pride and the Equality March for Unity and Pride (EMUP),


'''The Latino Diaspora in the Americas Project''' seeks to understand the movements of Latinx peoples and their struggles in Gainesville, the United States, and abroad. LDAP covers a wide range of subject matter, including projects on undocumented students, Hispanic alumni, and Christian communities.
This year, the LDAP team worked with the University to create training programs for administration on undocumented students and built a research platform on La Casita and safe spaces for Latinx students on campus. We presented at several conferences including the Southwest Oral History Association and UF's Social Justice Summit. LDAP also expanded its research into the lives of agricultural workers, Hispanic alumni at UF, and Latinx religious communities in Gainesville.


'''The History of the Jewish Community in El Salvador''' documents the community-building efforts of Jewish immigrants to El Salvador, some arriving in the 1920s and starting coffee plantations, and many more after fleeing the Nazi occupation during WWII. Many members of the community then left El Salvador in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to the civil war. The collection began in 1981 when Lea Freund, a member of the community, interviewed some of her family members and friends in the parts of South Florida that they had immigrated to. It was then substantially expanded when Jessica Alpert, whose grandmother had lived in the community, received a Fulbright grant to interview community members who were now geographically scattered; she traveled to San Salvador, Miami, Maryland, Israel, and parts of Europe to conduct the interviews and trace out the interconnections of family and heritage in this small and tight-knit community, as well as being able to record voices from the Jewish community's efforts in San Salvador to convert new members so that it is able to carry on into the future. The interviews are primarily in English or Spanish, but variously also contain phrases and statements in French, German, and Hebrew. This year, SPOHP expects to finally complete the transcription of the History of the Jewish Community in El Salvador project, through a collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Jefferson of the UF Judaica Library. 

== Events and Public Programs ==


Since 2018, SPOHP has transcribed and processed a substantial number of oral history interviews within the African American History Project (AAHP). This summer, we are finalizing the transcriptions to be ready for their public unveiling at the inaugural symposium on March 21-23rd, 2019. The symposium, entitled, '''From Segregation to Black Lives Matter''' will feature this collection, which holds over six hundred oral history interviews.

In January, our original play '''Voices from the March''' headlined the 2018 UF Social Justice Summit. We were joined by actors from the UF College of the Arts to present the play, which was collaboratively written by SPOHP staff and Fall 2017 interns and directed by SPOHP visiting scholar, Jeffrey Pufahl. The play combines the experiences of the SPOHP staff who traveled to the presidential inauguration and Women's March on Washington in January 2017, and the perspectives of SPOHP interns who not only shared their personal narratives, but also incorporated archival research to feature interviews the research team collected in D.C. 

SPOHP regularly develops documentaries, podcasts, and other audio selections to highlight interviews in its collections.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, {{cite web|url=http://oral.history.ufl.edu/podcast.html |title=SPOHP Proctor Podcasts |publisher=Oral.history.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wuft.org/news/topics/samuel-proctor-oral-history-program/ |title=Samuel Proctor Oral History Program &amp;#124; WUFT News |publisher=Wuft.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314183347/http://www.wuft.org/news/topics/samuel-proctor-oral-history-program/ |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SPOHP's archives also contains a variety of different sound files, including University of Florida speeches, videotapes of television interviews, Native American slides and photos, and recordings of music.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, [http://oral.history.ufl.edu/about.html About], University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral History and Academic Study at UF==


SPOHP promotes the craft and intellectual traditions of oral history through university seminars, classes, and community-based workshops. SPOHP offers an internship class for 12-16 undergraduate students each semester, involving training in oral history practices and fieldwork experience, and also operates a program for volunteers on a rotating semester basis. The program consults on an ongoing basis with local historians, civic leaders, and educators across the country interested in initiating oral history projects in their towns and municipalities.

'''Intro to Oral History:''' This Summer B Semester Ph.D. Candidate Matt Simmons is teaching the Introduction to Oral History seminar. This course explores Florida's unique agricultural history, focusing on the experiences of farmworkers in Florida's fields. The class will interview current and former Latinx and African American Florida farmworkers through a partnership with the Farmworkers’ Association of Florida (FWAF), an organization which advocates on behalf of agricultural workers in central Florida. Conducting these oral history interviews will give students the opportunity to interrogate the lived experiences of these men and women and to better understand what it means to be a worker in the agricultural industry and to understand the intersection of class, race/ethnicity, and gender in this work environment. Through these interviews students will have the opportunity to also explore issues of environmental sustainability and the impact of pesticides and genetically modified crops on humans and the environment.

'''Trinidad Study Abroad Program:''' In the summer of 2017, SPOHP staff members traveled to the University of the West Indies St. Augustine in Trinidad to lay the groundwork for a study abroad program that incorporates guest lectures, oral history interviews, collaboration with local institutions, and excursions to heritage sites around the country. They met with professors, archivists, and other stakeholders to build the network of contacts necessary for successful oral history fieldwork. Students in the UF in Trinidad and Tobago 2019 program will have the opportunity to participate in Emancipation Day celebrations and interview the leaders who helped Emancipation Day become an official holiday in Trinidad. These interviews will not only become part of archives at UF, but will also be shared with the libraries at the University of the West Indies St. Augustine and the National Archives of Trinidad and Tobago. In addition to planning immersive student experiences, SPOHP staff are committed to finding ways to make the program accessible to as many students as possible.

'''Oral History Internship:''' SPOHP started recording interviews with people involved in the punk scene, prioritizing the voices of women, people of color, and queer punks who have always been part of the scene but are not always visible in popular representations of it. We are also making an effort not only to interview band members, but also general show-goers, zine makers, venue operators, and anyone else willing to share some of their experiences. This fall, our internship will add to and further process this collection, and also start creating things like podcasts and zines to share these stories and shed more light on how people can successfully create spaces of creative resistance, and what kinds of potential they offer for inclusivity and empowerment.

'''BA/MA 4+1 Combined Degree Program:''' In October 2013, the UF [http://history.ufl.edu/ History Department] announced a new [http://history.ufl.edu/undergraduate-studies/41-program/oral-history/ combined Bachelor's and Master's Degree Program] in oral history. The program, open to students working in any field of modern history, is designed to train students in oral history practice to make history accessible to a broad audience and connect scholars and departments to their local communities. The track opened to students in Spring 2014.&lt;ref&gt;History Department, [http://history.ufl.edu/undergraduate-studies/41-program/oral-history/ 4+1 Program in Oral History], University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sitaram Lalas''' (25 November 1912 - December 1986) (known as Sita Ramji maadsaab) was a [[linguist]] and [[lexicographer]] of [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhushan|first1=Ravi|title=Reference India: biographical notes on men &amp; women of achievement of today &amp; tomorrow|date=1992|publisher=Rifacimento International|location=New Delhi|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indian Newsmagazine, Volume 30, Part 1|journal=Indian Newsmagazine|date=1987|volume=30|issue=1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He produced a written dictionary of the local [[Rajasthani language]]- first ever in the language with name: Rajasthani Shabd (Sabada) Kosh and  Rajasthani Hindi Brihad Kosha. This perhaps is one of the voluminous dictionaries of the world consisting of more than {{formatnum:200000}} words. The dictionary  contains not only the meanings but the origin, synonyms, idioms and phrases based upon each word. It is named Rajasthani Bhasha-sahitya evam Vyakarana and was first published in 1962.The volume was acclaimed as a significant academic work by national and international scholars. The volume included two hundred thousand (200,000) words.

Dr Sitaram Lalas devoted 40 years in the compilation of this outstanding work and was awarded [[Padma Shri]] in 1977 for his contribution. He was also awarded honorary doctorate by [[Jai Narain Vyas University]] (Jodhpur University). Dr Lalas was also known for his excellent knowledge of Ayurveda besides being remembered as a great teacher. Dr Sita Ram Lalas was from [[Charan]] community.

Dr. Sitaram Lalas was rightly called promoter of Rajasthani language and was given due honour and respect as grammarian and lexicographer of yester years like Panini, Patanjali and Dr. Johnson. Scholars like W.S. Allen and Bhagwat Sharan Upadhaya have termed Dr. Sitaram Lalas' work as unprecedented and revolutionary. Though Dr. Lalas was a modest school teacher, by way of his commitment, sincerity and devotion, he presented a unique example – compiling a comprehensive dictionary of the Rajasthani language comprising nine volumes and an abridged dictionary. Apart from this, his other publications include – work on Rajasthani grammar,history of Rajasthani language and literature. He edited a dozen of Rajasthani classics.

Dr. Lalas' extensive and sincere work has administered a life-giving dose of renaissance to the Rajasthani language. [[Jai Narain Vyas University]] (Jodhpur University) conferred upon him, honorary degree of the doctor of literature in recognition to his work. The president of India honoured Dr. Lalas with [[Padma Shri]], fourth highest civilian award in the Republic of India. Sahitya Academy Sangam honoured Dr. Lalas with Manishee award. Some of the key highlights of his life and work are as below:-

# The literary ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur) 'Maharaja Mansigh' (1803–1843), honoured 61 [[Charan]] poets by giving them "The Hathi Siropao" (Haathi Siripao) (Refer Note a.). Navalji Lalas (1787–1832) of Judia Village, known as [[Voltaire]] of Marwar was one of them.  On account of this honour Navalji was presented SANSAN (Tax free fief) (Refer Note b.) village Narava 34&amp;nbsp;km north west of Jodhpur.  Generation of Navalji included Peerdanji, Harudanji and Hathiramji. Dr. Lalas was born on 29 December 1908, to Hathiramji and Jawahar Bai (daughter of Sadulji Bogsa and Singaran Bai of village Sarvari Charnan).
# When Hathi Ramji died, Sitaram was only two and a half years. His maternal grand father, Sadul Danji Bogsa (1833–1916), a prominent scholar and poet of Rajasthani, took the task of Sita Ram's education. After Sadul Danji died, Sita Ram stayed in his village and sometimes in Sarvari, the village of his mother.  He took his education in grammar and arithmetic from Amtuji Shreemali of village Khandap. Meanwhile, he also learned [[Dingal]] geet, an art of old Rajasthani poetry stanzas, from elderly persons of village Sarvari. His inclination towards [[Dingal]] stanzas and poetic compositions grew after coming in contact with Panna Ramji Maharaj, an elderly scholar. He also learned the culture and history from his maternal grand mother (maasa) – Singara Bai. Note – [[Dingal]] geet (stanzas) are peculiar style of old Rajasthani classical poetry.
# At the age of 16, having completed his formal school education, Sitaramji came to the town of [[Jodhpur]], on advice of Panna Ramji Maharaj and stayed in [[Charan]] hostel. His educational expenses were borne by an elderly businessman of Sarvari village.  The manager of the hostel Gulab Chand Churamani, was kind to him, where by he got admission in Rajmahal School, from where he passed his special eighth class, from Marwar Middle board with excellency and double promotion.
# In 1928, he became a teacher in Chainpura School ([[Mandore]], Jodhpur), while still continuing with his studies. He got his education of [[Sanskrit]] and grammar from Pandit Bhagwati Lalji Shastri, and Pandit Somendra, a visually challenged scholar.
# In 1930, he was posted to Vidyashala for School Teacher's Training. After the training, he was appointed in Bagar school, [[Jodhpur]] in 1931. During this period, he came in contact with Shri [[Kesari Singh Barahath]], a freedom fighter, and his brother Kishore Singh Brahaspatya, whom he supported with zeal and enthusiasm.
# During these days, he came in contact with the Rajasthani poet Amritlalji Mathur. Through him, he came in contact with the library superintendent of [[Jaipur]] state Pandit Hari Narayanji Purohit (Pareekh). With inspiration from Hari Narayanji Purohit, he started work related to [[Rajasthani literature]] and history for [[Nagari Pracharini Sabha]], [[Benaras]].
# In 1931 he edited the book 'Virad Shrigar' which was an abridged edition of the book 'Suraj Prakash'. This book is in poetic form and highlights the victory achievements of Maharaja Abhay Singh of [[Marwar]] in war against Sarbuland Khan of [[Gujarat]].
# Purohit Hari Narayanji gave Sitaram an old Rajasthani dictionary "Nam Mala". After studying it, Sitaram in his letter to Hari Narayanji, dated 4 April 1932 observed – "The dictionary is not useful in modern times."Purohitji took remark seriously and rebuked young Sitaram. In his letter Purohitji asked Sitaram to first compile a dictionary and then criticise. This stern advice from the old man pierced Sitaram's heart, and this proved a turning point in the creation of modern Rajasthani language dictionary.
# From 1937 to 1940, while living in [[Bilara]], he came in contact with he Diwan – Hari Singh ji, and was able to study the manuscripts of Aaimata Temple library, which was based in an underground. Once as he was reading the manuscripts, he fell down some 45 feet from the stairs and suffered brain haemorrhage and went into coma. With the help of Diwan Hari Singhji he was taken to [[Jodhpur]], and after long treatment, and with the help of his friend Ladhu Ramji Maharaj, he was able to work again.
# In 1937 he won a legal case against an obscene book. Due to this the writer of the book so called monk poised him, but he survived after the treatment.
# During his stay in [[Bilara]], in 1939 Sitaram wrote a brief history of Aai Mata – the goddess of Seervi caste. He also coordinated with Shiv Singh Choyal – a Seervi leader and opened a school for educating people with poor economic background. He also assisted in editing voluminous books of kashi [[Nagari Pracharini Sabha]], apart from editing the 'Haala Jhala Ra Kundaliyan' and 'Banki Das Granthawali'. He also coordinated with Kishore Singh Brahaspatya – younger brother of the freedom fighter [[Kesari Singh Barahath]], to edit an important [[Dingal]] book 'Hariras' of Barahath (Barath) Isar Das in 1938.
# In 1941, when Sitaram got his transfer to [[Mathania]], he gained a lot of literary knowledge after coming in contact with Panaramji Maharaj. Sitaram had discussion with Panaramji related to [[Dingal]] vocabulary during the latter's stay from 1941 to 1944.
# Sanskrit Society Ayodhya conferred upon him the degree of 'Sahitya Bhushan' in 1945, for his knowledge of [[Sanskrit]] literature and language.
# During this time Akhil Rajasthani Bhasha Sammelan was convened, under the chairmanship of [[Jai Narayan Vyas]]. Sitaramji was nominated the executive vice-president of the convention.
# In 1945 he edited Barahath (Barath) Laldan's book 'Shivdan Sujas Roopak'. This book contains poetic description of war against 'Talpuria [[Talpur]] of Sindh ([[Umerkot]])' by the Jodhpur Army under commander Shivdan Singh Rathore in 1783, in which he was a victorious martyr. This was during the time of Maharaja Vijay Singhji of Jodhpur [[Rulers of Marwar]].
# In 1946, he edited a book 'Prem Singh Roopak' by Gaadan Pratapji. The book in poetry form highlights the war achievements of Thakur Prem Singh of village Ladie in war against mutiny of Vishan Singh Meratia. This was in the Kingdom of Maharaja Takhat Singhji of Jodhpur.[[Rulers of Marwar]]
# During 1941–44, he completed his task of model Rajasthani Dictionary containing approximately fifty five thousand words. Due to the death of Purohit Hari Narayanji, in 1945, the dictionary could not be published.
# During 1946–47, he was terminated from Government Service on the charge of involvement in freedom movement and close contact with freedom fighters, but he was reinstated after the independence.
# In 1953, he forwarded a sixty five thousand word list to Sardul Rajasthani Research Institute Bikaner for publication, but publication could not be arranged.
# In 1954, on the advice of W.S. Allen, professor of [[Philology]], [[University of Cambridge]], he completed the first standard Rajasthani Grammar Book.
# After the establishment of the [[Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute]]by the Government in Jodhpur, Sitaram came in contact with Manishi [[Muni Jinvijayji]] and undertook the work of editing the book 'Granth Raghunath Roopak' – with [[Dingal]] (old Rajasthani stanzas) of Kishna Adha in 1959.

"'''The Birds and the Bees'''" is an [[English language|English-language]] [[idiom|idiomatic expression]] and [[euphemism]] that refers to [[courtship]] and [[sexual intercourse]]. The "Birds and the Bees talk" (sometimes known simply as "The Talk"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boynton|first1=Petra|title=How to talk about the 'birds and bees' with your child in the 21st century|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10291383/Sex-education-How-to-talk-about-the-birds-and-bees-with-your-child-in-the-21st-century.html|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Susan|title=Birds and Bees: Tips for Having ‘The Talk’ With Kids|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2011/09/22/birds-and-bees-tips-for-having-the-talk-with-kids-2/|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=[[ABC News]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is generally the event in most children's lives in which the parents explain what sexual relationships are.

According to tradition, the birds and the bees is a metaphorical story sometimes told to children in an attempt to explain the mechanics and good consequences of sexual intercourse through reference to easily observed natural events. For instance, bees carry and deposit pollen into flowers, a visible and easy-to-explain parallel to male [[fertilisation]]. Another example, birds lay eggs, a similarly visible and easy-to-explain parallel to female [[ovulation]].

The bees are stirring—birds are on the wing ... and I the while, the sole unbusy thing, not honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Samuel Taylor |last= Coleridge |date= February 21, 1825 |url= http://poetry.eserver.org/work.html |title= Work without Hope |work= EServer |publisher= Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even earlier instances of this idiomatic expression appear in the [[Cavalier poet]], [[Thomas Carew]]'s work, "The Spring" (c.1640), in which Carew uses earth and its change of seasons as a metaphorical depiction of women and their sensuality (The Norton Anthology of English Literature 1696).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Norton Anthology of English Literature |edition= 6th |volume= vol. 1 |location= New York |publisher= W.W. Norton &amp; Company |date= 1993 |page= 1696}}&lt;/ref&gt; To abet his ends, Carew alludes to the "birds and the bees" in lines 7-8 with the use of "swallow", "cuckoo", and "humble-bee" as seen here (lines included are 5-8): "But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth/And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth/To the dead ''swallow''; wakes in hollow tree/The drowsy ''cuckoo'' and the ''humble-bee''/Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring" (emphasis added; lines 5-9 from "The Spring").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Vincent |editor-first= Arthur |title= The Poems of Thomas Carew |location= London |publisher= George Routledge &amp; Sons |date= n.d. |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Emma Frances Angell Drake (b. 1849) wrote a section of a publication called ''The Story of Life'' which was published in 1909. This piece was later picked up and included in Safe Counsel, a product of the [[Eugenics]] movement in the late 19th and early 20th century. The author tells her daughters "when you discovered the tiny blue eggs in the robin's nest and I told you that wrapped in each shell was a baby robin that was growing there, kept warm by the mamma bird..." the narrative continues on in vague terms without actually describing sexual intercourse. Later she describes the father's role in reproduction like this; "Sometimes it is the wind which blows the pollen dust from one plant to the other, and sometimes it is the bees gathering honey from the flowers. As they suck the honey from the blossoms some of the plant dust sticks to their legs and bodies, and as they go to another plant in search of sweets this is rubbed off and so the parts of the father and mother plant get together and the seed is made fertile." Safe counsel was reprinted at least 40 times from 1893 through 1930 and may have been widely enough repeated to have contributed to the euphemism, "the birds and the bees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= The Story of Life |first1= Ozora S. |last1= Davis |first2= Emma F.A. |last2=Drake |title= Safe Counsel or Practical Eugenics |editor1-last= Jeffries |editor1-first= B.G. |editor2-last= Nichols |editor2-first= J.L. |editor3-first= Emma F.A. |editor3-last= Drake |editor4-first= Ozora Stearns |editor4-last= Davis |last-author-amp=yes |edition= 40th |year= 1930 |location= Naperville, IL |publisher= J.L.

'''Maskoy''', or '''Toba-Maskoy''', is one of several languages of the Paraguayan [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] (Particularly in the northern region of Paraguay) called ''[[Toba people|Toba]]''. It is spoken on a reservation near [[Puerto Victoria]]. Toba-Maskoy is currently a threatened language at risk of becoming an extinct language, due to the low number of native speakers.

== History ==
Toba-Maskoy was derived from Paraguay, specifically in the Chaco region of the Alto Paraguay department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gynan|first=S.N.|date=2001|title=Language Planning and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=__RCYFbzA0IC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=toba+maskoy&amp;ots=qTbmqLz9CB&amp;sig=legdmbS9NqTAnG9ERCDfkU67Zfg#v=onepage&amp;q=toba%20maskoy&amp;f=false|journal=Google Scholar|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==
Toba-Maskoy is spoken near Puerto Victoria, in the north of Paraguay.

=== Official Status ===
Though Toba-Maskoy is not the official language of Paraguay, it has a special well known status in the northern part of El Chaco.

=== Dialects/Varieties ===
Toba Maskoy is one of the five members of the Maskoy linguistic family, the other four include: Angaite, Enxet, Kaskiha, and Sanapan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braunstein|first=J|date=1999|title=Peoples of the Gran Chaco|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9LVFTUxjt7IC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=toba+maskoy&amp;ots=QuagTcMa6J&amp;sig=TK3PbFEN67ESbG1PcAKKpQJxXIg#v=onepage&amp;q=toba%20maskoy&amp;f=false|journal=Google Scholar|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that around 1870 some Toba chiefs immigrated from Argentina escaping constant victimization of their peoples, thus settling in Alto Paraguay. Since that transitional period, the language suffered both linguistically and culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durante|first=Santiago|date=2011|title=Las lenguas del Gran Chaco: Situación socio-lingüística y políticas lingüísticas|url=|journal=Google Scholar|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day it is rare to find grammar or writings in Toba-Maskoy due to a significant loss in the linguistic elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">The '''Todhri alphabet''' is an 18th-century Albanian alphabet invented for writing the [[Albanian language]] by Dhaskal Todhri (born [[Theodor Haxhifilipi|Theodor (Todhri) Haxhifilipi]]).&lt;ref name="Pollo1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefanaq Pollo|title=Historia e Shqipërisë: Vitet 30 të shek. XIX-1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4i4AAAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë, Instituti i Historisë|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a complex writing system of fifty-two characters which was used sporadically for written communication in and around [[Elbasan]] from the late eighteenth century on. The Todhri alphabet was discovered in Elbasan by [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] (1811–1869) who published it in 1854 his work Albanesische Studien in [[Jena]].&lt;ref name="Hahn2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Georg Hahn|title=The Discovery of Albania: Travel Writing and Anthropology in the Nineteenth Century Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2U7WCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=30 May 2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=8|isbn=9781784532925}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it to be 'the original' Albanian alphabet and a derivative of ancient [[Phoenician script]]. [[Leopold Geitler]] (1847–1885) and [[Slovenians|Slovenian]] scholar [[Rajko Nahtigal]] (1877–1958) subsequently studied the alphabet, concluding that it was derived primarily from the [[Roman cursive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript (Anonimi i Elbasanit), 1761, and the struggle for an original Albanian alphabet|url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A1995ElbasanMs_Fig.pdf|website=elsie.de|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest existing text in Todhri's script is '''Radhua Hesapesh''' ([[Bookkeeping#Daybooks|daybook]]) of a local merchant partnership known as Jakov Popa i Vogël dhe Shokët (Jakov Popa Junior and Friends). The entries in Todhri's script start on 10 August 1795 and continue until 1797.&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1976"&gt;{{citation| author=Dhimiter Shuteriqi| page=140|location = Tirana| year=1976| oclc=252881121 | publisher= Academy of Sciences of PR of Albania| title=Shkrimet Shqipe ne Vitet 1332-1850}}&lt;/ref&gt;
