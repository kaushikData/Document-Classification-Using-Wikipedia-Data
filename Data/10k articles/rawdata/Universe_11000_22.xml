The '''2000-watt society''' is an environmental vision, first introduced in 1998 by the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich]] (ETH Zurich), which pictures the average [[First World]] citizen reducing their overall average [[primary energy]] usage to no more than 2,000 [[watt]]s (i.e. 2 [[Watt-hour|kilowatt-hours]] per hour or 48 kWh per day) by the year 2050, without lowering their [[standard of living]].

The concept addresses not only personal or household energy use, but the total for the whole society, including [[embodied energy]], divided by the population.

Two thousand watts is approximately the current world average rate of total primary energy use. This compares to averages of around 6,000 watts in [[western Europe]], 12,000 watts in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novatlantis.ch/pdf/leichterleben_eng.pdf |title=Smarter Living |publisher=2000 watt society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040640/http://www.novatlantis.ch/pdf/leichterleben_eng.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,500 watts in [[China]], 1,000 watts in India, 500 watts in South Africa and only 300 watts in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="kol_2008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Kolbert (Journalist) |title=The Island in the Wind |publisher=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/07/080707fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |accessdate=2008-12-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219184431/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/07/080707fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |archivedate=19 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland itself, currently using an average of around 5,000 watts, was last a 2000-watt society in the 1960s.

It is further envisaged that the use of [[fossil fuel|carbon-based fuel]]s would be ultimately cut to no more than 500 watts per person within 50 to 100 years.

The vision was developed in response to concerns about [[climate change]], [[energy security]], and the future availability of energy supplies. It is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/forschungnetze/01223/index.html?lang=en|title=Federal government energy research|date=January 16, 2008|accessdate=17 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224105623/http://www.bfe.admin.ch/forschungnetze/01223/index.html?lang=en|archivedate=24 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Association of Swiss Architects and Engineers, and other bodies.

==Implications==
Researchers in Switzerland believe that this vision is achievable, despite a projected 65% increase in economic growth by 2050, by using new low-carbon technologies and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jochem |title=Steps towards a sustainable development. A white book for R &amp; D of energy-efficient technologies |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=2004 |url=http://www.2000watt.ch/data/downloads/Weissbuch.pdf |accessdate=10 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312011359/http://www.2000watt.ch/data/downloads/Weissbuch.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2012&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is envisaged that achieving the aim of a 2000-watt society will require, amongst other measures, a complete reinvestment in the country's capital assets; refurbishment of the nation's building stock to bring it up to [[low energy building|low-energy building]] standards; significant improvements in the efficiency of [[road transport]], [[aviation]] and energy-intensive material use; the possible introduction of high-speed [[maglev train]]s; the use of [[renewable energy]] sources, [[district heating]], [[microgeneration]] and related technologies; and a refocusing of research into new priority areas.

As a result of the intensified research and development effort required, it is hoped that Switzerland will become a leader in the technologies involved. Indeed, the idea has a great deal of government backing, due to fears about climate change.

==Basel pilot region==
Launched in 2001 and located in the metropolitan area of [[Basel]], 'Pilot Region Basel'  aims to  develop and commercialise some of the technologies involved. The pilot is a partnership between industry, universities, research institutes and the authorities, coordinated by [[Novatlantis]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Participation is not restricted to locally based organisations. The city of [[Zurich]] joined the project in 2005 and the canton of [[Geneva]] declared its interest in 2008.

Within the pilot region, the projects in progress include demonstration buildings constructed to ''[[MINERGIE]]'' or ''[[Passivhaus]]'' standards, [[electricity]] generation from [[renewable energy]] sources, and vehicles using [[natural gas]], [[Hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] and [[biogas]]. The aim is to put research into practice, seek continuous improvements, and to communicate progress to all interested parties, including the public.

== Fribourg smart living building ==
The "smart living lab", based in Fribourg, reunites researches from the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Fribourg University and the Lausanne Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smartlivinglab.ch/index.php/en/research/researchgroups.html|title=smart living lab research groups|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they design the smart living building,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://building2050.epfl.ch/page-150388-en.html|title=Smart living Building|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be both a '''sustainable structure and an evolving building''' and whose erection is to take place in 2020. It will house the activities of some 100 researchers, offering laboratories, offices, conference rooms and some experimental dwellings. In this multiple-use context, the building will become an experimental field of studies in itself, and aims to find solutions to energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions that it generates.

This construction is the group's first case study, and research projects have been established to help it meet the lab's ambitious goals: limiting its consumption and emissions to the values set for 2050 by the 2000-watt society vision, while considering the whole life cycle of its components. These goals are to be met by 2021, that is, almost 30 years ahead of the 2000-watt-society vision's deadline.

'''Arthur Addison Seeligson Jr.''' (October 29, 1920 - April 17, 2001) was an American oilman, rancher, and a [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|racehorse]] owner/breeder.

==Family==
Seeligson was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], the son of Ramona (née Frates) and Arthur Addison Seeligson Sr. His paternal great-grandfather, Henry Seeligson, was a Jewish Confederate soldier whose father served as mayor of [[Galveston, Texas]].&lt;ref name="LamarSmithGenealogy"/&gt; Through his great-grandfather, Seeligson was a relative of composer [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]]. Arthur Seeligson's brother, Frates Slick Seeligson (1923-2006), was a rancher and a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from 1953-1960.  His first cousin, once removed, [[Lamar S. Smith|Lamar Smith]]&lt;ref name="LamarSmithGenealogy"&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/smithlamar.htm&lt;/ref&gt; has been a Republican Congressman from Texas since 1987.

==Early life==
Arthur Seeligson was raised a Protestant. His family moved to [[Oklahoma]] when he was still a boy. After studying at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] and then graduating from [[Yale University]] in 1942, Arthur Seeligson Jr. followed in his fathers footsteps as a successful investor in the [[oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] industry in [[Kansas]].

Seeligson returned to live in San Antonio and it was his home at the time of his death in 2001.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Arthur Seeligson was involved in [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] for more than forty years. He had [[Graded stakes race|stakes race]] winners both in the United States and in [[Europe]]. He most notably [[Horse breeding|bred]] and raced [[Avatar (horse)|Avatar]], winner of the 1975 [[Santa Anita Derby]] and the [[American Classic Races|American Classic]], the [[Belmont Stakes]].

For a time, Arthur Seeligson was a co-owner of the now defunct [[Hialeah Park Race Track]] in [[Hialeah, Florida]]. He was a member of the [[Board of Directors]] of the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]] in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]].
Seeligson's daughter, Ramona Seeligson Bass, was a driving force behind the creation of ''[[Fort Worth Zoo#Texas Wild!|Texas Wild!]]'' at the [[Fort Worth Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.texasobserver.org/article.php?aid=419&lt;/ref&gt; The Zoo's Arthur A. Seeligson Conservation Fund was established by his family and friends to benefit Texas [[wildlife]].

[[Image:Bienenvolk-Gemuell.jpg|thumb|220px|Fresh wax scales (in the middle of the lower row)]]
'''Beeswax''' ('''''cera alba''''') is a natural [[wax]] produced by [[honey bee]]s of the genus ''Apis''.  The wax is formed into scales by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of [[worker bee]]s, which discard it in or at the hive.  The hive workers collect and use it to form cells for honey storage and larval and pupal protection within the [[beehive]].  Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of [[ester]]s of [[fatty acids]] and various [[fatty alcohol|long-chain alcohols]].

Beeswax has been used since prehistory as man's first plastic, as a lubricant and waterproofing agent, in [[lost wax casting]] of metals and glass, as a [[wood finishing|polish]] for wood and leather and for making [[candles]], as an ingredient in cosmetics and as an artistic medium in [[encaustic painting]]. 

Beeswax is edible, having similar negligible [[toxicity]] to plant waxes, and is approved for food use in most countries and in the [[European Union]] under the [[E number]] E901.

==Production==
The wax is formed by [[worker bee]]s, which secrete it from eight wax-producing mirror glands on the inner sides of the [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]] (the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] shield or plate of each segment of the body) on abdominal segments 4 to 7.&lt;ref name=Sanford&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=M.T.|last2=Dietz|first2=A.|year=1976|title=The fine structure of the wax gland of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.).|journal=Apidologie|volume=7|pages=197–207|doi=10.1051/apido:19760301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sizes of these wax glands depend on the age of the worker, and after many daily flights, these glands begin to gradually [[atrophy]].

The new wax is initially glass-clear and colorless, becoming [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] after [[mastication]] and adulteration with pollen by the hive worker bees.  Also, the wax becomes progressively more yellow or brown by incorporation of [[pollen]] oils and [[propolis]].  The wax scales are about {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|0.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and about 1100 are required to make a gram of wax.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R, H. (1981) ''Beeswax'' (2nd edition) Bee Books New and Old, Burrowbridge, Somerset UK. {{ISBN|0-905652-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honey bee]]s use the beeswax to build [[honeycomb]] cells in which their young are raised with [[honey]] and pollen cells being capped for storage. For the wax-making bees to secrete wax, the ambient temperature in the hive must be 33 to 36&amp;nbsp;°C (91 to 97&amp;nbsp;°F).

The amount of [[honey]] used by bees to produce wax has not been accurately determined. The book, ''Beeswax Production, Harvesting, Processing and Products'', suggests 1 kg of beeswax is used to store 22 kg honey.&lt;ref name=Coggshall&gt;{{cite book |title=Beeswax Production, Harvesting, Processing and Products, Coggshall and Morse |publisher=Wicwas Press |date=1984-06-01| ISBN=1878075063}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}  According to Whitcomb's 1946 experiment, 6.66 to 8.80 kg of honey yields 1 kg of wax.&lt;ref name=Coggshall/&gt;{{rp|35}} Another study estimated that 24 to 30 kg of honey are produced per kg of wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Top-Bar Beekeeping: Organic Practices for Honeybee Health|author=Les Crowder|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|date=2012-08-31|ISBN=1603584617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/what-we-do/information-and-education/info/file/1327 Top-bar beekeeping in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729214736/http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/what-we-do/information-and-education/info/file/1327 |date=2014-07-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==
When beekeepers extract the honey, they cut off the wax caps from each honeycomb cell with an uncapping knife or machine. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, and the type of flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the [[brood comb]] of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called [[slumgum]].

The wax may be clarified further by heating in water. As with petroleum waxes, it may be softened by dilution with mineral oil or vegetable oil to make it more workable at room temperature.

==Physical characteristics==
Beeswax is a tough [[wax]] formed from a mixture of several [[chemical compound]]s.

Beeswax can be classified generally into European and Oriental types. The [[saponification value]] is lower (3–5) for European beeswax, and higher (8–9) for Oriental types.

Beeswax has a relatively low [[melting point]] range of 62 to 64&amp;nbsp;°C (144 to 147&amp;nbsp;°F). If beeswax is heated above 85&amp;nbsp;°C (185&amp;nbsp;°F) discoloration occurs. The flash point of beeswax is 204.4&amp;nbsp;°C (400&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/02556.htm|title=MSDS for beeswax}}. No reported [[autoignition temperature]] has been reported&lt;/ref&gt; [[Density]] at 15&amp;nbsp;°C is 958 to 970&amp;nbsp;kg/m³.

When natural beeswax is cold, it is brittle, at room temperature it is tenacious, its fracture is dry and granular, it also softens at human body temperature. The specific gravity at {{convert|15|C|F}} is from 0.958 to 0.975, that of melted wax at {{convert|98|to|99|C|F|1}} compared with water at {{convert|15.5|C|F|1}} is 0.822.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Applied Chemistry, Vol. 5.

==Uses==
[[Image:Kurps in Warsaw-11-Niedzwiedzcy-Pasieka.jpg|thumb|Beeswax candles and figures]]

Candle-making has long involved the use of beeswax, which is highly flammable, and this material was traditionally prescribed for the making of the [[Paschal candle]] or "Easter candle". Beeswax candles are purported to be superior to other wax candles, because they burn brighter and longer, do not bend, and burn "cleaner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honey Bee Hobbyist: The Care and Keeping of Bees|last=Norman|first=Gary|publisher=BowTie Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-933958-94-1|location=California, USA|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further recommended for the making of other candles used in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01347a.htm 'Altar Candles"], 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;  Beeswax is also the candle constituent of choice in the [[Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/02/use-of-candles-in-orthodox-church.html], Use of Candles in the Orthodox Church&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Uwe Wolfmeier, Hans Schmidt, Franz-Leo Heinrichs, Georg Michalczyk, Wolfgang Payer, Wolfram Dietsche, Klaus Boehlke, Gerd Hohner, Josef Wildgruber "Waxes" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Refined beeswax plays a prominent role in art materials both as a binder in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic paint]] and as a stabilizer in [[oil paint]] to add body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22178945|title=The artist's handbook of materials and techniques|last=1895-1979.|first=Mayer, Ralph,|others=Sheehan, Steven.|isbn=0670837016|edition=Fifth edition, revised and updated|location=New York|oclc=22178945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeswax is an ingredient in surgical [[bone wax]], which is used during surgery to control bleeding from bone surfaces; [[shoe polish]] and [[furniture polish]] can both use beeswax as a component, dissolved in turpentine or sometimes blended with [[linseed oil]] or [[tung oil]]; modeling waxes can also use beeswax as a component; pure beeswax can also be used as an organic [[surfboard wax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morenature.com/raw-beeswax-uses.html 'Raw Beeswax Uses"], MoreNature&lt;/ref&gt; Beeswax blended with pine [[rosin]] is used for [[waxing]], and can serve as an adhesive to attach reed plates to the structure inside a [[squeezebox]]. It can also be used to make [[Cutler's resin]], an adhesive used to glue handles onto cutlery knives. It is used in Eastern Europe in egg decoration; it is used for writing, via [[resist dyeing]], on [[batik]] eggs (as in ''[[pysanka|pysanky]]'') and for making beaded eggs.
Beeswax is used by [[percussionist]]s to make a surface on [[tambourine]]s for thumb rolls. It can also be used as a metal injection moulding binder component along with other polymeric binder materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enggpedia.com/chemical-engineering-encyclopedia/dictionary/chemical-processes/1793-metal-injection-molding-process-mim 'Metal Injection Molding Process (MIM)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510045029/http://enggpedia.com/chemical-engineering-encyclopedia/dictionary/chemical-processes/1793-metal-injection-molding-process-mim |date=2012-05-10 }}, 2012 EngPedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Beeswax was formerly used in the manufacture of phonograph cylinders. It may still be used to seal formal legal or [[royal decree]] and academic parchments such as placing an awarding stamp [[imprimatur]] of the university upon completion of postgraduate degrees.

Purified and bleached beeswax is used in the production of food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The three main types of beeswax products are yellow, white, and beeswax absolute. Yellow beeswax is the crude product obtained from the honeycomb, white beeswax is bleached or filtered yellow beeswax, and beeswax [[Absolute (perfumery)|absolute]] is yellow beeswax treated with alcohol. In food preparation, it is used as a coating for cheese; by sealing out the air, protection is given against spoilage (mold growth). Beeswax may also be used as a food additive [[E number|E901]], in small quantities acting as a [[glazing agent]], which serves to prevent water loss, or used to provide surface protection for some fruits. Soft gelatin capsules and tablet coatings may also use E901. Beeswax is also a common ingredient of natural chewing gum.The wax monoesters in beeswax are poorly hydrolysed in the guts of humans and other [[mammals]], so they have insignificant nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/615.pdf Beeswax absorption and toxicity]. Large amounts of such waxes in the diet pose theoretical toxicological problems for mammals.&lt;/ref&gt; Some birds, such as [[honeyguide]]s, can digest beeswax. Beeswax is the main diet of [[Lesser wax moth|wax moth]] larvae.

Use of beeswax in skin care and cosmetics has been increasing. A German study found beeswax to be superior to similar barrier creams (usually mineral oil-based creams such as [[petroleum jelly]]), when used according to its protocol.&lt;ref&gt;

Beeswax is used in [[lip balm]], [[lip gloss]], [[hand cream]]s, salves, and moisturizers; and in cosmetics such as [[eye shadow]], blush, and [[eye liner]]. Beeswax is also an important ingredient in [[moustache wax]] and [[hair pomade]]s, which make hair look sleek and shiny.

Beeswax was among the first plastics to be used, alongside other natural polymers such as [[gutta-percha]], [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[Tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]], and [[shellac]]. For thousands of years, beeswax has had a wide variety of applications; it has been found in the tombs of Egypt, in wrecked Viking ships, and in Roman ruins. Beeswax never goes bad and can be heated and reused. Historically, it has been used:

* As candles - the oldest intact beeswax candles north of the Alps were found in the [[Alemanni|Alamannic]] graveyard of [[Seitingen-Oberflacht|Oberflacht, Germany]], dating to 6th/7th century AD
* In the manufacture of cosmetics
* As a modelling material in the [[lost-wax casting]] process, or ''cire perdue''&lt;ref name=Condon&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. O.

A biofilm may also be considered a hydrogel, which is a complex polymer that contains many times its dry weight in water. Biofilms are not just bacterial slime layers but biological systems; the bacteria organize themselves into a coordinated functional community. Biofilms can attach to a surface such as a tooth, rock, or surface, and may include a single species or a diverse group of microorganisms. The biofilm bacteria can share nutrients and are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as desiccation, antibiotics, and a host body's immune system. A biofilm usually begins to form when a free-swimming bacterium attaches to a surface.&lt;ref&gt;

The formation of a biofilm begins with the attachment of free-floating microorganisms to a surface.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first colonist bacteria of a biofilm may adhere to the surface initially by the weak [[van der Waals force]]s and hydrophobic effects.&lt;ref name="pmid11397632"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Briandet R, Herry J, Bellon-Fontaine M | title = Determination of the van der Waals, electron donor and electron acceptor surface tension components of static Gram-positive microbial biofilms | journal = Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–310 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11397632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20438621"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi H, Suda T, Tanaka Y, Kimura B | title = Cellular hydrophobicity of Listeria monocytogenes involves initial attachment and biofilm formation on the surface of polyvinyl chloride | journal = Lett.

[[Hydrophobicity]] can also affect the ability of bacteria to form biofilms. Bacteria with increased hydrophobicity have reduced repulsion between the substratum and the bacterium.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Donlan RM | year = 2002 | title = Biofilms: Microbial Life on Surfaces | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 9| pages = 881–890 | doi=10.3201/eid0809.020063 | pmid=12194761 | pmc=2732559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteria species are not able to attach to a surface on their own successfully due to their limited motility but are instead able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to other, earlier bacteria colonists. [[Non-motile bacteria]] cannot recognize surfaces or aggregate together as easily as motile bacteria.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt;

During surface colonization bacteria cells are able to communicate using [[quorum sensing]] (QS) products such as [[N-acyl homoserine lactone]] (AHL). Once colonization has begun, the biofilm grows by a combination of cell division and recruitment. [[Polysaccharide]] matrices typically enclose bacterial biofilms. In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt; The final stage of biofilm formation is known as dispersion, and is the stage in which the biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size.

The development of a biofilm may allow for an aggregate cell colony (or colonies) to be increasingly [[antibiotic resistance|resistant to antibiotics]]. Cell-cell communication or [[quorum sensing]] has been shown to be involved in the formation of biofilm in several bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;Quorum-Sensing Regulation of the Biofilm Matrix Genes (pel) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal ==
[[File:Honors Option-MMG.svg|thumb|Biofilm Dispersal]]
Dispersal of cells from the biofilm colony is an essential stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|biofilm extracellular matrix]], such as [[dispersin B]] and [[deoxyribonuclease]], may contribute to biofilm dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Ramasubbu N, Fine DH |title=Detachment of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells by an endogenous beta-hexosaminidase activity |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=185 |issue=16 |pages=4693–8 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896987 |pmc=166467 |doi=10.1128/JB.185.16.4693-4698.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Izano EA, Amarante MA, Kher WB, Kaplan JB |title=Differential roles of poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide and extracellular DNA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=470–6 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18039822 |pmc=2223269 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02073-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enzymes that degrade the biofilm matrix may be useful as anti-biofilm agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Velliyagounder K, Fine DH, Ramasubbu N |title=Enzymatic detachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=2633–6 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15215120 |pmc=434209 |doi=10.1128/AAC.48.7.2633-2636.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Xavier JB, Picioreanu C, Rani SA, van Loosdrecht MC, Stewart PS |title=Biofilm-control strategies based on enzymic disruption of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix--a modelling study |journal=Microbiology |volume=151 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3817–32 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16339929 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.28165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, [[Cis-2-Decenoic acid|''cis''-2-decenoic acid]], is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies.

It is generally assumed that cells dispersed from biofilms immediately go into the planktonic growth phase. However, recent studies have shown that the physiology of dispersed cells from ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' biofilms is highly different from those of planktonic and biofilm cells.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Chua SL, Liu Y, Yam JK, Tolker-Nielsen T, Kjelleberg S, Givskov M, Yang L |title=Dispersed cells represent a distinct stage in the transition from bacterial biofilm to planktonic lifestyles |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |doi=10.1038/ncomms5462 |pmid=25042103 |pages=4462|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4462C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26158442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua SL, Hultqvist LD, Yuan M, Rybtke M, Nielsen TE, Givskov M, Tolker-Nielsen T, Yang L | title = In vitro and in vivo generation and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-dispersed cells via c-di-GMP manipulation | journal = Nat Protoc | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 1165–80 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26158442 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2015.067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the dispersal process is a unique stage during the transition from biofilm to planktonic lifestyle in bacteria. Dispersed cells are found to be highly virulent against macrophages and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', but highly sensitive towards iron stress, as compared with planktonic cells.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Properties ==

Biofilms are usually found on solid [[wikt:substrate|substrates]] submerged in or exposed to an [[aqueous]] [[solution]], although they can form as floating mats on liquid surfaces and also on the surface of leaves, particularly in high humidity climates. Given sufficient resources for growth, a biofilm will quickly grow to be macroscopic (visible to the naked eye). Biofilms can contain many different types of microorganism, e.g. [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[protozoa]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]]; each group performs specialized [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions. However, some organisms will form single-species films under certain conditions. The social structure (cooperation/competition) within a biofilm depends highly on the different species present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nadell|first=Carey D.|author2=Xavier, Joao B. |author3=Foster, Kevin R. |title=The sociobiology of biofilms |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |date=1 January 2009|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=206–224|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00150.x |pmid=19067751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extracellular matrix ===

The EPS matrix consists of [[exopolysaccharides]], proteins and nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danese|first=P. N.|last2=Pratt|first2=L.

This matrix encases the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals as well as gene exchange. The EPS matrix also traps extracellular enzymes and keeps them in close proximity to the cells. Thus, the matrix represents an external digestion system and allows for stable synergistic microconsortia of different species (Wingender and Flemming, Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 8, 623-633). Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute [[nutrient]]s and signalling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Paul|author2=Dirk deBeer |author3=Zbigniew Lewandowski |title=Liquid Flow in Biofilm Systems |journal=Appl.

Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vlamakis|first=Hera|last2=Aguilar|first2=Claudio|last3=Losick|first3=Richard|last4=Kolter|first4=Roberto|date=2008-04-01|title=Control of cell fate by the formation of an architecturally complex bacterial community|journal=Genes &amp; Development|volume=22|issue=7|pages=945–953|doi=10.1101/gad.1645008|issn=0890-9369|pmc=2279205|pmid=18381896}}&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to [[detergent]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community.

However, biofilms are not always less susceptible to antibiotics. For instance, the biofilm form of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the biofilm is compared to logarithmic-phase planktonic cells, the biofilm does have greater resistance to antimicrobials. This resistance to antibiotics in both stationary-phase cells and biofilms may be due to the presence of [[persister cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Spoering AL, Lewis K |title=Biofilms and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have similar resistance to killing by antimicrobials |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=183 |issue=23 |pages=6746–51 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11698361 |pmc=95513 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.23.6746-6751.2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofilms are ubiquitous in organic life. Nearly every species of microorganism have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other. Biofilms will form on virtually every non-shedding surface in [[Asepsis|non-sterile]] aqueous or humid environments. Biofilms can grow in the most extreme environments: from, for example, the extremely hot, briny waters of [[hot spring]]s ranging from very acidic to very alkaline, to frozen [[glacier]]s.

Biofilms can be found on rocks and pebbles at the bottoms of most streams or [[river]]s and often form on the surfaces of [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pools of water. Biofilms are important components of [[food chains]] in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic [[invertebrate]]s upon which many fish feed. Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, as in the case of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots, exist symbiotically with the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|title=Introduction to Biofilms: Desirable and undesirable impacts of biofilm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622002657/http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|archivedate=2008-06-22|df=}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include Citrus Canker, [[Pierce's Disease]] of grapes, and Bacterial Spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=September 2007|title=Influence of xylem fluid chemistry on planktonic growth, biofilm formation and aggregation of Xylella fastidiosa|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=274|issue=2|pages=210–7|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00827.x|pmid=17610515|vauthors=Andersen PC, Brodbeck BV, Oden S, Shriner A, Leite B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies in 2003 discovered that the immune system supports bio-film development in the large intestine. This was supported mainly with the fact that the two most abundantly produced molecules by the immune system also support bio-film production and are associated with the bio-films developed in the gut. This is especially important because the appendix holds a mass amount of these bacterial bio-films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Barbas|first2=Andrew|last3=Bush|first3=Errol|last4=Lin|first4=Shu|last5=Parker|first5=William|date=24 June 2007|title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix|url=http://sciences.surgery.duke.edu/files/BillSection1SecondInsert.pdf|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=249|issue=4|pages=826–831|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032|pmid=17936308|last1=Bollinger|first1=Randal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery helps to distinguish the possible function of the appendix and the idea that the appendix can help reinoculate the gut with good gut flora.

In the human environment, biofilms can grow in [[shower]]s very easily since they provide a moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and [[Sanitary sewer|sewage]] [[pipe (material)|pipes]] and cause clogging and [[corrosion]]. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. Biofilm in soil can cause [[bioclogging]]. Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to reduce heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/01457638108939572 |title=Influence of Fouling Biofilms on Heat Transfer |year=1981 |last1=Characklis |first1=WG |last2=Nevimons |first2=MJ |last3=Picologlou |first3=BF |journal=Heat Transfer Engineering |volume=3 |pages=23–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schwermer CU, Lavik G, Abed RM |title=Impact of nitrate on the structure and function of bacterial biofilm communities in pipelines used for injection of seawater into oil fields |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=2841–51 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18344353 |pmc=2394879 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02027-07|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that are attached to the metal subsurface (i.e., [[Microbial corrosion|microbially influenced corrosion]]).

Bacterial adhesion to boat hulls serves as the foundation for [[biofouling]] of seagoing vessels. Once a film of bacteria forms, it is easier for other marine organisms such as barnacles to attach. Such fouling can reduce maximum vessel speed by up to 20%, prolonging voyages and consuming fuel. Time in dry dock for refitting and repainting reduces the productivity of shipping assets, and the useful life of ships is also reduced due to corrosion and mechanical removal (scraping) of marine organisms from ships' hulls.

[[Stromatolites]] are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial biofilms, especially of [[cyanobacteria]]. Stromatolites include some of the most ancient records of life on Earth, and are still forming today.

=== Dental plaque ===

Within the human body, biofilms are present on the [[teeth]] as [[dental plaque]], where they may cause [[tooth decay]] and [[gum disease]]. These biofilms can either be in an uncalcified state that can be removed by dental instruments, or a calcified state which is more difficult to remove. Removal techniques can also include [[antimicrobial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandki|first=Rita|last2=Banthia|first2=Priyank|last3=Banthia|first3=Ruchi|date=2011|title=Biofilms: A microbial home|journal=Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=111–114|doi=10.4103/0972-124X.84377|issn=0972-124X|pmc=3183659|pmid=21976832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dental plaque]] is an oral biofilm that adheres to the [[teeth]] and consists of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''Candida albicans''), embedded in salivary [[polymers]] and microbial extracellular products.

The dental plaque biofilm can result in the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from balanced populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an [[acidogenic]], aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary [[carbohydrate]]. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues ([[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and then [[dentin]]), the sign and symptom being a [[carious lesion]]. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathology of dental caries.

Competence can lead to genetic transformation, a form of sexual interaction, favored under conditions of high cell density and/or stress where there is maximal opportunity for interaction between the competent cell and the DNA released from nearby donor cells. This system is optimally expressed when ''S. mutans'' cells reside in an actively growing biofilm. Biofilm grown ''S. mutans'' cells are genetically transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than ''S. mutans'' growing as free-floating planktonic cells suspended in liquid.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

Research has shown that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics induce biofilm formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus''. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result from the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy.

=== ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' ===

''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of septicemia in HIV-infected persons. When ''S. pneumonia'' grows in biofilms, genes are specifically expressed that respond to oxidative stress and induce competence.&lt;ref name="pmid16925554"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oggioni MR, Trappetti C, Kadioglu A, Cassone M, Iannelli F, Ricci S, Andrew PW, Pozzi G |title=Switch from planktonic to sessile life: a major event in pneumococcal pathogenesis |journal=Mol.

CSP also functions as a quorum-sensing peptide. It not only induces biofilm formation, but also increases virulence in pneumonia and meningitis.

It has been proposed that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of ''S. pneumoniae'' to survive the defenses of the host.&lt;ref name=Michod /&gt; In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22706053"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wei H, Håvarstein LS |title=Fratricide is essential for efficient gene transfer between pneumococci in biofilms |journal=Appl.

=== In industry ===
Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many [[sewage treatment]] plants include a [[secondary treatment]] stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter ([[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]), while [[protozoa]] and [[rotifer]]s are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. [[Slow sand filter]]s rely on biofilm development in the same way to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate [[petroleum]] oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the [[microbial biodegradation|hydrocarbon-degrading]] activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCB).&lt;ref name="chapter9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|vauthors=Martins dos Santos VA, Yakimov MM, Timmis KN, Golyshin PN|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-17-2|pages=1971|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx6v3TIkzXUC&amp;pg=PA1971#v=onepage|editor=Díaz E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food industry ===
Biofilms have become problematic in several food industries due to the ability to form on plants and during industrial processes.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srey S | year = | title = Biofilm formation in food industries: A food safety concern | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;T. Tarver, "Biofilms: A Threat to Food Safety – IFT.org", Ift.org, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase surface corrosion and frictional resistance of fluids.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kumar C | year = | title = Significance of microbial biofilms in food industry: a review | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt; Along with economic problems, biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due to the ability to make the food more resistant to disinfectants&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;

In produce, microorganisms attach to the surfaces and biofilms develop internally.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; This problem is also found in ready-to-eat foods, because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt; The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is [[Salmonella]].&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mizan F | year = | title = Microbial biofilms in seafood: A food-hygiene challenge | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of salmonella contamination can be found in the poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt; Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt; The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;

New forms of cleaning procedures are being tested in order to reduce biofilm formation in these processes which will lead to safer and more productive food processing industries. These new forms of cleaning procedures also have a profound effect on the environment, often releasing toxic gases into the groundwater reservoirs.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

=== In aquaculture ===
[[File:Screen Shot 2017-12-13 at 1.40.19 PM.png|thumb|A bioflim from the [[Dead sea]]]]

In shellfish and algae farms, biofouling microbial species tend to block nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Marine biofouling on fish farms and its remediation|url=|journal=Advances in Marine Biology|volume=47|issue=|pages=215–252|author=Braithwaite R, McEvoy L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that are more favorable for biofouling species. In the marine environment, biofilms could reduce the hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliances deployed in seawater.&lt;ref name="pmid17497196"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qian PY, Lau SC, Dahms HU, Dobretsov S, Harder T | title = Marine biofilms as mediators of colonization by marine macroorganisms: implications for antifouling and aquaculture | journal = Mar.

== Eukaryotic biofilms ==
{{See also|Phototrophic biofilms}}
Along with bacteria, biofilms are often initiated and produced by eukaryotic microbes. The biofilms produced by eukaryotes is usually occupied by bacteria and other eukaryotes alike, however the surface is cultivated and EPS is secreted initially by the eukaryote.&lt;ref name="pmid16897306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Colen 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cooksey K, Wigglesworth-Cooksey B | year = 1995 | title = Adhesion of bacteria and diatoms to surfaces in the sea: a review | url = | journal = Aquatic Microbial Ecology | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.3354/ame009087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[microalgae]] are known to form biofilms in such a way. Biofilms of fungal origin are important aspects of human infection and fungal pathagenicity, as the fungal infection is more resistant to antifungals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fanning S, Mitchell AP | year = 2012 | title = Fungal Biofilms | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = e1002585 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11514524"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra J, Kuhn DM, Mukherjee PK, Hoyer LL, McCormick T, Ghannoum MA | title = Biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans: development, architecture, and drug resistance | journal = J.

In the environment, fungal biofilms are an area of ongoing research. One key area of research is fungal biofilms on plants. For example, in the soil, plant associated fungi including [[mycorrhiza]] have been shown to decompose organic matter, protect plants from bacterial pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications {{cite book|last1=Burmølle|first1=Mette|last2=Kjøller|first2=Annelise|last3=Sørenses|first3=Søren|editor1-last=Lear|editor1-first=Gavin|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Gillian|title=Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications|date=2012|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|isbn=1904455964|pages=61–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofilms in aquatic environments are often founded by [[diatom]]s. The exact purpose of these biofilms is unknown, however there is evidence that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress.&lt;ref name="pmid27009999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25268215"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steele DJ, Franklin DJ, Underwood GJ | title = Protection of cells from salinity stress by extracellular polymeric substances in diatom biofilms | journal = Biofouling | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 987–98 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25268215 | pmc = 4706044 | doi = 10.1080/08927014.2014.960859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the [[phycosphere]], but importantly are the bacteria associated with diatoms, as it has been shown that although diatoms excrete EPS, they only do so when interacting with certain bacteria species.&lt;ref name="pmid26986529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Windler M, Leinweber K, Bartulos CR, Philipp B, Kroth PG | title = Biofilm and capsule formation of the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum are affected by a bacterium | journal = J.

This page describes some parameters used to characterize the properties of a [[boundary layer]] formed by fluid flow along a wall.  The boundary layer concept was first described by [[Ludwig Prandtl]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Prandtl, (1904), “Über Flüssigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung,” Verhandlungen des Dritten Internationalen Mathematiker-Kongresses in Heidelberg 1904, A. Krazer, ed., Teubner, Leipzig, (1905) 484–491.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a stationary body with a fluid flowing around it, like the semi-infinite flat plate with air flowing over the top of the plate (assume the flow and the plate extends to infinity in the positive/negative direction perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt; plane).  At the solid walls of the body the fluid satisfies a [[no-slip boundary condition]] and has zero velocity, but as you move away from the wall, the velocity of the flow asymptotically approaches the free stream mean velocity.  Therefore, it is impossible to define a sharp point at which the boundary layer becomes the free stream, yet this layer has a well-defined characteristic thickness.  The parameters below provide a useful definition of this characteristic, measurable thickness.  Also included in this boundary layer description are some parameters useful in describing the shape of the boundary layer.

== Boundary Layer thickness ==
The '''boundary layer thickness''', '''δ''',  is the distance across a boundary layer from the wall to a point where the flow velocity has essentially reached the 'free stream' velocity, &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This distance is defined normal to the wall.  It is customarily defined as the point &lt;math&gt;y_{99}&lt;/math&gt; where:
:&lt;math&gt;u(y_{99}) = 0.99u_o&lt;/math&gt;
at a point on the wall &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  For laminar boundary layers over a flat plate, the [[Blasius boundary layer|Blasius solution]] to the flow governing equations gives:&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta \approx 4.91 \sqrt{ {\nu  x}\over u_0} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta \approx 4.91 x/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Re}_x} &lt;/math&gt;

For turbulent boundary layers over a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta \approx 0.37x/ {\mathrm{Re}_x}^{1/5} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re}_x = \rho u_0 x/\mu&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the overall thickness (or height) of the boundary layer
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Reynolds number]]
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density
:&lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; is the freestream velocity
:&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance downstream from the start of the boundary layer
:&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic viscosity
:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \mu/\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the kinematic viscosity

The turbulent boundary layer thickness formula assumes 1) the flow is turbulent right from the start of the boundary layer and 2) the turbulent boundary layer behaves in a geometrically similar manner (i.e. the velocity profiles are geometrically similar along the flow in the x-direction, differing only by stretching factors in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u(y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Neither one of these assumptions are true for the general turbulent boundary layer case so care must be excersised in applying this formula.

The velocity thickness can also be referred to as the Soole ratio, although the gradient of the thickness over distance would be adversely proportional to that of velocity thickness.

== Displacement thickness ==

The '''displacement thickness''', '''δ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' or '''δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved in the direction perpendicular to its normal vector away from the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; to give the same flow rate as occurs between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practical [[aerodynamics]], the displacement thickness essentially modifies the shape of a body immersed in a fluid to allow an inviscid solution.  It is commonly used in aerodynamics to overcome the difficulty inherent in the fact that the fluid velocity in the [[boundary layer]] approaches asymptotically to the free stream value as distance from the wall increases at any given location.

The definition of the displacement thickness for [[compressibility|compressible]] flow is based on mass flow rate:

:&lt;math&gt; {\delta^*}= \int_0^\infty {\left(1-{\rho(y) u(y)\over \rho_0 u_0}\right) \,\mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;

The definition for [[compressibility|incompressible]] flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:

:&lt;math&gt; {\delta^*}= \int_0^\infty {\left(1-{u(y)\over u_0}\right) \,\mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate normal to the wall.

For turbulent boundary layer calculations, the time averaged density and velocity at the edge of the boundary layer must be used.  In the equations above, &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; are therefore replaced with &lt;math&gt;\rho_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_e&lt;/math&gt;.

The displacement thickness is used to calculate the boundary layer's [[Shape factor (boundary layer flow)|shape factor]].

== Momentum thickness ==

The '''momentum thickness''', '''θ''' or '''δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved parallel to itself towards the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; to give the same total momentum as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the momentum thickness for [[compressibility|compressible]] flow is based on mass flow rate:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \int_0^\infty {{\rho(y) u(y)\over \rho_0 u_o} {\left(1 - {u(y)\over u_o}\right)}} \,\mathrm{d}y &lt;/math&gt;

The definition for [[compressibility|incompressible]] flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \int_0^\infty {{u(y)\over u_o} {\left(1 - {u(y)\over u_o}\right)}} \,\mathrm{d}y &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate normal to the wall.

For turbulent boundary layer calculations, the time averaged density and velocity at the edge of the boundary layer must be used.  In the equations above, &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; are therefore replaced with &lt;math&gt;\rho_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_e&lt;/math&gt;.

For a flat plate at zero [[angle of attack]] with a laminar boundary layer, the Blasius solution gives.&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \theta \approx 0.664 \sqrt{{\nu x}\over u_o}&lt;/math&gt;

The influence of fluid [[viscosity]] creates a wall [[shear stress]], &lt;math&gt; \tau_w &lt;/math&gt;, which extracts energy from the mean flow.  The boundary layer can be considered to possess a total momentum flux deficit, due to the frictional [[dissipation]] given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \int_0^\infty {u(y) \left(u_o - u(y)\right)} \,\mathrm{d}y. &lt;/math&gt;

== Energy thickness ==

The '''energy thickness''', &lt;math&gt;\delta_3&lt;/math&gt; , is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved parallel to itself towards the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; to give the same total kinetic energy as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenhead, Louis, ed. Laminar boundary layers. Clarendon Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the energy thickness for [[compressibility|compressible]] flow is based on mass flow rate:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_3 = \int_0^\infty {{\rho(y) u(y)\over \rho_0 u_o} {\left(1 - {u(y)^2\over u_o^2}\right)}} \,\mathrm{d}y &lt;/math&gt;

The definition for [[compressibility|incompressible]] flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_3 = \int_0^\infty {{u(y)\over u_o} {\left(1 - {u(y)^2\over u_o^2}\right)}} \,\mathrm{d}y &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate normal to the wall.

== Shape factor ==

A '''shape factor''' is used in [[boundary layer flow]] to determine the nature of the flow.

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac {\delta^*}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'' is the shape factor, &lt;math&gt;\delta^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement thickness]] and ''θ'' is the [[momentum thickness]]. The higher the value of ''H'', the stronger the adverse [[pressure gradient]]. A high adverse pressure gradient can greatly reduce the [[Reynolds number]] at which transition into [[turbulence]] may occur.

Conventionally, ''H'' = 2.59 (Blasius boundary layer) is typical of laminar flows, while ''H'' = 1.3 - 1.4 is typical of turbulent flows.&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moment Method ==
A relatively new method&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; for describing the thickness and shape of the boundary layer utilizes the [[Moment (mathematics)|moment method]] commonly used to describe a random variable's [[probability distribution]].  The moment method was developed from the observation that the plot of the second derivative of the [[Blasius boundary layer]] for laminar flow over a plate looks very much like a Gaussian distribution curve.&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2006, p. 1678.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is straightforward to cast the properly scaled velocity profile and its first two derivatives into suitable integral kernels.

The velocity profiles central moments are defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; {\zeta_n}= \int_0^\infty {(y-m)^n {1\over\delta^*} (1-{u(y)\over u_0}) \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean location is given by: 
:&lt;math&gt; m = \int_0^\infty { y {1\over\delta^*} (1-{u(y)\over u_0}) \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;

There are some advantages to also include descriptions of moments of the boundary layer profile derivatives with respect to the height above the wall.  Consider the first derivative velocity profile central moments given by:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa_n} = \int_0^\infty { (y-{\delta^*})^n {d u(y)/u_0 \over dy} \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean location is the displacement thickness &lt;math&gt;\delta^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally the second derivative velocity profile central moments are given by:
:&lt;math&gt; {\lambda_n} = \int_0^\infty { (y-{\eta})^n {d^2 \{-\eta u(y)/u_0 \} \over dy^2} \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean location is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; {\eta} = {\mu u_0 \over \tau_w}&lt;/math&gt;
 
With the moments and the mean locations defined, the boundary layer thickness and shape can be described in terms of the boundary layer widths ([[variance]]), [[Skewness|skewnesses]], and excesses ([[Kurtosis|excess kurtosis]]).  Experimentally, it is found that the turbulent boundary layer thickness defined as &lt;math&gt;\delta_m = m + 3\sigma_m&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_m=\zeta_2^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, tracks the 99% thickness very well.&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a cue from the [[Boundary layer|boundary layer momentum balance equations]], the second derivative boundary layer moments, &lt;math&gt;{\lambda_n}&lt;/math&gt; track the thickness and shape of that portion of the boundary layer where the viscous forces are significant.  Hence the moment method makes it possible to track and quantify the inner viscous region using &lt;math&gt;{\lambda_n}&lt;/math&gt; moments whereas the outer region of the turbulent boundary layer is tracked using &lt;math&gt;{\zeta_n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\kappa_n}&lt;/math&gt; moments.

Calculation of the derivative moments without the need to take derivatives is simplified by using integration by parts to reduce the moments to simply integrals based on the displacement thickness kernel:
:&lt;math&gt; {\alpha_n}= \int_0^\infty {y^n (1-{u(y)\over u_0}) \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;
This means that the first derivative skewness, for example, can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{1} = \kappa_3/\kappa_{2}^{3/2} = (2\delta^{*3} - 6\delta^* \alpha_1 + 3\alpha_3)/(-\delta^{*2} + 2\alpha_1)^{3/2} &lt;/math&gt;    
This parameter was shown to track the boundary layer shape changes that accompany the laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition.&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2014, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = n_{1}\mathbf{a}_{1} + n_{2}\mathbf{a}_{2} + n_{3}\mathbf{a}_{3}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are any integers and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''primitive vectors'' which lie in different directions (not necessarily mutually perpendicular) and span the lattice. This discrete set of vectors must be closed under vector addition and subtraction. For any choice of position vector '''R''', the lattice looks exactly the same.

When the discrete points are [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s, or [[polymer]] strings of [[Solid|solid matter]], the Bravais lattice concept is used to formally define a ''crystalline arrangement'' and its (finite) frontiers. A [[crystal]] is made up of a periodic arrangement of one or more atoms (the ''basis'', or ''motif'') repeated at each lattice point. Consequently, the crystal looks the same when viewed from any equivalent lattice point, namely those separated by the translation of one unit cell.

Two Bravais lattices are often considered equivalent if they have isomorphic symmetry groups. In this sense, there are 14 possible Bravais lattices in three-dimensional space. The 14 possible symmetry groups of Bravais lattices are 14 of the 230 [[space group]]s.

The unit cells are specified according to the relative lengths of the cell edges (''a'' and ''b'') and the angle between them (''θ''). The area of the unit cell can be calculated by evaluating the [[Vector norm|norm]] {{nowrap|{{norm|'''a''' × '''b'''}}}}, where '''a''' and '''b''' are the lattice vectors.

==In 3 dimensions==
[[File:diamond_lattice.stl|thumb|2&amp;times;2&amp;times;2 unit cells of a [[diamond cubic]] lattice]]
In three-dimensional space, there are 14 Bravais lattices. These are obtained by combining one of the seven [[lattice system]]s with one of the centering types. The centering types identify the locations of the lattice points in the unit cell as follows:

*Primitive (P): lattice points on the cell corners only (sometimes called simple)
*Base-centered (A, B, or C): lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each face of one pair of parallel faces of the cell (sometimes called end-centered)
*Body-centered (I): lattice points on the cell corners, with one additional point at the center of the cell
*Face-centered (F): lattice points on the cell corners, with one additional point at the center of each of the faces of the cell

Not all combinations of lattice systems and centering types are needed to describe all of the possible lattices, as it can be shown that several of these are in fact equivalent to each other. For example, the monoclinic I lattice can be described by a monoclinic C lattice by different choice of crystal axes. Similarly, all A- or B-centred lattices can be described either by a C- or P-centering. This reduces the number of combinations to 14 conventional Bravais lattices, shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the list of conventional cells found in {{harvp|Hahn|2002|p=744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bulahdelah Tornado''' was an intense [[tornado]] which occurred near the town of Bulahdelah ({{Convert|100|km|mi|1}} north-northeast of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]), [[New South Wales]] on 1 January 1970, and is thought to be the most destructive tornado ever documented in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="BoM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stormy Weather: A century of storms, fire, flood and drought in New South Wales|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/sevwx/facts/stormy-weather.pdf|work=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to be an F4 or F5 on the [[Fujita scale]]; however, no official rating has been made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tornadoes of Australia and New Zealand |url = http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/storm/tornadoes-aunzea.htm |publisher  = The Weather Doctor |accessdate = 5 April 2008

}}The '''third-generation [[Chrysler minivans|Chrysler minivan]]s''' are a series of passenger [[Minivan|minivans]] that were marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] (later [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]]) from the 1996 to 2000 model years.  Designated the NS platform by Chrysler, these minivans were sold by Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth divisions in passenger configurations; minivans were exported under the Chrysler brand.  While the second-generation AS platform was a revision of the original vans, the NS platform marked the first ground-up redesign of the Chrysler vans since their 1984 introduction, ending the use of components from [[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]] derivatives.

The first non-compact minivans in North America to adopt four sliding passenger doors, the third-generation Chrysler minivans saw its form factor adopted by many competitors.  In addition to chief competitors [[Ford Windstar]], [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], and [[Toyota Sienna]], the NS-platform configuration was adopted by the [[Chevrolet Venture]], [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], and [[Pontiac Montana|Pontiac (Trans Sport) Montana]], and the [[Mercury Villager]]/[[Nissan Quest]].

In line with the first and second-generation minivans, the third-generation minivans were assembled at [[Windsor Assembly]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor, Ontario, Canada]], with additional production sourced from [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (South) Assembly]] in [[Fenton, Missouri]].  To supplement exports from the United States, production of the Chrysler Voyager was sourced from [[Graz|Graz, Austria]] (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).

== Development ==
Development of the NS platform minivans commenced in 1990; with a team lead by [[Tom Gale]] and Chris Theodore, design work (by Don Renkert) was approved in September 1991 with a design freeze in May 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to becoming the first all-new Chrysler minivan in a decade, the third-generation vans were also a response to the development of a front-wheel drive replacement for the [[Ford Aerostar]] (unveiled in 1994 as the 1995 Ford Windstar).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|title=Civil Action File No. 0110133833|date=|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016062810/http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|archivedate=October 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the S/AS-platform vans did not share direct structural underpinnings with the Chrysler K-Cars, in contrast to their predecessors, the NS vans were the first generation designed from the ground up as a minivan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first Chrysler vehicles designed with [[CATIA#Automotive|CATIA]], which allowed for much tighter design tolerances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In its effort to design the third-generation minivans, Chrysler benchmarked the vehicle from various sources of data, using customer input, warranty data, and research based on various other minivans (the Ford Aerostar, Mercury Villager, and Toyota Previa)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  During its market research, Chrysler sought owner feedback on adding a $300 driver-side sliding door option from minivan owners, with 85% of participants answering that they would buy the van with the second sliding door, even as an extra-cost option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ironically, the feature was planned for the first-generation minivans, but was removed in 1980 due to concerns over additional tooling costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=Creating the Plymouth, Dodge, and Chrysler Minivan: The Caravan/Voyager Development Story|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the sliding door, several designs underwent consideration for the floor layout.  Initially, a lower floor height was considered (research feedback felt that the step-in height was too high), but was rejected as it jeopardized the higher driving position sought by buyers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For production, a compromise design was approved, retaining the same floor height as the previous generation eased into lower door sills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In addition to preserving the higher driving position, the floor design allowed the fitment of all-wheel drive without major modification, larger wheels and tires, CNG tanks, and batteries for electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While the V6 powertrains of the previous-generation platform were retained, during the development of the NS platform, several configurations underwent configuration.  To improve the body structure, a mid-engine powertrain (in line with the [[Toyota Previa]]) was initially considered, but was rejected for cost and complexity considerations.  A transition to a longitudinal-mounted powertrain (to simplify V6 engine access and all-wheel drive configuration) underwent strong consideration; the transverse layout was chosen in order to reduce overall length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In an extensive shift from the boxy design of the first two generations, the body adopted [[Cab forward|cab-forward design]], shifting the dashboard and windshield forward.  In contrast to the controversial styling of the GM APV minivans, the roof was moved upward (nearly 3 inches) and the cowl moved lower&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, allowing for a less radical windshield angle.  To move the base of the windshield back several inches (to further improve visibility), Chrysler designed the windshield wiper module/lower windshield cowl to be removable (allowing for improved engine bay access).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In total, the development of the NS platform would cost Chrysler Corporation $2.8 billion dollars (approximately $4.6 billion in 2017 dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi|title=The Inflation Calculator|website=westegg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the most costly vehicle ever developed by Chrysler at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Model overview ==

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation Chrysler minivans use the Chrysler NS platform designation.  Using a completely new unibody chassis, the NS platform uses a 113.3 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans (1.3 inches longer) and a 119.3 inch wheelbase for long-wheelbase vans (same as 1994-1995 AS-platform vans).  Front-wheel drive is the standard drivetrain configuration with all-wheel drive offered as an option.

The suspension of the NS platform is a modified version of the previous two generations.  In front, the use of [[MacPherson struts]] continued, with leaf springs and a beam axle in the rear.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its development, a number of suspension configurations were considered, including a 4-wheel double wishbone layout.  Rear leaf springs were retained largely in an effort to provide an ideal handling balance with a load in addition to maximize interior load space.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In a major modification, the front track width was widened three inches, allowing for lower mounting of the engine and transaxle, reduction in turning radius, and a lower cowl height.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Front-wheel drive vans had front-wheel disc brakes and rear drum brakes.  From 1997, all-wheel drive vans were fitted with four-wheel disc brakes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Powertrains====
For 1996, the Chrysler minivans received the first new four-cylinder engine in the powertrain line since 1987, with the introduction of a 2.4L engine (shared with the JA-platform cars).  While smaller in displacement than its 2.5L predecessor, the 150hp engine nearly matched the 3.0L V6 in both output and fuel economy.

In states that did not observe [[California emission standards]], the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In those that followed California emissions standards, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In the Dodge Caravan ES and Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi, the 3.8L V6 was standard.

In 1999, the 3.8L V6 became optional on the Plymouth Voyager Expresso; in Canada, the 2.4L engine was dropped, with the 3.0L V6 becoming the standard engine.

In the United States and Canada, a manual transmission was no longer available, with a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic fitted to the 2.4L and 3.0L engines.  The 3.3L and 3.8L engines were fitted with a 4-speed  [[Ultradrive]] automatic.

For the first time, export vehicles were fitted with different powertrains, with the standard engine being a SOHC 2.0L engine with an optional  DOHC 2.0L engine (from the Neon); a VM Motori 2.5L inline-4 was offered, becoming the first diesel Chrysler minivan.  All three engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual or an automatic transmission.  In addition to the four-cylinder engines, export vehicles were offered the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines offered in American-market minivans.  AWD models were not sold in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Body ===
In an extensive shift from the second-generation minivans, the NS-platform minivans abandoned the boxy body design of the previous two Chrysler minivan generations.  While (on average) three inches taller than their predecessors, the new design lowered the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.39 to 0.35&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (matching the Ford Windstar, bested only by the GM APV minivans).   In the redesign, no body panels were carried over, with all three brands adopting new model badging.

A central feature of the redesign (later becoming a standard feature on some trim levels) was the driver-side sliding door.  While first used on compact minivans, including the [[Nissan Stanza Wagon]] and [[Nissan Axxess]], the NS-platform minivans were the first mid-size minivans to adapt the feature.  Though again using a 3-track mounting system for the sliding doors, the system was redesigned to consume less interior space; the exterior door track was hidden below the side windows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  In addition to its styling, the function of the liftgate was changed for the first time, with an exterior handle available for the first time, eliminating the pop-and-lift maneuver of the two previous generations (adapted from the K-car station wagon).  The exterior door handles were redesigned, switching from a flip-up design to a pull-out design.

Alongside the exterior, major changes were made to the interior of the NS-platform minivans.  Again offered with 7 passenger seating, the latching system for the 2nd and 3rd row seats was redesigned; in a single motion, owners could release 2nd and 3rd-row bench seats by floor latch, raising them onto rollers to move them out of the vehicle (the lighter 2nd-row bucket seats did not have them).&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  For the first time, the seatbacks of front bucket seats folded forward.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  The mounting positions for the third-row seat were moved inboard, matching the second row, eliminating a separate set of seat mounts on the floor.

While styled far differently from its 1995 predecessor, the dashboard of the NS-platform minivans adopted a similar layout to the second-generation minivans.  For the first time since 1988, each Chrysler minivan shared the same steering wheel (among the only Chrysler Pentastars visible to the driver).  While the glovebox was enlarged, the underseat storage drawer made its return as an option, complemented by a second locking storage compartment mounted to the side of the passenger seat.  As a first for minivans, the NS minivans introduced dual-zone climate control (as an option) and adjustable cupholders.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Safety ===
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

According to EuroNCAP crash test results, the 1999 model Chrysler Voyager did so badly in the frontal impact that it earned no points,&lt;ref name="euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_1999/56.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 1999|work=euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the worst of the group.{{Cn|date=September 2018}} The body structure became unstable and the steering column was driven back into the driver's chest and head'. The 2007 model Chrysler Voyager fared little better, achieving just 19% in the frontal impact test, with an overall score of 2 stars out of a possible 5.&lt;ref name="www.euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 2007|work=www.euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chest compression measurements on the test dummy 'indicated an unacceptably high risk of serious or fatal injury. As a result, the final star in the adult occupant rating is struck-through'.

Despite the bad results in the EuroNCAP crash tests, statistics from the real world indicate that this is not the whole picture. [[Folksam]] is a Swedish insurance company that in May 2009 published a report on injuries and survivability of 172 car models.  The 88–96 generation got a real world rating of "Average", and the 96-00 generation got a rating called "Safest" (at least 30% safer than the average car.){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Introduced in March 1995 for the 1996 model year&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the third-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth divisions.  In line with the second generation, Chrysler marketed the minivans as the [[Plymouth Voyager]], [[Dodge Caravan]], and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] in both standard wheelbase and long-wheelbase ("Grand") configurations.  The Dodge Caravan C/V was withdrawn from the model line; all NS-platform vans were of passenger van configuration.

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
Again positioned as the flagship of the Chrysler minivans, the third-generation marked a major expansion of the Town &amp; Country model range, from one model to three.  For the first time, a short-wheelbase configuration was offered (LX for 1996, SX for 1997-1999).  The previously-standard long-wheelbase configuration was offered in two trim levels (LX and LXi). The short-wheelbase LX and SX models replaced the Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager LX. In a shift from the simulated woodgrain trim of the previous generation, the Town &amp; Country was distinguished by chrome exterior moldings.  Unique features for the Town &amp; Country include pre-programmed driver's seat and mirror, standard leather interior, 8-way power adjustable front seats, [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity sound system]] with cassette/CD player.

Marking the retirement of the Chrysler crystal Pentastar hood ornament, the Town &amp; Country adopted the Chrysler medallion badge.  As part of a 1998 mid-cycle exterior revision, the front fascia underwent a revision, replacing the waterfall grille with a black eggcrate grille and a winged version of the Chrysler ribboned badge.

In 1997, the driver-side sliding door became standard on the Town &amp; Country (1996 examples produced without one are very rare).  For 1999, the middle-row bench seat configuration was deleted in favor of rear bucket seats.

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
Outside the United States and Canada, Chrysler exported the third-generation minivans to a number of global markets under the Chrysler (Grand) Voyager nameplate.  Using the body and interior of the Dodge Caravan, the Voyager was produced by Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri and by Eurostar in Graz, Austria.  For the first time, right-hand drive configurations were produced, allowing wide sales of the Chrysler Voyager in Australia and the United Kingdom.  Alongside the 3.0L, 3.3L, and 3.8L V6 engines of domestic-market minivans, the Chrysler Voyager was produced with 2.0L 4-cylinder engines shared with the Neon, along with a 2.5L diesel engine.  Along with automatic transmissions, a 5-speed manual transmission was offered (the only third-generation Chrysler minivan produced with a manual transmission).

In Brazil, Chrysler minivans were offered under the Chrysler Caravan nameplate, using Dodge Caravan bodyshells.
[[File:Dodge-Caravan.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dodge-Caravan.jpg|thumb|1996 Dodge Caravan (no driver-side sliding door)]]

=== Dodge Caravan ===
In a break from its predecessors, the third-generation Dodge Caravan was marketed distinctly from the Plymouth Voyager.  Replacing its role as the Dodge counterpart of the Voyager, the Caravan was remarketed to serve as the mid-range model of the Chrysler minivan product line.  In contrast to the chrome trim moldings of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, base, SE and LE trims shared gray moldings with the Voyager with model-specific front bumpers; the ES trim and vans equipped with the Sport package featured body-colored moldings.

As with the AS-platform vans, 7-passenger seating was offered on the Dodge Caravan, regardless of body length.  In 1999, the driver-side sliding door became an option on all versions of the Caravan.

For 1999, the Dodge Caravan ES was equipped with an [[Autostick#Chrysler%20Autostick|Autostick gear selector]] for its automatic transmission, a first for a minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/first.html|title=Chrysler minivan firsts|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to previous uses (the Eagle Vision TSi and the Plymouth Prowler), the Caravan ES placed the system selector on the end of the column-mounted shifter.
[[File:Plymouth Grand Voyager.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plymouth%20Grand%20Voyager.jpg|thumb|Plymouth Grand Voyager SE]]

=== Plymouth Voyager ===
In an effort to reposition the Plymouth division during the mid-1990s, Chrysler sought to focus the Plymouth brand on entry-level vehicles.  In place of serving as a direct counterpart of the Dodge Caravan, the third-generation Plymouth Voyager became the entry-level Chrysler minivan.  In a major change, for the first time, the Voyager and Caravan visually differed from one another.  Along with a dark gray eggcrate grille (a body-colored grille became optional starting with model year 1998), the Voyager adopted matte gray bumpers across all trim levels along with matte gray side moldings. Voyagers featured unique front bumpers not shared with other models and did not come with fog lights in all trim levels.

1996 marked the introduction of the Plymouth "sailboat" grille emblem; examples produced before calendar 1996 were produced with the Chrysler Pentastar, with latter vehicles bearing the sailboat emblem.

A Rallye option package (carried from the previous generation) was available on the SE trim.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1996 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1998, the Rallye trim was renamed Expresso.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1998 Plymouth Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==
In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to {{convert|80|mi|km}} on a single charge. The EPIC was sold as a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today.

== Concept vehicles ==
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of Chrysler minivan production, Chrysler unveiled three concept minivans, largely intended to further advance the divisional styling and design of each vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Chrysler Pacifica ===
&lt;p&gt;The [[Chrysler Pacifica (1999 concept vehicle)|Chrysler Pacifica]], derived from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, was given an exterior and interior restyling.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allcarindex.com/auto-car-model/United-States-Chrysler-Pacifica-Concept-1/|title=Chrysler - Pacifica Concept [1]|website=ACI|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to a full-size conversion van, the Pacifica was given a raised roof for increased headroom, with a full-length skylight. In a 2+2+2 seating layout, the Pacifica was fitted with power-operated middle-row seats (with power-operated footrests).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  The exterior adapted design elements of the flagship [[Chrysler LHS]] sedan, including a (smaller) version of its grille and modified versions of its headlamps.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to 2008, the Chrysler Pacifica nameplate saw use on a production vehicle, as a CUV derived from the Grand Caravan/Town &amp; Country.  For 2017, the Pacifica nameplate was again revived, used on the current generation of Chrysler-division minivans.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Dodge Caravan R/T ===
&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to the 1996 Dodge Caravan ESS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-ess/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} Car Reviews {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN ESS - FIRST TEST|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the 1999 Dodge Caravan R/T replaced the 3.8L V6 with the 3.5L V6 of the Chrysler 300M, increasing output to 253 hp, paired with the 4-speed AutoStick transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-2/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} News {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN - DODGE'S CORNER-CARVING CARAVAN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge Caravan adapted several styling elements from the Dodge Viper RT/10, including hoodscoops (carried directly over from the Viper), and a redesigned lower fascia that shifted the Dodge "crosshair" grille into the lower bumper (with the addition of foglamps from the Viper).  The interior featured a performance-oriented theme, with brushed aluminum trim for the trim and door panels, with black leather seats and racing-style pedals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2016, Dodge produced the Grand Caravan R/T as an trim variant, though the option was largely cosmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Plymouth Voyager XG ===
&lt;p&gt;Derived from the Plymouth Voyager, the Plymouth Voyager XG was a four-seat minivan geared towards active lifestyles of younger drivers.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carstyling.ru/en/car/1999_plymouth_voyager_xg/|title=1999 Plymouth Voyager XG - Concepts|last=Site-Mechanics|website=www.carstyling.ru|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Externally similar to the standard Voyager, the XG was distinguished by its 17-inch wheels (shared with the Plymouth Prowler), and body-color bumpers and grille.  The interior was given a full-length retractable fabric sunroof, with a large removable storage pod placed behind the seats.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Voyager XG featured the powertrain of the export-market Chrysler Voyager, with a 2.5L diesel engine and a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== Awards ==
&lt;p&gt;The new minivans earned unanimous critical acclaim: the Dodge Caravan was the 1996 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] (the first and only minivan to ever win the award), and the vans were on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724084058/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1996_10best_cars-10best_cars "1996 10Best Cars"], retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars "1997 10Best Cars"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730194234/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars|date=July 30, 2012}}, retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The '''Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers''' ('''CRESST''') is a collaboration of European experimental particle physics groups involved in the construction of cryogenic detectors for direct [[dark matter]] searches. The participating institutes are the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] ([[Munich]]), [[Technische Universität München]], [[Universität Tübingen]], [[University of Oxford]] (Great Britain) and the [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare]] (INFN, Italy).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cresst.de/people.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRESST collaboration currently runs an array of [[Cryogenic particle detectors|cryogenic detectors]] in the underground laboratory of the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]]. The modular detectors used by CRESST facilitate discrimination of [[background radiation]] events by the simultaneous measurement of [[phonon]] and [[photon]] signals from scintillating [[calcium tungstate]] crystals. By cooling the detectors to temperatures of a few [[millikelvin]], the excellent discrimination and energy resolution of the detectors allows identification of rare particle events.

CRESST-I took data in 2000 using sapphire detectors with tungsten thermometers. CRESST-II uses CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal [[Scintillator|scintillating]] [[calorimeter]]s.  It was prototyped in 2004 and had a 47.9&amp;nbsp;kg-day commissioning run in 2007 and operated 2009 to 2011. CRESST-II Phase 1 experiment observed excess events above known background that could be understood to constitute a dark matter signal. However, later analysis showed that these excess events were due to a previously uncounted for excess of background from the detector itself and not a true signal from dark matter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Jonathan|title=The Past and Future of Light Dark Matter Direct Detection|journal=Int. J. Mod. Phys. A|year=1530|volume=30|issue=15|page=1530038|doi=10.1142/S0217751X15300380|arxiv=1506.03924|bibcode=2015IJMPA..3030038D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the excess backgound in the detector was removed for Phase 2.

Phase 2 has a new CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal with better radiopurity, improved detectors, and significantly reduced background. It began July 2013 to explore excess signals in the prior run. The results of Phase 2 showed no signal above expected background, proving that the result of Phase 1 had indeed been due to excess background by components of the detector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CRESST-I first detected the alpha decay of tungsten. CRESST-II phase 1 full results were published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Results from 730 kg days of the CRESST-II Dark Matter search|last = |first = |date = Apr 12, 2012|journal = European Physical Journal C |volume=72 |issue=4 |page=1971 |accessdate = |doi = 10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-1971-8|pmid = |arxiv = 1109.0702 |bibcode = 2012EPJC...72.1971A |last1 = Angloher|first1 = G|last2 = Bauer|first2 = M|last3 = Bavykina|first3 = I|last4 = Bento|first4 = A|last5 = Bucci|first5 = C|last6 = Ciemniak|first6 = C|last7 = Deuter|first7 = G|last8 = von Feilitzsch|first8 = F|last9 = Hauff|first9 = D|last10 = Huff|first10 = P|last11 = Isaila|first11 = C|last12 = Jochum|first12 = J|last13 = Kiefer|first13 = M|last14 = Kimmerle|first14 = M|last15 = Lanfranchi|first15 = J. -C|last16 = Petricca|first16 = F|last17 = Pfister|first17 = S|last18 = Potzel|first18 = W|last19 = Pröbst|first19 = F|last20 = Reindl|first20 = F|last21 = Roth|first21 = S|last22 = Rottler|first22 = K|last23 = Sailer|first23 = C|last24 = Schäffner|first24 = K|last25 = Schmaler|first25 = J|last26 = Scholl|first26 = S|last27 = Seidel|first27 = W|last28 = Sivers|first28 = M. v|last29 = Stodolsky|first29 = L|last30 = Strandhagen|first30 = C|displayauthors = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New phase 2 results have been presented on July 2014 &lt;ref name="CRESSTII0714"&gt;The CRESST Collaboration, ''Results on low mass WIMPs using an upgraded CRESST-II detector'', https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3146&lt;/ref&gt; with a limit on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering for WIMP masses below 3 GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In 2015 the CRESST detectors were upgraded by a sensitivity factor of 100 allowing dark matter particles with a mass around that of a proton to be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://phys.org/news/2015-09-detectors-lightweight-dark-particles.html|title = New detectors allow search for lightweight dark matter particles|date = September 2015|accessdate = 14 September 2015|website = PhyOrg|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]] experiment is a planned successor to CRESST, ultimately aiming to run an array of detectors with a total mass of around 1 tonne.

'''Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid''' ('''DGLA''') is a 20-carbon [[Omega-6 fatty acid|ω−6 fatty acid]].  In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:3 (ω−6).   DGLA is a [[carboxylic acid]] with a 20-carbon chain and three ''[[Cis–trans isomerism|cis]]'' double bonds; the first double bond is located at the sixth carbon from the omega end.  DGLA is the elongation product of [[Gamma-linolenic acid|γ-linolenic acid]] (GLA; 18:3, ω−6). GLA, in turn, is a desaturation product ([[Delta 6 desaturase]]) of [[linoleic acid]] (18:2, ω−6). DGLA is made in the body by the elongation of GLA, by an efficient enzyme which does not appear to suffer any form of (dietary) inhibition. DGLA is an extremely uncommon fatty acid, found only in trace amounts in animal products.&lt;ref&gt;Horrobin, D. F., 1990a. 
Gamma linolenic acid.

Gamma-linolenic acid metabolism and its roles in nutrition and medicine. 
AOCS Press, Champagne, Illinois, 319 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  DGLA production from GLA is enhanced when high levels of [[alpha-linolenic acid]] are present, blocking the [[arachidonic acid]] pathway.&lt;ref&gt;http://gamalift.com.br/site/artigos/03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological effects==
The [[eicosanoid]] metabolites of DGLA are:
* Series-1 [[thromboxane]]s (thromboxanes with 1 double-bond), via the [[Cyclooxygenase|COX-1 and COX-2]] pathways.
* Series-1 [[prostanoid]]s, via the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fan, Yang-Yi  |author2=Robert S. Chapkin  | title=Importance of Dietary γ-Linolenic Acid in Human Health and Nutrition  | url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/128/9/1411  | date= 9 September 1998 | accessdate= 2007-10-16 | journal =Journal of Nutrition  | volume = 128 |issue = 9 |pages = 1411–4  | pmid=9732298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 15-hydroxyl derivative that blocks the transformation of [[arachidonic acid]] to [[leukotriene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Belch, Jill JF  |authorlink=Jill Belch |author2=Alexander Hill| title=Evening primrose oil and borage oil in rheumatologic conditions|date=January 2000| url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/71/1/352S|accessdate=February 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these effects are anti-inflammatory.  This is in marked contrast with the analogous metabolites of [[arachidonic acid]] (AA), which are the series-2 thromboxanes and prostanoids and the series-4 leukotrienes.  In addition to yielding anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, DGLA [[Competitive inhibitor|competes]] with AA for COX and lipoxygenase, inhibiting the production of AA's eicosanoids.

Taken orally in a small study, DGLA produced [[antithrombotic]] effects.&lt;ref name="pmid338112"&gt;{{cite journal

Internal strain within a metal is either [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]].  In the case of elastic strain this is observed as a distortion of the [[crystal lattice]], in the case of plastic strain this is observed by the presence of dislocations –the displacement of part of the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. Such strain effects can result in unwanted cracking of the material, as is the case with residual plastic strain. In other cases deliberate introduction of plastic strain results in a strengthening of the material and other performance enhancing behaviors, for example in the manufacture of [[Semiconductor|semi-conductors]] and [[solar cell]]s.

== Fundamentals ==
As an illustration, if you hang a weight on a spring it extends in direct proportion to the load.  That is the same effect that occurs in the elastic deformation part of the standard tensile test.

This is normally written as:  applied stress = [[Young's modulus|Young’s modulus]]  *  strain

That is: σ        =           Y                 *    e

Commonly known as:  [[Hooke’s Law]].

Where stress is a force ( a vector property) divided by the cross sectional area. Strain is the displacement (also a vector quantity) per unit length and is also a vector quantity.  A vector quantity requires three numbers to define its direction.  It can be represented then by a number with one subscript, Ui, where i takes the numbers 1 to 3.  Such a quantity can be referred to as a tensor of rank 1.  The rank refers to the number of subscripts.  The strains e can be formally written as a differential or gradient.  So that, if u1 was the extension in the x direction, we would write the strain as δu1/δx.   
We also know that when we stretch something it gets thinner in the direction normal to the stretch direction.  This is the [[Poisson effect]] and the ratio extension /contraction is the [[Poisson ratio]].

== Illustration of Poisson effect ==
{{Missing information|images|date=May 2018}}

This coupling of the different strains caused in a sample by the application of a stress classifies strain as a tensor property. In fact it is a second rank tensor because it consists of a 3 x 3 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and hence each element will need two suffixes to locate any one of its components in the matrix, i.e. eij.  The physical significance of this will be apparent later.

We set up a co-ordinate system based on some reference axes in the sample.  A convenient one for the case illustrated above is included in the figure.  It is a right handed system when reading the axes in the sequence x y z.   If we start at a point on the positive x axis and rotate towards the positive y axis in a clockwise direction then positive  z axis would point in the direction of movement of a right handed screw.

To keep it as clear as possible which reference axes we are using it is conventional often to refer to these axes as 1 2 and 3.  This is to allow easy identification of the strain terms as depicted in the tenor 3x3 matrix. The directions 1 2 and 3 are synonymous with the x y and z directions.

In a sample strained in tension ([[Tension (physics)|uni-axial tension]]) as in the above figure, the z axis has been strained in the positive sense, i.e. it becomes longer.  The strain term for this deformation is e33. The applied force is acting in the z direction.  The first subscript refers to the axis that is being strained and the second to the direction it is being strained.  Thus the first subscript 3 refers to the strain is occurring along the z axis and the second subscript to the fact that the strain is in the direction of the z axis.  Likewise for the strains e11 and e 22.   The strains e 11,  e 22 and e 33 are known as tensile or normal strains.
The force along z can also be resolved onto inclined planes causing these planes to shear resulting in [[shear strain]]s. It will also cause the crystal to rotate (called a rigid body rotation).  To illustrate this I include a more general deformation, as shown next.

Illustration of tensile and shear strains plus rotation in x z plane.
x y z right handed axis system, u1 u2 u3 displacements in x y z directions.
The figure shows only deformation, that is change of length and direction, in the x z plane for clarity. The tensile strains e11 and e 33 are shown plus the two strains e 13 and e 31.  Note  the differential form of these latter strains as shown in the figure.  Let us consider for now that there is no rotation. Then e 13 and e 31 represent the shear components alone and are in fact equal. The first of the subscript in both of e 13 and e31 signifies the plane that is sheared and the second component the axis defining the direction of shear.  Hence the first shear component e13 describes the shear of the plane normal to the x axis and in the z direction whilst the second, e31 defines the shear of the plane normal to the z axis in the x direction. 
Simple (mechanical) shear versus physics
Now some of you may say, ‘surely shear of a plane distorts a crystal’ as shown in the left sketch below.

Simple shear. (Engineering) Shear  (Physics)
Well this is true and is how engineers express it.  As shown in the right hand figure, the shear strain as used in engineering is twice that used by physicists.  Engineering strain measures the total strain in the xz  plane and is often given the symbol γ.  On the other hand,  e31, which remember  =  δu3/δx and in this case where there is no rotation, is simply the average of the strains on the z and x faces i.e. ε31 = ½(e31+e13). Note I have changed the symbol from e31 to ε31.  The symbol e31 refers to the strains as measured and may contain a rotational component. The symbol ε31 refers specifically to the shear strain component included in the e31 term.   You may need to note this when involved in discussion with engineers.  For consistency the Greek symbol ε is used instead of e for the tensile strains as well.
Tensors in Strain
Tensors: Geometric entities introduced into mathematics and physics to extend the notion of scalars, (geometric) vectors, and matrices. Many physical quantities are naturally regarded not as vectors themselves, but as correspondences between one set of vectors and another.

== Techniques for measuring strain ==
There is a wide variety of strain measurement techniques, depending on the resolution and precision required.  Larger scale methods include the use of [[strain gauge]]s.  For higher precision [[Raman scattering|Raman Spectroscopy]] and recently emerging techniques such as [[EBSD]] are used.
Traditional measurement of residual strain in metals is through x-ray diffraction.  Unfortunately this has major shortcomings in today’s applications and material’s development environment:
* Probe size (width) is too large for nano-scale material structures.
* Probe size (depth) is typically too large for nano-scale material structures.
Result: Diffraction volume is too large and individual grains (crystal lattices) cannot be observed or measured accurately.

The advanced application of the alternative diffraction technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) overcomes these limitations.  Software applications such as [http://www.vantagesoftwareinc.com/wp/products/ CrossCourt3] have enabled practical measurement at the nanoscale quite possible.

== Electron backscatter diffraction ==
The technique of [[Electron backscatter diffraction|EBSD]] produces patterns from the metal’s [[crystallography]] that consist of a well-defined geometric arrangement of bright bands edged by sharp lines.  These are known as Kikuchi bands and Kikuchi lines respectively. Elastic strain changes the width of these bands, and the angles between them plus a general rotation of the entire pattern.   The total result is a distortion that involves dilation of the crystal lattice (or unit cell) as a result of tensile and compressive strains, shear strains and rotation.  A complete description of internal elastic strain requires that all these crystallographic parameters be measured.  This is a benefit of advanced or high accuracy EBSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Angus J.|last2=Britton|first2=T.

Eng. Gas Turbines Power, July 1985, Volume 107, Issue 3, 596 (11 pages), {{doi|10.1115/1.3239778}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important in turbine off-design calculations.

== Description ==
[[File:Zoelly turbine, section (Heat Engines, 1913).jpg|thumb|180px| Multistage turbine.]]
[[File:Stodola's cone not choked.svg|thumb|180px| Stodola's cone for a turbine not choked.]]
[[File:Stodola's cone choked.svg|thumb|180px| Stodola's cone for a turbine with the last stage choked.]]
We consider a multistage turbine, like in the picture. The design calculation is done for design [[mass flow rate|flow rate]] (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \dot m_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;, the flow expected for the most uptime). The other parameters for design are the [[temperature]] and pressure at the stage group intake, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively the extraction pressure at the stage group outlet &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; (the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is used for the pressure after a stage nozzles, pressure does not interfere in relations here).

For off-design calculations, the off-design flow rate is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \dot m_{01} \,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively the temperature and pressure at the stage group intake are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_{01} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{01} \,&lt;/math&gt; and the outlet pressure is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Stodola established experimentally that the relationship between these three parameters represented in [[Cartesian coordinate system]] has the shape of a degenerate [[quadric]] surface, the [[conical surface|cone directrix]] being an [[ellipse]].&lt;ref name="C300"&gt;Creța, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L175"&gt;Leyzerovich, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; For a constant initial pressure &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{01} \,&lt;/math&gt; the flow rate depends on the outlet pressure &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt; as an arc of ellipse in a plane parallel to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \dot m_{01} \,0\, p_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt;

For very low outlet pressure &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt;, like for [[steam turbine|condensing turbines]], flow rates do not change with the outlet pressure, but drops very quickly with the increase of the backpressure. For a given outlet pressure &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt;, flow rates changes depending on the inlet pressure &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{01} \,&lt;/math&gt; as an arc of [[hyperbola]] in a plane parallel to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \dot m_{01} \,0\, p_{01} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Usually, Stodola's cone do not represent absolute flow rates and pressures, but relative to the maximum flow rate and pressures, the maximum values of the diagram having in this case the value of 1. The maximum flow rate has the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \dot m_{0m} \,&lt;/math&gt; and the maximum pressures at the inlet and outlet have the symbols &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{0m} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_{2m} \,&lt;/math&gt;. The pressure ratios for design flow rate at the intake and outlet are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_0 = p_0 / p_{0m} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_2 = p_2 / p_{2m} \,&lt;/math&gt;, and the off-design ratios are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_{01} = p_{01} / p_{0m} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_{21} = p_{21} / p_{2m} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[speed of sound]] is reached in a stage, the group of stages can be analyzed till that stage, which is the last in the group, the remaining stages forming another group of analysis. This division is imposed by the stage working in ''limited'' (choked) mode. The cone is shifted in the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0\, p_{02} \,&lt;/math&gt; axis direction, appearing a triangular surface, depending on the critical pressure ratio &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_c = p_c / p_{01} \,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p_c \,&lt;/math&gt; is the outlet critical pressure of the stage group.&lt;ref name="C301"&gt;Creța, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L176"&gt;Leyzerovich, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytical expression of the flow ratio is:&lt;ref name="C303"&gt;Creța, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot m_0}{\dot m_{01}} = \sqrt{\frac{T_{01}}{T_0}} \sqrt{\frac {\epsilon_0^2 (1 - \epsilon_c)^2 - (\epsilon_2 - \epsilon_c \epsilon_0)^2}{\epsilon_{01}^2 (1 - \epsilon_c)^2 - (\epsilon_{21} - \epsilon_c \epsilon_{01})^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For condensing turbine the ratio &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_c \,&lt;/math&gt; is very low, previous relation reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot m_0}{\dot m_{01}} = \sqrt{\frac{T_{01}}{T_0}} \sqrt{\frac {\epsilon_0^2 - \epsilon_2^2}{\epsilon_{01}^2 - \epsilon_{21}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
simplified relationship obtained theoretically by Gustav Flügel (1885–1967).&lt;ref name="C303"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L174"&gt;Leyzerovich, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event that the variation of inlet temperature is low, the relationship is simplified:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot m_0}{\dot m_{01}} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0^2 - \epsilon_2^2}{\epsilon_{01}^2 - \epsilon_{21}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
For condensing turbines &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_2 \, \approx \, \epsilon_{21} \, \approx \, 0&lt;/math&gt;, so in this case:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot m_0}{\dot m_{01}} = \frac{\epsilon_0}{\epsilon_{01}} = \frac{p_0}{p_{01}}&lt;/math&gt;

During operation, the above relations allow the assessment of the flow rate depending on the operating pressure of a stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">'''Energy management''' includes planning and operation of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption]] units. Objectives are [[Energy conservation|resource conservation]], [[climate protection]] and [[Saving|cost savings]], while the users have permanent access to the energy they need. It is connected closely to [[environmental management]], [[Manufacturing process management|production management]], [[logistics]] and other established business functions. The [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI-Guideline]] 4602 released a definition which includes the economic dimension: “Energy management is the proactive, organized and systematic coordination of procurement, [[Energy transformation|conversion]], [[Energy distribution|distribution]] and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;VDI-Guideline VDI 4602, page 3, Beuth Verlag, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency ==

===Base line of energy assessment===
One of initial steps for an effective energy cost control program is the base line energy assessment, which examines the pattern of existing energy usage by the government or any sub-entity of the government or private organization. This program will set the reference point for improvements in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can improve the existing energy usage and benchmarking of every individual section such as area, sub-area and the industry etc .

== Organizational integration ==
It is important to integrate the energy management in the organizational structure, so that the energy management can be implemented. Responsibilities and the interaction of the decision makers should be regularized. The delegation of functions and competencies extend from the top management to the executive worker. Furthermore, a comprehensive [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] can ensure the fulfillment of the tasks.

It is advisable to establish a separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track. It depends on the basic form of the [[organizational structure]], where this unit is connected. In case of a [[functional organization]] the unit is located directly between the first ([[CEO]]) and the second hierarchical level (corporate functions such as production, [[procurement]], [[marketing]]). In a divisional organization, there should be a central and several sector-specific energy management units. So the diverse needs of the individual [[Sector (economic)|sector]]s and the coordination between the branches and the head office can be fulfilled. In a [[matrix management|matrix organization]] the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.

== Energy management in operational functions ==

=== Facility management ===
[[Facility management]] is an important part of energy management, because a huge proportion (average 25 per cent) of complete [[operating cost]]s are energy costs. According to the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA), facility management is "a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, processes and technology."

The central task of energy management is to reduce costs for the provision of energy in buildings and facilities without compromising work processes. Especially the availability and service life of the equipment and the ease of use should remain the same. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA e.V.) has published guidelines (e.g. GEFMA 124-1 and 124-2), which contain methods and ways of dealing with the integration of energy management in the context of a successful facility management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gefma.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/GEFMA124-1S1.2009-11.pdf|title=GEFMA: Energiemanagement Grundlagen und Leistungsbild|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topic the facility manager has to deal with economic, ecological, risk-based and quality-based targets. He tries to minimize the total cost of the energy-related processes (supply, distribution and use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy20.net/pi/index.php?StoryID=317&amp;articleID=154847 |title=viewed 10. November 2012 |publisher=Energy20.net |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The '''Passivhaus''' uses a combination of [[:category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies]]

The most important key figure in this context is [[kilowatt-hour]]s per square meter per year (kWh/m²a). Based on this key figure properties can be classified according to their energy consumption.

* Europe: In Germany a [[low-energy house]] can have a maximum energy consumption of 70 kWh/m²a.
*North America: In the [[United States]], the [[ENERGY STAR]] program is the largest program defining low-energy homes. Homes earning ENERGY STAR certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the International Residential Code, although homes typically achieve 20%-30% savings.&lt;ref&gt;"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes." - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Passive house]] (Passivhaus in German) ultra-low-energy standard, currently undergoing adoption in some other European countries, has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kWh/m²a. A Passive House is a very well-insulated and virtually air-tight building. It does not require a conventional heating system. It is heated by solar gain and internal gains from people. Energy losses are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm |title=retrieved 8 December 2012 |publisher=Passiv.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also buildings that produce more energy (for example by [[solar water heating]] or [[photovoltaic system]]s) over the course of a year than it imports from external sources. These buildings are called [[energy-plus-house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusenergiehaus.de/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=8&amp;L=0&amp;host=1#a1 |title=retrieved 3 December 2012 |publisher=Plusenergiehaus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work regulations manage competencies, roles and responsibilities. Because the systems also include risk factors (e.g., oil tanks, gas lines), you must ensure that all tasks are clearly described and distributed. A clear regulation can help to avoid liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung, p. 75 – 77, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
[[File:A8 bei Derching LKW Richtung München MAN Mercedes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Carriage of goods]]
Logistics is the [[management]] of the flow of [[resources]] between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet some requirements, for example of customers or corporations. Especially the core logistics task, transportation of the goods, can save costs and protect the environment through efficient energy management. The relevant factors are the choice of means of transportation, duration and length of transportation and cooperation with logistics service providers.

The logistics causes more than 14% percent of CO2 emissions worldwide. For this reason the term [[Green Logistics]] is becoming increasingly important.

Possible courses of action in terms of green logistics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |title=retrieved on November 10, 2012 |publisher=Iml.fraunhofer.de |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010036/http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Shift to ecofriendly transport carrier such as railroad and waterway
* Route and load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

Besides transportation of goods, the transport of persons should be an important part of the logistic strategy of organizations. In case of business trips it is important to attract attention to the choice and the proportionality of the means of transport. It should be balanced whether a physical presence is mandatory or a telephone or video conference is just as useful. Home Office is another possibility in which the company can protect the environment indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy procurement ===
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services. Energy prices fluctuate constantly, which can significantly affect the energy bill of organizations. Therefore poor energy procurement decisions can be expensive. Organizations can control and reduce energy costs by taking a proactive and efficient approach to buying energy. Even a change of the energy source can be a profitable and eco-friendly alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energieagentur.nrw.de/unternehmen/energiebeschaffung-3699.asp |title=retrieved 10 November 2012 |publisher=Energieagentur.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This central process may differ depending on the industry. Industrial companies have facilities that require a lot of energy. Service companies, in turn, do not need many materials, their energy-related focus is mainly facility management or Green IT. Therefore the energy-related focus has to be identified first, then evaluated and optimize.

=== Production planning and control ===
Usually, production is the area with the largest energy consumption within an organization. Therefore also the production planning and control becomes very important. It deals with the operational, temporal, quantitative and spatial planning, control and management of all processes that are necessary in the production of goods and commodities. The "production planner" should plan the production processes so that they operate in an energy efficient way. For example, strong power consumer can be moved into the night time. Peaks should be avoided for the benefit of a unified [[load profile]].

The impending changes in the structure of energy production require an increasing demand for storage capacity. The Production planning and control has to deal with the problem of limited [[energy storage|storability of energy]]. In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/Press/press-releases,did=487632.html |title=retrieved 6 December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is the combination of all technical and administrative actions, including supervision actions, intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard Glossary of terms (3811:1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed maintenance is essential to support the energy management. Hereby power losses and cost increases can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps-consulting.de/industrie/IH-Energiemanagement.html |title=abgerufen am 12. November 2012 |publisher=Ps-consulting.de |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management challenge===
Through the energy efficiency it management is remain the key for the any industrial user across globe , to achieve  the energy management goal for the federal government or  industry  the efficiency of water and energy resources play a vital role

Examples of how it is possible to save energy and costs with the help of maintenance:

* Defrost the fridges
* Check the barometer of cars and trucks
* Insulation of hot systems
* Improve leaks in building envelopes

== Energy strategies ==
A long-term energy strategy should be part of the overall strategy of a company. This strategy may include the objective of increasing the use of renewable energies. Furthermore, criteria for decisions on energy investments, such as yield expectations, are determined.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, S. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; By formulating an energy strategy companies have the opportunity to avoid risks and to assure a competitive advance against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential energy strategies ===
According to Kals there are the following energy strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Passive Strategy: There is no systematic planning. The issue of energy and environmental management is not perceived as an independent field of action. The organization only deals with the most essential subjects.
* Strategy of short-term profit maximization: The management is concentrating exclusively on measures that have a relatively short [[payback period]] and a high return. Measures with low profitability are not considered.
* Strategy of long-term profit maximization: This strategy includes that you have a high knowledge of the energy price and technology development. The relevant measures (for example, [[heat exchanger]]s or [[power station]]s) can have durations of several decades. Moreover, these measures can help to improve the [[image]] and increase the [[motivation]] of the employees.
* Realization of all financially attractive energy measures: This strategy has the goal to implement all measures that have a positive return on investment.
* Maximum strategy: For the climate protection one is willing to change even the object of the company.

In reality, you usually find hybrid forms of different strategies.

=== Energy strategies of companies ===
Many companies are trying to promote its image and time protect the climate through a proactive and public energy strategy. [[General Motors]] (GM) strategy is based on continuous improvement. Furthermore they have six principles: e.g. restoring and preserving the environment, reducing waste and pollutants, educating the public about environmental conservation, collaboration for the development of environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/vision/environment1/our_commitment.html |title=retrieved 21. December 2012 |publisher=Gm.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nokia]] created its first climate strategy in 2006. The strategy tries to evaluate the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of products and operations and sets reduction targets accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/operations/operations/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their environmental efforts is based on four key issues: substance management, energy efficiency, recycling, promoting environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/strategy/strategy-and-reports/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy strategy of [[Volkswagen]] (VW) is based on environmentally friendly products and a resource-efficient production according to the "Group Strategy 2018".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/sustainability_and_responsibility/Model_of_Sustainable_Development/Strategy_2018.html |title=retrieved 22. December 2012. |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all locations of the Group are certified to the international standard ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html retrieved 22. December 2012.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083829/http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the energy strategies of companies it is important to you have the topic [[greenwashing]] in mind. This is a form of propaganda in which green strategies are used to promote the opinion that an organization's aims are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/ |title=retrieved 16.01.2013 |publisher=Greenwashingindex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy strategies of politics ===
Even many countries formulate energy strategies. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided in May 2011 to resign nuclear energy medium-dated. The nuclear power plants will be shut down at the end of life and will not be replaced. In Compensation they put the focus on energy efficiency, [[renewable energies]], [[fossil energy]] sources and the development of [[water power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00526/00527/index.html?lang=de |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has clear instructions for its members. The "20-20-20-targets" include, that the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, increase energy efficiency by 20% and achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085821/http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and normative basis of the energy strategies ===
The basis of every energy strategy is the [[corporate culture]] and the related ethical standards applying in the company.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethics]], in the sense of [[business ethics]], examines ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. Ethical standards can appear in company guidelines, energy and environmental policies or other documents.

The most relevant ethical ideas for the energy management are:

* [[Utilitarianism]]: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the [[internalization]] of [[external cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse ethics|Argumentation Ethics]]: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the [[Decision making|decision]], must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair [[dialogue]], the result is completely uncertain.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"&gt;Johannes Kals: Business Ethics and Corporate Energy Management, in: Karczewski, Leszek; Kretek, Henryk (eds): Odpowiedzialny biznes i konsumerysm wyzwaniem XXI Wieku (Responsible Business and Responsible Consumerism as a Challenge of the 21st Century), Polen, Raciborz 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deontological ethics]]: The deontological ethics assigns individuals and organizations certain obligations. A general example is the [[golden rule]]: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself." Therefore everyone should manage their duties and make an energy economic contribution.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"/&gt;

A '''fiber optic current sensor (FOCS)''' is a [[current sensor]] for measuring [[direct current]].  By using a single-ended optical fiber around the current conductor that utilizes the magneto-optic effect ([[Faraday effect]]), FOCS measures uni- or bidirectional DC currents of up to 600&amp;nbsp;kA within ±0.1% of the measured value.&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;{{cite web|title=FOCS – Fiber-Optic Current Sensor: make light work of DC current measurement |url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot232.nsf/veritydisplay/74d5555d2a9c2998c12579a00038ff0a/$file/FOCS_brochure_3BHS362996_E01.pdf |year=2011 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2}}&lt;ref name="ABB"&gt;{{cite web|title= Fiber-Optic Current Sensor FOCS |url= http://www.abb.com/product/seitp322/87658a38b941842dc1256f480034c11c.aspx?productLanguage=us&amp;country=00|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it does not need a magnetic yoke, an FOCS is smaller and lighter than [[Hall effect]] current sensors, and suffers no reduction in accuracy due to saturation effects.  Because magnetic field sensing is distributed around circumference, it is unaffected by stray magnetic fields, and there is no need for magnetic centering.  It also does not need recalibration after installation or during its service life.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABB" /&gt;  Because the optical fiber is inherently insulating, electrical isolation is easier to maintain.

The optical phase detection circuit, light source and digital signal processor are contained within the sensor electronics; this technology has been proven in highly demanding applications such as navigation systems in the air, on land and at sea.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{Rp|5}}

==Applications==
[[File:DCB with FOCS.jpg|thumb|A disconnecting circuit breaker with integrated FOCS]]
In 2013, [[ABB Group|ABB]] launched a 420&amp;nbsp;kV [[Circuit breaker#Disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB)|Disconnecting Circuit Breaker]] (DCB) with integrated FOCS. Since one FOCS replaces many conventional [[current transformer]]s,{{dubious |reason=Why should the number of required current sensors depend on the technology used? |date=December 2015}} engineering and design of the [[Electrical substation|substation]] is simplified. By reducing the material needed, including insulation, a 420&amp;nbsp;kV DCB with integrated FOCS can reduce a substation’s [[ecological footprint|footprint]] by over 50% compared to the conventional solution of [[circuit breaker#High-voltage circuit breakers|live tank breakers]] with [[disconnector]]s and [[current transformer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=362–550 kV Disconnecting Circuit Breaker with FOCS: Small, smart and flexible |page=1 |url=http://search-ext.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=1HSM%209543%2021-10en&amp;LanguageCode=en&amp;DocumentPartId=&amp;Action=Launch |year=2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a school teacher, Ohm began his research with the new [[electrochemical cell]], invented by Italian scientist [[Alessandro Volta]]. Using equipment of his own creation, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference ([[voltage]]) applied across a conductor and the resultant [[electric current]]. This relationship is known as [[Ohm's law]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Georg Simon Ohm was born into a [[Protestant]] family in [[Erlangen]], [[Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] (then a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]), son to Johann Wolfgang Ohm, a locksmith and Maria Elizabeth Beck, the daughter of a tailor in Erlangen. Although his parents had not been formally educated, Ohm's father was a respected man who had educated himself to a high level and was able to give his sons an excellent education through his own teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, Joseph F. (1999). ''The Story of Electrical and Magnetic Measurements: From 500 BC to the 1940s''. John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven children of the family only three survived to adulthood: Georg Simon, his younger brother [[Martin Ohm|Martin]], who later became a well-known mathematician, and his sister Elizabeth Barbara. His mother died when he was ten.

From early childhood, Georg and Martin were taught by their father who brought them to a high standard in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[philosophy]]. Georg Simon attended Erlangen Gymnasium from age eleven to fifteen where he received little in the area of scientific training, which sharply contrasted with the inspired instruction that both Georg and Martin received from their father. This characteristic made the Ohms bear a resemblance to the [[Bernoulli family]], as noted by [[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]], a professor at the [[Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]].

===Life in university===

Georg Ohm's father, concerned that his son was wasting his educational opportunity, sent Ohm to Switzerland. There in September 1806 Ohm accepted a position as a mathematics teacher in a school in Gottstadt bei Nidau.

[[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]] left the University of Erlangen in early 1809 to take up a post in the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]]. Ohm wanted to  restart his mathematical studies with Langsdorf in [[Heidelberg]]. Langsdorf, however, advised Ohm to pursue mathematical studies on his own, and suggested that Ohm read works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Sylvestre François Lacroix|Lacroix]]. Rather reluctantly Ohm took his advice but he left his teaching post in [[Gottstatt Monastery]] in March 1809 to become a private tutor in [[Neuchâtel]]. For two years he carried out his duties as a tutor while he followed Langsdorf's advice and continued his private study of mathematics. Then in April 1811 he returned to the University of Erlangen.

===Teaching career===

Ohm's own studies prepared him for his [[doctorate]] which he received from the University of Erlangen on October 25, 1811.  He immediately joined the faculty there as a lecturer in mathematics but left after three semesters because of unpromising prospects. He could not survive on his salary as a lecturer. The  [[Bavaria|Bavarian government]] offered him a post as a teacher of mathematics and physics at a poor quality school in [[Bamberg]] which Ohm accepted in January 1813. Unhappy with his job, Georg began writing an elementary textbook on [[geometry]] as a way to prove his abilities. That school was closed in February 1816. The Bavarian government then sent Ohm to an overcrowded school in Bamberg to help out with the teaching of mathematics.
[[File:Denkmal Ohm TU München.jpg|thumb|Memorial for Ohm (by [[Wilhelm von Rümann]]) at the [[Technical University of Munich]], Campus Theresienstrasse]]

After his assignment in Bamberg, Ohm sent his completed manuscript to [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Wilhelm III of Prussia]]. The King was satisfied with Ohm's book, and offered Ohm a position at the [[Dreikönigsgymnasium|Jesuit Gymnasium]] of [[Cologne]] on 11 September 1817. This school had a reputation for good science education and Ohm was required to teach physics in addition to mathematics. The physics laboratory was well equipped, allowing Ohm to begin experiments in physics. As the son of a locksmith, Ohm had some practical experience with mechanical devices.

Ohm published ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically'') in 1827. Ohm's college did not appreciate his work and Ohm resigned from his position. He then made an application to, and was employed by, the [[Technische Hochschule Nürnberg|Polytechnic School of Nuremberg]]. Ohm arrived at the Polytechnic School of Nuremberg in 1833, and in 1852 he became a professor of experimental physics at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}}

In 1849, Ohm published ''Beiträge zur Molecular-Physik'', (in English: Molecular Physics). In the preface of this work he stated he hoped to write a second and third volume "and if God gives me length of days for it, a fourth". However, on finding that an original discovery recorded in it was being anticipated by a Swedish scientist he did not publish it, stating: "The episode has given a fresh and deep sense for my mind to the saying 'Man proposes, and God disposes'. The project that gave the first impetus to my inquiry has been dissipated into mist, and a new one, undesigned by me, has been accomplished in its place."&lt;ref&gt;Kneller, Karl Alois; Kettle, Thomas Michael (1911).

Ohm died in Munich in 1854,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}} and is buried in the [[Alter Südfriedhof]]. A collection of his family letters would be compiled in a German book, which shows that he used to sign some of his letters with the expression ''"Gott befohlen, G S Ohm,"''&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simon Ohm (2002), ''Georg Simon Ohm: nachgelassene Schriften und Dokumente aus seinem Leben : mit Schriftstücken seiner Vorfahren und Briefen seines Bruders Martin''. Palm und Enke. p. 216; 219&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Commended to God".&lt;ref&gt;Leopold von Ranke (1966), ''History of the Reformation in Germany, Volume 2''. F. Unger Publishing Company, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Ohm's law==
{{further|Ohm's Law}}

Ohm's law first appeared{{efn|Ohm's law, that electric current is proportional to a potential difference, was first discovered by [[Henry Cavendish]], but Cavendish did not publish his electrical discoveries in his lifetime and they did not become known until 1879, long after Ohm had independently made the discovery and published himself. Thus the law came to bear the name of Ohm.}} in the famous book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (tr., ''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically'') (1827) in which he gave his complete theory of electricity. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}} In this work, he stated his law for [[electromotive force]] acting between the extremities of any part of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] is the product of the strength of the [[electric current|current]], and the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of that part of the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Die galvanische kette: mathematisch By Georg Simon Ohm [https://books.google.com/books?id=29gPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 Pg. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically By Georg Simon Ohm [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qkh8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA202 Pg. 202]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book begins with the mathematical background necessary for an understanding of the rest of the work. While his work greatly influenced the theory and applications of current electricity,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; it was coldly received at that time. Ohm presents his theory as one of contiguous action, a theory which opposed the concept of [[action at a distance]]. Ohm believed that the communication of electricity occurred between "contiguous particles" which is the term he himself used. The paper is concerned with this idea, and in particular with illustrating the differences in this scientific approach of Ohm's and the approaches of [[Joseph Fourier]] and [[Claude-Louis Navier]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Pourprix, "G. S. Ohm théoricien de l'action contiguë," ''Archives internationales d'histoire des sciences'' '''45'''(134) (1995), pp. 30–56&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the [[conceptual framework]] used by Ohm in producing Ohm's law has been presented by Archibald.&lt;ref&gt;T Archibald, "Tension and potential from Ohm to Kirchhoff," ''Centaurus'' '''31''' (2) (1988), pp. 141–163&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Ohm marked the early beginning of the subject of [[circuit theory]], although this did not become an important field until the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitold Belevitch|Belevitch, V]], "Summary of the history of circuit theory", ''Proceedings of the IRE'', '''vol 50''', Iss 5, pp. 848–855, May 1962 {{doi|10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288301}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohm's acoustic law==
{{further|Ohm's acoustic law}}

Ohm's acoustic law, sometimes called the acoustic phase law or simply Ohm's law, states that a musical sound is perceived by the ear as a set of a number of constituent pure harmonic tones.  It is well known to be not quite true.&lt;ref&gt;

==Study and publications==

His writings were numerous. With his first paper in 1825, Ohm looks into the decrease in the electromagnetic force produced by a wire as the length of the wire increased. In 1826, he gave a description of conduction in circuits modeled on Fourier's study of heat conduction. This paper continue Ohm's deduction of results from experimental evidence and, particularly in the second, he was able to propose laws which went a long way to explaining results of others working on galvanic electricity.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html &lt;/ref&gt; The most important was his pamphlet published in [[Berlin]] in 1827, with the title ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet''. This work, the germ of which had appeared during the two preceding years in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, has exerted an important influence on the development of the theory and applications of [[electric current]].  Ohm's name has been incorporated in the terminology of [[Electrical engineering|electrical science]] in Ohm's Law (which he first published in ''Die galvanische Kette''...),&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Ohm, Georg Simon |volume=20 |page=34|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of current and [[voltage]] in a [[resistor]], and adopted as the [[SI]] unit of [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (symbol Ω).

Although Ohm's work strongly influenced theory, at first it was received with little enthusiasm. However, his work was eventually recognized by the [[Royal Society]] with its award of the [[Copley Medal]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Societies/CopleyMedal.html  Winners of the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a foreign member of the Royal Society in 1842, and in 1845 he became a full member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. At some extent, [[Charles Wheatstone]] drew attention to the definitions which Ohm had introduced in the field of physics.&lt;ref&gt;Merz, John Theodore (1903). ''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofeuropea01merziala#page/364/mode/2up "A history of European thought in the nineteenth century"]'', pp. 365–366&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9545">'''Hot zone''', also written as '''hot-zone''' or '''hotzone''', refers to an area that is considered to be dangerous. It generally entails special equipment to protect occupants, because there is a high risk of infection.

== Etymology ==
The term ''hot zone'' was likely coined during the [[Cold War]] where it described locations rendered hazardous due to nuclear contamination. The term was later extended to areas or locations considered to be hazardous such as [[biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Level-4 biosafety]] labs, places in which there is active conflict, and so forth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The term ''hot zone'' was popularized by the book ''[[The Hot Zone]]'' by [[Richard Preston]], and the film ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Types of hot zones==
===Biological===
{{main|Biosafety level}}
Hazardous biological agents can induce a hot zone, as occupants are in danger of becoming infected. These biological contaminants can include many things. Some common examples would be bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Many times these are used as biological warfare, or biowarfare, agents with the intent to harm.

Precautions are taken in a gradient level of protection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 2009, the outbreak of swine influenza happened in most places of the whole world. The swine influenza originated from a Mexican woman, and it was transmitted from person to person by air with a rapid speed. North America and Mexico were the first places to be affected by the virus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last=Gangurde | first=H. H.
 | title=Swine influenza A (H1N1 virus): a pandemic disease
 | journal=Surgical Neurology International
 | year=2011 | volume=2 | issue=2 | pages=110–124
 | doi=10.4103/0975-8453.86300
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 14,142 deaths of swine influenza, and 1,311,522 people had this virus in their bodies in 2009. Spain, China, the United States, and South Korea are considered to be hot zones of swine influenza. There were 155,051 people who had this virus in Spain, 120,498 in China, 107,939 in United State and 101,182 in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WHO|title=2009 swine influenza}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The people in those areas can very easily get 
this virus. The virus is transmittable through the air, such as through coughing, sneezing or touching something containing the virus. Epidemics of acute respiratory disease of pigs are caused by the virus disease, swine influenza. Swine influenza belongs to the type A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The patients with swine influenza virus have symptoms consisting of headaches, chills, fatigue, fever, cough and sore throat.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==== Malaria ====
In Peru deforestation is leading to the distribution of Malaria. With the forests being destroyed the wildlife is as well, leaving malaria looking for a new host. Malaria is a very dangerous disease, so much so that vaccinations are required for traveling into places suspected of housing the disease. Malaria is a disease that is found predominantly in third world, low-income countries. Malaria along with other insect diseases are learning to adapt to life in the city. In Peru a port city called Iquitos the population has been growing in the past 10 years making it prime for mosquitoes to flourish. These mosquitoes also bring in Dengue Fever, in which 5 percent of its victims will die.&lt;ref name="Hot Zones"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Zones|url=https://www.pbs.org/journeytoplanetearth/about/hotzones.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clean water ====
With an increased world population in the early 21st century water borne diseases have become the most pressing hot zone. With a lot of the worlds population moving into the city it is hard separating sanitation and clean water. In the early 90's a cholera epidemic broke out in a fishing village in Lima, Peru. Many thought that this was coming from the seafood, but it was really from the water the seafood was cleaned with. Cholera starts when infected human waste seeps into the water supply of a community. Not having a clean water supply is something that affects a third world country the most,though there are cases of poor water in the States. In Maryland's Chesapeake Bay fisherman have seen a decline in their catch over the last couple of years. A few years ago fisherman of Maryland's Chesapeake Bay area started noticing lesions on the crabs and fish they caught and soon the fisherman were sick themselves. Industrial waste, sewage and pesticides have slowly sunk into the Chesapeake Bay over the past decade.&lt;ref name="Hot Zones"/&gt;

===Chemical===
Hazardous chemicals can induce a hot zone, as occupants are in danger of it disrupting their biological processes. For example, if while driving down a highway, an oil tanker gets into a car accident and spills its load on the pavement and surrounding grass areas, those areas affected will be considered hot zones. To correct these incidents, fire departments will deploy their HAZMAT, or hazardous materials, teams to reder the area safe once again. These types of spills can be harmful to people and to the environment because they are not meant to be there and therefore contaminate the land.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Nuclear===
[[Radioactive contamination]] can create a hot zone, as occupants are in danger of being exposed to radiation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and its accompanying tsunami struck a nuclear power station in Fukushima Daiichi area of north-eastern Japan. A number of safety systems were badly 
damaged by the tsunami leading to a loss-of-coolant (LOCA) event which damaged the nuclear core of several reactors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Von Hippel|first=F, N.|title=). The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|year=2011|volume=67|issue=5|pages=27–36|doi=10.1177/0096340211421588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) announced that the subsequent release of radioactivity into atmosphere qualified as the highest level of radiological event scale, INES level 7.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The radioactive materials released in Fukushima Daiichi area are mostly iodine-131 and cesium-137.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamauchi|first=M|title=Settlement process of|journal=Annales Geophysicae|year=2011|volume=30|issue=1|pages=49–56|doi=10.5194/angeo-30-49-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency estimated the cancer consequence of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. From the government statistics, around the two million people who live within 80 kilometre radius of the nuclear plate, and about one million people live in areas contaminated with cesium-137.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==== Land contamination ====
The loss of coolant further caused hydrogen explosions in the facility. As the fuel temperature went up, zirconium alloy cladding reacted with the hot steam removing oxygen from water molecule, leaving hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas was ultimately vented off into the reactor building, because of the design of the facility, mixing with air and creating an explosive environment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==== Disease ====
Diseases are estimated that thyroid cancer is the main cancer which affected by the nuclear accident. High amount of radioactive iodine mainly causes thyroid cancer, and most of the cases are the result of releasing iodine-131. If people consume food and water contaminated by iodine-131, iodine-131 (which has a half-life of 8 days) concentrates in the thyroid. The most contaminated food and drink are raw milk and vegetables in Fukushima Daiichi area. Milk production was blocked after six days of the nuclear explosion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Nuclear accidents are very serious matters. As you can see from the above statements, they can cause massive panic, disease, and not to mention the fact that humans and other organisms may not be able to inhabit the affected area for many years to come. A perfect example of this is the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, Ukraine. Chernobyl is near Pripyat, Ukraine and also the country of Belarus. Chernobyl is now a ghost town. They had a malfunction with their nuclear power plant, and now there is still a hot zone there. This hot zone actually has a name, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

===Violence===
Violence can induce a hot zone, as occupants are subject to attacks, crossfire, or even direct fire targeted at them specifically. The most identifiable violent hot zones are in war zones, such as the war in Afghanistan. Soldiers are constantly fighting with other soldiers and insurgents to attempt to accomplish tactical goals. Hot zones are not good places to appear as a member of either of the opposing teams, because one may be prone to attacks or capture. Although war zones may have the most targeted attacks, crime ridden neighborhoods are the most common areas for crossfire to occur, and subsequently the most victims of crossfire are here.

Sandy developed from a [[tropical wave]] in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, quickly strengthened, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sandy six hours later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the [[Greater Antilles]] and gradually intensified. On October 24, Sandy became a hurricane, made landfall near [[Kingston, Jamaica]], re-emerged a few hours later into the Caribbean Sea and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane.

===Forecasts===
On October 23, 2012, the path of Hurricane Sandy was correctly predicted by the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]] (ECMWF) headquartered in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading, England]] nearly eight days in advance of its striking the [[East Coast of the United States|American East Coast]]. The computer model noted that the storm would turn west towards land and strike the New York/New Jersey region on October 29, rather than turn east and head out to the open Atlantic as most hurricanes in this position do. By October 27, four days after the ECMWF made its prediction, the [[National Weather Service]] and [[National Hurricane Center]] confirmed the path of the hurricane predicted by the European model. The National Weather Service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its European counterpart did. A hardware and software upgrade completed at the end of 2013 enabled the weather service to make more accurate predictions, and do so far more in advance than the technology in 2012 had allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vergano|first=Dan|title=U.S. forecast's late arrival stirs weather tempest|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2012/10/30/sandy-hurricane-models/1668867/w|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=October 5, 2013|date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to global warming===
{{see also|Tropical cyclones and climate change}}
According to [[NCAR]] senior climatologist [[Kevin E. Trenberth]], "The answer to the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by [[global warming|climate change]] is that it is the wrong question. All weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trenberth|first=Kevin|title=Framing the way to relate climate extremes to climate change|journal=Climatic Change|date=March 2012|doi=10.1007/s10584-012-0441-5|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0008xl84w0743102/fulltext.pdf|volume=115|issue=2|pages=283–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] meteorologist Martin Hoerling attributes Sandy to "little more than the coincidental alignment of a tropical storm with an extratropical storm",&lt;ref name="Revkin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Andrew C.|first=Revkin|title=The #Frankenstorm in Climate Context|url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/the-frankenstorm-in-climate-context/|newspaper=The New York Times; Dot Earth|date=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trenberth does agree that the storm was caused by "natural variability" but adds that it was "enhanced by global warming".&lt;ref name="SurfTemps"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trenberth|first=Kevin|title=Hurricane Sandy mixes super-storm conditions with climate change|url=http://theconversation.edu.au/hurricane-sandy-mixes-super-storm-conditions-with-climate-change-10388|publisher=The Conversation|accessdate=October 29, 2012|quote=The sea surface temperatures along the Atlantic coast have been running at over 3[[°C]] above normal for a region extending 800 km off shore all the way from Florida to Canada. Global warming contributes 0.6°C to this. With every degree C, the water holding of the atmosphere goes up 7%, and the moisture provides fuel for the tropical storm, increases its intensity, and magnifies the rainfall by double that amount compared with normal conditions. Global climate change has contributed to the higher sea surface and ocean temperatures, and a warmer and moister atmosphere, and its effects are in the range of 5 to 10%. Natural variability and weather has provided the perhaps optimal conditions of a hurricane running into extra-tropical conditions to make for a huge intense storm, enhanced by global warming influences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor contributing to the storm's strength was abnormally warm [[sea surface temperatures]] offshore the [[East Coast of the United States]]—more than {{convert|3|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}} above normal, to which global warming had contributed {{convert|0.6|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name="SurfTemps" /&gt; As the temperature of the atmosphere increases, the capacity to hold water increases, leading to stronger storms and higher rainfall amounts.&lt;ref name="SurfTemps" /&gt;

As they move north, Atlantic hurricanes typically are forced east and out to sea by the [[Westerlies|Prevailing Westerlies]].&lt;ref name=Masters&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=Why did Hurricane Sandy take such an unusual track into New Jersey?|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2283|publisher=Weather Underground|accessdate=November 6, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103064238/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2283|archivedate=November 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Sandy's case, this typical pattern was [[Block (meteorology)|blocked]] by a ridge of high pressure over Greenland resulting in a negative [[North Atlantic Oscillation]], forming a kink in the jet stream, causing it to double back on itself off the East Coast.  Sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow.&lt;ref name=Masters /&gt;  The blocking pattern over Greenland also stalled an [[Arctic front]] which combined with the cyclone.&lt;ref name=Masters /&gt; Mark Fischetti of ''[[Scientific American]]'' said that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by [[Climate change in the Arctic|the melting of Arctic ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Climate Change Cause Hurricane Sandy?|last=Fischetti|first=Mark|date=October 30, 2012|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/10/30/did-climate-change-cause-hurricane-sandy/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trenberth said that while a negative North Atlantic Oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place, the [[null hypothesis]] remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.&lt;ref name=Revkin/&gt; Sea level at New York and along the New Jersey coast [[Current sea level rise|has increased by nearly a foot]] (300&amp;nbsp;mm) over the last hundred years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How to keep New York afloat|author=Velasquez-Manoff, Moises|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=November 9, 2006|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-154089560.html|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contributed to the [[storm surge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boxall and Neela Banerjee|first=Bettina|title=Sandy a galvanizing moment for climate change?|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-climate-politics-20121105,0,234626.story|accessdate=November 5, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard geologist [[Daniel P.

Last spring's unseasonable warmth caused places like Rochester, Minn., to set record daytime highs.  'By midcentury, this will be the new normal,' Schrag predicted. 'How do you deal with extreme heat in the summer? It's going to be a challenge, but humans are adaptable. It's not going to be easy, just like a 13-foot storm surge will be the new norm on the Eastern seaboard.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that those affected by the hurricane were still struggling to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recovery Remains Spotty 3 Months After Hurricane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/nyregion/recovery-remains-spotty-3-months-after-hurricane-sandy.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=March 24, 2014|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, NY Governor Andrew Cuomo set out to centralize recovery and rebuilding efforts in impacted areas of New York State by establishing the Governor's Office of Storm Recovery (GOSR). He aimed to address communities' most urgent needs, and to identify innovative and enduring solutions to strengthen the State's infrastructure and critical systems. Operating under the umbrella of New York Rising, GOSR utilized approximately $3.8 billion in flexible funding made available by the [[U.S. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development]]'s (HUD) [[Community Development Block Grant]] Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program to concentrate aid in four main areas: housing, small business, infrastructure, and the community reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Governor's Office of Storm Recovery: Overview|url=http://stormrecovery.ny.gov/overview|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405075405/http://stormrecovery.ny.gov/overview|archivedate=April 5, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2013, an analysis of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] data showed that fewer than half of those affected who requested disaster recovery assistance had received any, and a total of 30,000 residents of New York and New Jersey remained displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|title=Displaced by Hurricane Sandy, and Living in Limbo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/nyregion/displaced-by-hurricane-sandy-and-living-in-limbo-instead-of-at-home.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=March 24, 2014|date=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, ''[[Newsday]]'' reported, that 17 months after the hurricane people displaced from rental units on Long Island faced unique difficulties due to lack of affordable rental housing and delays in housing program implementations by New York State. Close to 9,000 rental units on Long Island were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, and [[Hurricane Irene]] and [[Tropical Storm Lee]] in 2011 per the NY State Governor's Office of Storm Recovery (GOSR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Island storm damage|url=http://data.newsday.com/long-island/data/real-estate/storm-damage|work=Newsday|publisher=New York State Governor's Office of Storm Recovery|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York State officials said that additional assistance would soon be available from the HUD's Community Development Block Grant funds via the New York Rising program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramos|first=Victor|title=Displaced by Sandy, LI renters long for home|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/displaced-by-sandy-li-renters-long-for-home-1.7433299|work=Newsday|publisher=Newsday|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2014, a group of those who remained displaced by the hurricane organized a protest at the Nassau Legislative building in Mineola, New York, to raise awareness of their frustration with the timeline for receiving financial assistance from the New York Rising program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protesters demand Sandy recovery help in Mineola| work=News 12|  url=http://longisland.news12.com/features/sandy/protesters-demand-sandy-recovery-help-in-mineola-1.7400730|publisher=News 12|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of| March 2014}}, the GOSR released a press statement, that the New York Rising Community Reconstruction Program had distributed more than $280 million in payments to 6,388 homeowners for damage from Hurricane Sandy, [[Hurricane Irene]] or [[Tropical Storm Lee]]. Every eligible homeowner who had applied by January 20, 2014 had been issued a check for home reconstruction, including over 4,650 Nassau residents for over $201 million and over 1,350 Suffolk residents for over $65 million. The State also had made offers over $293 million to buyout homes of 709 homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release, Governor's Office of Storm Recovery|date=March 11, 2014|url=http://www.stormrecovery.ny.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/03-11-14_gosr_ny_rising_housing_program_application_deadline_release_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane Sandy sparked much political commentary. Many scientists said warming oceans and greater atmospheric moisture were intensifying storms while rising sea levels were worsening coastal effects. November 2012 Representative [[Henry Waxman]] of [[California]], the top Democrat of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]], requested a hearing in the [[lame duck session]] on links between [[climate change]] and Hurricane Sandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rep.

The storm hit the United States one week before its general [[United States elections]], and affected the presidential campaign, local and state campaigns in storm-damaged areas. New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]], one of [[Mitt Romney]]'s leading supporters, praised President [[Barack Obama]] and his reaction to the hurricane, and toured storm-damaged areas of his state with the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horsey|first=David|title=Chris Christie and Hurricane Sandy give Obama a timely boost|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-chris-christie-boost-20121031,0,1044954.story| publisher=LA Times| accessdate=November 2, 2012|date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the time that Sandy might affect elections in several states, especially by curtailing [[early voting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2012/10/31/hurricane-sandy-effect-on-election-could-hurt-democrats/|title=Hurricane Sandy effect on election could hurt Democrats| publisher=Foundation for Independent Voter Education| date=October 31, 2012|author=W.E.

In his news conference on November 14, 2012, President Obama said, "we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting faster than was predicted even five years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily — there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe. And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcript of President Obama's News Conference |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/us/politics/running-transcript-of-president-obamas-press-conference.html |accessdate=November 14, 2012 |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2015, days after the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] released a post-Sandy report examining flood risks for 31,200 miles (50,210&amp;nbsp;km) of the North Atlantic coast, President Obama issued an executive order directing federal agencies, state and local governments drawing federal funds to adopt stricter building and siting standards to reflect scientific projections that future flooding will be more frequent and intense due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Eilperin, Juliet [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/01/30/in-major-shift-obama-administration-will-plan-for-rising-seas-in-all-federal-projects/ In major shift, Obama administration will plan for rising seas in all federal projects] ''The Washington Post''.

Power outages and flooding in the area closed the New York Stock Exchange and other financial markets on both October 29 and 30, a weather-related closure that last happened in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Craig|first1=Susanne|last2=Protess|first2=Ben|title=After Hurricane Sandy, Stock Exchanges Prepare to Open|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/after-hurricane-sandy-stock-exchanges-prepare-to-open/|accessdate=November 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When markets reopened on October 31, investors were relieved that it closed relatively flat that day. A week later, the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]] Capital Markets Bureau noted a slight uptick in the market (0.8%) and suggested that the negative economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was offset by the expected positive impacts of rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Market Volatility: The Impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Financial Markets|url=http://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/121108.htm|work=Capital Markets Bureau Report|agency=National Association of Insurance Commissioners|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
As Hurricane Sandy approached the United States, forecasters and journalists gave it several different unofficial names, at first related to its projected snow content, then to its proximity to Halloween, and eventually to the overall size of the storm.

===Insurance fraud claims===

===Retirement of the name===
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}

Because of the exceptional damage and deaths caused by the storm in many countries, the name ''Sandy'' was later retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]], and will never be used again for a [[North Atlantic hurricane]]. The name was replaced with ''Sara'' for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. However, because ''Sara'' was not used in 2018, it could be used in 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Sandy retired from list of Atlantic Basin tropical cyclone names|date=April 13, 2012|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=April 11, 2012|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2013/20130411_sandynameretiredt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In the [[Syfy]] [[television movie]] ''[[Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!]]'', a radar image of Sandy can be seen (close to its landfall in [[New Jersey]]), but represented fictionally as an unnamed tropical storm heading towards [[Washington D.C.]] The storm is also featured in an episode of ''[[Shades of Blue (TV series)|Shades of Blue]].''

'''Lateritic nickel ore deposits''' are surficial, [[weathered]] rinds formed on [[ultramafic]] rocks.
They account for 73% of the [[continent]]al world [[nickel]] resources and will be in the future the dominant source for the mining of nickel.

== Genesis and types of nickel laterites ==
[[Lateritic]] nickel [[ores]] formed by intensive tropical [[weathering]] of olivine-rich ultramafic rocks such as dunite, peridotite and komatiite and their serpentinized derivatives, [[serpentinite]] which consist largely of the [[magnesium]] [[silicate]] serpentine and contains approx. 0.3% nickel. This initial nickel content is strongly enriched in the course of [[lateritization]]. 
Two kinds of lateritic nickel ore have to be distinguished: [[limonite]] types and silicate types.&lt;ref&gt;Schellmann, W. (1983): Geochemical principles of lateritic nickel ore formation. Proceedings of the 2. International Seminar on Lateritisation Processes, Sao Paulo, 119-135&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limonite type''' laterites (or oxide type) are highly enriched in iron due to very strong leaching of magnesium and silica. They consist largely of [[goethite]] and contain 1-2% nickel incorporated in goethite. Absence of the limonite zone in the ore deposits is due to erosion.

'''Silicate type''' (or saprolite type) nickel ore formed beneath the limonite zone. It contains generally 1.5-2.5% nickel and consists largely of Mg-depleted serpentine in which nickel is incorporated. In pockets and fissures of the serpentinite rock green [[garnierite]] can be present in minor quantities, but with high nickel contents - mostly 20-40%. It is bound in newly formed [[phyllosilicate]] minerals. All the nickel in the silicate zone is leached downwards (absolute nickel concentration) from the overlying goethite zone.

== Ore deposits ==
Typical nickel laterite ore deposits are very large [[tonnage]], low-grade deposits located close to the surface. They are typically in the range of 20 million tonnes and upwards (this being a contained resource of 200,000 tonnes of nickel at 1%) with some examples approaching a billion tonnes of material. Thus, typically, nickel laterite ore deposits contain many billions of dollars of in-situ value of contained [[metal]].

Ore deposits of this type are restricted to the weathering mantle developed above ultramafic rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Golightly, J.P. (1981): Nickeliferous Laterite Deposits. Economic Geology 75th Anniversary Volume, 710-735&lt;/ref&gt; As such they tend to be tabular, flat and really large, covering many square kilometres of the Earth's surface. However, at any one time the area of a deposit being worked for the nickel ore is much smaller, usually only a few hectares. The typical nickel laterite mine often operates as either an open cut mine or a strip mine.

== Extraction ==
Nickel laterites are a very important type of nickel ore deposit. They are growing to become the most important source of nickel metal for world demand (currently second to [[sulfide nickel ore deposits]]).

Nickel laterites are generally mined via [[open cut mining]] methods.  Nickel is extracted from the ore by a variety of process routes.  Hydrometallurgical processes include [[high-pressure acid leach]] (HPAL) and [[heap leach]], both of which are generally followed by solvent extraction - electrowinning ([[SX-EW]]) for recovery of nickel.  Another hydrometallurgical routes is the Caron process, which consists of roasting followed by ammonia leaching and precipitation as nickel carbonate. Additionally, ferronickel is produced by the rotary kiln - electric furnace (RKEF) process.

=== HPAL process ===
High pressure acid leach processing is employed for two types of nickel laterite ores. 1) Ores with a limonitic character such as the deposits of the Moa district in [[Cuba]] and southeast [[New Caledonia]] at Goro where nickel is bound in [[goethite]] and [[asbolite]]. 2) Ores of a predominantly [[Nontronite|nontronitic]] character, such as many deposits in Western Australia, where nickel is bound within [[clay]] or secondary silicate substrates in the ores. The nickel (+/- [[cobalt]]) metal is liberated from such minerals only at low [[pH]] and high temperatures, generally in excess of 250&amp;nbsp;°C.

The advantages of HPAL plants are that they are not as selective toward the type of ore minerals, grades and nature of [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralisation]]. The disadvantage is the energy required to heat the ore material and acid, and the wear and tear hot acid causes upon plant and equipment. Higher energy costs demand higher ore grades.

=== Heap (Atmospheric) Leach ===
Heap leach treatment of nickel laterites is primarily applicable to clay-poor oxide-rich ore types where clay contents are low enough to allow [[percolation]] of acid through the heap. Generally, this route of production is much cheaper - up to half the cost of production - due to the lack of need to heat and pressurise the ore and acid.

Ore is ground, agglomerated, and perhaps mixed with clay-poor rock, to prevent compaction of the clay-like materials and so maintain [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]. The ore is stacked on impermeable plastic membranes and acid is percolated over the heap, generally for 3 to 4 months, at which stage 60% to 70% of the nickel-cobalt content is liberated into acid solution, which is then neutralised with [[limestone]] and a nickel-cobalt hydroxide intermediate product is generated, generally then sent to a [[smelter]] for refining.

The advantage of heap leach treatment of nickeliferous laterite ores is that the plant and mine infrastructure are much cheaper - up to 25% of the cost of a HPAL plant - and less risky from a technological point of view. However, they are somewhat limited in the types of ore which can be treated.

=== FerroNickel Process ===
A recent development in the extraction of nickel laterite ores is a particular grade of tropical deposits, typified by examples at Acoje in the Philippines, developed on [[ophiolite]] sequence ultramafics. This ore is so rich in [[limonite]] (generally grading 47% to 59% [[iron]], 0.8 to 1.5% [[nickel]] and trace [[cobalt]]) that it is essentially similar to low-grade [[iron ore]]. As such, certain steel smelters in [[China]] have developed a process for blending nickel limonite ore with conventional iron ore to produce [[stainless steel]] feed products.

=== Nitric Acid Hydrometallurgical Tank Leach ===

Another new method of extracting nickel from laterite ores is currently being demonstrated at a full-scale test plant at the CSIRO facility in Perth Australia. The DNi process uses nitric acid, instead of sulphuric acid, to extract the nickel within a few hours and then the nitric acid is recycled. The DNi process has the major advantage of being able to treat both limonite and saprolite lateritic ores and is estimated to have less than half the capital and operating costs of HPAL or FerroNickel processes.

'''Lead scandium tantalate''' ('''PST''') is a [[ferroelectric]] [[ceramic]] material with [[perovskite]] structure. It has the formula [[lead|Pb]]([[scandium|Sc]]&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[[Tantalum|Ta]]&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;)[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The x is usually about 0.5.

Like structurally similar [[lead zirconate titanate]] and [[barium strontium titanate]], PST can be used for manufacture of uncooled [[Staring array|focal plane array]] [[infrared imaging]] sensors for [[thermal camera]]s. Both bulk and [[thin film]] structures are used.

It is a mixed oxide of lead, scandium, and tantalum.

[[File:Glass of water with ice cubes.JPG|thumb|Ice cubes put in water will reach the 0 [[Celsius|°C]] melting point of ice when they start to melt.]]
The '''melting point''' (or, rarely, '''liquefaction point''') of a substance is the [[temperature]] at which it changes [[state of matter|state]] from [[solid]] to [[liquid]]. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The melting point of a substance depends on [[pressure]] and is usually specified at a [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]] such as 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] or 100 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]].

When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the '''freezing point''' or '''crystallization point'''. Because of the ability of some substances to [[Supercooling|supercool]], the freezing point is not considered as a characteristic property of a substance. When the "characteristic freezing point" of a substance is determined, in fact the actual methodology is almost always "the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice", that is, the [[#Melting point measurements|melting point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/1/57.pdf |title= A new method of freezing-point determination for small quantities |author= Ramsay, J. A. |journal= [[J. Exp. Biol.]] |year= 1949 |volume= 26 |issue= 1 |pages= 57–64 |pmid= 15406812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[File:Carboxylic.Acids.Melting.&amp;.Boiling.Points.jpg|thumb|right|Melting points (in blue) and boiling points (in pink) of the first eight [[carboxylic acids]] (°C)]]

For most substances, [[melting]] and [[freezing]] points are approximately equal. For example, the melting point ''and'' freezing point of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] is 234.32 [[kelvin]]s (−38.83&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] or −37.89&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haynes|Haynes]], p. 4.122.&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures. For example, [[agar]] melts at 85&amp;nbsp;°C (185&amp;nbsp;°F) and solidifies from {{Convert|31|C|F K}}; such direction dependence is known as [[hysteresis]]. The melting point of ice at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close &lt;ref&gt;The melting point of purified water has been measured as 0.002519 ± 0.000002 °C, see {{cite journal|author1=Feistel, R.  |author2=Wagner, W.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 2006

&lt;/ref&gt; to {{Convert|0|C|F K}}; this is also known as the ice point. In the presence of [[Nucleation|nucleating substances]], the freezing point of [[water]] is not always the same as the melting point. In the absence of nucleators water can exist as a [[Supercooling|supercool]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ed liquid down to −48.3&amp;nbsp;°C (−55&amp;nbsp;°F, 224.8&amp;nbsp;K) before freezing.

The [[chemical element]] with the highest melting point is [[tungsten]], at {{Convert|3414|C|F K}};&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haynes|Haynes]], p. 4.123.&lt;/ref&gt; this property makes tungsten excellent for use as filaments in light bulbs. The often-cited [[carbon]] does not melt at ambient pressure but [[sublimation (physics)|sublimes]] at about {{Convert|3726.85|C|F K}}; a liquid phase only exists above pressures of {{Convert|10|MPa|atm|abbr=on}} and estimated {{Convert|4030-4430|C|F K}} (see [[:File:Carbon basic phase diagram.png|carbon phase diagram]]). [[Tantalum hafnium carbide]] (Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HfC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[refractory]] compound with a very high melting point of 4215&amp;nbsp;K (3942&amp;nbsp;°C, 7128&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Researches on Systems with Carbides at High Melting Point and Contributions to the Problem of Carbon Fusion|journal=Z. Tech. Phys.|author1=Agte, C. |author2=Alterthum, H. |lastauthoramp=yes | volume= 11|year= 1930|pages=182–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the scale, [[helium]] does not freeze at all at normal pressure even at temperatures close to [[absolute zero]]; a pressure of more than twenty times normal [[atmospheric pressure]] is necessary.

==Melting point measurements==
{{main|Melting point apparatus}}
[[File:Koflerbank.jpg|thumb|Kofler bench with samples for calibration]]
Many [[laboratory techniques]] exist for the determination of melting points.
A [[Kofler bench]] is a metal strip with a temperature gradient (range from room temperature to 300&amp;nbsp;°C). Any substance can be placed on a section of the strip, revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point. [[Differential scanning calorimetry]] gives information on melting point together with its [[enthalpy of fusion]].

[[File:Krüss M5000.jpg|thumb|Automatic digital melting point meter]]
A basic melting point apparatus for the analysis of crystalline solids consists of an [[oil bath]] with a transparent window (most basic design: a [[Thiele tube]]) and a simple magnifier. The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath. The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.

The measurement can also be made continuously with an operating process. For instance, oil refineries measure the freeze point of diesel fuel online, meaning that the sample is taken from the process and measured automatically. This allows for more frequent measurements as the sample does not have to be manually collected and taken to a remote laboratory.

===Techniques for refractory materials===
For refractory materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely high melting point (typically considered to be above, say, 1800&amp;nbsp;°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical [[pyrometer]]. For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body is known to be a function of its temperature. An optical pyrometer matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using [[Planck's law]] of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.

Consider the case of using gold as the source (mp = 1063&amp;nbsp;°C). In this technique, the current through the filament of the pyrometer is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be expressed in terms of current through the pyrometer lamp. With the same current setting, the pyrometer is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the pyrometer and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the pyrometer filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the pyrometer. This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding pyrometer filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.

In determining melting points of a refractory substance by this method, it is necessary to either have black body conditions or to know the [[emissivity]] of the material being measured. The containment of the high melting material in the liquid state may introduce experimental difficulties. Melting temperatures of some refractory metals have thus been measured by observing the radiation from a black body cavity in solid metal specimens that were much longer than they were wide. To form such a cavity, a hole is drilled perpendicular to the long axis at the center of a rod of the material. These rods are then heated by passing a very large current through them, and the radiation emitted from the hole is observed with an optical pyrometer. The point of melting is indicated by the darkening of the hole when the liquid phase appears, destroying the black body conditions. Today, containerless laser heating techniques, combined with fast pyrometers and spectro-pyrometers, are employed to allow for precise control of the time for which the sample is kept at extreme temperatures. Such experiments of sub-second duration address several of the challenges associated with more traditional melting point measurements made at very high temperatures, such as sample vaporization and reaction with the container.

==Thermodynamics==
[[File:Melting curve of water.svg|thumb|right|Pressure dependence of water melting point.]]
For a solid to melt, heat is required to raise its temperature to the melting point. However, further heat needs to be supplied for the melting to take place: this is called the [[heat of fusion]], and is an example of [[latent heat]].

From a thermodynamics point of view, at the melting point the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] (ΔG) of the material is zero, but the [[enthalpy]] (''H'') and the [[entropy]] (''S'') of the material are increasing (ΔH, ΔS &gt; 0). Melting phenomenon happens when the Gibbs free energy of the liquid becomes lower than the solid for that material. At various pressures this happens at a specific temperature. It can also be shown that:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \frac {\Delta H} {T}&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''T'', ''ΔS'' and ''ΔH'' are respectively the [[temperature]] at the melting point, change of entropy of melting and the change of enthalpy of melting.

The melting point is sensitive to extremely large changes in [[pressure]], but generally this sensitivity is orders of magnitude less than that for the [[boiling point]], because the solid-liquid transition represents only a small change in volume.&lt;ref&gt;The exact relationship is expressed in the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mpec.sc.mahidol.ac.th/RADOK/physmath/PHYSICS/j10.htm |title= J10 Heat: Change of aggregate state of substances through change of heat content: Change of aggregate state of substances and the equation of Clapeyron-Clausius |accessdate= 19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, as observed in most cases, a substance is more dense in the solid than in the liquid state, the melting point will increase with increases in pressure. Otherwise the reverse behavior occurs. Notably, this is the case of water, as illustrated graphically to the right, but also of Si, Ge, Ga, Bi. With extremely large changes in pressure, substantial changes to the melting point are observed. For example, the melting point of silicon at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) is 1415&amp;nbsp;°C, but at pressures in excess of 10 GPa it decreases to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Tonkov, E. Yu. and Ponyatovsky, E. G. (2005) ''Phase Transformations of Elements Under High Pressure'', CRC Press, Boca Raton, p. 98 {{ISBN|0-8493-3367-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting points are often used to characterize organic and inorganic compounds and to ascertain their [[wiktionary:Purity|purity]]. The melting point of a pure substance is always higher and has a smaller range than the melting point of an impure substance or, more generally, of mixtures. The higher the quantity of other components, the lower the melting point and the broader will be the melting point range, often referred to as the "pasty range". The temperature at which melting begins for a mixture is known as the "solidus" while the temperature where melting is complete is called the "liquidus". Eutectics are special types of mixtures that behave like single phases. They melt sharply at a constant temperature to form a liquid of the same composition. Alternatively, on cooling a liquid with the eutectic composition will solidify as uniformly dispersed, small (fine-grained) mixed crystals with the same composition.

In contrast to crystalline solids, [[glass]]es do not possess a melting point;
on heating they undergo a smooth [[glass transition]] into a [[viscous liquid]].
Upon further heating, they gradually soften, which can be characterized by certain [[softening point]]s.

==Freezing-point depression==
{{main|Freezing-point depression|Supercooling}}

The freezing point of a [[solvent]] is depressed when another compound is added, meaning that a [[solution]] has a lower freezing point than a pure solvent. This phenomenon is used in technical applications to avoid freezing, for instance by adding salt or ethylene glycol to water.

==Carnelley's rule==
In [[organic chemistry]], '''Carnelley's rule''', established in 1882 by [[Thomas Carnelley]], states that ''high [[molecular symmetry]] is associated with high melting point''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Melting Point and Molecular Symmetry |journal= [[Journal of Chemical Education]] |page= 724 |volume= 77 |issue= 6 |year= 2000 |doi= 10.1021/ed077p724 |author1=Brown, R. J. C.  |author2=R. F. C. |lastauthoramp=yes |bibcode = 2000JChEd..77..724B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three [[structural isomer]]s with [[molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; the melting point increases in the series [[isopentane]] −160&amp;nbsp;°C (113 K) [[n-pentane]] −129.8&amp;nbsp;°C (143 K) and [[neopentane]] −16.4&amp;nbsp;°C (256.8 K).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haynes|Haynes]], pp. 6.153–155.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in [[xylene]]s and also [[dichlorobenzene]]s the melting point increases in the order [[arene substitution patterns|meta, ortho and then para]]. [[Pyridine]] has a lower symmetry than [[benzene]] hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with [[diazine]] and [[triazine]]s. Many cage-like compounds like [[adamantane]] and [[cubane]] with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.

A high melting point results from a high [[heat of fusion]], a low [[entropy of fusion]], or a combination of both. In highly symmetrical molecules the crystal phase is densely packed with many efficient intermolecular interactions resulting in a higher enthalpy change on melting.

==Predicting the melting point of substances (Lindemann's criterion)==
An attempt to predict the bulk melting point of crystalline materials was first made in 1910 by [[Frederick Lindemann]].&lt;ref name="Lindemann1910"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindemann FA |title=The calculation of molecular vibration frequencies |journal=Phys. Z. |volume=11 |year=1910 |pages=609–612 |authorlink=Frederick Lindemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the theory was the observation that the average amplitude of thermal vibrations increases with increasing temperature. Melting initiates when the amplitude of vibration becomes large enough for adjacent atoms to partly occupy the same space. The '''Lindemann criterion''' states that melting is expected when the vibration [[root mean square amplitude]] exceeds a threshold value.

Assuming that all atoms in a crystal vibrate with the same frequency ''ν'', the average thermal energy can be estimated using the [[equipartition theorem]] as&lt;ref name=Sorkin&gt;Sorkin, S., (2003), [http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~phsorkin/thesis/thesis.html Point defects, lattice structure, and melting], Thesis, Technion, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 E = 4\pi^2 m \nu^2~u^2 = k_{\rm B} T
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the [[atomic mass]], ''ν'' is the [[frequency]], ''u'' is the average vibration amplitude, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]. If the threshold value of ''u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is ''c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' where ''c'' is the [[Lindemann index|Lindemann constant]] and ''a'' is the [[atomic spacing]], then the melting point is estimated as
:&lt;math&gt;
 T_{\rm m} = \cfrac{4\pi^2 m \nu^2 c^2 a^2}{k_{\rm B}} .
 &lt;/math&gt;
Several other expressions for the estimated melting temperature can be obtained depending on the estimate of the average thermal energy. Another commonly used expression for the Lindemann criterion is&lt;ref name=Hofmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Hofmann|title=Solid state physics: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfIpxi4kcM4C&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=13 March 2011|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-40861-0|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 T_{\rm m} = \cfrac{4\pi^2 m \nu^2 c^2 a^2}{2k_{\rm B}} .
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the expression for the [[Debye frequency]] for ''ν'', we have
:&lt;math&gt;
 T_{\rm m} = \cfrac{2\pi m c^2 a^2 \theta_{\rm D}^2 k_{\rm B}}{h^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Debye temperature]] and ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. Values of ''c'' range from 0.15–0.3 for most materials.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;Nelson, D.

'''METTLER TOLEDO''' ({{NYSE|MTD}}) is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] manufacturer of [[Weighing scale|scale]]s and analytical instruments. It is the largest provider of weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. The company also provides various analytical instruments, process analytics instruments, and end-of-line inspection systems.  The company operates worldwide; 70% of [[net sales]] are derived in equal part from [[Europe]] and from the [[Americas]];  [[Asia]]n business is included in the remaining 30%.&lt;ref name='annualreport' /&gt;

==Formation and history==

=== Toledo Scale Company ===
[[File:Vashon Island Coffee Roasterie - scale 01.jpg|thumb|Toledo counter-top fan scale]]
[[File:Toledo dial scale.jpg|thumb|Toledo dial scale]]
[[Image:Inspected scale 2.jpg|right|thumb|A Toledo scale used in a hospital cafeteria]]
Allen DeVilbiss, Jr. (1873-1911) was an inventor who lived in [[Toledo, Ohio]], USA.  He became interested in the concept of weighing machines and conceived the idea of an automatic computing pendulum scale.  He was able to prove his concept with a local butcher, who realized that customers appreciated the automatic computation which eliminated the risk of overcharging.  While his invention gained in popularity, DeVilbiss was not interested in making it a viable business.&lt;ref name='honestweight'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terry|first1=Robert|title=Honest Weight|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=0-7388-1330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

In 1900, Henry Theobald (1868-1924) was fired from his job at the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Company]].  He decided to start his own business, and was convinced that selling the automatic computing scales could be a good business.  He solicited additional financial investors and purchased the company from DeVilbiss.  On July 10, 1901, the ''Toledo Computing Scale and Cash Register Company'' was incorporated.&lt;ref name='honestweight' /&gt;

By May 1902, Theobald's company was selling more than 100 [[cash register]]s with scales per month.  By that time, John H. Patterson, Theobald's boss from NCR, threatened to sue the new company for patent infringements. As an alternative, Patterson offered to purchase all cash register patents and property, along with the stipulation that Theobald would no longer engage in the cash register business. The investors, who worried about the costs of patent infringement litigation, agreed to the sale in June 1902.  Since cash registers were no longer part of Theobald's business, he changed the name to ''Toledo Computing Scale Company''.  Theobald later coined the phrase "No Springs, Honest Weight" as a slogan for the new company.&lt;ref name='honestweight' /&gt;&lt;ref name='honestweight' /&gt;

In the years that followed, Theobald realized that the weighing scale was the most important part of the retail transaction between the merchant and the customer. He felt that many of his competitors who used [[spring scale]] technology, especially [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company#Computing Scale Company of America|Dayton Scale Company]], were allowing merchants to cheat their customers by incorrectly calculating the total price of a measured good. He campaigned for more government regulation of weights and measures to eliminate dishonest weighing systems.  On October 1, 1907, [[Massachusetts]] adopted the first [[Weights and Measures Act|weights and measures laws]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1907/1907acts0535.pdf|website=State Library of Massachusetts|title=1907 Chap. 0535. An Act To Provide For The Testing And Sealing Of Weights, Measures And Balances Having A Device For Indicating The Price As Well As The Weight Of Commodities Offered For Sale.|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the company name changed once again, to ''Toledo Scale Company''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Toledo Scale|url=http://www.toledosattic.org/exhibits/97-essays/commind/97-toledoscale|website=Toledo's Attic|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a new scale line featuring a double pedulum mechanism and a dial face was introduced and was most suited for industrial applications.&lt;ref name=tsc /&gt;

=== Mettler Instruments AG ===
In 1945, [[Erhard Mettler|Dr. Erhard Mettler]], a Swiss engineer, started a precision mechanics company in Küsnacht, Switzerland.  He invented the substitution principle with a single-pan balance, capable of being produced in series. Analytical balances with a single weighing pan gradually replaced conventional two-pan balances in the laboratory.
[[File:METTLER TOLEDO UV7 Spectrophotometer.jpg|thumb|METTLER TOLEDO UV7 Spectrophotometer]]
Mettler diversified its product line in 1970 with the introduction of its automated titration systems, and the acquisition of balance manufacturer Microwa AG. Mettler acquired its 500-employee competitor August Sauter KG, of [[Albstadt]]-[[Ebingen]], Germany, in 1971, for its specialized industrial and retail scales.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;"[http://www.company-histories.com/MettlerToledo-International-Inc-Company-History.html History of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.]," ''International Directory of Company Histories'', Vol. '''30''', St. James Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Dr. Mettler sold his business to Ciba-Geigy AG. A third pillar - after laboratory and industrial - was created: the retail business. Technological progress had made it possible to advance retail scales to instruments for the management of perishable goods.

=== Mettler Toledo ===
In 1989, Reliance Electric sold the Toledo Scale division to Ciba-Geigy AG.  The division was then merged with Mettler Instruments.  The merger vastly increased the global scope of the company, which, as a result, operated in 18 countries.  Mettler acquired another competitor, [[Ohaus]] Corp., in 1990.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;  In 1992, the company was incorporated as ''Mettler Toledo, Inc.''&lt;ref name='tsc'&gt;{{cite web|title=The Toledo Scale Collection, 1900-1980|url=http://www.utoledo.edu/library/canaday/HTML_findingaids/MSS-153.htm|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996/97, Mettler Toledo, Inc. was sold by Ciba-Geigy AG to the New York-based AEA Investors Inc., in preparation for a subsequent initial public offering. The initial public offering was completed and began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], under the ticker symbol {{NYSE|MTD}}.

The resultant company is currently headquartered in [[Greifensee]], Switzerland, with offices for its many brands based around the world.

==Operational structure==
Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. They are geographically diversified with sales in 2012 derived 34% from Europe, 34% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The Company has an extensive global sales and service organization with approximately 6,000, or approximately one-half, of the employees providing sales and service in 36 countries. The Company has a manufacturing presence in Europe, the United States and China.&lt;ref name=annualreport /&gt;

=== Laboratory Instruments ===
1952, the measurement of up to one ten-millionth of a gram became possible with the laboratory [[Weighing scale|balance]] products. "The Mettler Balance" proved to be a catchphrase in the laboratory.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Consequently, with the advancement of microprocessor technology over the years, a wide range of products for the laboratory were invented, like automated [[titrators]] and thermal analyzers. Mettler-Toledo laboratory products and technology were able to improve processes in research and development, drug discovery and quality control. Application-specific software for balances provides data analysis opportunities to enhance accuracy, productivity and compliance. The most recent product development for the laboratory was the array-based UV/VIS spectrophotometer which encompasses four different units including UV5, UV7, UV5Bio and UV5Nano.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mt.com/uvvis&lt;/ref&gt;

====RAININ Instrument====
In 2001, Mettler-Toledo purchased Rainin Instrument, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037646/000103764601500013/tpexhibit.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Rainin supplies precision manual liquid handling instruments and calibration services worldwide. Under the Rainin brand, METTLER TOLEDO provides advanced liquid handling solutions for life scientists worldwide, offering a wide selection of ergonomic manual pipettes, electronic pipettes, multichannel pipettes, patented BioClean LTS and universal pipette tips. Rainin developed the first complete pipetting solution called Pipetting 360°, which significantly increases the reproducibility of basic research steps. An estimated 3 million scientists have benefited from improved research results and reductions in repetitive strain injuries (RSI) with the ergonomic Rainin LTS pipettes and tips.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mt.com/us/en/home/products/pipettes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====AutoChem====
The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem Inc. develops process analytical technology (PAT), automated reactors, and in situ sampling for use in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and academia industries.  Specifically, in situ spectroscopy and automated sampling provides continuous analysis of chemical reactions; inline particle size analysis enables crystallization, suspension, and emulsion development with real-time particle size and shape measurements; and automated reactors and reaction calorimetry provides process knowledge to eliminate scale-up and safety incidents. As METTLER TOLEDO built the franchise from a startup operation in the early 1990s, several companies were acquired. These acquisitions included ASI Applied System Inc., Lasentec®, and the Virtual Lab software business from Avantium to assemble the technology platforms required to develop and maintain its market leading position.

====THORNTON====
Thornton, Inc. Process Analytics Division &lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1050223&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1964 develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies instrumentation and sensors used for liquid process measurement and control applications.The instrumentation provides pure water treatment measurement &amp; control for the pharmaceutical industry; and parameters of conductivity/resistivity, TOC, pH, DO, dissolved ozone and flow for the semiconductor and power industries. Thornton acquired microbial detection startup Instant BioScan, Inc. in 2015 to become the first manufacturer of instrumentation within the pharmaceutical industry to offer real-time measurement solutions for all three regulated parameters by global pharmacopeias for ultra pure water, adding bioburden analysis to their portfolio.

====INGOLD====
Founded in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=MTO%253AGR&amp;sid=a4.V3XP_VtE4 | work=Bloomberg | title=New Portable Dissolved Oxygen Measurement System From Mettler-Toledo Ingold}}&lt;/ref&gt; INGOLD specializes in [[solution]]s for pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity and CO2 for process analytics applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and food &amp; beverage industries.

'''''Mighty Ducks''''' (also known as '''''Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series''''') is an American animated television series that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming block ''[[The Disney Afternoon]]'', the last show produced by the block, in the fall of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Disney and NHL Hope Young Fans Will Be Drawn to Hockey Via Animated Series|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=April 10, 1996|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-10/news/ls-56973_1_mighty-ducks|accessdate=September 4, 2010| first=Steven | last=Lowery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was inspired by the live-action [[The Mighty Ducks (film series)|Mighty Ducks films]] and the [[NHL|NHL team]], the [[Anaheim Ducks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Anaheim, Ducks Are Drawn Into Disney Cartoon|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1996-08-07|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-07/entertainment/ca-34677_1_mighty-ducks|accessdate=2010-09-04 | first=Benjamin | last=Epstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-six episodes were produced in total. The series most recently aired on [[Toon Disney]] but was removed from schedules in November 2004.

The series' main theme, composed by Carl Swander Johnson, is performed by [[Mickey Thomas (singer)|Mickey Thomas]] of [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Elvin Bishop]] fame.

[[DisneyQuest]], an "Indoor Interactive Theme Park" located in the [[Disney Springs]] area of the [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World Resort]], had an attraction loosely based on the program called ''Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam''. Wildwing was the only character from the show featured, first as a life-size cutout at the front of the queue and then again as the goalie in the game.

==Story==
In another universe exists a planet populated entirely by humanoid ducks. Dubbed "Puckworld" by its inhabitants, it is an icy planet, perfectly suited to the Ducks' favorite pastime, hockey. For the citizens of Puckworld, hockey was not simply a sport, but a way of life, occupying virtually every aspect of day-to-day existence.

Legend has it that centuries ago, during an invasion by a reptilian race called Saurians, a duck named Drake DuCaine became the planet's savior over the Saurians' Overlords. The legend tells that DuCaine did so with a high-tech goalie  mask. With it, DuCaine sent the Saurians to a mysterious "Dimensional Limbo".

The last of the Saurians escape Dimensional Limbo and returns to Puckworld with an armada of robotic attack ships. The group of four is led by the last of the Saurian Overlords, Lord Dragaunus, who is assisted by his minions Siege, Chameleon and Wraith. They invade the planet and enslave the people of Puckworld. After some time, a resistance is formed by Canard, who has found The Mask of Drake DuCaine. With it, the wearer of the Mask could see through the Saurians' invisibility cloaks. Canard forms a band of Ducks to fight Dragaunus. The members of his team consists of Wildwing, Nosedive, Tanya, Duke, Mallory and Grin. They go on a mission to destroy Dragaunus's fortress the Master Tower and free the planet from the Saurians' control. While the mission is successful, Dragaunus and his forces manage to escape in their ship, the Raptor. The Saurians open up a dimensional gateway to escape through, but Canard and the others follow him into the portal with the Aerowing, intent on stopping them.

Dragaunus attempts to get rid of the Ducks inside the portal by attacking them with an electromagnetic worm that will grow until it can swallow the Aerowing. In a desperate attempt to get rid of the worm, Canard sacrifices his own life by throwing himself to the worm. Before doing so, however, Canard gave the Mask, and leadership of the team, to Wildwing Flashblade, his best friend. Both the Raptor and the Aerowing leave the portal and enter a different dimension, landing in the Earth city of [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]]. The Ducks meet Phil Palmfeather, a human who becomes their manager and makes them a legitimate NHL team. Their arena, only known as [[Honda Center|The Pond]] in the show, has a hockey rink that doubles as a landing pad for the Aerowing above and has a formal HQ below. On Earth, the Ducks and Dragaunus continue their fight, with Dragaunus's plans of conquest often curtailed by damage to the Raptor's power source and his efforts to find a new source of power, although there are other villains that also challenge the six Ducks.

==Characters==

===Main===
[[Image:MightyDtvs.jpg|thumb|The Mighty Ducks in action, from left: Nosedive, Tanya, Grin, Wildwing (center), Mallory, Duke.]]
*Wildwing Flashblade (voiced by [[Ian Ziering]]){{spaced ndash}}Saved by Canard back on Puckworld, he is the leader of the Ducks on and off the ice. At first reluctant to take charge after Canard fell, he eventually comes to accept the role of leadership. As a hockey player, he's the [[Goaltender|goalie]], wearing the jersey number 00 and being known for his ability to take any kind of beating and still remain standing. Brave like Canard before him, Wildwing is also intelligent and just. He usually plays the [[double act|straight man]] to the other ducks and protector to his younger brother, Nosedive. Along with the mask of Drake DuCaine, Wildwing uses body armor and a [[Hockey puck|Puck]] Launcher on his left [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]. In real life, Wildwing is the mascot for the [[Anaheim Ducks]], known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim until the [[2006–07 NHL season]], when they won the Stanley Cup.
*Nosedive Flashblade (voiced by [[Steve Mackall]]){{spaced ndash}}Wildwing's younger brother, who initially was not intended to be part of Canard's resistance. However, Wildwing makes Canard take Nosedive with them by quoting "If you want me, then my brother's part of the deal." Once they reach Earth, Nosedive becomes an official member of the team, both on the hockey team and the crime fighting team. He is by far the team's most impulsive and immature member, similar to [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] of the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. His character may have been influenced by Michelangelo; the two series were initially penned by the same writer. Nosedive is more childish and easy-going than the other Ducks, and often looks toward his older brother for support and protection. Nosedive can be very likable, making friends with teammate Grin, and humans Thrash and Mookie. He wears body armor, but not as much as Wildwing. He usually uses a Puck Blaster and rides a Duckcycle. On-ice, Nosedive is the [[winger (ice hockey)|left winger]], and his jersey number is 33.
*Duke L'Orange (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]){{spaced ndash}}A notorious jewel thief on Puckworld, Duke changed his ways to battle Lord Dragaunus. Duke has used a Puck Blaster in some episodes, but he mainly uses a golden sword called a Ducksaber (or sometimes just a 'saber'). He also carries [[Lock picking|lock picks]] and a grappling hook attached to his wrist. Duke is pretty level-headed, albeit egotistical at times. He also has an eyepatch and a chipped beak, possibly as a result of his past as a thief (In the episode "Dungeons and Ducks", he tells Borg, "Hey, take it easy, you can put someone's eye out with one of that thing [a sword]. I should know.", which might be a clue to how he lost his eye). He was the leader of a gang called The Brotherhood of the Blade. He remains the most experienced of all the Ducks and possesses a good balance of skill and confidence. Unfortunately, there are some minor trust issues with Mallory due to Duke being an ex-thief, though this fact doesn't seem to faze their leader Wildwing. His name is a pun on the dish [[duck à l'orange]]. He is the team's [[centre (ice hockey)|center]], and his jersey number is 13. His character design is based on Kurama Wataribe from the Japanese animated series ''[[Mashin Hero Wataru]]''.
*Mallory McMallard (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]){{spaced ndash}}Mallory is a fiery [[Red hair|redhead]] who is well-learned in Puckworld's version of the [[martial art]]s, although most of the time she is content with just using a Puck Blaster. She has a sharp tongue and usually directs it towards Nosedive's immature acts, or anything that she feels is "out of line." Her trust is easily broken, particularly in Duke's case, and as she sees it, for some very good reasons. With her strong military background as a member of the "Puckworld Special Forces," she often thinks in black and white. She's a strict disciplinarian, and has a high regard for the chain of command. She's also stubborn, which can be a fault as much as a strength. Mallory is the team's right winger, and her jersey number is 15.
*Tanya Vanderflock (voiced by [[April Winchell]]){{spaced ndash}}The Ducks' resident genius who is often the one turned to for advice, even by Wildwing. She is good with mechanics and uses the Omnitool on her wrist with many of her projects. Despite her intellect, she has bad allergies (including an ironic allergy to feathers, with the result that she constantly sounds like she has a cold), lacks confidence, has a gentler personality, and is not as good a fighter as the other ducks. She makes up for this with her good common sense and wry humor. According to herself, her middle name is Gertrude. On-ice, Tanya is the left [[defenceman|defenseman]], and her jersey number is 23.
*Check "Grin" Hardwing (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]){{spaced ndash}}A large super-strong member of the group with a [[Zen]]-like philosophy. Unlike the stereotype of strong people, Grin is wise and doesn't let his anger cloud his judgment. He rarely uses weapons in battle, relying on his wisdom and strength instead. He has a strong sense of honor and can always be counted on for support. He is a good friend of Nosedive. During Grin's younger years, he had a horrible temper. He found enlightenment with the training from the grand hockey master, Tai Quack Do. Grin is the right defenseman of the team, and his jersey number is 1, the same number on Tai Quack Do wears on his robe.
*Canard Thunderbeak (voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]){{spaced ndash}}Canard Thunderbeak was Wildwing's best friend, and the only remaining survivor of the Resistance from Puckworld. He was the original leader and team captain of the Mighty Ducks. While following Dragaunus through a dimensional gateway, Canard sacrificed himself when the Saurians released an electromagnetic worm on the Aerowing. Before he did, he gave the mask of Drake DuCaine to Wildwing and told him to be the team captain as he gets trapped in the dimensional limbo. As far as the Mighty Ducks know, Canard is still trapped in dimensional limbo. He was a great leader and a great friend. Wildwing believes Canard is still alive and swears he will find him. In the episode "Take Me to Your Leader", he appears to have escaped and made a distress call to the Ducks, but it is revealed to be Chameleon setting a trap for them once again leaving Wildwing feeling guilty for not being able to save his friend. As Wildwing thinks he still might be alive in the dimensional limbo, he vows to one day find him.

===Human allies===
*Phil Palmfeather (voiced by [[James Belushi]]){{spaced ndash}}The Ducks' [[Coach (sport)|manager]] when they are being an [[ice hockey]] team. He'd rather have the team do sometimes rather dangerous or stupid promotional gimmicks and autograph signings with fans than having them save the world, although he does acknowledge that they do good. He also has bad taste in fashion.
*Captain Klegghorn (voiced by [[Dennis Franz]]){{spaced ndash}}The police captain of the [[Anaheim]] Police Department who initially doesn't trust the Ducks, particularly due to the lack of evidence that Dragaunus even existed in the first place. While he still doesn't like them, eventually they come to terms when he helped Wildwing retake the Pond when the Saurians took their headquarters.
*Thrash &amp; Mookie (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] &amp; [[April Winchell]]){{spaced ndash}}Nosedive's seemingly only human friends who dress like punk rockers. They run the comics store called "Captain Comics," of which Nosedive is a frequent customer. They were the first people that they met on Earth. Thrash is male, Mookie is female.
*Bernie "Buzz" Blitzman (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]){{spaced ndash}}Buzz is an orphaned genius young boy in his early teens. He is a big fan of the Ducks and is particularly fond of Mallory. He proves to be a big help to the Ducks.
*Dr. Huggerman (voiced by [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]]){{spaced ndash}}A scientist and friend of Tanya's. He turned his back on humanity when they abused his inventions. However, he does help the Ducks stop the energy creatures.

===Other allies===
*Borg (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]){{spaced ndash}}Prince regent of the dimensional Anaheim. The Ducks helped him take back his throne and fought against Asteroth. He soon returns to warn the Ducks of Asteroth's search for his amulet, and he helps Nosedive and Duke find the Star Sword, a weapon capable of destroying Asteroth's amulet.
*B.R.A.W.N. (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]){{spaced ndash}}A large gold robot who is a bounty hunter, sent to capture Dragaunus but was reprogramed to eliminate the Ducks. Tanya was able to re-reprogram him into joining their cause and stopping Dragaunus' assault platform. He from there on in had a game show host-like voice and personality. Almost his entire body was destroyed, but his head still remained. He briefly appears in "The Return of Asteroth".

===The Saurians===
*Lord Dragaunus (voiced by [[Tim Curry]]){{spaced ndash}}The dragon-like leader of the Saurians, Dragaunus is evil, big, strong and can breathe fire. He's not above working with humans or even other aliens he hates in his quest for world domination. When a geeky guy who's a comic book fan dreams of being a real-life superhero, he gives him superpowers and employs him to steal and kill others for Dragaunus. He doesn't take kindly to the failures of his cronies, Siege, Chameleon and Wraith. Dragaunus has lost faith in the Saurian dark magic which Wraith uses and only when somewhat desperate, will he allow Wraith to employ them in a major part of his latest plan. Otherwise, the main tools he equips himself and his henchmen with are teleporters, rays, blasters, rockets, and cloaking devices. Most of Dragaunus's schemes involve trying to create an alternative fuel source for his flagship, The Raptor, after Grim and Tanya smashed its existing power crystals in the pilot, with the Raptor's remaining power only enough to run the ship's cloaking device wherever it lands.
*Siege (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]){{spaced ndash}} Siege is an [[Ankylosaurus]]-like soldier who is aggressive and has a strong hatred for the Ducks (particularly Grin, due to the large duck being able to go toe-to-toe with him on a daily basis and generally win or draw in the fight). He can also be viewed as Dragaunus' second in command, though the window is pretty wide. His cruel nature is mechanically and technologically minded, and he believes that brute force is the only means of victory. He often builds weapons and vehicles and directly uses them against the Ducks. He scoffs the dark magic of the ancient Saurians, and Dragaunus seems a little more tolerant and open to his ideas as a result. However, when he fails, he gets little better treatment than the others.
*Chameleon (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]){{spaced ndash}} A [[shapeshifting]] chameleon-like Saurian that is able to increase or decrease his strength, size and dexterity depending on his transformations. Much of the time, an imperfect transformation can give him away. Also, he ends up wasting his powers a lot by doing corny impressions of human [[Celebrity|celebrities]] (mostly famous early 20th century comedians). At times, he is capable of transforming into a large reptilian form rivaling Siege or Grin in strength. Dragaunus has little patience for his antics and stupidity. The most effective uses of his powers has been in his impersonations of the Ducks and other humans, which comes in handy the most for such tasks as infiltration, sabotage, and espionage.
*Wraith (voiced by [[Tony Jay]]){{spaced ndash}}A Saurian [[warlock]] with a dry sense of humor. He is smarter than Siege or Chameleon, but disdained by Dragaunus because of his firm belief that the dark magic of their ancestors is the only means for victory. Wraith shuns weapons in battle, preferring to use his ability to throw fireballs. He is very glum and is often predicting the inevitable failure of their mission. Of course, Wraith is usually proven right.
*Hunter Drones{{spaced ndash}}Robotic foot soldiers of Dragaunus. They have blasters on their hands. They are often easily destroyed by the Ducks. Dragaunus himself destroys whenever he's extremely angry and having a tantrum. In "The Iced Ducks Cometh", they face off against a much larger Drone, nicknamed Tiny by Siege. Nosedive destroys Tiny by crushing him with a [[Ice resurfacer|zamboni]].

===Other villains===
*Dr. Droid (voiced by [[Charlie Adler|Charles Adler]]){{spaced ndash}}Formerly a human named Otto Maton, Dr. Droid is now mostly [[Android (robot)|android]] (essentially a [[cyborg]]), and wants to turn the rest of the world into robots. The Ducks tangle with him twice.
*Asteroth (voiced by [[W. Morgan Sheppard]]){{spaced ndash}}An evil wizard from another [[dimension]], which is actually a [[supernatural]] version of [[Anaheim, California]]. His title is "Lord of the Red [[Dragon]]", since he can morph into a large red [[dragon]] when enough power is in his possession. The Ducks fight him twice: first in the alternate Anaheim and then in the "real" Anaheim.
*Daddy-O Cool (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]){{spaced ndash}}A deformed [[beat poet]] who is into [[monster truck]]s. In "Monster Rally", he challenged the ducks to a monster truck battle, and had planned to put [[toxic waste]] into the world's water supply to make the world a "cooler" place. It's stated that he was once human, until he fell into some toxic waste. When his plan is thwarted, the toxic waste changes him into a 1950s insurance salesman.
*Dr. Wally Pretorius (voiced by [[Matt Frewer]]){{spaced ndash}}A mad scientist who likes to splice different types of DNA on test subjects. His main purpose was to try his experiment out on the Ducks by trapping them in a small town called Sunnyville, where he disguised himself as the town mechanic. He then kidnapped the town residents and made humanoid replicas of them, after he made a satellite that jammed their frequencies forcing their vehicle to break down and prevented them from using their comlinks. He was about to extract their DNA until Nosedive saved them. He is also considered Draganus' number 1 fan.
===Secondary villains===
*Falcone (voiced by [[Reed Diamond]]){{spaced ndash}}Falcone is a Raptrin member of The Brotherhood of The Blade. Duke pretended to join up with Falcone to learn what he was up to, and found out that Falcone was working for the Saurians, trying to help them steal the world's largest jewels for a new weapon. Duke tried to stop him, but failed as Falcone got him arrested. Falcone got the gem, but not long after that, his ship blew up and sent him down into a moat. There, the guards of Big Ben found him. Falcone is currently sitting in London's jail cell for stealing a jewel from them.
*Lucretia DeCoy (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]){{spaced ndash}}Lucretia DeCoy is a traitor to the race of the Ducks and a spy for the Saurians. Tanya was the only one who knew who she was, but Lucretia prevented her from revealing that she was a spy by tying her to the top rafters of The Pond. She tells the others that her name is "Vonda McDrake". Due to a misunderstanding, the Saurians believed that she switched the item she was sent to steal from a tomb with the help from the Ducks; in reality, it had really been switched by Wildwing. The end result was her being sent to the dimensional limbo as punishment for her perceived treachery and the weapon Dragaunus tried to use the chip for blowing up in his face.
*Dr. Swindle (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]){{spaced ndash}}A corrupt scientist the Saurians hired in "Beaks vs. B.R.A.W.N." to create a flotation device. When the Saurians refused to pay him for his work, he attempted to sell the machine to the highest bidder instead. The highest bidder turned out to be Chameleon, who took the device and left Swindle with a suitcase full of newspapers. A running gag has the Doctor insisting that his name is pronounced "Swindel".
*Phineas P. Viper (voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]]){{spaced ndash}}An industrialist who helped Dragaunus with his plan to create a Super Raptor. In the future, he ruled Earth with an iron fist while the Saurians were off conquering the galaxy and he genetically merged himself with his pet snakes in that time. He was mentioned again in "Bringing Down Baby" when Wildwing, Duke and Tanya found out that he was still helping Dragaunus with his plans.
*Baron Von Licktenstamp (voiced by [[David Hyde-Pierce]]){{spaced ndash}}A German hunter who owned his own island. He captures Wildwing, Tanya and Duke and hunts them. Baron Von Licktenstamp had robotic animals to help with his hunt. He collaborated with Dragaunus, giving him the Salerinite substance in exchange for the hunt. Baron Von Licktenstamp was captured by the three ducks and had his head stuck on a wall.
*Stanley Strazinski (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]){{spaced ndash}}A former hockey player with a violent attitude. Dragaunus came to him for help and used a DNA accelerator to transform him into a monstrous version of himself to fight the ducks. Stanley changed his ways when Grin's words reached him. He was turned back to normal and becomes a referee.
*Mondo-Man (voiced by [[Eddie Deezen]]){{spaced ndash}}Alvin Yasbeck, a regular customer of Captain Comics, did not like the Ducks' style of crimefighting, so he acted like he was his own superhero. However, he was extremely clumsy at what he did, and his appearance gave the Saurians the chance to escape once more. Tricking him into believing they were good and the Ducks were evil, Dragaunus gave him super powers and got him to do his dirty work. Incapacitating three of the Ducks with "Ducktonite", a radioactive egg of his own creation which had the ability to weaken them, he then stole some Balerium Crystals from the incoming Sarks for the Saurians. After Dragaunus was finished with him, he took away his powers during a fight and he was later arrested by Captain Klegghorn.
*Emperor Xyloid &amp; Commander Zenon (both voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]){{spaced ndash}}Xyloid and Zenon are [[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]-like aliens that came to Earth to freeze the entire planet to live on with the aid of their weather machine, which was interfering with Dragaunus' plan to use [[solar power]] to recharge the Raptor. During conversation, Xyloid always tells everyone to take a memo/note, tells them what he has to say, and he ends his sentences with "Sincerely, Yours truly, so on and so forth, etc., etc., etc."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1581">In mathematics, '''noncommutative projective geometry''' is a noncommutative analog of [[projective geometry]] in the setting of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

== Examples ==
*The quantum plane, the most basic example, is the [[quotient ring]] of the free ring:
::&lt;math&gt;k \langle x, y \rangle / (yx - q xy)&lt;/math&gt;
*More generally, the '''quantum polynomial ring''' is the quotient ring:
::&lt;math&gt;k \langle x_1, \dots, x_n \rangle / (x_i x_j - q_{ij} x_j x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

== Proj construction ==
{{see also|Proj construction}}

By definition, the Proj of a graded ring ''R'' is the quotient category of the category of finitely generated graded modules over ''R'' by the subcategory of torsion modules. If ''R'' is a commutative Noetherian graded ring generated by degree-one elements, then the Proj of ''R'' in this sense is equivalent to the category of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on the usual Proj of ''R''. Hence, the construction can be thought of as a generalization of the Proj construction for a commutative graded ring.

[[File:Nordic swan mark.svg|thumb|The Nordic swan mark]]
The '''Nordic Ecolabel''' or '''Nordic swan''' is the official sustainability [[ecolabel]] for the [[Nordic countries]], introduced by the [[Nordic Council]] of Ministers in 1989.  This is done by a voluntary [[license]] system where the applicant agrees to follow a certain criteria set outlined by the Nordic Ecolabelling in cooperation with stakeholders. These criteria include environmental, quality and health arguments. The criteria levels promote products and services belonging to the most environmentally sound and take into account factors such as free trade and proportionality (cost vs. benefits).

The Nordic Ecolabel now covers 67 different product groups, from hand soap to furniture to hotels.  Products must verify compliance using methods such as samples from independent laboratories, certificates and control visits.  The label is usually valid for three years, after which the criteria are revised and the company must reapply for a license.

The Nordic Ecolabel first appeared in the United States through a small offering of Nordic products. KCK Industries recognized the value of branding quality eco-friendly products and through a partnership with ABENA introduced Bambo Nature, an environmentally friendly baby diaper. The success of this offering has led to the expansion of the ecolabel in the U.S.

Norway and Sweden implemented the Nordic swan in 1989, Finland in 1990, Iceland in 1991 and Denmark in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/the-nordic-swan-from-past-experiences-to-future-possibilities_tn2008-529|title=TemaNord, Nordic iLibrary:The third evaluation of the Nordic ecolabelling scheme|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12871">In [[chemistry]], an '''onium ion''' is a [[cation]] formally obtained by the [[protonation]] of mononuclear parent [[hydride]] of a [[pnictogen]] (group 15 of the [[periodic table]]), [[chalcogen]] (group 16), or [[halogen]] (group 17). The oldest-known onium ion, and the namesake for the class, is [[ammonium]], {{chem|NH|4|+}}, the protonated derivative of [[ammonia]], {{chem|NH|3}}.&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=OlahBk/&gt;

The name '''onium''' is also used for cations that would result from the substitution of hydrogen atoms in those ions by other groups, such as organic radicals, or halogens; such as [[tetraphenylphosphonium]], {{chem|(C|6|H|5|)|4|P|+}}. The substituent groups may be divalent or trivalent, yielding ions such as [[iminium]] and [[nitrilium]].&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=OlahBk/&gt;

A simple onium ion has a charge of +1. A larger ion that has two onium ion subgroups is called a '''double onium ion''', and has a charge of +2. A '''triple onium ion''' has a charge of +3, and so on.

Compounds of an onium cation and some other [[anion|negative ion]] are known as '''onium compounds''' or '''onium salts'''.

Onium ions and onium compounds are inversely [[structural analog|analog]]ous to -ate ions and [[ate complex]]es:
*Lewis bases form onium ions when the central atom gains one more bond and becomes a positive [[cation]].
*Lewis acids form -ate ions when the central atom gains one more bond and becomes a negative [[anion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions and mechanisms'', Maya Shankar Singh, 2007, Dorling Kindersley, {{ISBN|978-81-317-1107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pan-European Oil Pipeline (PEOP)''' is a proposed oil pipeline from [[Constanţa]] in [[Romania]] via [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] to [[Rijeka]] and from there through [[Slovenia]] to [[Trieste]] in Italy.  The aim of the pipeline is to bypass Turkish straits in the transportation of Russian and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] oil to Central Europe. In Trieste the pipeline will be connected with the [[Transalpine Pipeline]], running to Austria and Germany.

==History==
The project was originally proposed in 2002. Signing of the memorandum of understanding on the construction of the pipeline was several times delayed until on 3 April 2007 it was signed by officials of Croatia, Italy, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia during an energy forum in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="ens"&gt;

 | accessdate=2007-04-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2008 Romanian, Serbian and Croatian companies signed an agreement establishing the Pan-European Oil Pipeline Project Development Company (PEOP PDC).&lt;ref name=romania&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 July 2008 Shareholders adopted the Statute and appointing the Managing Board of the PEOP PDC Plc.&lt;ref name=mfa&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The national governments of [[Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] are favorable about the project. Most engaged is the President of Romania, [[Traian Băsescu]], who has cited a study estimating the benefits of the project for Romania over 20&amp;nbsp;years of operation in the range between US$2.27 to 4.39&amp;nbsp;billion. The Government of Serbia is also politically motivated so as to decrease its dependence on crude oil supply from Croatia.&lt;ref name="Pan European Oil Pipeline"/&gt;

In 2006, the Government of [[Slovenia]] did not support the project because the {{convert|29|km|mi}} long stretch would pass the environmentally sensitive [[Karst Plateau|Karst]] terrain and no national interest exists regarding oil supply.&lt;ref name="gasandoil"&gt;
{{cite news

 | accessdate=2007-04-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Slovenian representatives in 2009 expressed support for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/beograd-potpora-izgradnji-peopa-114304.aspx | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Poslovni dnevnik]] | title = Beograd: Potpora izgradnji PEOP-a | date = 2009-04-22 | accessdate = 2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2010, JANAF decided to freeze its involvement in PEOP. The Romanian and Serbian companies responded by saying they would still build the pipeline from the Black Sea to the Pančevo refinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/peop-se-nece-graditi-bez-janafa-140021.aspx | language = Croatian | title = PEOP se neće graditi bez Janafa | newspaper = [[Poslovni dnevnik]] | date = 2010-02-17 | accessdate = 2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical description==
The {{convert|1856|km|mi}} long pipeline is expected to cost about €3.5&amp;nbsp;billion. The capacity of the pipeline will be {{bbl to t|1.2|and|1.8|mlt=M|per=d|t_per=a}}. It is planned to be operational by 2012.&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project company==
The pipeline project is developed by the London-registered Pan-European Oil Pipeline Project Development Company, comprising Romanian companies Conpet Ploiești and Oil Terminal Constanța, Serbian company Transnafta and Croatian company [[Jadranski naftovod|JANAF]]. One of the main purposes of the company is promotion of the Pan European Oil Pipeline and subsequently attracting new investors.&lt;ref name="Pan European Oil Pipeline"&gt;[http://www.transnafta.co.rs/en/home/dev_projects/peop/ Pan European Oil Pipeline]&lt;/ref&gt; Italian and Slovenian companies are invited to participate in the project.&lt;ref name=romania/&gt;

'''Quintrix''' is a name given to a flat and wide [[cathode ray tube|television tube]] made by [[Panasonic]].  Quintrix tubes were first introduced to the market in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;http://panasonic.co.in/web/ImgCont/1747/081007Panasonic300milTVSets.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The word originates from the Latin word "quintum", which means "fifth".  So far there are three models of Quintrix available: 
* Quintrix,
* QuintrixF, and 
* Quintrix SR (SR = Super Resolution)

The first Quintrix cathode ray tubes featured a prefocus lens that reduced beam diffusion, giving a sharper picture.

Manufactured in Malaysia and also in Wales with an MX-6 core, the Quintrix model was the standard television type for Hong Kong's [[Educational_Television_(Hong_Kong)|etv]] project in 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1290">The '''Relative temperature index (RTI)''' is a characteristic parameter related to the [[thermal degradation]] of [[plastic]] materials.

The RTI is part of the [[thermal-aging]] program of the [[UL 746B]] standard from [[UL (safety organization)|UL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastics Testing|url=https://industries.ul.com/plastics-and-components/plastics/plastics-testing|website=UL Industries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the process of the UL 746B program, the degradation of certain properties of the material like [[dielectric]] and [[mechanic strength]], is investigated with regards to thermal-aging. The RTI is the temperature in degrees C, at which the properties have decreased to 50 percent of their initial value after a long-term exposure to this temperature.

Though the RTI is an index, it is given in [[Celsius]] units.
The UL 746B standard distinguishes between three sub-categories of the RTI:
*'''Electrical RTI''' which relates to [[Insulation resistance testing|electrical insulating]] performance.
*'''Mechanical impact RTI''' which relates to mechanical performance with [[Mechanical impact|impact]]
*'''Mechanical strength RTI''' which relates to mechanical performance without impact

'''Rue de la Commune'''  ({{lang-en|De la Commune Street}}) is a road in [[Old Montreal]] which is well used both by Montrealers and by tourists, since it is the home of the [[Pointe-à-Callière Museum]] and the [[Old Port of Montreal]]. The road follows the original shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The buildings along the north side of the road are former commercial buildings.

== History ==
In 1651, the governor of Montréal, [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] granted land to Jean de Saint-Père to be used as [[pasture]]. This 'commune' (commons) is a strip of land one [[arpent]] wide with 40 arpents of shoreline.

The river bank was the site of a [[tow path]], and became a road, lined with grain elevators from 1879. A proposed elevated highway along the river over the Rue de la Commune spurred a movement to preserve the district. Dutch-born architect and urban planner [[Sandy van Ginkel|Daniel van Ginkel]] played a major role in saving the district from destruction during the early 1960s. As assistant director of the city of Montreal's newly formed planning department, he persuaded authorities to abandon plans for an expressway that would have cut through the old city.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/sandy-van-ginkel-rescued-old-montreal-from-freeway-developers/article1229337/|title=Sandy van Ginkel rescued Old Montreal from freeway developers|last=Martin|first=Sandra|date=July 23, 2009|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, most of Old Montreal was classified as an historic district

In 1970, the road was renamed from ''rue des Commissaires'', in memory of early colonial days. After the [[Port of Montreal]] was moved, the area became a recreational area in 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">The '''solar azimuth angle''' is the [[azimuth]] angle of the [[position of the Sun|Sun's position]].&lt;ref name="sukhatme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seinfeld and Pandis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffie"/&gt; This [[horizontal coordinate system|horizontal coordinate]] defines the [[Sun]]'s [[relative direction]] along the local [[horizon]], whereas the [[solar zenith angle]] (or its [[Angle#Combining angle pairs|complementary angle]] solar [[elevation]]) defines the Sun's apparent [[altitude]].

There are several conventions for the solar azimuth; however, it is traditionally defined as the angle between a line due [[south]] and the shadow cast by a vertical rod on [[Earth]]. This convention states the angle is positive if the line is [[east]] of south and negative if it is [[west]] of south.&lt;ref name="sukhatme"&gt;{{cite book |title=Solar Energy: Principles of Thermal Collection and Storage |first=S. P. |last=Sukhatme |date=2008 |edition=3rd |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0070260641 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seinfeld and Pandis"&gt;{{cite book |title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, from Air Pollution to Climate Change | first1=John H. | last1=Seinfeld | first2=Spyros N. |last2=Pandis |date=2006 |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-72018-8 |page=130 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471720186.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, due east would be 90° and due west would be -90°. Another convention is the reverse; it also has the origin at due south, but measures angles clockwise, so that due east is now negative and west now positive.&lt;ref name="Duffie"&gt;{{cite book |title=Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes |first1=John A. |last1=Duffie |first2=William A. |last2=Beckman |date=2013 |edition=4th |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-87366-3 |pages=13, 15, 20 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470873663.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite tradition, the most commonly accepted convention for analyzing [[solar irradiation]], e.g. for [[solar energy]] applications, is clockwise from due [[north]], so east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°. This is the definition used by [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|NREL]] in their solar position calculators&lt;ref name="SPA"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reda, I. |first=Andreas, A. |title=Solar Position Algorithm for Solar Radiation Applications |journal=Solar Energy |volume=76 |issue=5 |date=2004 |pages=577–89 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X0300450X |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2003.12.003 |issn=0038-092X |bibcode=2004SoEn...76..577R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the convention used in the [[#Formulas|formulas]] presented here. However, [[Landsat]] photos and other [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] products, while also defining azimuthal angles relative to due north, take counter[[clockwise]] angles as negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/landsat_dictionary.html#sun_azimuth |title=Sun Azimuth |work=Landsat Data Dictionary |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulas==
''Note: Both of these formulas assume the '''north-clockwise convention'''.'' The '''solar azimuth angle''' can be calculated to a good approximation with the following formula, however angles should be interpreted with care because the [[inverse sine]], i.e. x = sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(y) or x = arcsin(y), has multiple solutions, only one of which will be correct.
:&lt;math&gt;
\, \sin \phi_\mathrm{s} = \frac{-\sin h \cos \delta}{\sin \theta_\mathrm{s}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The following formulas can also be used to approximate the solar azimuth angle, but these formulas use cosine, so the azimuth angle as shown by a calculator will always be positive, and should be interpreted as the angle between zero and 180 degrees when the hour angle, ''h'', is negative (morning) and the angle between 180 and 360 degrees when the hour angle, ''h'', is positive (afternoon). (These two formulas are equivalent if you assume the "[[solar elevation angle]]" approximation formula).&lt;ref name="Seinfeld and Pandis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\, \cos \phi_\mathrm{s} = \frac{\sin \delta \cos \Phi - \cos h \cos \delta \sin \Phi}
                               {\sin \theta_\mathrm{s}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\, \cos \phi_\mathrm{s} = \frac{\sin \delta - \cos \theta_\mathrm{s}\sin \Phi }
                               {\sin \theta_\mathrm{s}\cos \Phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The formulas use the following terminology:
*&lt;math&gt;\, \phi_\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the solar azimuth angle
*&lt;math&gt;\, \theta_\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar zenith angle]]
*&lt;math&gt;\, h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hour angle]], in the local [[solar time]]
*&lt;math&gt;\, \delta&lt;/math&gt; is the current [[Position of the Sun|sun declination]]
*&lt;math&gt;\, \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[latitude]]

The '''space derby''' is a racing event for [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] that is similar to the [[pinewood derby]] car race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cub Scout Leader How-To Book |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |pages= 9–44 to 9–47 |isbn=0-8395-3832-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cub Scouts (the young-age division of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]) race miniature [[balsa wood]] gliders that are propelled by a [[rubber band]] and [[propeller]].

==Construction==
[[Image:Space Derby Rocket.jpg|left|thumb|250 px|Space derby glider]]
The space derby kit consists of a balsa wood block, [[propeller]] assembly, [[rubber band]]s, plastic sheet (for fins), and a mounting bracket. The wood block comes out of the box with a drilled out center hole. The block is carved into the desired shape, sanded and painted. The mounting bracket and fins can be added either before or after painting. The rubber band is inserted through the center hole with one end on the propeller and the other held in a cross-piece at the rear.

==Race==
The completed gliders are wound up with as many as 100 or more turns on the propeller and suspended on a string from a separate bracket with the propeller held in place. Two, three or four string lanes are typically used. The gliders are held in place and launched when the mechanism releases the propeller.

In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''stall''' is a reduction in the [[lift (force)|lift]] coefficient generated by a [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] as [[angle of attack]] increases.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', p. 486. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when the [[critical angle of attack]] of the foil is exceeded.  The critical angle of attack is typically about 15 degrees, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil, and [[Reynolds number]].

Stalls in fixed-wing flight are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift as the pilot increases the wing's angle of attack and exceeds its critical angle of attack (which may be due to slowing down below [[#Speed|stall speed]] in level flight). A stall does not mean that the engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving—the effect is the same even in an unpowered [[glider aircraft]]. [[Thrust vectoring|Vectored thrust]] in manned and unmanned aircraft is used to surpass the stall limit, thereby giving rise to [[post-stall]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Gal-Or, ''Vectored Propulsion, Supermaneuverability, and Robot Aircraft'', Springer Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|0-387-97161-0}}, {{ISBN|3-540-97161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USAF &amp; NATO Report RTO-TR-015 AC/323/(HFM-015)/TP-1 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because stalls are most commonly discussed in connection with [[aviation]], this article discusses stalls as they relate mainly to aircraft, in particular [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. The principles of stall discussed here translate to foils in other fluids as well.

==Formal definition==
[[File:StallFormation.svg|right|350px]]
A stall is a condition in [[aerodynamics]] and aviation wherein the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point such that lift begins to decrease. The angle at which this occurs is called the ''critical angle of attack''. This critical angle is dependent upon the airfoil section or profile of the wing, its [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]], its [[aspect ratio (aeronautics)|aspect ratio]], and other factors, but is typically in the range of 8 to 20 degrees relative to the incoming wind ("relative wind") for most subsonic airfoils. The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack on the [[lift coefficient]] versus angle-of-attack curve at which the maximum lift coefficient occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flow separation]] begins to occur at small angles of attack while attached flow over the wing is still dominant. As angle of attack increases, the separated regions on the top of the wing increase in size and hinder the wing's ability to create lift. At the critical angle of attack, separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle of attack produce ''less'' lift and more [[drag (physics)|drag]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A fixed-wing aircraft during a stall may experience [[buffeting]] or a change in [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]. Most aircraft are designed to have a gradual stall with characteristics that will warn the pilot and give them time to react. For example, an aircraft that does not buffet before the stall may have an audible alarm or a [[stick shaker]] installed to simulate the feel of a buffet by vibrating the stick fore and aft. The critical angle of attack in steady straight and level flight can be attained only at low airspeed. Attempts to increase the angle of attack at higher airspeeds can cause a high-speed stall or may merely cause the aircraft to climb.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Any [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] of the aircraft as it enters the stall regime can result in [[autorotation (fixed-wing aircraft)|autorotation]], which is also sometimes referred to as a "[[spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]". As air no longer flows smoothly over the wings during a stall, [[aileron]] control of roll becomes less effective, whilst simultaneously the tendency for the ailerons to generate [[adverse yaw]] increases. This characteristic increases the lift from the advancing wing and increases the likelihood of the aircraft entering into a spin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Graph==

[[File:Lift curve.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|An example of the relationship between angle of attack and lift on a cambered airfoil. The exact relationship is usually measured in a [[wind tunnel]] and depends on the airfoil section. The relationship for an aircraft wing depends on the planform and its aspect ratio.]]

The graph shows that the greatest amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached (which in early-20th century aviation was called the "burble point"). This angle is 17.5 degrees in this case, but it varies from airfoil to airfoil. In particular, for aerodynamically thick airfoils (thickness to [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] ratios of around 10%), the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]]. Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles (but also work efficiently in inverted flight). The graph shows that, as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, the lift produced by the airfoil decreases.

The information in a graph of this kind is gathered using a model of the airfoil in a [[wind tunnel]]. Because aircraft models are normally used, rather than full-size machines, special care is needed to make sure that data is taken in the same [[Reynolds number]] regime (or scale speed) as in free flight. The separation of flow from the upper wing surface at high angles of attack is quite different at low Reynolds number from that at the high Reynolds numbers of real aircraft. High-pressure wind tunnels are one solution to this problem. In general, steady operation of an aircraft at an angle of attack above the critical angle is not possible because, after exceeding the critical angle, the loss of lift from the wing causes the nose of the aircraft to fall, reducing the angle of attack again. This nose drop, independent of control inputs, indicates the pilot has actually stalled the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.28 and 16.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.D., ''A History of Aerodynamics'', pp. 296–311&lt;/ref&gt;

This graph shows the stall angle, yet in practice most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling in terms of [[airspeed]]. This is because all aircraft are equipped with an [[airspeed indicator]], but fewer aircraft have an angle of attack indicator. An aircraft's stalling speed is published by the manufacturer (and is required for certification by flight testing) for a range of weights and flap positions, but the stalling angle of attack is not published.

As speed reduces, angle of attack has to increase to keep lift constant until the critical angle is reached. The airspeed at which this angle is reached is the (1g, unaccelerated) stalling speed of the aircraft in that particular configuration. Deploying [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]]/slats decreases the stall speed to allow the aircraft to take off and land at a lower speed.

==Aerodynamic description==

===Fixed-wing aircraft===
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] can be made to stall in any [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|pitch]] attitude or bank angle or at any airspeed but deliberate stalling is commonly practiced by reducing the speed to the unaccelerated stall speed, at a safe altitude. Unaccelerated (1g) stall speed varies on different fixed-wing aircraft and is represented by colour codes on the [[airspeed indicator]]. As the plane flies at this speed, the angle of attack must be increased to prevent any loss of altitude or gain in airspeed (which corresponds to the stall angle described above). The pilot will notice the [[aircraft flight control system|flight controls]] have become less responsive and may also notice some buffeting, a result of the turbulent air separated from the wing hitting the tail of the aircraft.

In most [[light aircraft]], as the stall is reached, the aircraft will start to descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, until smooth air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver is normally quite safe, and, if correctly handled, leads to only a small loss in altitude (20–30&amp;nbsp;m/50–100&amp;nbsp;ft). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 61&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations Part25 section 201&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of an unfamiliar aircraft type. The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.

A special form of asymmetric stall in which the aircraft also rotates about its yaw axis is called a [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]. A spin can occur if an aircraft is stalled and there is an asymmetric yawing moment applied to it.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt; This yawing moment can be aerodynamic (sideslip angle, rudder, adverse yaw from the ailerons), thrust related (p-factor, one engine inoperative on a multi-engine non-centreline thrust aircraft), or from less likely sources such as severe turbulence. The net effect is that one wing is stalled before the other and the aircraft descends rapidly while rotating, and some aircraft cannot recover from this condition without correct pilot control inputs (which must stop yaw) and loading.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 23&lt;/ref&gt; A new solution to the problem of difficult (or impossible) stall-spin recovery is provided by the [[ballistic parachute]] recovery system.

The most common stall-spin scenarios occur on takeoff ([[departure resistance|departure]] stall) and during landing (base to final turn) because of insufficient airspeed during these maneuvers. Stalls also occur during a go-around manoeuvre if the pilot does not properly respond to the out-of-trim situation resulting from the transition from low power setting to high power setting at low speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Stall speed is increased when the wing surfaces are [[Atmospheric icing|contaminated with ice]] or frost creating a rougher surface, and heavier airframe due to ice accumulation.

Stalls occur not only at slow airspeed, but at any speed when the wings exceed their critical angle of attack. Attempting to increase the angle of attack at 1g by moving the control column back normally causes the aircraft to climb. However, aircraft often experience higher g-forces, such as when turning steeply or pulling out of a dive. In these cases, the wings are already operating at a higher angle of attack to create the necessary force (derived from lift) to accelerate in the desired direction. Increasing the g-loading still further, by pulling back on the controls, can cause the stalling angle to be exceeded, even though the aircraft is flying at a high speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These "high-speed stalls" produce the same buffeting characteristics as 1g stalls and can also initiate a spin if there is also any yawing.

===Symptoms of onset===
One symptom of an approaching stall is slow and sloppy controls. As the speed of the aircraft decreases approaching the stall, there is less air moving over the wing, and, therefore, less air will be deflected by the control surfaces (ailerons, elevator, and rudder) at this lower speed. Some buffeting may also be felt from the turbulent flow above the wings as the stall is reached. The stall warning will sound, if fitted, in most aircraft 5 to 10 knots above the stall speed.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations part 25 section 207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Different aircraft types have different stalling characteristics. A benign stall is one where the nose drops gently and the wings remain level throughout. Slightly more demanding is a stall in which one wing stalls slightly before the other, causing that wing to drop sharply, with the possibility of entering a spin. A dangerous stall is one in which the nose rises, pushing the wing deeper into the stalled state and potentially leading to an unrecoverable ''[[#Deep stall|deep stall]]''. This can occur in some T-tailed aircraft wherein the turbulent airflow from the stalled wing can blanket the control surfaces at the tail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Stalls depend only on angle of attack, not [[airspeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stick and Rudder|author=Langewiesche, Wolfgang|publisher=McGraw Hill|date=1972|pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more slowly an airplane goes, the greater the angle of attack it needs to produce lift equal to the aircraft's weight.&lt;ref name="phakcp4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-3of7.pdf|title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge – Chapter 4|accessdate=2014-03-13|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904015736/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-3of7.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the speed decreases further, at some point this angle will be equal to the [[Critical angle of attack|critical (stall) angle of attack]]. This speed is called the "stall speed". An aircraft flying at its stall speed cannot climb, and an aircraft flying below its stall speed cannot stop descending. Any attempt to do so by increasing angle of attack, without first increasing airspeed, will result in a stall.

The actual stall speed will vary depending on the airplane's weight, altitude, configuration, and vertical and lateral acceleration. Guidelines for the case of zero acceleration are provided by the following [[V speeds]]:
* V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;: The computed stalling speed with [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]] retracted at design speed. Often has the same value as V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt;: The stall speed in landing configuration (full flaps, [[landing gear]] down, [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] retracted).
* V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt;: The stall speed in a "clean" configuration (flaps, landing gear and spoilers all retracted as far as possible).
* V&lt;sub&gt;SR&lt;/sub&gt;: Reference stall speed.&lt;ref name="faacfr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=f553dbb9c06409a040f3d6865e435c70&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.2&amp;idno=14;cc=ecfr|title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations – Chapter 14.1|accessdate=2008-05-07|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* V&lt;sub&gt;SR0&lt;/sub&gt;: Reference stall speed in the landing configuration.
* V&lt;sub&gt;SR1&lt;/sub&gt;: Reference stall speed in the clean configuration.
* V&lt;sub&gt;SW&lt;/sub&gt;: Speed at which onset of natural or artificial stall warning occurs.

On an airspeed indicator, the bottom of the white arc indicates V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt; at maximum weight, while the bottom of the green arc indicates V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; at maximum weight. While an aircraft's V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; speed is computed by design, its V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; speeds must be demonstrated empirically by flight testing.&lt;ref&gt;Flight testing of fixed wing aircraft.

==In accelerated and turning flight==
[[File:Accelerated stall.gif|thumb|350px|Illustration of a turning flight stall, occurring during a co-ordinated turn with progressively increasing angle of bank.]]
The normal stall speed, specified by the V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values above, always refers to straight and level flight, where the [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] is equal to 1g. However, if the aircraft is turning or pulling up from a dive, additional lift is required to provide the vertical or lateral acceleration, and so the stall speed is higher. An accelerated stall is a stall that occurs under such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Considering, for example, a [[banked turn#Aviation|banked turn]], the [[lift (force)|lift]] required is equal to the [[weight]] of the aircraft plus extra lift to provide the [[centripetal force]] necessary to perform the turn; that is:&lt;ref name=Clancy5.22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W. (1979), ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics and Flight Mechanics'', p. 464, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York {{ISBN|0-471-03032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = nW&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = lift
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = load factor (greater than 1 in a turn)
:&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = weight of the aircraft

To achieve the extra lift, the [[lift coefficient]], and so the angle of attack, will have to be higher than it would be in straight and level flight at the same speed. Therefore, given that the stall always occurs at the same critical angle of attack,&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.8 and 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; by increasing the load factor (e.g., by tightening the turn) such critical angle – and the stall – will be reached with the airspeed remaining well above the normal stall speed,&lt;ref name="Clancy5.22"&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; that is:&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Equation 14.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W.

The table that follows gives some examples of the relation between the [[angle of bank]] and the square root of the load factor. It derives from the trigonometric relation ([[Cosecant|secant]]) between &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in a turn with bank angle of 45°, V&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; is 19% higher than V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.

It should be noted that, according to [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called '''turning flight stall''', while the term ''accelerated'' is used to indicate an ''accelerated turning stall'' only, that is, a turning flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A notable example of air accident involving a low-altitude turning flight stall is the [[1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash]].

==Types==

===Dynamic stall===
Dynamic stall is a non-linear unsteady aerodynamic effect that occurs when airfoils rapidly change the angle of attack. The rapid change can cause a strong [[vortex]] to be shed from the leading edge of the aerofoil, and travel backwards above the wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buchner |first1=A. J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |title=Measurements of the flow due to a rapidly pitching plate using time resolved high resolution PIV |journal=Aerospace Science and Technology |volume=44 |pages=4 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1270963814000789 |publisher=Aerospace Science and Technology |accessdate=18 October 2015 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.ast.2014.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vortex, containing high-velocity airflows, briefly increases the lift produced by the wing. As soon as it passes behind the trailing edge, however, the lift reduces dramatically, and the wing is in normal stall.&lt;ref name="Filippone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |title=Dynamic Stall, Unsteady Aerodynamics |accessdate=March 25, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229110350/http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |archivedate=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic stall is an effect most associated with helicopters and flapping wings, though also occurs in wind turbines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/jfm.2018.112 |title=Dynamic stall in vertical axis wind turbines: Scaling and topological considerations |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=841 |pages=746-66 |year=2018 |last1=Buchner |first1=A-J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |last3=Honnery |first3=D. |last4=Smits |first4=A.J. |bibcode=2018JFM...841..746B }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and due to gusting airflow. During forward flight, some regions of a helicopter blade may incur flow that reverses (compared to the direction of blade movement), and thus includes rapidly changing angles of attack. Oscillating (flapping) wings, such as those of insects—including the most famous one, the [[bumblebee]]—may rely almost entirely on dynamic stall for lift production, provided the oscillations are fast compared to the speed of flight, and the angle of the wing changes rapidly compared to airflow direction.&lt;ref name="Filippone" /&gt;

Stall delay can occur on [[airfoils]] subject to a high angle of attack and a three-dimensional flow. When the angle of attack on an airfoil is increasing rapidly, the flow will remain substantially attached to the airfoil to a significantly higher angle of attack than can be achieved in steady-state conditions. As a result, the stall is delayed momentarily and a lift coefficient significantly higher than the steady-state maximum is achieved. The effect was first noticed on [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Trubshaw&lt;ref&gt;"Low Speed Handling with Special Reference to the Super Stall" Trubshaw, Appendix III in "Trubshaw Test Pilot" Trubshaw and Edmondson, Sutton Publishing 1998, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; gives a broad definition of deep stall as penetrating to such angles of attack &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that pitch control effectiveness is reduced by the wing and nacelle wakes. He also gives a definition that relates deep stall to a locked-in condition where recovery is impossible. This is a single value of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, for a given aircraft configuration, where there is no pitching moment, i.e. a trim point.

Typical values both for the range of deep stall, as defined above, and the locked-in trim point are given for the [[Douglas DC-9]] Series 10 by Schaufele.&lt;ref&gt;"Applied Aerodynamics at the Douglas Aircraft Company-A Historical Perspective" Roger D. Schaufele, 37th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 11–14, 1999/Reno, NVFig.26 Deep Stall Pitching Moments&lt;/ref&gt; These values are from wind tunnel tests for an early design. The final design had no locked in trim point so recovery from the deep stall region was possible, as required to meet certification rules. Normal stall beginning at the 'g' break (sudden decrease of the vertical [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]]&lt;ref name=boeing/&gt;) was at 18 degrees &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, deep stall started at about 30 degrees and the locked-in unrecoverable trim point was at 47 degrees.

The very high &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for a deep stall locked-in condition occurs well beyond the normal stall but can be attained very rapidly as the aircraft is unstable beyond the normal stall and requires immediate action to arrest it. The loss of lift causes high sink rates which, together with the low forward speed at the normal stall, give a high &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with little or no rotation of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=trubshaw&gt;"Accident Report No. EW/C/039, Appendix IV in "Trubshaw Test Pilot" Trubshaw and Edmondson, Sutton Publishing 1998, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[BAC 1-11]] G-ASHG, during stall flight tests before the type was modified to prevent a locked-in deep stall condition, descended at over {{convert|10000|ft/min|m/s|-1}} and struck the ground in a flat attitude moving only {{convert|70|ft|m|-1}} forward after initial impact.&lt;ref name=trubshaw/&gt; Sketches which show how the wing wake blankets the tail may be misleading if they imply that deep stall requires a high body angle.

Effects similar to deep stall had been known to occur on some aircraft designs before the term was coined. A prototype [[Gloster Javelin]] ([[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial]] ''WD808'') was lost in a crash on 11 June 1953, to a "locked in" stall&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=20519 ASN Wikibase Occurrence # 20519] Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Waterton&lt;ref name=waterton&gt;"The Quick and the Dead" W.A.Waterton, Frederick Mueller, London 1956, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; states that the trimming tailplane was found to be the wrong way for recovery. Low speed handling tests were being done to assess a new wing.&lt;ref name=waterton/&gt; [[Handley Page Victor]] ''XL159'' was lost to a "stable stall" on 23 March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevictorassociation.org.uk/?p=491 A Tale of Two Victors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322161536/http://www.thevictorassociation.org.uk/?p=491 |date=2012-03-22 }} Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been clearing the fixed droop leading edge with the test being stall approach, landing configuration, C of G aft.

Brooks, Pen &amp; Sword Aviation 2007, {{ISBN|978 1 84415 570 5}}, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "deep stall" first came into widespread use after [[1963 BAC One-Eleven test crash|the crash]] of the prototype [[BAC 1-11]] G-ASHG on 22 October 1963, which killed its crew.&lt;ref&gt;""Report on the Accident to B.A.C.

Stick shakers are now a standard part of commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to cause accidents; on 3 June 1966, a [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] (G-ARPY), was [[1966 Felthorpe Trident crash|lost to deep stall]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19660603-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Hawker Siddeley HS-121 Trident 1C G-ARPY Felthorpe |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=1966-06-03 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; deep stall is suspected to be cause of another Trident (the [[British European Airways Flight 548]] ''G-ARPI'') crash – known as the "Staines Disaster" – on 18 June 1972 when the crew failed to notice the conditions and had disabled the stall recovery system.&lt;ref&gt;AIB Report 4/73, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 1980, a prototype of the [[Canadair Challenger]] [[business jet]] crashed after initially entering a deep stall from 17,000&amp;nbsp;ft and having both engines flame-out.

===Tip stall===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Aircraft with a [[swept wing]] suffer from a particular form of stalling behaviour at low speed. At high speed the airflow over the wing tends to progress directly along the chord, but as the speed is reduced a sideways component due to the angle of the [[leading edge]] has time to build up. Airflow at the root is affected only by the angle of the wing, but at a point further along the span, the airflow is affected both by the angle as well as any sideways component of the airflow from the air closer to the root. This results in a pattern of airflow that is progressively "sideways" as one moves toward the wingtip.

As it is only the airflow along the chord that contributes to lift, this means that the wing begins to develop less lift at the tip than the root. In extreme cases, this can lead to the wingtip entering stall long before the wing as a whole. In this case the average lift of the wing as a whole moves forward; the inboard sections are continuing to generate lift and are generally in front of the [[center of gravity]] (C of G), while the tips are no longer contributing and are behind the C of G. This produces a strong nose-up pitch in the aircraft, which can lead to more of the wing stalling, the lift moving further forward, and so forth. This chain reaction is considered very dangerous and was known as the [[pitch-up]].

Tip stall can be prevented in a number of ways, at least one of which is found on almost all modern aircraft. An early solution was the addition of [[wing fence]]s to re-direct sideways moving air back towards the rear of the wing. A similar solution is the dog-tooth notch seen on some aircraft, like the [[Avro Arrow]]. A more common modern solution is to use some degree of [[Washout (aviation)|washout]].

==Warning and safety devices==
Fixed-wing aircraft can be equipped with devices to prevent or postpone a stall or to make it less (or in some cases more) severe, or to make recovery easier.
* An '''aerodynamic twist''' can be introduced to the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called '''washout''' and causes the [[wing root]] to stall before the wing tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive. Since the stall is delayed at the wing tips, where the [[aileron]]s are, roll control is maintained when the stall begins.
* A '''[[stall strip]]''' is a small sharp-edged device that, when attached to the leading edge of a wing, encourages the stall to start there in preference to any other location on the wing. If attached close to the wing root, it makes the stall gentle and progressive; if attached near the wing tip, it encourages the aircraft to drop a wing when stalling.
* A '''[[Wing fence|stall fence]]''' is a flat plate in the direction of the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] to stop separated flow progressing out along the wing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |title=Stall fences and vortex generators |access-date=2009-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508032211/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |archive-date=2009-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Vortex generator]]s''', tiny strips of metal or plastic placed on top of the wing near the leading edge that protrude past the [[boundary layer]] into the free stream. As the name implies, they energize the boundary layer by mixing free stream airflow with boundary layer flow thereby creating vortices, this increases the [[momentum]] in the boundary layer. By increasing the momentum of the boundary layer, airflow separation and the resulting stall may be delayed.
* An '''anti-stall strake''' is a [[leading edge extension]] that generates a [[vortex]] on the wing upper surface to postpone the stall.
* A '''[[stick pusher]]''' is a mechanical device that prevents the pilot from stalling an aircraft. It pushes the elevator control forward as the stall is approached, causing a reduction in the angle of attack. In generic terms, a stick pusher is known as a ''stall identification device'' or ''stall identification system''.&lt;ref&gt;US [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Advisory Circular 25-7A ''Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes'', paragraph 228&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[stick shaker]]''' is a mechanical device that shakes the pilot's controls to warn of the onset of stall.
* A '''stall warning''' is an electronic or mechanical device that sounds an [[buzzer|audible warning]] as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain some form of this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a ''stall warning horn'', which consists of either a [[pressure]] [[sensor]] or a movable metal tab that actuates a [[switch]], and produces an audible warning in response.
* An '''angle-of-attack indicator''' for light aircraft, the "AlphaSystemsAOA" and a nearly identical "'''Lift Reserve Indicator'''", are both pressure differential instruments that display margin above stall and/or angle of attack on an instantaneous, continuous readout. The General Technics CYA-100 displays true angle of attack via a magnetically coupled vane. An AOA indicator provides a visual display of the amount of available lift throughout its slow speed envelope regardless of the many variables that act upon an aircraft. This indicator is immediately responsive to changes in speed, angle of attack, and wind conditions, and automatically compensates for aircraft weight, altitude, and temperature.
* An '''angle of attack limiter''' or an "alpha" limiter is a flight computer that automatically prevents pilot input from causing the plane to rise over the stall angle. Some alpha limiters can be disabled by the pilot.

Stall warning systems often involve inputs from a broad range of sensors and systems to include a dedicated angle of attack sensor.

Blockage, damage, or inoperation of stall and angle of attack (AOA) probes can lead to unreliability of the stall warning, and cause the stick pusher, overspeed warning, autopilot, and yaw damper to malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |title=Harco Probes Still Causing Eclipse Airspeed Problems |access-date=2008-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926190738/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |archive-date=2008-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a forward [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] is used for pitch control, rather than an aft tail, the canard is designed to meet the airflow at a slightly greater angle of attack than the wing. Therefore, when the aircraft pitch increases abnormally, the canard will usually stall first, causing the nose to drop and so preventing the wing from reaching its critical AOA. Thus, the risk of main wing stalling is greatly reduced. However, if the main wing stalls, recovery becomes difficult, as the canard is more deeply stalled and angle of attack increases rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Airplane stability and control By Malcolm J. Abzug, E. Eugene Larrabee Chapter 17 {{ISBN|0-521-80992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an aft tail is used, the wing is designed to stall before the tail. In this case, the wing can be flown at higher lift coefficient (closer to stall) to produce more overall lift.

Most military combat aircraft have an angle of attack indicator among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a stall warning indicator or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).

==Flight beyond the stall==
As a wing stalls, [[aileron]] effectiveness is reduced, making the plane hard to control and increasing the risk of a spin starting. [[Post stall]], steady flight beyond the stalling angle (where the coefficient of lift is largest) requires engine thrust to replace lift as well as alternative controls to replace the loss of effectiveness of the ailerons. For high-powered aircraft, the loss of lift (and increase in drag) beyond the stall angle is less of a problem than maintaining control. Some aircraft may be subject to [[post-stall gyration]] (e.g. the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]) or susceptible to entering a [[Spin (aerodynamics)#Unrecoverable spins|flat-spin]] (e.g. [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]). Control beyond-stall can be provided by reaction control systems (e.g. [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104A]]), vectored thrust, as well as a rolling [[stabilator]] (or taileron). The enhanced manoeuvering capability by flights at very high angles of attack can provide a tactical advantage for military fighters such as the [[F-22 Raptor]]. Short term stalls at 90–120° (e.g. [[Pugachev's Cobra]]) are sometimes performed at airshows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationfans.com/node/12 Pugachev's Cobra Maneuver]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest angle of attack in sustained flight so far demonstrated was 70 degrees in the [[X-31]] at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/X-31/HTML/EC94-42478-3.html X-31 EC94-42478-3: X-31 at High Angle of Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustained post-stall flight is a type of [[supermaneuverability]].

==Spoilers==
{{Main|Spoiler (aeronautics)}}
Except for flight training, airplane testing, and [[aerobatics]], a stall is usually an undesirable event. [[spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoilers]] (sometimes called lift dumpers), however, are devices that are intentionally deployed to create a carefully controlled [[flow separation]] over part of an aircraft's wing to reduce the lift it generates, increase the drag, and allow the aircraft to descend more rapidly without gaining speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoilers|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/spoil.html|publisher=[[NASA]], [[Glenn Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoilers are also deployed asymmetrically (one wing only) to enhance roll control. Spoilers can also be used on aborted take-offs and after main wheel contact on landing to increase the aircraft's weight on its wheels for better braking action.

Unlike powered airplanes, which can control descent by increasing or decreasing thrust, gliders have to increase drag to increase the rate of descent. In high-performance gliders, spoiler deployment is extensively used to control the approach to landing.

Spoilers can also be thought of as  "lift reducers" because they reduce the lift of the wing in which the spoiler resides. For example, an uncommanded roll to the left could be reversed by raising the right wing spoiler (or only a few of the spoilers present in large airliner wings). This has the advantage of avoiding the need to increase lift in the wing that is dropping (which may bring that wing closer to stalling).

==History==
[[Otto Lilienthal]] died while flying in 1896 as the result of a stall. Wilbur Wright encountered stalls for the first time in 1901, while flying his second glider. Awareness of Lilienthal's accident and Wilbur's experience, motivated the [[Wright Brothers]] to design their plane in "[[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]]" configuration. This made recoveries from stalls easier and more gentle. The design saved the brothers' lives more than once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm Designing the 1900 Wright Glider] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002349/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] worked on his "[[Autogiro]]" project to develop a rotary wing aircraft which, he hoped, would be unable to stall and which therefore would be safer than aeroplanes. In developing the resulting "[[autogyro]]" aircraft, he solved many engineering problems which made the [[helicopter]] possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7603">In [[fluid mechanics]], the '''Tait equation''' is an [[equation of state]], used to relate liquid [[density]] to [[pressure]].  The equation was originally published by [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] in 1888 in the form&lt;ref name=Hayward/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{V_0 - V}{(P - P_0) V_0} = -\frac{1}{V_0}\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta P} = \frac{A}{\Pi + (P - P_0)}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is the reference pressure (taken to be 1 atmosphere), &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the current pressure, &lt;math&gt; V_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the volume of fresh water at the reference pressure, &lt;math&gt; V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume at the current pressure, and &lt;math&gt;A, \Pi&lt;/math&gt; are experimentally determined parameters.
 
== Popular form of the Tait equation ==
Around 1895,&lt;ref name=Hayward/&gt; the original isothermal Tait equation was replaced by Tammann with an equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   -\frac{1}{V}\,\frac{dV}{dP} = \frac{A}{V (B + P)} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The temperature-dependent version of the above equation is popularly known as the '''Tait equation''' and is commonly written as&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Yuan-Hui|date=15 May 1967|title=Equation of State of Water and Sea Water|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|location=[[Palisades, New York]]|volume=72|issue=10|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/yhli/1967a.pdf|bibcode=1967JGR....72.2665L|pages=2665|doi=10.1029/JZ072i010p02665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \beta = -\frac{1}{V} \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right )_T = \frac{0.4343 C}{V(B+P)}&lt;/math&gt;

or in the integrated form

:&lt;math&gt; V = V_0 - C \log_{10} \left(\frac{B+P}{B+P_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[compressibility]] of the substance (often, [[compressibility of water|water]]) (in units of [[bar (unit)|bar]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or Pa)
*&lt;math&gt; V \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific volume]] of the substance (in units of [[litre|ml]]/[[gram|g]] or m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/kg)
*&lt;math&gt; V_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume at &lt;math&gt;P = P_0&lt;/math&gt; = 1 bar
*&lt;math&gt; B \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; C \ &lt;/math&gt; are functions of [[temperature]] that are independent of pressure&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

=== Pressure formula ===
The expression for the pressure in terms of the specific volume is
:&lt;math&gt;
   P = (B + P_0)\,10^\left[-\cfrac{V - V_0}{C}\right] - B \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Bulk modulus formula ===
The tangent bulk modulus at pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   K = \frac{V(B+P)}{0.4343 C} = \cfrac{\left[V_0 - C \log_{10} \left(\cfrac{B+P}{B+P_0}\right)\right](B+P)}{0.4343 C} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Murnaghan-Tait equation of state ==
[[File:WaterTaitMacDonaldEOSSpVol.pdf|250px|thumbnail|right|Specific volume as a function of pressure predicted by the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state.]]
Another popular isothermal equation of state that goes by the name "Tait equation"&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Thompson, P. A., &amp; Beavers, G. S. (1972). Compressible-fluid dynamics. Journal of Applied Mechanics, 39, 366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kedrinskiy, V. K. (2006). Hydrodynamics of Explosion: experiments and models. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; is the '''Murnaghan model'''&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;Macdonald, J. R. (1966). Some simple isothermal equations of state. Reviews of Modern Physics, 38(4), 669.&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{V}{V_0} = \left[1 + \frac{n}{K_0}\,(P - P_0)\right]^{-1/n}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume at pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume at pressure &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt; is the bulk modulus at &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a material parameter.

=== Pressure formula ===
This equation, in pressure form, can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   P = \frac{K_0}{n} \left[\left(\frac{V_0}{V}\right)^n - 1\right] + P_0 = \frac{K_0}{n} \left[\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^n - 1\right] + P_0 .
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho, \rho_0&lt;/math&gt; are mass densities at &lt;math&gt;P, P_0&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
For pure water, typical parameters are &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; = 101,325 Pa, &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/cu.m, &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt; = 2.15 GPa, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = 7.15{{Citation needed|reason=Compressibility of water seems rather around 6?|date=November 2016}}.

Note that this form of the Tate equation of state is identical to that of the [[Murnaghan equation of state]].

=== Bulk modulus formula ===
The tangent bulk modulus predicted by the MacDonald-Tait model is
:&lt;math&gt;
   K = K_0\left(\frac{V_0}{V}\right)^n \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Tumlirz-Tammann-Tait equation of state ==
[[File:WaterTaitEOS.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|Tumlirz-Tammann-Tait equation of state based on fits to experimental data on pure water.]]
A related equation of state that can be used to model liquids is the '''Tumlirz''' equation (sometimes called the '''Tammann equation''' and originally proposed by Tumlirz in 1909 and Tammann in 1911 for pure water).&lt;ref name=Hayward/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;Fisher, F. H., and O. E. Dial Jr. Equation of state of pure water and sea water. No. MPL-U-99/67. SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY LA JOLLA CA MARINE PHYSICAL LAB, 1975. http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a017775.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This relation has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   V(P,S,T) = V_\infty - K_1 S + \frac{\lambda}{P_0 + K_2 S + P}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; V(P,S,T) &lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the salinity, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature, and &lt;math&gt;V_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume when &lt;math&gt;P=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_1, K_2, P_0&lt;/math&gt; are parameters that can be fit to experimental data.

The Tumlirz-Tammann version of the Tait equation for fresh water, i.e., when &lt;math&gt; S = 0&lt;/math&gt;, is
:&lt;math&gt;
   V = V_\infty + \frac{\lambda}{P_0 + P} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For pure water, the temperature-dependence of &lt;math&gt;V_\infty , \lambda, P_0&lt;/math&gt; are:&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \lambda &amp;= 1788.316 + 21.55053\, T - 0.4695911\, T^2 + 3.096363 \times 10^{-3}\, T^3 - 0.7341182 \times 10^{-5}\, T^4 \\
     P_0 &amp;= 5918.499 + 58.05267\, T - 1.1253317\, T^2 + 6.6123869 \times 10^{-3}\, T^3 - 1.4661625 \times 10^{-5}\, T^4 \\
     V_\infty &amp;= 0.6980547 - 0.7435626 \times 10^{-3}\, T + 0.3704258 \times 10^{-4}\, T^2 - 0.6315724 \times 10^{-6}\, T^3 \\
               &amp; + 0.9829576 \times 10^{-8}\, T^4 - 0.1197269 \times 10^{-9} \,T^5 + 0.1005461 \times 10^{-11}\,T^6 \\
               &amp; - 0.5437898 \times 10^{-14} \,T^7 +  0.169946 \times 10^{-16}\, T^8 
               - 0.2295063 \times 10^{-19}\, T^9
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
In the above fits, the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is in degrees Celsius, &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is in bars, &lt;math&gt;V_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is in cc/gm, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is in bars-cc/gm.

=== Pressure formula ===
The inverse Tumlirz-Tammann-Tait relation for the pressure as a function of specific volume is
:&lt;math&gt;
   P =  \frac{\lambda}{V - V_\infty} - P_0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Bulk modulus formula ===
The Tumlirz-Tammann-Tait formula for the instantaneous tangent [[bulk modulus]] of pure water is a quadratic function of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; (for an alternative see &lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;Hayward, A. T. J. (1967). Compressibility equations for liquids: a comparative study. British Journal of Applied Physics, 18(7), 965. http://mitran-lab.amath.unc.edu:8081/subversion/Lithotripsy/MultiphysicsFocusing/biblio/TaitEquationOfState/Hayward_CompressEqnsLiquidsComparative1967.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;
   K = -V\,\frac{\partial P}{\partial V} = \frac{V\,\lambda}{(V - V_\infty)^2} = (P_0 + P) + \frac{V_\infty}{\lambda}(P_0 + P)^2\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Sri Lanka]]n people may have started cultivating [[rice]] as early as 800 B.C., according to documentary evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/111023/Plus/plus_16.html|title=From wild grass to golden grain|publisher=Sundaytimes.lk|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further evidence of early rice cultivation is the construction, since 390 B.C., of massive [[irrigation]] structures, [[reservoirs]], and interconnected [[canals]]. From ancient times, rice cultivation was not only an economic activity, but a way of life for the people of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agridept.gov.lk/index.php/en/crop-recommendations/808|title=Rice|publisher=Agridept.gov.lk|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some varieties of rice have been passed down for generations, and are called [[traditional]], [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]], or [[heirloom]].

Once renowned as the [[granary]] of the east, Sri Lanka offered more than 2000 indigenous rice varieties to the rest of the world. Rice cultivation in Sri Lanka was once considered sacred. The process remained [[sustainable]] due to the methods used for production, as well as the sanctity associated with the process of rice cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2008/4/27275_space.html |title=Sri Lanka - Granary of the East - Sri Lanka |publisher=Lankanewspapers.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonialism===
With the European [[colonization]] of Sri Lanka during the 16th and 18th centuries, more emphasis was given to other [[plantation]] [[crop]]s.  In the 20th century, however, rice was once again given attention. With an increase in the country's population, a new series of rice varieties, called "the H series," was introduced in the 1950s. [[Fertilizer]]s were also introduced at this time to increase harvest yield. As a result, the average yield of rice increased from 0.65 [[metric ton]]/[[hectare]] (mt/ha) to 1.73 mt/ha in 1950.

Unfortunately, many of the new rices  of Sri Lanka  contained lower concentrations  of [[glutamic acid]], [[vitamins]], and [[fiber]], and a higher [[glycemic index]] than  the traditional varieties. While the new rices were being produced in greater quantities, it was not as nutritious as the traditional rice that had once sustained the Sri Lankan people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/features/20020301value_of_rice.htm|title=Features|publisher=Priu.gov.lk|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medrs|date=August 2016}}

===Rise of the new rices===
By the 1980s, 90% of the farmland in Sri Lanka was being used to cultivate the "semi-dwarf" (newly improved) rice variety.

Currently, 95% of the rice produced in Sri Lanka are hybrid varieties.  These are harvested using non-[[organic fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]]s which are needed to produce larger harvests with lower costs.

However, traditional rice is gradually making a comeback.  This is due to increased global demand for [[organic food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agridept.gov.lk/index.php/en/institutes/136|title=Varietal Improvement_RRDI|author=|publisher=Agridept.gov.lk|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2011/1/63722_space.html |title=Dhasa Maha Yodhayo- The legendary ten giants of King Dutugemunu - Sri Lanka |publisher=Lankanewspapers.com |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional rices==
=== Suwandel ===
As the translated name implies, this is a fragrant white rice with an exquisite aroma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sljol.info/index.php/JNSFSL/article/view/2040|title=Identification of fragrant gene, fgr, in traditional rice varieties of Sri Lanka|publisher=Sljol.info|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its milky taste makes Suwandel a common choice for festive occasions and ceremonies. Nutritionally, the rice consists of 90% [[carbohydrates]], 7% [[crude protein]], 0.7% crude fat, and 0.1% crude fiber. Suwandel is known to contain higher amounts of glutamic acid and vitamins than other, more common rice varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slowfoodfoundation.com/ark/details/1459/suwandel-rice|title=Suwandel Rice - Sri Lanka  - Cereals and Flours - Ark of Taste - Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity|author=|publisher=Slowfoodfounation.com|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suwandel is an heirloom rice variety, cultivated organically with traditional rain-fed methods in the southern lowlands of Sri Lanka. Because of this, cultivation takes longer than other varieties of rice.  It is usually 5 to 6 months before harvest.  Heirloom rice cultivation in Sri Lanka is a sacred process.

=== Kalu Heenati ===
Kalu Heenati is literally translated as "dark, fine grain." It is a highly nutritious red rice that is considered to be good for daily consumption.

=== Maa-Wee ===
This is a reddish-brown rice variety with a unique texture.  It is low in carbohydrates, and rich in protein and fiber. Ma-Wee is also proven to have a 25% to 30% lower glycemic index (GI) than other common rice varieties. It is 84.5% carbohydrates, 9.4% protein, 3.6% fat, and 1.1% fiber.

Ma-Wee rice is best when soaked prior to boiling. One traditional dish calls for the rice to be cooked with chopped spring onion and [[leek]]s, and served with [[bottle gourd]] sautéed in spices and coconut milk.

Ma-Wee was loved by the queens of Sri Lanka, who believed it helped them maintain a trim, shapely figure.

Ma-Wee is also revered for its historical importance in religious ceremonies. According to folklore, Ma-Wee has been placed in the caskets of sacred [[relic]]s and the pinnacle (kotha) of dagabas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrimin.gov.lk/web/images/pdf/english_report%20.pdf |format=PDF |title=2011 Progress &amp; 2012 Programme : Ministry of agriculture |publisher=Agrimin.gov.lk |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pachchaperumal ===
The word "Pachchaperumal" means "The Lord [[Buddha]]’s color."  It is a wholesome red rice variety. When cooked, it takes on a deep, rich burgundy color. It is rich in nutrients and proteins, and is considered an excellent choice for an every day meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/10/19/spe02.asp |title=Spectrum &amp;#124; Sundayobserver.lk - Sri Lanka |publisher=Sundayobserver.lk |date=2008-10-19 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also said to be part of a good diet for people with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Pachchaperumal has long been considered a divine rice in traditional [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] culture. Traditionally, it was often used in [[alms]]-giving.
[[File:Pachchaperumal traditional sri lankan rice sml.jpg|alt=traditional Sri Lankan rice|thumb|Traditional Sri Lankan rice]]

=== Kuruluthuda ===
A nutritious red rice variety rich in proteins and fiber, kuruluthuda has a unique, pleasant taste.

===Others===
Other varieties include Rathdel, Madathawalu, and Hetadha Wee.

==Future==
Rice has a sacred association among [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]], and [[Muslim]] populations alike. It is said that rice cooked with coconut milk was the first offering made to Buddha, and to this day the dish is a staple of Sri Lankan culture during sacred festivals and important events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">'''Transition modeling''' is the use of a [[mathematical model|model]] to predict the change from [[Laminar flow|laminar]] and [[turbulence]] flows in fluids and their respective effects on the overall solution. The complexity and lack of understanding of the underlining physics of the problems makes simulating the interaction between laminar and turbulent flow to be difficult and very case specific.  Transition does have the wide range of turbulence options available for most CFD applications for the following reasons. Transition involves a wide range of scales where the energy and momentum transfer are strong influenced by inertial or non-linear effects that are unique to the simulation. Transition also occurs using different ways, (such as natural or bypass) where modelling all options are difficult. Most CFD code uses RANS where averaging eliminates linear disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A selective review of CFD transition models |author=D.Di Pasquale, A.Roma, S.J.

'''Trimethylglycine''' ('''TMG''') is an [[:Category:Amino acid derivatives|amino acid derivative]] that occurs in plants. Trimethylglycine was the first [[betaine]] discovered; originally it was simply called '''betaine''' because, in the 19th century, it was discovered in [[sugar beet]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|first1=Hubert|last1=Schiweck|first2=Margaret|last2=Clarke|first3=Günter|last3=Pollach|title=Sugar|doi=10.1002/14356007.a25_345.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many other betaines have been discovered, and the more specific name ''glycine betaine'' distinguishes this one.

== Structure and reactions ==
Trimethylglycine is an ''N''-trimethylated amino acid. This [[quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium]] exists as the [[zwitterion]] at neutral pH. Strong acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]] convert TMG to various salts, with [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]] yielding betaine hydrochloride:
:(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{chem|CO|2|−}} + HCl → [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H]Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
[[Demethylation]] of TMG gives [[dimethylglycine]]. Degradation of TMG yields [[trimethylamine]], the scent of [[Putrefaction|putrefying]] fish.

==Production and biochemical processes==
[[Food processing|Processing]] [[sucrose]] from sugar beets yields glycine betaine as a [[byproduct]]. The value of the TMG rivals that of the sugar content in sugar beets.&lt;ref name=Makela/&gt; 

=== Biosynthesis ===
In most organisms, glycine betaine is biosynthesized by oxidation of [[choline]] in two steps. The intermediate, [[betaine aldehyde]], is generated by the action of the enzyme mitochondrial choline oxidase ([[choline dehydrogenase]], EC 1.1.99.1). Betaine aldehyde is further oxidised in the [[mitochondria]] in mice to betaine by the enzyme betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8).&lt;ref name=Kempf&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kempf | first1 = B. | last2 = Bremer | first2 = E. | year = 1998 | title = Uptake and synthesis of compatible solutes as microbial stress responses to high-osmolality environments | url = | journal = Arch.

=== Biological function ===
TMG is an organic [[osmolyte]]. Sugar beet was cultivated from [[Sea beet]], which requires osmolytes in order to survive in the salty soils of coastal areas. TMG also occurs in high concentrations (~10&amp;nbsp;mM) in many marine invertebrates, such as crustaceans and molluscs. It serves as a potent appetitive attractant to generalist carnivores such as the predatory sea-slug ''Pleurobranchaea californica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10737805 | volume=97 | issue=7 | title=Cost-benefit analysis potential in feeding behavior of a predatory snail by integration of hunger, taste, and pain | pmc=16283 |date=March 2000 | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | pages=3585–3590 |last1=Gillette |first1=R. |last2=Huang |first2=R. C. |last3=Hatcher |first3=N. |last4=Moroz |first4=L. L. | doi=10.1073/pnas.97.7.3585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMG is an important [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in [[methylation]], a process that occurs in every mammalian cell donating [[methyl group]]s (-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for other processes in the body. These processes include the synthesis of [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]]. Methylation is also required for the biosynthesis of [[melatonin]] and the [[electron transport chain]] constituent [[coenzyme Q10|coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]], as well as the methylation of DNA for epigenetics.

The major step in the methylation cycle is the remethylation of [[homocysteine]], a compound which is naturally generated during demethylation of the essential amino acid [[methionine]]. Despite its natural formation, homocysteine has been linked to inflammation, depression, specific forms of dementia, and various types of vascular disease. The remethylation process that detoxifies homocysteine and converts it back to methionine can occur via either of two pathways. The pathway present in virtually all cells involves the enzyme [[methionine synthase]] (MS), which requires vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; as a cofactor, and also depends indirectly on [[folate]] and other B vitamins. The second pathway (restricted to liver and kidney in most mammals) involves [[betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase|betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT)]] and requires TMG as a cofactor. During normal physiological conditions, the two pathways contribute equally to removal of homocysteine in the body&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finkelstein|first=J. D.|date=1998-03-24|title=The metabolism of homocysteine: pathways and regulation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FPL00014300|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|language=en|volume=157|issue=S2|pages=S40–S44|doi=10.1007/pl00014300|issn=0340-6199}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Further degredation of betaine, via the enzyme [[dimethylglycine dehydrogenase]] produces folate, thus contributing back to methionine synthase. Betaine is thus involved in the synthesis of many biologically important molecules, and may be even more important in situations where the major pathway for the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine has been compromised by genetic polymorphisms such as mutations in the MS gene.

==TMG in agriculture and aquaculture==
[[Factory farming|Factory farms]] supplement [[fodder]] with TMG and [[lysine]] to increase livestocks' [[muscle mass]] (and, therefore, "carcass yield", the amount of usable meat).

[[Salmon farm]]s apply TMG to relieve the osmotic pressure on the salmon's cells when workers transfer the fish from freshwater to saltwater.&lt;ref name="Makela"&gt;{{cite journal|first=P.|last=Mäkelä|title=Agro-industrial uses of glycinebetaine|journal=Sugar Tech.|date=2004|volume=6|page=207–212|DOI=10.1007/BF02942500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xue"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xue|first1=M.|last2=Xie|first2=S.|last3=Cui|first3=Y.|date=2004|title=Effect of a feeding stimulant on feeding adaptation of gibel carp ''Carassius auratus gibelio'' (Bloch), fed diets with replacement of fish meal by meat and bone meal|journal=Aquacult. Res.|volume=35|page=473–482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMG supplementation decreases the amount of [[adipose tissue]] in pigs; however, research in human subjects has shown no effect on body weight, body composition, or resting energy expenditure.&lt;ref name="pmid12399266"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwab |first1=U. |last2=Törrönen |first2=A. |last3=Toppinen |first3=L. |displayauthors=etal |title=Betaine supplementation decreases plasma homocysteine concentrations but does not affect body weight, body composition, or resting energy expenditure in human subjects |journal=Am.

=== Dietary supplement ===
Although TMG supplementation decreases the amount of [[adipose tissue]] in pigs, research on human subjects has shown no effect on body weight, body composition, or resting energy expenditure when used in conjunction with a low calorie diet.&lt;ref name="pmid12399266"/&gt;  The [[Food and Drug Administration]] of the United States approved '''anhydrous trimethylglycine''' (also known by the brand name '''Cystadane''') for the treatment of [[homocystinuria]], a disease caused by abnormally high [[homocysteine]] levels at birth.&lt;ref name="homocysteine"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15550695 | doi=10.1161/01.ATV.0000151283.33976.e6 | volume=25 | issue=2 | title=Betaine and folate status as cooperative determinants of plasma homocysteine in humans |date=February 2005 | journal=Arterioscler.

E. |displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TMG is also used as the [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] (marketed as betaine hydrochloride or betaine HCl). Betaine hydrochloride was once permitted in [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter (OTC) drugs]] as a gastric aid in the United States. US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Section 310.540, which became effective on November 10, 1993, banned betaine hydrochloride from being used in OTC products due to insufficient evidence to classify it as "generally recognized as safe and effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=310.545&amp;SearchTerm=betaine%20hydrochloride|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

TMG supplementation may cause [[diarrhea]], stomach upset, or [[nausea]]. TMG supplementation lowers homocysteine but also raises LDL-cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olthof MR, van Vliet T, Verhoef P, Zock PL, Katan MB |title=Effect of homocysteine-lowering nutrients on blood lipids: results from four randomised, placebo-controlled studies in healthy humans |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e135 |year=2005 |pmid=15916468 |pmc=1140947 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020135 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses: PCR ===&lt;!--seems highly specialized--&gt;
Trimethylglycine can act as an [[adjuvant]] of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) process, and other [[DNA polymerase]]-based assays such as [[DNA sequencing]]. By an unknown mechanism, it aids in the prevention of secondary structures in the DNA molecules, and prevents problems associated with the amplification and sequencing of GC-rich regions.

TMG has been proposed as a treatment for depression. In theory, it would increase [[S-adenosylmethionine|''S''-adenosylmethionine]] (SAMe) by remethylating homocysteine. The same homocysteine-to-methionine result could be achieved by supplementing with folic acid and vitamin B12, methionine then serving as a precursor to synthesis of SAMe. SAMe as a dietary supplement has been shown to work as a nonspecific antidepressant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mischoulon D, Fava M |title=Role of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the treatment of depression: a review of the evidence |journal=Am.

The '''Wisconsin Hybrid Vehicle Team''' consists mainly of undergraduate students from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] who work together to build a [[hybrid electric vehicle]].

==The Team==
Many of the members have little to no previous automotive experience. New team members are taught alongside veteran student members. This passing of knowledge ensures a legacy that is carried on to younger generations.

The team is subdivided into five major groups to handle necessary tasks. The Mechanical and Drivetrain groups work to design and implement new components, renovate old parts, and perform general vehicle maintenance. The Control and Electrical Groups are responsible for maintaining all of the vehicle computer and electrical components; this includes developing a complex control strategy and programing the [[electronic control unit]], rewiring the vehicle to accommodate the hybrid systems, and maintaining the battery pack as well as other electrically sensitive components. The Outreach group is responsible for publishing newsletters, maintaining the website, obtaining positive relationships with local businesses and community, and involving the team in community events.
Each group is led by a veteran team member who meet to coordinate projects and make decisions for the vehicle's progress. Each leader is responsible to teach each of the groups attendants safely.

==Current Competition==
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20080329222703/http://www.ecocarchallenge.org/ EcoCar Challenge] is a three-year competition sponsored by the U.S. DOE, GM, and Argonne National Labs for 2008-2010. Seventeen universities from the US and Canada were selected to participate.
In the first year, teams concentrated on designing, modeling, and simulating their teams proposed vehicle architecture. Additionally, teams worked to create a functional HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) to demonstrate their capability to manage a vehicle's ECU. The first year's competition was completed in June 2009 in Toronto, OH Canada.

In the first year of the competition, the UWHVT developed an architecture that was a powersplit [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] design. Technical papers were created at intervals throughout the year dictating decisions and results of simulations. It consists of a prototype traction motor, the 150&amp;nbsp;kW Continental AG Sapphire drive. A Weber MPE 750 engine (operating on [[E85]]) and the Delphi DU174 motor (found in the [[EV1]]) complete the genset. A clutch implemented in between the DU174 and the Weber allow for efficient all electric drive, while a clutch implemented in between the DU174 and the rear differential allows the Weber engine to be directly coupled to the road at highway speeds. Lastly, the battery pack located in the spare rear wheel compartment will be a Johnson Controls Saft 41Ah [[lithium-ion]] pack.

The UWHVT expects to receive its stock Saturn Vue in August 2009 and proceed building the vehicle in year 2. Competition for year two of the challenge will be in Yuma, AZ at [http://www.autoblog.com/2009/07/23/gm-and-army-open-up-new-test-facility-on-yuma-proving-ground/ GM's new proving ground].

'''Vanadium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''V''' and [[atomic number]] 23. It is a hard, silvery-grey, [[ductile]], and [[malleable]] [[transition metal]]. The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, the formation of an [[oxide]] layer ([[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]) somewhat stabilizes the free metal against further [[oxidation]].

[[Andrés Manuel del Río]] discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801 in [[Mexico]] by analyzing a new [[lead]]-bearing mineral he called "brown lead", and presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element, which he named ''erythronium'' (derived from Greek for "red") since, upon heating, most of the [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] turned red. Four years later, however, he was (erroneously) convinced by other scientists that erythronium was identical to [[chromium]]. [[Chloride]]s of vanadium were generated in 1830 by [[Nils Gabriel Sefström]] who thereby proved that a new element was involved, which he named "vanadium" after the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility, [[Vanadís]] ([[Freyja]]). Both names were attributed to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds. Del Rio's lead mineral was later renamed [[vanadinite]] for its vanadium content. In 1867 [[Henry Enfield Roscoe]] obtained the pure element.

Vanadium occurs naturally in about 65 [[mineral]]s and in [[fossil fuel]] deposits. It is produced in [[China]] and [[Russia]] from steel smelter [[slag]]; other countries produce it either from magnetite directly, flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of [[uranium]] mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty [[steel]] [[alloy]]s such as [[High-speed steel|high-speed tool steels]]. The most important industrial vanadium compound, [[Vanadium(V) oxide|vanadium pentoxide]], is used as a catalyst for the production of [[sulfuric acid]].

Large amounts of vanadium [[ions]] are found in a few organisms, possibly as a [[toxin]]. The oxide and some other salts of vanadium have moderate toxicity. Particularly in the ocean, vanadium is used by some life forms as an active center of [[enzymes]], such as the [[vanadium bromoperoxidase]] of some ocean [[algae]].

==History==
Vanadium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Andrés Manuel del Río]], a Spanish-Mexican mineralogist, in 1801. Del Río extracted the element from a sample of Mexican "brown lead" ore, later named [[vanadinite]]. He found that its salts exhibit a wide variety of colors, and as a result he named the element ''panchromium'' (Greek: παγχρώμιο "all colors"). Later, Del Río renamed the element ''erythronium'' (Greek: ερυθρός "red") because most of the salts turned red upon heating. In 1805, the French chemist [[Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils]], backed by del Río's friend Baron [[Alexander von Humboldt]], incorrectly declared that del Río's new element was only an impure sample of [[chromium]]. Del Río accepted Collet-Descotils' statement and retracted his claim.&lt;ref name="Cintas"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Road to Chemical Names and Eponyms: Discovery, Priority, and Credit|author = Cintas, Pedro|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume = 43|issue = 44|date = 2004|pmid = 15376297|doi = 10.1002/anie.200330074|pages = 5888–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, the Swedish chemist [[Nils Gabriel Sefström]] rediscovered the element in a new oxide he found while working with [[iron ore]]s. Later that same year, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] confirmed del Río's earlier work.&lt;ref name="sefs"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber das Vanadin, ein neues Metall, gefunden im Stangeneisen von Eckersholm, einer Eisenhütte, die ihr Erz von Taberg in Småland bezieht|first = N. G.|last = Sefström|journal = [[Annalen der Physik und Chemie]]|volume = 97|pages= 43–49|date = 1831|doi = 10.1002/andp.18310970103|bibcode = 1831AnP....97...43S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sefström chose a name beginning with V, which had not been assigned to any element yet. He called the element ''vanadium'' after [[Old Norse]] ''[[List of names of Freyja|Vanadís]]'' (another name for the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Vanir|Vanr]] goddess [[Freyja]], whose attributes include beauty and fertility), because of the many beautifully colored [[chemical compound]]s it produces.&lt;ref name="sefs" /&gt; In 1831, the geologist [[George William Featherstonhaugh]] suggested that vanadium should be renamed "''rionium''" after del Río, but this suggestion was not followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = The Monthly American Journal of Geology and Natural Science |first = George William|last = Featherstonhaugh |title=New Metal, provisionally called Vanadium |year = 1831|page=69 | url = https://archive.org/stream/monthlyamericanj11831phil#page/68/mode/2up/search/rionium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Featherstonhaugh, the editor of the journal cited, comments on a letter from Berzelious to [[Pierre Louis Dulong]]--&gt;

[[File:1910Ford-T.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Model T]] made use of vanadium steel in its [[chassis]].]]
The isolation of vanadium metal proved difficult. In 1831, [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]] reported the production of the metal, but [[Henry Enfield Roscoe]] showed that Berzelius had in fact produced the nitride, [[vanadium nitride]] (VN). Roscoe eventually produced the metal in 1867 by reduction of [[vanadium(II) chloride]], VCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name="Roscoe"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Researches on Vanadium. Part II|author = Roscoe, Henry E. |journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society of London]]|volume = 18|pages=37–42|date =1869–1870|doi =10.1098/rspl.1869.0012|issue = 114–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, pure vanadium was produced by reducing [[vanadium pentoxide]] with [[calcium]].&lt;ref name="Marden"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Vanadium|first = J.

The first large-scale industrial use of vanadium was in the [[steel]] alloy chassis of the [[Ford Model T]], inspired by French race cars.

[[File:Vanadium-bar.jpg|thumb|right|High-purity (99.95%) vanadium cuboids, [[Electron beam technology|ebeam remelted]] and macro-etched]]
Vanadium is a medium-hard, [[ductility|ductile]], steel-blue metal. It is electrically [[conductive]] and thermally [[Thermal insulation|insulating]]. Some sources describe vanadium as "soft", perhaps because it is ductile, [[malleable]] and not [[brittle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George F. Vander Voort|title=Metallography, principles and practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRQC8zYqtBIC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=17 September 2011|date=1984|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-0-87170-672-0|pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=François Cardarelli|title=Materials handbook: a concise desktop reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvU-qbQJq7IC&amp;pg=PA338|accessdate=17 September 2011|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84628-668-1|pages=338–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanadium is harder than most metals and steels (see [[Hardnesses of the elements (data page)]] and [[Iron#Mechanical properties|iron]]). It has good resistance to [[corrosion]] and it is stable against [[alkali]]s and [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] acids.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1071–1075|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|author2 = Wiberg, Egon|author3 = Wiberg, Nils|chapter = Vanadium| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[oxidation|oxidized]] in air at about 933&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (660&amp;nbsp;°C, 1220&amp;nbsp;°F), although an oxide [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer forms even at room temperature.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of vanadium}}
Naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;V, and one radioactive isotope, &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;V. The latter has a [[half-life]] of 1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; years and a natural abundance of 0.25%. &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;V has a [[nuclear spin]] of {{frac|7|2}}, which is useful for [[NMR spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A. H.| url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four artificial [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, ranging in [[mass number]] from 40 to 65. The most stable of these isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;V with a half-life of 330 days, and &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;V with a half-life of 16.0 days. The remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, most below 10 seconds. At least four isotopes have [[nuclear isomer|metastable excited states]].&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt; [[Electron capture]] is the main [[decay mode]] for isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;V. For the heavier ones, the most common mode is [[beta decay]]. The electron capture reactions lead to the formation of element 22 ([[titanium]]) isotopes, while beta decay leads to element 24 ([[chromium]]) isotopes.

The chemistry of vanadium is noteworthy for the accessibility of the four adjacent [[oxidation state]]s 2–5. In [[Metal ions in aqueous solution|aqueous solution]], vanadium forms [[metal aquo complex]]es&lt;nowiki/&gt; of which the colours are lilac [V(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, green [V(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, blue [VO(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, yellow VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Vanadium(II) compounds are reducing agents, and vanadium(V) compounds are oxidizing agents. Vanadium(IV) compounds often exist as [[vanadyl ion|vanadyl]] derivatives, which contain the VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;

[[Ammonium metavanadate|Ammonium vanadate(V)]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be successively reduced with elemental [[zinc]] to obtain the different colors of vanadium in these four oxidation states. Lower oxidation states occur in compounds such as V(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, {{chem|[V(CO)|6|]|-}} and substituted derivatives.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;

The most commercially important compound is [[Vanadium(V) oxide|vanadium pentoxide]]. It is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt; This compound oxidizes [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) to the [[sulfur trioxide|trioxide]] ({{chem|SO|3}}). In this [[redox reaction]], sulfur is oxidized from +4 to +6, and vanadium is reduced from +5 to +4:
: V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The catalyst is regenerated by oxidation with air:
: 4 VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
Similar oxidations are used in the production of maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, and several other bulk organic compounds.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Günter Bauer, Volker Güther, Hans Hess, Andreas Otto, Oskar Roidl, Heinz Roller, Siegfried Sattelberger "Vanadium and Vanadium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a27_367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vanadium redox battery]] utilizes all four oxidation states; one electrode uses the +5/+4 couple and the other uses the +3/+2 couple. Conversion of these oxidation states is illustrated by the reduction of a strongly acidic solution of a vanadium(V) compound with zinc dust or amalgam. The initial yellow color characteristic of the pervanadyl ion [VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is replaced by the blue color of [VO(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by the green color of [V(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and then the violet color of [V(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt;

===Oxyanions===
[[Image:decavanadate polyhedra.png|thumb|The [[decavanadate]] structure]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Ammonium-metavanadate-chains-3D.png|thumb|upright|Metavanadate chains]] --&gt;In aqueous solution, vanadium(V) forms an extensive family of [[oxyanion]]s. The interrelationships in this family are described by the [[predominance diagram]], which shows at least 11 species, depending on pH and concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|page=984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrahedral orthovanadate ion, {{chem|VO|4|3−}}, is the principal species present at pH 12-14. Similar in size and charge to phosphorus(V), vanadium(V) also parallels its chemistry and crystallography. [[Sodium orthovanadate|Orthovanadate]] V{{chem|O|4|3−}} is used in [[protein crystallography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume = 577|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2004.10.022|pmid = 15556602|date = 2004|title = The power of vanadate in crystallographic investigations of phosphoryl transfer enzymes|first = Irmgard|last = Sinning|journal = FEBS Letters|last2 = Hol|first2 = Wim G.

At lower pH values, the monomer [HVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and dimer [V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are formed, with the monomer predominant at vanadium concentration of less than c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;M (pV &gt; 2, where pV is equal to the minus value of the logarithm of the total vanadium concentration/M). The formation of the divanadate ion is analogous to the formation of the [[dichromate]] ion. As the pH is reduced, further protonation and condensation to [[vanadate|polyvanadates]] occur: at pH 4-6 [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is predominant at pV greater than ca. 4, while at higher concentrations trimers and tetramers are formed. Between pH 2-4 [[decavanadate]] predominates, its formation from orthovanadate is represented by this condensation reaction:
:10 [VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  24 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  →  [V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In decavanadate, each V(V) center is surrounded by six oxide [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF" /&gt; Vanadic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; results in the preferential formation of the octahedral [VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH&lt;2. [VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the predominant species, while the oxide V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the [[inorganic anhydride]] of vanadic acid. The structures of many [[vanadate]] compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.

Vanadium(V) forms various peroxo complexes, most notably in the active site of the vanadium-containing [[bromoperoxidase]] enzymes. The species VO(O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is stable in acidic solutions. In alkaline solutions, species with 2, 3 and 4 peroxide groups are known; the last forms violet salts with the formula M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (M = Li, Na, etc.), in which the vanadium has an 8-coordinate dodecahedral structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}, p994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lmt3x9CyfLgC&amp;pg=PA128|page=128|title=Catalytic oxidations with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant|author=Strukul, Giorgio|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-1771-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halide derivatives===
Twelve binary [[halides]], compounds with the formula VX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (n=2..5), are known. VI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, VCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, VBr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and VI&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; do not exist or are extremely unstable. In combination with other reagents, [[Vanadium(IV) chloride|VCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] is used as a catalyst for polymerization of [[diene]]s. Like all binary halides, those of vanadium are [[Lewis acid]]ic, especially those of V(IV) and V(V). Many of the halides form octahedral complexes with the formula VX&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6−''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (X = halide; L = other ligand).

Many vanadium [[oxyhalide]]s (formula VO&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|page=993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxytrichloride and oxytrifluoride ([[Vanadium oxytrichloride|VOCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Vanadium oxytrifluoride|VOF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) are the most widely studied. Akin to POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, they are volatile, adopt tetrahedral structures in the gas phase, and are Lewis acidic.

===Coordination compounds===
[[File:Vanadyl-acetylacetonate-from-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|A [[ball-and-stick model]] of VO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are relatively exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, as is the case in [V(CN)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The coordination chemistry of V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; is dominated by the [[vanadyl]] center, VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is [[vanadyl acetylacetonate]] (V(O)(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the [[association constant]] of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordination chemistry of V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.

The [[vanadyl ion]] is abundant in [[seawater]], having an average concentration of 30 [[Molar concentration#Units|nM]].&lt;ref name=Dieter /&gt; Some [[mineral water]] [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] also contain the ion in high concentrations.

Most vanadium is used as a [[steel]] alloy called [[ferrovanadium]].  Ferrovanadium is produced directly by reducing a mixture of vanadium oxide, iron oxides and iron in an electric furnace. The vanadium ends up in [[pig iron]] produced from vanadium-bearing magnetite. Depending on the ore used, the slag contains up to 25% of vanadium.&lt;ref name="Moskalyk" /&gt;

Vanadium metal is obtained by a multistep process that begins with the roasting of crushed ore with [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] or [[sodium carbonate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] at about 850&amp;nbsp;°C to give [[sodium metavanadate]] (NaVO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). An aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to give "red cake", a polyvanadate salt, which is reduced with [[calcium]] metal. As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with [[hydrogen]] or [[magnesium]]. Many other methods are also in use, in all of which vanadium is produced as a [[byproduct]] of other processes.&lt;ref name="Moskalyk" /&gt; Purification of vanadium is possible by the [[crystal bar process]] developed by [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] in 1925. It involves the formation of the metal iodide, in this example [[vanadium(III) iodide]], and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Preparation of High-Purity Vanadium Metals by the Iodide Refining Process|journal = Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume = 108|page=88|date = 1961|first = O.

Vanadium stabilizes the beta form of titanium and increases the strength and temperature stability of titanium. Mixed with [[aluminium]] in [[titanium]] alloys, it is used in [[jet engine]]s, high-speed airframes and [[dental implant]]s. The most common alloy for seamless tubing is [[Titanium alloy#Grades of titanium|Titanium 3/2.5]] containing 2.5% vanadium, the titanium alloy of choice in the aerospace, defense and bicycle industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Supplement: Titanium|url=http://www.sevencycles.com/buildingbike/techsupplement/ti.php|website=Seven Cycles|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common alloy, primarily produced in sheets, is [[Titanium 6AL-4V]], a titanium alloy with 6% aluminium and 4% vanadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Titan und Titanlegierungen|chapter = Metastabile β-Legierungen|first = Manfred|last = Peters|author2=Leyens, C. |publisher = Wiley-VCH|date = 2002|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sxdR882jQpYC&amp;pg=PA23|isbn = 978-3-527-30539-1|pages = 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanadyl sulfate as a dietary supplement has been researched as a means of increasing insulin sensitivity or otherwise improving glycemic control in people who are diabetic.

In [[particle physics]], a '''vector boson''' is a [[boson]] with the [[spin (physics)|spin]] equal to 1.  The vector bosons regarded as [[elementary particle]]s in the [[Standard Model]] are the [[gauge boson]]s, the [[force carrier]]s of [[fundamental interaction]]s: the [[photon]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak interaction]], and the [[gluon]]s of the [[strong interaction]]. Some [[composite particle]]s are vector bosons, for instance any [[vector meson]] ([[quark]] and [[antiquark]]). During the 1970s and 1980s, '''intermediate vector bosons'''—vector bosons of "intermediate" mass (a mass between the two of the [[vector meson]]s)—drew much attention in [[particle physics]].

==Vector bosons and the Higgs==
[[Image:BosonFusion-Higgs.svg|miniature|thumb|[[Feynman diagram]] of the fusion of two [[electroweak]] vector bosons to the scalar [[Higgs boson]], which is a prominent process of the generation of Higgs bosons at particle accelerators.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(The symbol q means a [[quark]] particle, W and Z are the vector bosons of the [[electroweak interaction]]. H&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the Higgs boson.)&lt;/small&gt;]]
The Z and W particles interact with the [[Higgs boson]] as shown in the [[Feynman diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/27888-newfound-particle-is-higgs.html|title=Confirmed! Newfound Particle Is a Higgs Boson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Explanation==
The name ''vector boson'' arises from [[quantum field theory]]. The [[vector component|component]] of such a particle's spin along any axis has the three [[eigenvalue]]s −''ħ'', 0, and +''ħ'' (where ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]]), meaning that any measurement of its spin can only yield one of these values. (This is, at least, true for [[rest mass|massive]] vector bosons; the situation is a bit different for [[massless particle]]s such as the photon, for reasons beyond the scope of this article. See [[Wigner's classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/2/287.full.pdf|title=Some Comments Regarding Spin and Relativity|author=[[Robert Weingard|Weingard, Robert]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  The space of spin [[quantum state|states]] therefore is a discrete [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] consisting of three states, the same as the number of components of a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] in three-dimensional space. [[Quantum superposition]]s of these states can be taken such that they transform under [[rotation formalisms in three dimensions|rotations]] just like the spatial components of a rotating vector{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} (the so named [[representation theory of SU(2)|'''3''' representation of SU(2)]]).  If the vector boson is taken to be the [[quantum]] of a field, the field is a [[vector field]], hence the name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">The '''World Human Powered Vehicle Association''' is dedicated to promoting the design and development of [[human-powered vehicle]]s. Its main focus is coordinating between national HPV clubs with regard to competitions and records. The WHPVA also supports the Human Power eJournal, with a broader focus including stationary uses of human power.

== History ==
The WHPVA was originally called the IHPVA ([[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]]), which was founded in 1976 in the USA and was for many years an association of individual members. In 1997 the IHPVA was reorganized into an international association with national organizations as members and an American association which adopted the name Human Powered Vehicle Association HPVA.

Due to conflicts regarding record keeping and copyrights, the HPVA left the IHPVA in 2004. In 2008 the HPVA decided to rename itself to IHPVA while the IHPVA of this time decided to keep its name, resulting in two organizations with the same name.

In a hostile takeover, the American IHPVA also seized control of the domain name ihpva.org away from the international IHPVA. The IHPVA tried to regain its domain by appealing to the ICANNs ombudsman but was unsuccessful and in 2009 itself renamed to WHPVA.

== WHPVA records ==
The WHPVA maintains speed and distance records for various times and distances for land, water and air vehicles. The best [[hour record]] is currently held by Francesco Russo of Switzerland with a total distance of {{convert|92.43|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Since 2009, this recordbase has forked from the previously identical one of the [[IHPVA]].
