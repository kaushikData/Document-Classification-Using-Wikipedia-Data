In [[computing]], ''' 10-foot user interface''' ("10-foot UI") is a [[graphical user interface]] designed for [[television]]s. Compared to [[desktop computer]] and [[smartphone]] user interfaces, it uses text and other interface elements which are much larger in order to accommodate a typical television viewing distance of 10 feet (3 meters). Additionally, the limitations of a television's [[remote control]] necessitate extra [[User experience design|user experience]] considerations to minimize user effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX06/BTB029 The Digital Home: Designing for the Ten-Foot User Interface]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/nuci3hometheatersolutionguide_v02.pdf Intel Next Unit of Computing Driving your 10 foot experience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easyclasspage.de/mac/seite-16.html 10 foot Style / Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Growl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The term "10-foot" is used to differentiate this user interface style from those used on desktop computers, which typically assume the user's eyes are only about two feet (60 cm) from the display. This difference in distance from the display has a huge impact on the interface design, requiring the use of extra large fonts on a television and allowing relatively few items to be shown on a television at once.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=10-foot+user+interface&amp;i=36892,00.asp#fbid=8WN9yzOrfhM PC Magazine Definition of: 10-foot user interface]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://developer.android.com/design/tv/style.html Style for TV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.nvidia.com/android-tv-developer-guide Android TV Developer Guide (Nvidia)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10 foot UI is almost always designed to be operated by a simple hand-held remote control. Rather than the [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or [[touchscreen]] which are commonly used with other types of user interfaces, the remote's [[D-pad|directional pad]] is the primary means of navigation. This means that a 10-foot UI needs to arrange items on screen in a way that clearly shows which item would be next in each of the four directions of the directional pad - usually a grid layout. Also, without a mouse cursor, the currently-selected item must be highlighted in some way.

Ten-foot interfaces may resemble other [[post-WIMP]] systems graphically, due to a similar paucity of pixels, but do not assume the use of a [[touch screen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/upload/avermediatvsoftware/index.html AVerMedia TV Software]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://appdevconf.engagedigital.com/sessions/keys-to-successfully-building-a-10-ft-ui/# |title=Building a 10 Foot UI: Dealing With Platform Diversity |access-date=2011-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114121831/http://appdevconf.engagedigital.com/sessions/keys-to-successfully-building-a-10-ft-ui/# |archive-date=2011-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of 10 foot user interface design is normally to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, trying to achieve a more laid-back and relaxed user experience with as few button presses as possible while still having an intuitive layout, in terms of accomplishing user goals&amp;mdash;what is often called [[user-centered design]]. Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. [[Graphic design]] may be utilized to support its [[usability]]; however, the design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements (e.g., [[mental model]]) to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.android.com/design/tv/index.html Designing for Android TV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-10-foot-home-TV-experience-so-hard-to-get-right Why is the "10 foot" home TV experience so hard to get right?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.android.com/training/tv/index.html Building Apps for TV&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arawak''' (Arowak/Aruák), also known as '''Lokono''' ('''Lokono Dian''', literally 'people's talk' by its speakers), is an [[Arawakan language]] spoken by the [[Lokono]] (Arawak) people of [[South America]] in eastern [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Pet, Willem J. A. A Grammar Sketch and Lexicon of Arawak (Lokono Dian). SIL International. 2011. p 2. http://www-01.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/928474543236/e-Books_30_Pet_Arawak_Suriname.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is the eponymous language of the Arawakan language family.

Lokono has an [[active–stative]] syntax.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald, "Arawak", in Dixon &amp; Aikhenvald, eds., ''The Amazonian Languages'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Lokono is a critically endangered language.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1708|title=Lokono|last=|first=|date=|website=endangeredlanguages|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lokono language is most commonly spoken in South America. Some specific countries where this language is spoken include Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Venezuela.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sPGe7aBSkpkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=arawak+language+(lokono)&amp;ots=YVkULFBY7-&amp;sig=1ndPkjAzTIaQwBkqJonmHLWlHnY#v=onepage&amp;q=arawak%20language%20(lokono)&amp;f=false|title=Areal Diffusion, Genetic Inheritance and Problems of Subgrouping: A north Arawak Case Study|last=Aikhenvald|first=Alexandra|date=|website=Google Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of living fluent speakers with active knowledge of the language is estimated to be 5% of the ethnic population.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=W.|year=1979|title=An Ethnohistory of Amerindians in Guyana|jstor=481091|journal=Ethnohistory|volume= 26| issue =  2|pages=161–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are small communities of semi-speakers who have varying degrees of comprehension and fluency in Lokono that keep the language alive..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harbert|first=Wayne|last2=Pet|first2=Willem|date=1988-10-01|title=Movement and Adjunct Morphology in Arawak and Other Languages|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/466095|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=54|issue=4|pages=416–435|doi=10.1086/466095|issn=0020-7071}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are around 2,500 remaining speakers (including fluent and semi-fluent speakers).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aikhenvald|first=Alexandrs|date=|year=2013|title=Arawak Languages|url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/28542/|journal=Aronoff, Mark, (ed.) Linguistics: Oxford Bibliographies. Oxford Bibliographies Online|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford Bibliographies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in the use of Lokono as a language of communication is due to its lack of transmission from older speakers to the next generation. The language is not being passed to young children, as they are taught to speak the official languages of their countries. The oldest generation of speakers are around the age of 70 years of age of older.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Classification ==
The Lokono language is part of the larger Arawakan language family spoken by indigenous people in South and Central America along with the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-05-01|title=The diachrony of person-number marking in the Lokono-Wayuunaiki subgroup of the Arawak family: reconstruction, sound change and analogy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0388000116000115|journal=Language Sciences|volume=55|pages=1–15|doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2016.02.001|issn=0388-0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spans four countries of Central America — Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua — and eight of South America — Bolivia, Guyana, French Guiana, Surinam, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil (and also formerly Argentina and Paraguay). With about 40 extant languages, it is the largest language family in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.jcu.edu.au/lcrc/language-archives/south-america-languages/arawak-languages/arawak-languages|title=Arawak languages|website=Research@JCU|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===

''Arawak'' is a tribal name in reference to the main crop food, the cassava root. It is commonly known as ''Manioc.'' The cassava root is a popular staple to millions in South America, Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aikhenvald|first=Alexandra|year=2008|title=PERSON MARKING AND DISCOURSE IN NORTH ARAWAK LANGUAGES|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9582.1995.tb00469.x/abstract|journal=Studia Linguistica|volume=49|pages=152–195|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a woody shrub grown in tropical or subtropical regions. The speakers of the Arawak language also identify themselves as, ''Lokono'', which translates to "the people" . The Arawak language within itself is known as, ''Lokono Dian'', "the people's speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Brief_Introduction_to_Some_Aspects_of.html?id=Aq8PAQAAMAAJ|title=A Brief Introduction to Some Aspects of the Culture and Language of the Guyana Arawak (Lokono) Tribe|date=1980|publisher=Amerindian Languages Project, University of Guyana|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==
Lokono is an Arawakan language most commonly found to be spoken in eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. It was also formerly spoken on Caribbean islands such as Barbados and other neighboring countries. There are approximately 2,500 native speakers today. The following are regions where Arawak has been found spoken by native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/arw|title=Arawak on Ethnologue|last=|first=|date=|website=Ethnologue|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The [[personal pronouns]] are shown below. The forms on the left are free forms, which can stand alone. The forms on the right are bound forms ([[prefixes]]), which must be attached to the front of a [[verb]], a [[noun]], or a [[postposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Pet, Willem J. A.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Gender ===
In the Arawak language there are two distinct genders of masculine and feminine. They are used in cross referencing affixes, in demonstratives, in nominalization and in personal pronouns. Typical pronominal genders for example are feminine and non-feminine. The markers go back to Arawak third person singular cross referencing : feminine ''-(r)u,'' masculine ''-(r)i''&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

=== Number ===
Arawak Languages do distinguish singular and plural, however plural is optional unless the referent is a person. Markers used are ''*-na/-ni'' (animate/human plural) and ''*-pe'' (inanimate/animate non-human plural)&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;

=== Possession ===
Arawak nouns are fragmented into inalienably and alienably possessed. Inalienably crossed nouns include things such as body parts, terms for kinship and common nouns like food selections. Deverbal nominalization belong to that grouping. Both forms of possession  are marked with prefixes (A/Sa) . Inalienably possessed nouns have what is known as an "unpossessed" form (also known as 'absolute') marked with the suffix ''*-tfi or *-hV.'' Alienably possessed nouns take one of the suffixes ''*-ne/ni, *-te, *-re, *i/e, or *-na.'' All suffixes used as nominalizers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybka|first=Konrad|year=2015|title=State-of-the-Art in the Development of the Lokono Language|url=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc/?p=603|journal=Language Documentation &amp; Conservation|volume=|pages=9110–9133.|via=ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negation ===
Arawak languages have a negative prefix ''ma-'' and attributive-relative prefix ''ka-.'' An example of the use is ''ka-witi-w'' (a woman with good eyes) and ''ma-witti-w (a woman with bad eyes aka. blind) .''

== Writing System ==
The Arawak language system has an alphabetical system similar to the Roman Alphabet with some minor changes and new additions to letters. The letters in brackets under each alphabetical letter is the IPA symbol for each letter.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/arw|title=Arawak|last=|first=|date=|website=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a nominated member of [[Rajya Sabha]] for twelve years.

Banarsidas became interested in the plight of [[Indentured Indian labourers|indentured labourers]] ([[Girmitiya]]) of Indian origin in Fiji where he spent several years. He wrote extensively about the predicament of [[Indians in Fiji]]. With the intervention of [[Charles Freer Andrews|Reverend C. F. Andrews]], the system of indentured labour in Fiji was formally ended in 1920.

A book in English titled 'Charles Freer Andrews, a Narrative' written by Banarsidas with [[Marjorie Sykes]] as co-author and foreword written by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was published in 1949.

A '''baseline''' in [[medicine]] is information found at the beginning of a [[clinical trial|study]] or other initial known value which is used for comparison with later data.  The concept of a baseline is essential to the daily practice of medicine in order to establish a relative rather than absolute meaning to data.  The meaning of baseline in medicine is very similar to that of the running [[baseline (baseball)]] being the direct path that a baserunner is taking to the base he is in route to.  If the baserunner is outside the 3 foot margin around his running baseline, then he is considered out.  Whereas if a patient with kidney failure (whose creatinine is usually 3.0 mg/dL) suddenly has a [[creatinine]] of 5.0 mg/dL, then his creatinine is out of his normal.  For that person with kidney failure, absolute normal no longer applies because he will never again be able to obtain an absolutely normal creatinine level (0.5-1.2 mg/dL) with kidneys that no longer function properly.

A '''blackboard''' (also known as a '''chalkboard''') is a reusable [[writing]] surface on which text or drawings are made with sticks of [[calcium sulfate]] or [[calcium carbonate]], known, when used for this purpose, as [[chalk]].  Blackboards were originally made of smooth, thin sheets of black or dark grey [[slate]] stone.

==Design==
[[File:Blackboard Laos.jpg|thumb|Students writing on a blackboard in a village school in [[Laos]], 2007]]
[[File:BlankChalkboard.JPG|thumb|A modern chalkboard, 2014.]]
A blackboard can simply be a board painted with [[matte (surface)|matte]] dark [[paint]] (usually black, occasionally dark green).  Matte black plastic sign material (known as ‘[[closed-cell PVC foamboard]]’) is also used to create custom [[chalkboard art]].
A more modern variation consists of a coiled sheet of plastic drawn across two parallel rollers, which can be scrolled to create additional writing space while saving what has been written. The highest grade blackboards are made of a rougher version porcelain enamelled steel (black, green, blue or sometimes other colours). Porcelain is very hard wearing and blackboards made of porcelain usually last 10–20 years in intensive use.

Manufacturing of slate blackboards began by the 1840s. Green chalkboards, generally made of porcelain enamel on a steel base, first appeared in the 1960s.

&lt;!-- [[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - F 18 - School in Candjambary, Guinea-Bissau - Teacher explaining - 1974.tif|thumb|Man writing on a blackboard in [[Guinea-Bissau]] in the open air, 1974]] --&gt;

Lecture theatres may contain a number of blackboards in a grid arrangement. The lecturer then moves boards into reach for writing and then moves them out of reach, allowing a large amount of material to be shown simultaneously.

The chalk marks can be easily wiped off with a damp cloth, a sponge or a special [[Chalkboard eraser|blackboard eraser]] usually consisting of a block of wood covered by a felt pad. However, chalk marks made on some types of wet blackboard can be difficult to remove. Blackboard manufacturers often advise that a new or newly resurfaced blackboard be completely covered using the side of a stick of chalk and then that chalk brushed off as normal to prepare it for use.

==Chalk sticks==
Sticks of processed ‘chalk’ are produced especially for use with blackboards in white and also in various colours.  White chalk sticks are made mainly from calcium carbonate derived from mineral [[chalk]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or limestone, while colored or pastel chalks are made from [[calcium sulfate]] in its [[dihydrate]] form, CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, derived from [[gypsum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Chalk.html|title=How chalk is made – material, making, used, processing, procedure, product, industry|website=www.madehow.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Corazza, M., Zauli, S., Pagnoni, A. and Virgili, A., 2012. Allergic contact dermatitis caused by metals in blackboard chalk: a case report. Acta dermato-venereologica, 92(4), pp.436–437.&lt;/ref&gt; Chalk sticks containing [[calcium carbonate]] typically contain 40–60% of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[calcite]]).

==Advantages and disadvantages==
As compared to [[whiteboards]], blackboards still have a variety of advantages:

*Chalk requires no special care; whiteboard markers must be capped or else they will dry out.
*Chalk is an [[order of magnitude]] cheaper than whiteboard markers for a comparable amount of writing.
*It is easier to draw lines of different weights and thicknesses with chalk than with whiteboard markers.
*Dashed lines can be drawn very quickly using a technique involving the friction of the chalk (or chalk marker) and blackboard.
*Chalk has a mild smell, whereas whiteboard markers often have a pungent odor.
*Chalk writing often provides better contrast than whiteboard markers.
*Chalk can be easily erased; writing which has been left on a whiteboard for a prolonged period may require a solvent to remove.
*Chalk can be easily removed from most clothing; whiteboard markers often permanently stain fabric, wood (wood frame), etc..
*Chalk is mostly [[biodegradable]], whereas most plastic recyclers will not take whiteboard markers.

On the other hand, chalk produces dust, the amount depending on the quality of chalk used.  Some people find this uncomfortable or may be [[allergic]] to it, and according to the [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology]] (AAAAI), there are links between chalk dust and allergy and asthma problems.&lt;ref name="Reading, Writing, and Wheezing? Not Necessarily"&gt;{{cite web|last=WebMD|title=Reading, Writing, and Wheezing? Not Necessarily|url=http://www.webmd.com/asthma/news/20000919/reading-writing-wheezing-not-necessarily|work=Asthma Health Center|publisher=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dust also precludes the use of chalk in areas shared with dust-sensitive equipment such as [[computers]]. The writing on blackboards is difficult to read in the dark. Chalk sticks shrink through use, and are notorious for breaking in half unless inserted in a [[writing utensil]] designed for chalk.

The [[Chalkboard scraping|scratching of fingernails on a blackboard]], as well as other pointed, especially metal objects against blackboards, produces a sound that is well known for being extremely irritating to most people. According to a study run by Michael Oehler, a professor at the University of Media and Communication in Cologne, Germany, humans are "predisposed to detest" the sound of nails on a blackboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/09/142184389/why-nails-on-a-chalkboard-drives-us-crazy | title=Why Nails On A Chalkboard Drives Us Crazy | author=Robert Siegel | date=9 November 2011 | publisher=NPR | access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the study were presented at the [[Acoustical Society of America]] conference and support earlier findings from a 1986 study by Vanderbilt psychologist [[Randolph Blake]] and two colleagues found that the sound of nails on a chalkboard annoyed people even when the high-pitch frequencies were removed. The study earned Blake a 2006 [[Ig Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1996489_1996488_1996483,00.html | title=Top 10 Most Annoying Sounds: Nails on a Chalkboard | author=Frances Romero |date=14 June 2010 | publisher=TIME Magazine |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and history==
The [[writing slate]] was in use in Indian schools in the 11th century as mentioned in [[Alberuni]]’s ''Indica'' (''Tarikh Al-Hind''), written in the early 11th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They use black tablets for the children in the schools, and write upon them along the long side, not the broadside, writing with a white material from the left to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/stream/alberunisindiaac01biru#page/182/mode/2up| title=Full text of “Alberuni’s India. An account of the religion, philosophy, literature, geography, chronology, astronomy, customs, laws and astrology of India about A.D. 1030”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first classroom uses of large blackboards are difficult to date, but they were used for music education and composition in Europe as far back as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessie Ann Owens|Owens, Jessie Ann]]. Composers at Work: The Craft of Musical Composition, 1450-1600. Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ‘blackboard’ is attested in English from the mid-eighteenth century; the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' provides a citation from 1739, to write “with Chalk on a black-Board”.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Entry for [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/19691 blackboard, ''n''], in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (Third ed., 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
The first attested use of chalk on blackboard in the United States dates to September 21, 1801, in a lecture course in mathematics given by [[George Baron]].&lt;ref name="Ambrose1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen E. Ambrose|title=Duty, Honour, Country: A History of West Point|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC5wr5A_hbkC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=14 February 2013|date=1 December 1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6293-9|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Pillans]] has been credited with the invention of coloured chalk (1814): he had a recipe with ground chalk, dyes and porridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jo Swinnerton|title=The History of Britain Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hd0wNKXAupwC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=14 February 2013|date=30 September 2005|publisher=Anova Books|isbn=978-1-86105-914-7|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of blackboard did change methods of education and testing, as found in the [[Conic Sections Rebellion#1830 incident|Conic Sections Rebellion]] of 1830 in Yale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200209/comm-smithsonian.pdf Teaching Math in America: An Exhibit at the Smithsonian], p. 1082&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Absolute contraindications''' are contraindications for which there are no reasonable circumstances for undertaking a course of action.  For example, children and teenagers with viral infections should not be given [[aspirin]] because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essence of Analgesia and Analgesics |author1=Raymond S.

Similarly, a person with [[hemochromatosis]] should not be administered iron preparations.

'''Relative contraindications''' are contraindications for circumstances in which the patient is at higher risk of complications from treatment, but these risks may be outweighed by other considerations or mitigated by other measures. For example, a pregnant woman should normally avoid getting [[X-ray]]s, but the risk may be outweighed by the benefit of diagnosing (and then treating) a serious condition such as [[tuberculosis]].  Relative contraindications may also be referred to as ''cautions'', such as in the [[British National Formulary]].

'''Cross merchandising''' is the [[retail]] practice of [[marketing]] or displaying products from different categories together, in order to generate additional [[revenue]] for the store, sometimes also known as add-on sales, incremental purchase or secondary product placement. Its main objective is to link different products that complement each other or can logically be used in association.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This strategy also aims to improve overall [[customer experience]] by allowing them to pick up related goods at the same place instead of having to spend time searching for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cross Merchandising? (with pictures)|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-cross-merchandising.htm|website = wiseGEEK|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
Cross merchandising generally exists in several forms:

=== Displays ===
Displays involve exhibiting a series of related products which together offers a complete package or solution to the customer's needs. This technique explicitly demonstrates the way multiple different products displayed complement and interact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Art of Cross-Merchandising {{!}} Albert's Organics|url = http://albertsorganics.com/resources/merchandising-tips/art-cross-merchandising|website = albertsorganics.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples include a clothing store featuring outfits and accessories ensemble on a mannequin, or a department store presenting a full set of furniture and electronics in a showcase window.

=== Secondary placements ===
Secondary placements or [[merchandising]] are carried out by showing products of different categories to the same shelf, pegs or aisle. This enables customers to link the related products at the time of purchase, saving their time of travelling down another aisle or luring them into buying additional items that they would not have done otherwise.

This strategy is most typically realised in supermarkets where Italian bread can be found directly in front of the butter and margarine aisle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = merchandising {{!}} myRetailPOV|url = http://myretailpov.com/tag/merchandising/|website = myretailpov.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Link suggestions ===
Link suggestions or redirections describe the attempt of e-commerce platform to encourage additional purchases by displaying a link to complementary goods on the page of a specific product. The advantages of this online product placement approach are the absence of physical constraints and the ability to tailor product suggestions according to individual consumption history.

The use of the section titled "Customers who bought this item also bought..." on the online shopping website [[Amazon.com]] is an illustration of link suggestions and how they can constantly adjust with transaction patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amazon.co.uk Associates Central|url = https://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/tips/t1/a5%253Fie%253DUTF8%2526pf_rd_i%253Dassoc_tips_t1%2526pf_rd_m%253DA3P5ROKL5A1OLE%2526pf_rd_p%253D%2526pf_rd_r%253D%2526pf_rd_s%253Dassoc-center-3%2526pf_rd_t%253D501|website = affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
An effective cross merchandising programme creates a linkage between the products involves to appeal to customers, and the source of that correlation differs depending on the products themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perfect pairings|url = http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/2012/08/perfect-pairings/|website = Macfadden Grocery Headquarters, LLC|accessdate = 2015-11-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150326210018/http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/2012/08/perfect-pairings/|archivedate = 2015-03-26|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The products being displayed often change over time. Stores regularly adjust merchandise according to season, sales target, consumption pattern and many other factors to maximize impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://beefretail.org/CMDocs/BeefRetail/bff/BFFCrossMerchandising.pdf|title = Beef Fast Facts|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common type of product used in cross merchandising is [[complementary good]]s, which are products that are consumed in conjunction with one another. Electronics and batteries as well as printers and ink cartridges are examples of products that exhibit complementary properties for customers to connect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Distribution channel choice in a market with complementary goods|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167811687900012|journal = International Journal of Research in Marketing|pages = 85–97|volume = 4|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0167-8116(87)90001-2|first = Anne T.|last = Coughlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pairing products that offsets the unwanted effects of another is also a conventional strategy often found in cross merchandising. Examples include placing chewing gums next to cigarettes and putting toothpaste beside chocolates and sweets.

== Applications ==
The technique of cross merchandising is not exclusively introduced by supermarkets and department stores. Examples can be found in a wide range of markets, as brands explore new markets and boost sales by cross merchandising their products with each other's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UCL Single Sign-on|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/198908686?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:primo&amp;accountid=14511|website = search.proquest.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markets that frequently adopt cross merchandising include: 
* Food and beverage
* [[Household goods]] – electronic devices and appliances, and furniture
* Fashion and beauty – clothing, footwear, cosmetics, and personal products
* Supplies – stationery, paper and plastics products
* [[Entertainment]] – television, music, games, and live performances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sign In|url = http://jss.sagepub.com/content/18/1/27.full.pdf+html|website = jss.sagepub.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domingos Caldas Barbosa''' (1739? — November 9, 1800) was a [[Colonial Brazil]]ian [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]] poet and musician, famous for creating the ''[[modinha]]''. He wrote under the pen name '''Lereno'''.

Barbosa is the patron of the 3rd chair of the Academia Brasileira de Música (Brazilian Academy of Music).

==Life==

[[File:Domingos Caldas Barbosa.jpg|thumb|left|Domingos Caldas Barbosa.]]

Barbosa's date of birth is unknown. It is most accepted to be in 1739, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], to a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] man and a liberated [[Angola]]n slave woman. Trained at the [[Jesuit]] college in Rio de Janeiro, he developed a power of literary improvisation which he indulged at the expense of the Portuguese whites and thereby stirred them up against him. His enemies had him forcibly enrolled in a body of troops setting forth for the [[Colonia del Sacramento]],&lt;ref name="Beattie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Yv38N0-CqMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPP1,M1 Beattie, Peter M. (2001):  The Tribute of Blood: Army, Honor, Race, and Nation in Brazil, 1864-1945]. Duke University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|9780822327431}}. pp. 1-7. (visited May 7, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained until 1762. Returning to Rio Janeiro he soon embarked for Portugal, and there obtained the patronage of two nobles of the [[Vasconcellos]] family, the Conde de Pombeiro and the Marquez de Castello Melhor. Taking minor orders he received a religious benefice, being attached as chaplain to the Casa da Supplicaçáo.

Although he was a mulatto, he obtained entrance into high society in the Portuguese capital: he could improvise ''[[cantiga]]s'' and play his own accompaniment on the [[viol]]. Hence the condescending nickname ''cantor de viola'' which was given to him. Well aware that his social status was uncertain, he retained his self-possession even in the face of the insulting attitude of the poet [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage|Bocage]] and others.

With most of the Portuguese poets of the time he had good relations, consorting with them in one or another literary academy. His ''cantigas'' acquired great popularity. He was a minor poet with facility, able to express himself simply, and to avoid bombast and sensuality. His poetical definition of the characteristically Portuguese quality of ''saudades'' remains famous.

Barbosa's poems were published posthumously, in [[1825 in literature|1825]], under the name ''Viola de Lereno'' (''Lereno's [[Viol]]'').

'''Eggon''' (also '''Egon''', '''Ero''', '''Mo Egon''', '''Hill Mada''' or '''Mada Eggon''') is a [[Plateau language]] spoken in central [[Nigeria]]. It is a major language in [[Nasarawa State]].

==Classification==
The exact classification of the Eggon language has been in dispute and it can be said that this issue remains unresolved.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Eggon was first classified by Greenberg (1963) as a [[Plateau languages|Plateau language]] in his group 5, together with [[Nungu language|Nungu]] and [[Yeskwa language|Yeskwa]]. In the revision prepared by Carl Hoffman published in Hansford et al. (1976) a Benue group was set up that combined Greenberg's Plateau 5 and 7 with Jukunoid. The new subgrouping classified Eggon together with Nungu, [[Ake language|Ake]] and [[Bu language|Jidda-Abu]]. This concept of a Benue grouping came from the lexicostatistical studies of Shimizu (1975) who argued against the unity of Greenberg's Plateau and proposed the Benue group. However, in 1983, Gerhardt published a convincing rebuttal of Shimizu's arguments. The latest version of classification of Plateau languages in Gerhardt (1989) adds Yashi to the Eggon subgroup but removes the links with 'Benue' i.e. Tarok and the [[Jukunoid languages]]. Blench (2008) classifies Eggon and Ake as the Eggonic group of the Southern branch of Plateau.

== Distribution ==
The main towns of the [[Eggon people]] are [[Nassarawa-Eggon]], Kagbu, Washo and Wana. They stretch as far south as [[Lafia]] and west of [[Akwanga]] as far as the railway line. They are bordered on the north by the [[Mada language|Mada]] and to the south by the [[Migili language|Migili]] and the [[Idoma people|Idoma]].

In much of the [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial]] literature, the Eggon were known as the "Hill Mada" in contrast to the "Plains Mada", the people known as [[Mada people|Mada]] today. The Eggon lived in the Mada hills south of Akwanga in the pre-colonial period, but there is no connection between the groups that would justify these terms, and they have now been discarded.

The exact number of speakers is unknown, but it is unlikely to be less than the estimate of 200,000 given by Sibomana (1985). Ames (1934) gave a figure of 41,276 for the 1920s, but this is likely to have been substantially underestimated. Welmers (1971) estimated 52,000 although this may have been only a projection from Ames.

Very little has been written about Eggon society and Temple (1922) and Ames (1934) are the only sources that contain any descriptions of Eggon social organisation.{{Relevance inline|reason=For Eggon people article}}

===Dialects===
Eggon is conventionally divided into twenty-five mutually comprehensible dialects, some of which are; Eggon Wangibi, Ikka, Wana, Washo, Wakama, Ogne, Angbashu, Alushi, Alogani, Eva, Nabe, Lizzi, Ezzen, Arikpa, etc. The only author to discuss dialects is Sibomana (1985) whose discussion focuses on Kagbu, which he states is the main dialect. He also cites data from the Nassarawa-Eggon dialect. The Benue–Congo Comparative Wordlist (1969, 1972) also gives data from two dialects.

A twenty-sixth variety is Madan-tara, spoken by a group of Eggon east of Nassarawa-Eggon. It is said to be impossible to understand without special learning and is sufficiently different from other lects to be effectively a new language. Its precise relationship to the other varieties of Eggon is unknown.

==Written language==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2017}}

Eggon has no literary standard language. The earliest written material in Eggon appears to be scripture portions from 1937, probably prepared by I.D. Hepburn. The dialect chosen for bible translation is based on the Wana dialect, although it is supplemented by forms from other dialects and so is a sort of synthetic Eggon not based on the speech of a particular group. A hymnbook and 2 readers were prepared, and the translation of the New Testament was completed in 1974. The orthography of the New Testament is somewhat different from the earlier publications. There are however, literature works written in eggon language which provides confidence for one to surely say there is improvement in the written language of eggon. There are also summer lessons to teach and train eggon sons and daughters their language and culture.

Eggon is apparently in use in churches only in remoter regions and it has been displaced by [[Hausa language|Hausa]] in all establishments along the main road. However, there is apparently a move to revive the use of Eggon. Some evidence of this is the recent publication of new material in Eggon, a book of history and customs and a women's magazine which is intended to make a regular appearance.

'''Eliezer Dob Liebermann''' (12 April 1820 - 15 April 1895) was a [[Russia]]n [[Hebrew]]-language writer of [[Jewish]] origin.  

== Life ==
He was born in [[Pilvischok]] in the region of [[Suwałki]]. His father was a [[shohet]], a kosher butcher, and gave him a normal Jewish education. At the age of twelve he was sent to his uncle R. [[Elijah Schick]] ("Reb Elinke Lider"), then the rabbi of [[Amstibove]], who instructed him in [[Talmud]] and rabbinical literature. In 1838 he went to [[Vilna]] and joined the [[Maskilim]]. In about 1844 he settled as a teacher in [[Białystok]]. In 1867 he left to Suwałki, remained there about twenty years, and then returned to Białystok.

== Works ==
Liebermann was the author of ''Megillat Sefer'', a collection of short stories, essays, fables, and letters, and of ''Zedek u-Mishpat'', a Hebrew adaptation of [[S. D. Luzzatto]]'s "Lezioni di Teologia Morale Israelitica". He wrote also "Ge Hizzayon", and a number of articles which he published in various Hebrew periodicals.

'''Fictional languages''' are [[constructed language]]s created as part of a fictional setting, for example in books, movies, television shows, and video games. Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.{{sfn|Conley|Cain|2006|pages="Foreword", p.

Some of these languages, e.g., in worlds of [[fantasy fiction]], [[alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]]s, Earth's future, or [[alternate history]], are presented as distorted versions or [[dialect]]s of modern English or other natural language, while others are independently designed [[conlang]]s.

While most fictional languages are just [[gibberish]], a few are fully functioning and comprehensive languages that can be learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.britannica.com/list/6-fictional-languages-you-can-really-learn |title=6 Fictional Languages You Can Really Learn |first1=Alison |last1=Eldridge |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Fictional languages are separated from artistic languages by both purpose and relative completion: a fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] (two Elvish languages), ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Klingon language]] and [[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']]'s [[Na'vi language]] which exist as functioning, usable languages. Here "fictional" can be a [[misnomer]].

By analogy with the word "conlang," the term ''[[conworld]]'' is used to describe these fictional worlds, inhabited by fictional [[constructed culture]]s. The conworld influences vocabulary (what words the language will have for flora and fauna, articles of clothing, objects of technology, religious concepts, names of places and tribes, etc.), as well as influencing other factors such as pronouns, or how their cultures view the break-off points between colors or the gender and age of family members.

==Professional fictional languages==
'''Professional fictional languages''' are those languages created for use in books, movies, television shows, video games, comics, toys, and musical albums (prominent examples of works featuring fictional languages include the Middle-Earth and ''Star Trek'' universes and the game ''[[Myst]]'').

===Alien languages===

{{main|Alien language}}
A notable subgenre of fictional languages are [[alien language]]s, the ones that are used or might be used by putative [[extraterrestrial life]] forms. Alien languages are subject of both [[science fiction]] and scientific research.

Perhaps the most fully developed fictional alien language is the Klingon language of the ''Star Trek'' universe - a fully developed [[constructed language]].

The problem of alien language has confronted generations of [[science fiction]] writers; some have created fictional languages for their characters to use, while others have circumvented the problem through translation devices or other fantastic technology.

Although this field remains largely confined to science fiction, the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life makes the question of alien language a credible topic for [[science|scientific]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] speculation.

While in many cases an alien language is but an element of a fictional reality, in a number of science fiction works the core of the plot involves linguistic and psychological problems of communication between various alien species.

==Internet-based fictional languages==
'''Internet-based fictional languages''' are hosted along with their "conworlds" on the internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites; [[Verdurian]], the language of [[Mark Rosenfelder]]'s Verduria on the planet of Almea, is a flagship Internet-based fictional language. Many other fictional languages and their associated conworlds are created privately by their inventor, known only to the inventor and perhaps a few friends. In this context the term "professional" (used for the first category) as opposed to "amateur" (used for the second and third) refers only to the professionalism of the used medium, and not to the professionalism of the language itself or its creator. In fact, most professional languages are the work of non-linguists, while many amateur languages were in fact created by linguists, and in general the latter are better developed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15226">'''Género chico''' (literally, "little genre") is a [[Spain|Spanish]] genre of short, light plays with music. It is a major branch of ''[[zarzuela]]'', Spain's form of popular music theatre with dialogue, and differs from ''zarzuela grande'' and most other [[opera]]tic forms both in its brevity and by being aimed at audiences of a wide social spectrum.

== Origin and development ==
===Historical context===
''Zarzuela'' was developed during the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] (1605&amp;ndash;1665, reigned from 1621), who during the 1640s began to commission musico-theatrical entertainments on mythological themes mixed with popular peasant song and dance, from the writer [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] working with composers such as [[Juan de Hidalgo]]. These were performed at the Royal hunting lodge, the ''[[Palacio de la Zarzuela]]''. During the next two hundred years, ''zarzuela'', as these mixed entertainments swiftly became known, became the native-language alternative to the [[Italy|Italian]] operatic form nurtured by successive monarchs.

In the 19th century, the country's tense political circumstances affected ''zarzuela''. [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] fell from power during the [[Liberalism|liberal]] revolution of 1868, and the country found itself submerged in a crisis at all levels: economic, political, and ideological (with various strands of [[socialism]] coming to prominence). Instability increased with the 1870 [[assassination]] of [[Juan Prim]], President of the [[Regent|regency]] council and [[Marshal]] of Spain. For economic and other reasons, there was a sharp drop in theatre box-office sales, as most people could not afford the average fourteen ''[[Spanish real|reales]]'' for non-necessities. Such high prices, plus the national uncertainty, brought most [[Madrid]] theatres into crisis, and many - including the ''Teatro de la Zarzuela'' itself - came close to ruin.

===The beginning===
Against this trend, [[Juan José Luján]], [[Antonio Riquelme]] and [[José Vallés]], three [[actor]]s, had the idea of splitting the afternoon at the theatre into four parts of one hour each, creating the so-called ''sesiones por horas'', or "performances by the hour", which cost barely a ''real'', and were given in down-market theatres.  This kept the seats filled, since people came more often, due to low prices.  Managers accepted the idea, needing customers.

They wanted to repeat the success of ''teatro cómico'', an earlier phenomenon that copied [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s comic model, and was brought by the theatre manager Arderíus to the [[Madrid]] Variety Theatre (with his own ''El Joven Telémaco'' &amp;mdash; "Young Telemachus" &amp;mdash; as the main draw). The comedic model for these featured zany, unpredictable plots based on [[mythology|myth]]s, tending towards caricature and mockery of various topics such as royalty, the [[Army]], and [[politics]].  They do so with pleasant, catchy music with a certain popular, erotic tone. Comic operas of this sort were nevertheless quickly eclipsed by the expansion of the ''género chico'' and became less popular after the mid-1870s.

Because of the need for short operetta-like works that could fit into one hour, the first performances were of old plays that were already popular, such as ''El Maestro de baile'' ("The Dancing Master", by [[Luis Misón]], and predating the ''género chico'' by many years), or plays like ''Una vieja'' ("An Old Woman", [[Joaquín Romualdo Gaztambide]]) and ''El grumete'' ("The Cabin Boy", [[Juan Pascual Antonio Arrieta]]). These plays had originally been considered secondary and were programmed as such, beside larger, more important ''zarzuelas'', but with a change of taste and the tendency towards nationalism and German opera, the Italian taste copied by the ''zarzuelas'' would fall out of fashion, whilst the character of these little plays shone for itself. With time, new short plays were written for this short format and jolly style, notably influenced by the comic genre (with suggestive titles such as ''La hoja de parra'' ("The Fig Leaf") or ''Dice el sexto mandamiento'' ("According to the Sixth Commandment").

It is easy to see that the goal of ''género chico'' is purely to entertain the audience.  Unlike the serious, dramatic themes and complicated plots in ''zarzuela mayor'', this genre presented simplified farces about everyday topics such as daily life in Madrid. This is why it was so successful with the public: apart from the low price, people could easily follow the plot and identify with the characters.

===Development===
The decade of the 1870s saw the genre consolidate itself, with numerous authors publishing, for example [[Miguel Nieto]] and his ''El Gorro Frigio'' ("The [[Phrygian Cap]]"), and [[Fernández Caballero]]'s ''Château Margaux''.  The genre was now centred on a model similar to that of contemporary realist literature, mainly with the musical form of lyrical one-act farces.

The definitive accolade that the ''género chico'' would receive was with Chueca and Valverde's ''La Gran Vía'', in the summer of 1886.  The play, named after a major street that was then under construction through the heart of Madrid, was so successful that it went from the summer theatres to the Apolo, and was repeated several times.  It incorporated a series of lively, unrelated one-act farces on current affairs.  [[Federico Chueca]] was one of the most prolific and important ''chico'' composer-librettists, often collaborating with [[Joaquín Valverde Durán]].  His work includes ''El año pasado por agua'' ("Last Year Under Water"), ''Agua, azucarillos y aguardiente'' ("Water, Sweets, and Spirits"), perhaps the most popular nowadays, ''La alegría de la huerta'' ("The happiness of the orchard"), ''El arca de Noé'' ("Noah's Ark"), ''Los descamisados'' ("The Shirtless Ones") and more.

Another common model for these works was comparison of two places: ''De Madrid a París'' (Chueca y Velarde, "From Madrid to Paris") or ''De Getafe al paraíso'' ("From Getafe to Paradise", a two-act ''zarzuela'' by Barbieri, Getafe is a town close to Madrid), ''Cádiz'' (Valverde).  Other important playwrights were Giménez, [[Joaquín Valverde Sanjuán|Joaquín "Quinito" Valverde Sanjuán]] (Joaquín Valverde Durán's son), Tomás Lopez Torregrosa (''San Antón'' and ''El santo de la Isidra'' ["Isidra's Saint", Isidra being one of the characters]) Fernández Caballero (''El dúo de la africana'' [The Duet from ''L'Africaine'', a reference to the opera by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]], ''El cabo primero'' ["The Headman", that is, the person in command], ''La viejecita'' ["The Little Old Lady"], and ''Gigantes y cabezudos'' ["Giants and ''cabezudos''"]; named after popular Spanish parade disguises), Jerónimo Jiménez (''El baile de Luis Alonso'' ["The Dance of Luis Alonso"] and its sequel ''La boda de Luis Alonso'' ["The Marriage of Luis Alonso"]). 

One very important ''auteur'' was [[Ruperto Chapí]], who spent his life oscillating between attempts to create a proper Spanish opera, and his modest ''género chico'' plays, which included ''Música Clásica'' ("Classical Music"), ''La revoltosa'' ("The Rebel Girl"), ''¡Las doce y media y sereno!'' ("Half Past Midnight and all is quiet"), y ''El tambor de granaderos'' ("The Grenadiers' Drum"). 

Finally, one of the best-known examples of ''género chico'' was ''[[La verbena de la Paloma]]'' ("The Fair of the Dove", set at a ''verbena'' on the night of the [[Virgin of the Paloma]], August 14) [http://www.musicweb.uk.net/classrev/2003/Oct03/breton.htm];, by composer [[Tomás Bretón]].  This popular piece came about following several years of experiments by its creator.

The ''género chico'' was to decline in importance with the turn of the 19th century.

== Performance venues ==
The idea of performances by the hour began in cheap theatres, the ''Teatro del Recreo'' being the first.  Whilst the critics were harsh with the genre, it was a great success with the public and was adopted by a few more theatres, to the point where it took over the Variedades theater, which the decline of comic opera had left free, and which was already a venue of some note. But the most important venue associated with the ''género chico'' is the [[Teatro Apolo (Madrid)|Teatro Apolo]], opened in 1873, which, following the crisis in ''zarzuela grande'', began to put on ''género chico'', to overwhelming popular success.

The Apolo was considered the real bastion of the genre, and very famous because of the popularity of its fourth session, "''la cuarta de Apolo''", which was a night-time performance and was always full of dodgy characters, rogues and tricksters no different from the villains represented on stage.
Outside of the theatres, the ''género chico'' was also performed in small cafés, and during the summer cheap stages were set up for plays.  Indeed, the arguably most important play in the genre, ''La Gran Vía'', was performed in this way.

== Lyrical farce as form of ''género chico'' ==
The main model for ''género chico'' is the ''sainete lírico'' or one-act lyrical farce, thanks to the successful ''La canción de la Lola'' ("Lola's Song") by Chueca and Valverde, in 1880.  Although other genres are also utilised, the most important plays follow this model.  The ''sainete'', established in its definitive form by [[Ramón de la Cruz]], is the direct heir of the comic interludes or brief farces that were previously so popular. These are essentially short, independent pieces, with music and often dance.  The ''género chico'' evolved from this form towards a relatively faithful portrait of everyday Madrid life, in keeping with the abovementioned Realism.  However, unlike Realism, which lingers on the darker and murkier aspects of reality, such as poor, marginal sections of society and the violence running through them, the ''género chico'', whilst dealing with low-class neighbourhoods and uneducated people, concentrated on the jollier, picturesque aspects of Madrid, such as the dialect of the characters, and their most jovial facets.

Moreover, as a unique characteristic of the genre, the constant presence of open-air parties, often at night, which appear at the beginning of the plays in order to situate them and at the end as ''dénouement''.

===Libretto===
The plot is very simple, and sometimes barely holds up the play, which then relies on the scenes it creates.  In the majority of cases, it consists of a simple love story with the same basic structure: a couple is in love but some outside difficulty prevents them from consummating their love (always, by marrying each other in a happy ending); this difficulty is overcome and the story ends with a public ''dénouement'', a happy ending and an implicit or explicit moral (as well as asking the audience's favour at the very end).  Beside this structure, stereotyped characters from the Madrid scene are brought in (Madrid is typically the locale for these plays): the cheeky chappy, the colourful [[anarchist]] who avoids making provocative comments, the idler, the scrounger, the flirt, the sententious old geezer.  There usually aren't any educated characters; instead, popular folk wisdom is represented.

The ''género chico'' was always fiercely current: the actors make references (often in the songs, into which extra verses are added) to the outside world, with this "news" aspect of the play being even more important than the actual plot.  There are mentions of politicians, external events and so forth, all as a way of connecting with an audience of humble culture.  To this effect, the unity of what is going on in the play is broken, and the spectator is drawn in with the actors, without actually getting on stage.

The text is usually in prose, although some of the first plays alternate between parts in prose and in verse.  Moreover, the language used is deliberately vulgar, with fashionable expressions and badly-pronounced foreign words and references.  Jokes and other semantic aspects were not originally part of the ''sainete'', but were subsequently incorporated by ''quinteros''.  The music was then justified by the text: people dancing in the street and suchlike.  There is also theatre within theatre, as well as orchestra in the text.  All these features aim fundamentally to create contact with the audience.

===Music===
There is disagreement regarding the relevance of the music itself.  While some writers consider it always subordinate to the text in terms of importance, others such as Ramón Barce have theorised that the music comes first in the composition of the work; incoherent texts, called ''monstruos'' ("monsters"), merely gave the librettist a rhythm to which he must fit his words; these words were then often inexpertly fiddled with by the composer). In any case, the music does not usually correspond closely to the action, but rather is something in the background, sometimes coming in unexpectedly.

The musical part varies greatly in length, the plays with most music being ''Agua, azucarillos y aguardiente'' and ''La verbena de la paloma''.  Normally, the plays are preceded by a musical prelude, and occasionally have little intervals or music for dancing, and finish with a short finale in which the music from some previous scene is repeated.  There are usually passages read over background music, in ''[[Singspiel]]'' style.

The music is familiar to the ear, popular and traditional, with popular or fashionable melodies of the time being taken and their lyrics changed.  The aim is to have the ditty stick in the audience's mind after they leave the theatre.  Furthermore, pronounced, popular rhythms are sought in the dance halls, generally imported but "nationalised", such as the ''chotis'' (from the German ''Schottisch'', its ultimate origin being in [[Scotland]]), and many others, such as [[bolero]]s, [[Fandango (dance)|fandango]]s, or [[Habanera (music)|habanera]]s from Latin America, [[Jota (music)|jota]]s, [[seguidilla]]s, [[soleá]]s, [[pasacalle]]s, and [[waltz]]es, [[polka]]s, or [[mazurca]]s from [[Poland]].

 {{main|Harold Adams Innis}}
'''[[Harold Innis|Harold Adams Innis]]''' (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a professor of [[political economy]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and the author of seminal works on Canadian economic history and on media and [[communication theory]]. He helped develop the [[staples thesis]], which holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) "The Staple Approach." In ''Approaches to Canadian Economic History.'' Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis's communications writings explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert E. (2000) "The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis." In ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 51–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; But he warned that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] is now imperiled by powerful, advertising-driven media obsessed by "present-mindedness" and the "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications theories==
===Time and space===

{{quote|Improvements in communication...make for increased difficulties of understanding.|Harold Innis|''The Bias of Communication''&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 28. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of Harold Innis's primary contributions to the field of communications was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into time-biased and space-biased  types. Time-biased media include [[clay tablet|clay]] or [[stele|stone tablet]]s, [[manuscript|hand-copied manuscripts ]] on [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] and oral sources such as [[Homer|Homer's]] epic poems. These are intended to carry stories and messages that last for many generations, but tend to reach limited audiences. Space-biased media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers that convey information to many people over long distances, but have short exposure times. While time-biased media favour stability, community, tradition and religion, space-biased media facilitate rapid change, materialism, secularism and empire. Innis elaborated on his distinctions between time-biased and space-biased media in ''[[Empire and Communications]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concepts of time and space reflect the significance of media to civilization. Media that emphasize time are those durable in character such as parchment, clay and stone. The heavy materials are suited to the development of architecture and sculpture. Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character such as papyrus and paper. The latter are suited to wide areas in administration and trade. The conquest of Egypt by Rome gave access to supplies of papyrus, which became the basis of a large administrative empire. Materials that emphasize time favour decentralization and hierarchical types of institutions, while those that emphasize space favour centralization and systems of government less hierarchical in character.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1950) ''Empire and Communications''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies that depend solely on time-biased media are oral and tribal. Although leadership tends to be hierarchical, time-bound societies may also operate by consensus. Since, in their purest form, time-bound cultures do not rely on written records, they must preserve their traditions in story, song and myth handed down unchanged from one generation to the next. For them memory is of crucial importance; they revere the wisdom of elders and favour concrete over abstract forms of thought. On the other hand, societies that depend on space-biased media such as printed newspapers and books tend to favour abstract thought and control over space. They have little regard for tradition and when compared with oral societies, their ways of thinking are apt to be  more rational, linear and impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;See Babe, pp.72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The encounter of European traders from the imperial centres of France and Britain with the aboriginal tribes of North America that Innis chronicled in ''The Fur Trade in Canada'' is a poignant example of what can happen when two different civilizations meet --- one traditional and oriented to preserving its tribal culture in time and the other bent on spreading its influence over long distances. European guns used in war and conquest, for example, enabled the indigenous peoples to hunt more efficiently, but led to the rapid destruction of their food supply and of the beaver they depended on to obtain European goods. Conflicts over hunting territories led to warfare, made more deadly by European bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander, John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.150–153. "The apocalypse of culture disorientation that Innis would come to believe followed the introduction of writing and printing, and still later followed the application of power to print reproduction, has its prototype in the collapse of the traditional Indian civilization after the introduction of iron trade goods."&lt;/ref&gt; And all this, Innis argued, disturbed the balance that "...had grown up previous to the coming of the European."&lt;ref&gt; Innis (Fur Trade) pp.388–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance, bias and empire===

Harold Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain the empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. Innis wrote that the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire: "The sword and pen worked together. Power was increased by concentration in a few hands, specialization of function was enforced, and scribes with leisure to keep and study records contributed to the advancement of knowledge and thought. The written record, signed, sealed and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire and Communications) pp.10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis warned however, that such generalizations tended to obscure the differences between empires. So, he embarked on specific studies of the civilizations of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]; as well as of the effects of the oral tradition on [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] and the written tradition on the [[Roman Empire]]. His reflections appear in separate chapters in his book ''Empire and Communications'' along with additional chapters on the combined effects of parchment and paper in the [[Middle Ages]], and paper and the printing press in the development of modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.52: Heyer writes that ''Empire and Communications'' received few reviews and they ranged from "lukewarm to negative". Yet, many now see it as a Canadian classic because it "has sufficient detail in its analysis and originality to be regarded as a landmark book."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Plato Symposium papyrus.jpg|thumb|left|A papyrus copy of Plato's [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']]. Using the flexible Greek alphabet, Plato preserved the power of spoken dialogue in written prose. Innis thought this balancing of time and space-oriented media contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece.]]

Biographer John Watson warns against the tendency to apply Innis's concept of media 'bias' in a mechanical or deterministic way. He writes that Innis "emphasizes, in dealing with ''concrete historical cases'', the necessity of a balance of ''various media'' whose predispositions [or biases] complement each other to make for a successful imperial project." Watson points out that for Innis, balance was crucial in sustaining an empire. Innis examined each empire to discover how time-binding and space-binding media contributed to the necessary balance between power and knowledge and among ruling groups – religious, political and military.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.312–319.&lt;/ref&gt; As Innis himself wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concentration on a medium of communication implies a bias in the cultural development of the civilization concerned either towards an emphasis on space and political organization or towards an emphasis on time and religious organization. Introduction of a second medium tends to check the bias of the first and to create conditions suited to the growth of empire. The [[Byzantine empire]] emerged from a fusion of a bias incidental to [[papyrus]] in relation to political organization and of [[parchment]] in relation to ecclesiastical organization.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (''Empire and Communications''). p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of [[Plato]]. Plato conveyed his ideas by recording the conversations of [[Socrates]]. His philosophy thus preserved "the power of the spoken word on the written page." Plato's method of using poetic dialogues cast in prose enabled him to arrive at new philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.99–100. See also, Heyer, pp.49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monopolies of knowledge===

In his 1947 presidential address to the [[Royal Society of Canada]], Innis remarked: "I have attempted to suggest that Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by communication and that marked changes in communications have had important implications." He went on to mention the evolution of communications media from the [[cuneiform]] script inscribed on clay tablets in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] to the advent of radio in the 20th century. "In each period I have attempted to trace the implications of the media of communication for the character of knowledge and to suggest that a monopoly or oligopoly of knowledge is built up to the point that equilibrium is disturbed."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued, for example, that a "complex system of writing" such as cuneiform script resulted in the growth of a "special class" of scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The long training required to master such writing ensured that relatively few people would belong to this privileged and aristocratic class. As Paul Heyer explains:
[[Image:SphinxGiza.jpg|thumb|right|The Sphinx and the Great Pyramid at Giza. Innis wrote that the monarchs who built the pyramids had to relinquish their absolute power when papyrus replaced stone as the dominant medium of communication.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning, which for Innis means Mesopotamia, there was clay, the reed stylus used to write on it, and the wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Thus did civilization arise, along with an elite group of scribe priests who eventually codified laws. Egypt followed suit, using papyrus, the brush, and hieroglyphic writing.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In ''[[Empire and Communications]]'', Innis wrote that the ebb and flow of Egypt's ancient empire partly reflected weaknesses or limitations imposed by "the inflexibility of religious institutions supported by a monopoly over a complex system of writing":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Writing was a difficult and specialized art requiring long apprenticeship, and reading implied a long period of instruction. The god of writing was closely related to the leading deities and reflected the power of the scribe over religion. The scribe had the full qualifications of a special profession and was included in the upper classes of kings, priests, nobles and generals, in contrast with peasants, fishermen, artisans and labourers. Complexity favoured increasing control under a monopoly of priests and the confinement of knowledge to special classes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that this priestly or scribal monopoly disturbed the necessary balance between the religious bias toward time and continuity, and the political bias toward space and power. "A successful empire," he wrote, "required adequate appreciation of the problems of space, which were in part military and political, and of problems of time, which were in part dynastic and biological and in part religious." He ended his essay on ancient Egypt by pointing to the imbalance that arose because the priestly monopoly over writing and knowledge supported an emphasis on time and religion, but neglected the political problems inherent in ruling over an empire extended in space.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harold Innis, monopolies of knowledge eventually face challenges to their power, especially with the arrival of new media. He pointed for example, to the monasteries that spread throughout Europe after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. Their monopoly of knowledge depended on their control over the production of the time-binding medium of parchment useful for preserving hand-copied manuscripts written in Latin. Power was vested therefore, in a scribal and literate, religious elite. The largely illiterate laity depended on priests to interpret the scriptures and on image-driven media such as paintings and statues that depicted the central figures in Biblical stories.

[[Image:Chaucer_Hoccleve.png|thumb|left|280px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (c. 1343 – 1400). Innis pointed out that Chaucer wrote in vernacular English instead of Latin or Norman French hastening the growth of English nationalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Portrait of Chaucer by [[Thomas Hoccleve]].&lt;/sub&gt;]]

But the space-binding medium of paper imported from China, Innis wrote, facilitated challenges from Islam and later from a rising commercial class. "Paper supported the growth of trade and cities and of education beyond the control of the monasteries, and in turn of the Church and the cathedrals."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) pp.165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper also supported the rise of vernacular languages reducing Latin's cultural sway.

Innis wrote that the Catholic Church fought to preserve its time-oriented monopoly of knowledge with the [[Inquisition]], but eventually paper achieved even greater power with the invention of the [[printing press]] around the middle of the 15th century. Now, the balance shifted decisively in favour of space over time. The [[Protestant Reformation]] followed, along with European exploration and empire, the rise of science and the evolution of the nation-state. Characteristically, Innis summarizes the far-reaching implications of the new medium of paper in a single paragraph that starts with the Middle Ages and ends with the modern United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The dominance of parchment in the West gave a bias toward ecclesiastical organization, which led to the introduction of paper, with its bias toward political organization. With printing, paper facilitated an effective development of the vernaculars and gave expression to their vitality in the growth of nationalism. The adaptability of the alphabet to large-scale machine industry became the basis of literacy, advertising and trade. The book as a specialized product of printing and, in turn, the newspaper strengthened the position of language as a basis of nationalism. In the United States, the dominance of the newspaper led to large-scale development of monopolies of communication in terms of space and implied a neglect of problems of time.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (Empire) p.216. Innis traces the histories of parchment, paper and printing in his book's final chapters, pp. 140–217.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Western civilization in peril===

Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him, in the end, to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of "mechanized" communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. Industrial societies cut time into precise fragments suitable to engineers and accountants&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias), p.140.&lt;/ref&gt; and Western civilization suffered from an "obsession with present-mindedness" that eliminated concerns about past or future.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Communications media that transmit information quickly over long distances had upset the balance required for cultural survival. "The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine," Innis wrote, "has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity. The emphasis on change is the only permanent characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Valiant Shield - B2 Stealth bomber from Missouri leads ariel formation.jpg|thumb|A B-2 Stealth Bomber leads an aerial flight formation during exercise [[Valiant Shield]] in 2006. Innis believed that advanced U.S. military technologies reinforced the American obsession with space, empire and force at the expense of time, tradition and knowledge.]]

The crisis facing the West was worsened, Innis argued, because communications monopolies that ran the media were largely immune from outside challenge. They literally spoke the language of the masses, effectively penetrating popular consciousness and shaping public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.385.&lt;/ref&gt; American media, with their dependence on advertising and therefore mass appeal, were extremely effective at mobilizing large audiences. Not only were Americans exhorted to buy the newest "improved" products, they were also exposed to a barrage of propaganda from political elites. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] mastered the newspaper as a communications device, just as his fifth cousin, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] mastered radio.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The news media were also influenced by a large [[public relations]] industry that shaped public opinion on behalf of powerful interests.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Changing Concepts), pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis believed that the overwhelming spatial bias of modern media was heightened in the United States by the development of powerful military technologies, including atomic weapons. The advent of the [[Cold War]] led to such an emphasis on military preparedness that the U.S. was placed on a permanent war footing, its economy increasingly dependent on the manufacture of weapons. As Canadian scholar Arthur Kroker writes, "Innis's political lesson was clear: the United States was now a fully 'space-oriented' society, with no inner coordinating principle and with no organic conception of 'lived tradition,' time, succession or duration which might act as an inner check against the politics of imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Kroker, Arthur. (1984). ''Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biographer John Watson writes that "the United States represents to Innis something akin to cultural apocalypse."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.386.&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay entitled, "Technology and Public Opinion in U.S.A," Innis concluded that the United States depended on a foreign policy shaped by military power. "Dependence on organized power and a traditional antipathy to coloured peoples weakens political sensitivity, and lack of experience with problems of continuity and empire threatens the Western world with uncertainty and war."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis was among the first to suggest that the U.S. had lost the balance between power and knowledge essential to its long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.381 and 387.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, ''A Plea for Time'', he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) ''A Plea for Time'', pp.61–91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in "The upside of ivory towers" by Rick Salutin. ''Globe and Mail'', Sept. 7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Innis's theories==

Influenced by Innis's communications theories, historian [[Marshall Poe]] proposed a theory on the genesis of new media. He proposed that new media are "pulled" into existence by organized interests after inventors have already developed the technology, or prototypes of the technology, necessary to support the media.  Poe's theory also predicts the effects the media will have on society by considering eight attributes of a medium: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence, and searchability.&lt;ref name="Poe, A History of Communications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poe|first=Marshall|title=A History of Communication: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-17944-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall McLuhan]], Canadian philosopher, [[public intellectual]] and former colleague of Innis at the [[University of Toronto]], also acknowledged Innis's impact on McLuhan's own works, including "The Gutenberg Galaxy", and "Understanding Media".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Herman Grimm''' (6 January 1828, in [[Kassel]] &amp;ndash; 16 June 1901, in Berlin) was a [[Germany|German]] academic and writer.

Grimm's father was [[Wilhelm Grimm]] (1786-1859), and his uncle [[Jakob Grimm]] (1785-1863), the [[philologist]] compilers of indigenous folk tales ("[[Brothers Grimm]]"). His other uncle was the painter engraver [[Ludwig Emil Grimm]] (1790-1863).  Herman Grimm is believed to have had only one (known) child at a young age, Martin Grimm.   From 1841 Herman attended the [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium]] in Berlin. He belonged to a clique associated with [[Bettina von Arnim]] (1785-1859), wife of the late poet [[Achim von Arnim]] (1781-1831), and started publishing drama and novels. He began legal and philological studies at the universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]. 

In 1857 he visited [[Rome]] where the artistic circle of [[Peter von Cornelius]] brought his interests to art. In 1859, he married [[Gisela von Arnim]] (1827-1889), the Arnim's daughter, and published his treatise, ''Die Akademie der Künste und das Verhältniß der Künstler zum Staate''. His short-lived periodical, ''über Künstler und Kunstwerke'' (1864-1867), published many important essays. It also contained some of the first photographic illustrations of art in a magazine. The first volume of his biography of [[Michelangelo]], ''Das Leben Michelangelos'', began appearing in 1868. He wrote his dissertation in 1868 from [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and his [[habilitation]] (1870) in [[University of Berlin|Berlin]]. In 1871 he weighed in on the famous [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] "[[Meyer Madonna]]" debate concluding against the sound reasoning of the "Holbein convention" of eminent scholars, that the [[Dresden]] version was the autograph one. 

He accepted the chair in the newly created discipline of history of art (''Lehrstuhl für Kunstgeschichte'') in Berlin in 1872 and remained there the rest of his life. Grimm published the first (though incomplete) edition of his popular ''Das Leben Raphaels'' in 1872. Grimm's art history writing is characteristic of the period consolidation of standards following unification of [[Germany]], known as the [[Gründerzeit]]. When [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Friedrich Waagen]], for example, criticized in the early issues of the ''Zeitschrift für bildende Kunst'', [[Goethe]]'s aesthetic taste of some fifty years before, Grimm, the spokesman for the Gründerzeit, took it personally, refuting Waagen effectively point by point. Grimm's ''Beiträge zur deutschen Culturgeschichte'', essays about important cultural personalities, appeared in 1897. Throughout his life his books were popular and his biographies went through numerous editions. At his death he was succeeded by [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]. His more famous students included [[Alfred Lichtwark]]; [[Julius Meier-Graefe]] studied under him but received not a degree.

Grimm's reputation is that of the arch-Romantic, Gründerzeit art historian. He viewed himself as the intellectual successor of Goethe. His approach to art history was through the "Great Masters", and arranging significance of art through a biographical account of art history. His tastes both typified and led German and continental bourgeois taste. [[Homer]], [[Dante]] and [[Shakespeare]] were the great writers of their age; in art, only [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]] could compare. The nineteenth century's adoration of Raphael is in large part Grimm's doing. Wölfflin wrote that Grimm showed indifference to all but the very great. This approach to art history is shared by other historians of his age, including [[Carl Justi]], but was personally savaged in the lectures of [[Anton Springer]]. Grimm was one of the first to carefully study [[reception theory]], though he is little acclaimed for it. In the 3rd edition of his life of Raphael (1896) he added a section on ''Rezeptionsgeschichte''. Perhaps because formal analysis and the sanctity of viewing the original work of art mattered so little to him, he was among the first to use [[lantern slides]] (reproductive images) in his lectures. Grimm's writings were gradually supplanted by better scholarship in the twentieth century. His emotional approach to art-historical debate, as evidence in the Holbein Madonna incident, proved his allegiances were usually closer to nationalism than art history. In Germany, his concept of the [German] hero as a mover of history was embraced by the [[Nazis]], who saw to it that new and repackaged versions of his writings, such as ''Vom Geist der Deutschen'' (1943), appeared up until the war's end.

'''Hozo''' is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language spoken mostly in the Kondala woreda of [[Mirab Welega Zone]] (Western Oromia) by peoples generically known as "Mao". There are smaller groups of Hozo speakers in [[Mana Sibu]] woreda. The term Hozo is usually understood by the Mao to refer to a clan. Hozo speakers prefer to call themselves Amo. Hozo and Seze are sometimes called Begi Mao.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Hozo is spoken by roughly 3,000 people in Ethiopia. Hozo is also a clan in the Begi area. The Hozo language is also known as Begi-Mao and Mao of Begi. Its classification is Afro-Asiatic, Omotic, and Mao. The word Mao is Omotic and means ‘man; people’, occurring as [ma:ɪ] in Seze and as [mɔ:] in Hozo. Mao is frequently used as an ethnic term. There is a kind of Mao identity across language differences in Ethiopia. While it is generally accepted today that Omotic is one of the primary branches of the Afro-Asiatic family, the position of the four languages Hozo, Seze, Ganza and Northern Mao is still being discussed. The Mao languages are the least documented within Omotic, and  Omotic  itself  is  the  least  documented  of  the  Afroasiatic  groups.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Geographic Distribution==
The Omotic Mao languages Seze and Hozo form a compact area in Oromia Regional State surrounded by Oromo speakers on three sides. There seems to be some disagreement amongst the scientists as well as amongst the speakers in how far Seze and Hozo can be classified as two different languages or as dialects of the same language. It has been argued that Seze and Hozo are not two different languages; just two different dialects from village to village. The area where Hozo is predominately spoken appears to be scattered, and there are only a few villages where Hozo is reported as the only Omotic Mao language. Hozo people prefer less permanent forms of settlements for their families and herds. Omotic languages include Anfillo, Ari, Bambassi, Kara, Kefa, Gana, Dime, Nayi, Sheko, Hozo, Yemsa, and Welaytta.&lt;ref&gt;Küspert, K. C. (2015).

==Classification==

Hozo is an Omotic language. Omotic languages are an Ethiopian linguistic group consisting of more than twenty-five distinct languages. Omotic languages developed in the southwestern region near the river Omo, which gave the group its name. Distinct ethnic groups in Ethiopia speak individual languages classified as Omotic.&lt;ref name="Rydgren"&gt;Rydgren, E. (2016). Omotic Languages. Salem Press Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely verbal, the Omotic languages are rarely written down. When they are written, either the Ge’ez (Ethiopic) or Latin alphabet is used, but no standard transliteration from the Ethiopic to the Latin exists. Ge’ez is the ancient language of Ethiopia, which was first introduced as an official written language during the first Aksumite Kingdom between the first and seventh centuries BCE. The earliest known inscriptions of Ge’ez date to the fifth century BCE. Written in horizontal lines from left to right, it was created based on the Sabean/Minean alphabet and is still used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Rydgren" /&gt;

Ethiopian languages are classified into four major groups: Semitic, Cushitic, Omotic, and Nilo-Saharan. The Omotic languages are largely verbal and have several defining characteristics: the majority of vocabulary is monosyllabic, and the languages have ten vowel-sounds: five short and five long. Scholars estimate that there are between twenty-five and forty Omotic languages, but the group has not been extensively studied.&lt;ref name="Rydgren" /&gt;

An ongoing debate among linguists exists regarding the inclusion of Omotic languages in the Afro-Asiatic phylum. Experts cannot agree as to whether the system should be labeled as Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, or something unique. Until the 1960s, Omotic languages were considered as a west-Cushitic subgrouping.&lt;ref name="Rydgren" /&gt;

==History of Scholarship==

After World War II, efforts began to document Ethiopia’s history; however, much more attention was paid to the northern region, which had many Christian communities, a connection to the Ark of the Covenant, and the rock-hewn churches. Little attention was paid to the southern and southwestern Omo valley. Then a socialist coup in 1974 halted most research and expeditions, leaving vast gaps of knowledge about Omotic speakers and their history. Omotic languages are not well studied.&lt;ref name="Rydgren" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6041">{{short description|defines two sets of codes for a number of writing systems}}
'''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 15924''', '''Codes for the representation of names of scripts''', defines two sets of codes for a number of [[writing system]]s (scripts). Each script is given both a four-letter code and a numeric one.&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Everson|first=Michael|title=ISO 15924:2004|url=http://unicode.org/iso15924/|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Script is defined as "set of graphic characters used for the written form of one or more languages".&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004 /&gt; 

Where possible the codes are derived from [[ISO 639-2]] where the name of a script and the name of a language using the script are identical (example: [[Gujarati script|Gujarātī]] ISO 639 guj, ISO 15924 Gujr). Preference is given to the 639-2 Bibliographical codes, which is different from the otherwise often preferred use of the Terminological codes.&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004 /&gt;

4-letter ISO 15924 codes are incorporated into the Language Subtag Registry for [[IETF language tag]]s and so can be used in file formats that make use of such language tags. For example, they can be used in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] to help [[Web browser]]s determine which [[typeface]] to use for foreign text. This way one could differentiate, for example, between [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbian]] written in the Cyrillic (&lt;code&gt;sr-Cyrl&lt;/code&gt;) or Latin (&lt;code&gt;sr-Latn&lt;/code&gt;) script, or mark [[romanization|romanized]] text as such.

==Maintenance==
ISO has appointed the [[Unicode Consortium]] as the Registration Authority (RA) for the standard. In 2004, the RA appointed [[Michael Everson]] to act as Registrar. The Registrar works with a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) in developing and implementing the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/iso15924/ Unicode - ISO 15924 Registration Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; The JAC contains six members: the Registrar, one member from the Library of Congress, one from Standards Norway, one from the French Encyclopaedia Universalis, an officer of Unicode, and a member of Unicode. These individuals represent the interests of the ISO 15924 RA, the ISO 639-2 RA, ISO Technical Committee 37, ISO Technical Committee 46, and the ISO Coded Character Set Sub-Committee, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2.&lt;ref name="JAC info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Advisory Committee ISO 15924 /RA-JAC|url=http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924jac.html|publisher=ISO, Unicode, Inc. &amp; Evertype|accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Script codes==
===Numeric ranges===
*&lt;tt&gt;000–099&lt;/tt&gt; Hieroglyphic and cuneiform scripts
*&lt;tt&gt;100–199&lt;/tt&gt; Right-to-left alphabetic scripts
*&lt;tt&gt;200–299&lt;/tt&gt; Left-to-right alphabetic scripts
*&lt;tt&gt;300–399&lt;/tt&gt; Alphasyllabic scripts
*&lt;tt&gt;400–499&lt;/tt&gt; Syllabic scripts
*&lt;tt&gt;500–599&lt;/tt&gt; Ideographic scripts
*&lt;tt&gt;600–699&lt;/tt&gt; Undeciphered scripts
*&lt;tt&gt;700–799&lt;/tt&gt; Shorthands and other notations&lt;ref&gt;In July, 2010, [[Duployan shorthand]] was assigned code 755, even though the 700-799 range still carried its original designation of (unassigned). Shortly thereafter, Revision 1.1 clarified that codes in the 700s were reserved for "Shorthands and other notations", although that revision is only provisional until it can be confirmed by governing committees.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;800–899&lt;/tt&gt; (unassigned)
*&lt;tt&gt;900–999&lt;/tt&gt; Private use, alias, special codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Everson | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Everson | title=ISO 15924:2004 Information and documentation — Codes for the representation of names of scripts | url=https://www.unicode.org/iso15924/standard/index.html | date=2004-01-09 | publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special codes===

*&lt;tt&gt;Zsye 993&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Emoji]]
*&lt;tt&gt;Zinh 994&lt;/tt&gt;: Code for inherited script
*&lt;tt&gt;Zmth 995&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Mathematical notation]]
*&lt;tt&gt;Zsym 996&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Symbols]]
*&lt;tt&gt;Zxxx 997&lt;/tt&gt;: Code for unwritten languages
*&lt;tt&gt;Zyyy 998&lt;/tt&gt;: Code for undetermined script
*&lt;tt&gt;Zzzz 999&lt;/tt&gt;: Code for uncoded script

===Exceptionally reserved codes===

Two four letter codes are reserved at the request of the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] Project (CLDR):&lt;ref name="codelist"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 15924:2004 – Codes for the representation of names of scripts|url=https://www.unicode.org/iso15924/codelists.html|publisher=[[Unicode]]|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;Root&lt;/tt&gt;: Reserved for the language-neutral base of the CLDR locale tree
*&lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;: Reserved for the [[Boolean algebra|boolean]] value "true"

===List of codes===

This list of codes is from the ISO 15924 standard.&lt;ref name="codelist" /&gt;

{{ISO 15924 script codes and related Unicode data|state=uncollapsed}}

==Relations to other standards==
The following standards are referred to as indispensable by ISO 15924.
* [[ISO 639-2]]:1998 Codes for the representation of names of languages — Part 2: Alpha-3 code
* ISO/IEC 9541-1:1991 Information technology — Font information interchange — Part 1: Architecture
* [[ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000(E)|ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000]] Information technology — Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS)

For definition of font and glyph the standard refers to
* ISO/IEC 9541-1:1991

Around 146 scripts are defined in '''[[Unicode]]'''. Through a linkpin called "Property Value Alias", Unicode has made a 1:1 connection between a script defined, and its ISO 15924 standard. See [[Script (Unicode)]].

'''Ignatius Noah of Lebanon''',&lt;ref name="Swanson"&gt;Swanson (2007), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Nuh the Lebanese''',&lt;ref name="Barsoum" &gt;Barsoum (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; was  the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 1493 until his death in 1509.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt;

==Biography==
Noah was born in 1451 in the village of Baqufa, near [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], into a [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] family originally from [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt; At an early age, Noah and his brother converted to [[miaphysitism]], the doctrine of the Syriac Orthodox Church, as a result of missionary work led by Mor Dioscurus, the [[metropolitan bishop]] of Syria. Noah undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and was subsequently ordained as a priest by Dioskoros Isa ibn Daw, metropolitan bishop of Jerusalem, at the [[Monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian]]. Whilst at the monastery, Noah studied the [[Syriac language]] and religious sciences under Thomas of [[Homs]].&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt; He was later sent by Dioskoros Isa ibn Daw to preach amongst the Maronites in the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanese mountains]].

In 1480, Noah was ordained metropolitan of Homs by [[Ignatius John XIV]], Patriarch of Antioch, upon which he took the name Cyril.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt; Noah continued his work amongst the Maronite communities of Lebanon and converted many priests and their congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Salibi (1959), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; He was later ordained the [[Maphrian]] of the East by Ignatius John XIV in 1489, thereafter assuming the name Basilius, and held this office until his election and consecration as Patriarch of Antioch, the head of the Syriac Orthodox Church, in 1493.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt; Noah adopted the name Ignatius, after St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]], thus following the tradition established by [[Ignatius Behnam Hadliyo]], Patriarch of Antioch.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt;

As patriarch, a dispute emerged between Noah and [[Ignatius Mas'ud of Zaz]], Patriarch of [[Tur Abdin]], over the consecration of a certain Abraham as the metropolitan bishop of Ma'dan.&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt; Both Mas'ud and Noah had consecrated their candidates as metropolitan bishop of Ma'dan despite the location of Ma'dan, which was outside of the jurisdiction of the patriarchate of Tur Abdin.&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt; [[Pope John XIII of Alexandria]], the head of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], joined Noah in condemning Mas'ud, however, advised conciliation and unity in a letter to Noah.&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt; During his tenure as patriarch, Noah ordained thirteen bishops before his death at Hama on 28 July 1509.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt;

==Works==
Noah is known to have also been a writer and poet and several surviving works are attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt; He produced a 92-page anthology containing a number of odes and a eulogy to Thomas of Homs, his former tutor.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt; The patriarch is known to have written a very brief history of the church as well as theological works in Arabic and Syriac.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt;

'''Isanzu''' is a [[Bantu language]] of spoken by the [[Isanzu people]] south of [[Lake Eyasi]] in [[Tanzania]].

The position of Isanzu within the Bantu family is uncertain. It is rather distinct in certain features from other Bantu languages of the area, such as [[Turu language|Nyaturu]], but is quite close in others. One easily recognizable feature is /h/ in words where neighboring languages have /s/ or /tʃ/, as in the name Isanzu ~ ''Ihanzu'', a feature it shares with [[Iramba language|Iramba]], and a reason it is commonly classified with Iramba.

'''Johannes Hendrik "Jan" van Steenbergen''' (born June 3, 1970) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist, journalist, translator and interpreter. He is known for being the author of several constructed languages, notably [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]] and [[Wenedyk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://conlang.org/language-creation-conference/lcc4/lcc4-speakers/ Biography at conlang.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Hoorn]], where he spent most of his childhood. In 1988 he became a student at the [[Amsterdam University]], where he graduated in [[East European Studies]] with major topics in [[Slavistics]] and [[musicology]]. He continued his studies in Poland at [[Warsaw University]] and worked at the [[Warsaw Autumn]] festival for contemporary music. In 1997, he became a Polish translator and interpreter in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steenbergen.globtra.com/ Translator's profile] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140130143000/http://www.steenbergen.globtra.com/ |date=2014-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he started working on an artificial [[North Slavic languages|North Slavic]] language, ''Vuozgašchai'' (Vozgian), and in 2002 he created another language, [[Wenedyk]], a reconstruction of what [[Polish language|Polish]] might have looked like if it had been influenced by [[Vulgar Latin]]. In 2006, he was one of the initiators of the [[Pan-Slavic language|Pan-Slavic]] language [[Interslavic language|Slovianski]] (later renamed [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]), as well as the coordinator of a project for the creation of an electronic Interslavic dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:265446-Slovijanski-da-svako-razume M.

'''Jean-Joseph de Mondonville''' (25 December 1711 (baptised) – 8 October 1772), also known as '''Jean-Joseph Cassanéa de Mondonville''', was a [[French people|French]] [[violin]]ist and [[composer]]. He was a younger contemporary of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and enjoyed great success in his day. Pierre-Louis Daquin (son of the composer [[Louis-Claude Daquin]]) claimed: "If I couldn't be Rameau, there's no one I would rather be than Mondonville".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the booklet to ''Titon et l'Aurore''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Cassanéa de Mondonville, Jean-Joseph, par Cochin et Delattre, BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|Mondonville, 1768 engraving]]
Mondonville was born in [[Narbonne]] in [[Occitania]] (South [[France]]) to an aristocratic family which had fallen on hard times. In 1733 he moved to [[Paris]] where he gained the patronage of the king's mistress [[Madame de Pompadour]] and won several musical posts,  including violinist for the [[Concert Spirituel]].

His first opus was a volume of [[violin]] [[sonata]]s, published in 1733. He became a violinist of the [[Chapelle royale]] and chamber and performed in some 100 concerts; some of his ''grands motets'' were also performed that year receiving considerable acclaim. He was appointed ''sous-maître'' in 1740 and then, in 1744, intendant of the Royal Chapel. He produced operas and grands motets for the Opéra and Concert Spirituel respectively, and was associated with the Théatre des Petits-Cabinets, all the while maintaining his career as a violinist throughout the 1740s. In 1755, he became director of the Concert Spirituel on the death of [[Pancrace Royer]].  Mondonville died in [[Belleville (commune)|Belleville]] near [[Paris]] at the age of sixty.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical information: Viking, various booklet notes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

===Sacred music===
Between 1734 and 1755 Mondonville composed 17 ''[[grands motets]]'', of which only nine have survived. The motet ''Venite exultemus domino'', published in 1740, won him the post of ''Maître de musique de la Chapelle'' (Master of Music of the Chapel). Thanks to his mastery of both orchestral and vocal music, Mondonville brought to the grand motet—the dominant genre of music in the repertory of the ''Chapelle royale'' (Royal Chapel) before the [[French Revolution]]—an intensity of colour and a dramatic quality hitherto unknown. In 1758, Mondonville introduced [[oratorio]]s as a new genre at the [[Concert Spirituel]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Pierre, ''Histoire du Concert spirituel'' (Paris: Heugel, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operas===
Although Mondonville's first stage work, ''[[Isbé]]'', was a failure, he enjoyed great success with the lighter forms of French Baroque opera:  the ''[[opéra-ballet]]'' and the ''[[pastorale héroïque]]''. His most popular works were ''Le carnaval de Parnasse'', ''[[Titon et l'Aurore]]'' and ''[[Daphnis et Alcimadure]]'' (for which Mondonville wrote his own [[libretto]] in [[Languedocien]] - his native [[Occitan]] dialect).&lt;ref name="Viking"&gt;Viking&lt;/ref&gt; ''Titon et l'Aurore'' played an important role in the [[Querelle des Bouffons]], the controversy between partisans of French and Italian opera which raged in Paris in the early 1750s. Members of the "French party" ensured that ''Titon'''s premiere was a resounding success (their opponents even alleged they had guaranteed this result by packing the [[Académie Royale de Musique]], where the staging took place, with royal soldiers).&lt;ref&gt;Booklet notes to ''Titon et l'Aurore''&lt;/ref&gt; Mondonville's one foray into serious French opera - the genre known as ''[[tragédie en musique]]'' - was a failure however. He took the unusual step of re-using a libretto, ''[[Thésée]]'', which had originally been set in 1675 by the "father of French opera", [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. Mondonville's bold move to substitute Lully's much-loved music with his own did not pay off. The premiere at the court in 1765 had a mixed reception and a public performance two years later ended with the audience demanding it be replaced by the original. Yet Mondonville was merely ahead of his time; in the 1770s, it became fashionable to reset Lully's tragedies with new music, the most famous example being ''[[Armide (Gluck)|Armide]]'' by [[Gluck]].&lt;ref name="Viking"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="95612">A '''joint issue''' is the release of [[postage stamp|stamps]] or [[postal stationery]] by two or more countries to commemorate the same topic, event or person. Joint issues typically have the same [[first day of issue]] and their design is often similar or identical, except for the identification of country and value.

== Continental joint issues ==
* [[Europa postage stamp]]s : Between 1956 and 1973 the postal authorities of several European nations issued stamps with a common design but since 1974 a common topic is used on stamps issued each year. These are not true joint issues, because they do not share the same designs or dates of issue.

== An early unrealized trans-Atlantic joint issue ==
* 1914 peace commemoratives: In 1914, the United Kingdom, the Dominion of Canada and the United States agreed on a plan by which each of the three nations would issue its own series of stamps that year to commemorate the 100 years of Anglo-American peace that had prevailed since the end of the War of 1812.   After the outbreak of World War I later that year, however, the UK and Canada deemed it inappropriate to issue peace stamps and withdrew from the project.  The US had already produced [[Essay (philately)|essays]] for 2¢ and 5¢ stamps but canceled further plans for the designs. (This would not have been a true joint issue because each country would have designed its stamps individually.){{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3780">A '''monogastric''' organism has a simple single-chambered [[stomach]], compared with a [[ruminant]] organism, like a cow, goat, or sheep, which has a four-chambered complex stomach. Examples of monogastric animals include [[omnivore]]s such as [[humans]], [[rat]]s, [[dog]]s and [[pig]]s, [[carnivore]]s such as [[cat]]s, and [[herbivore]]s such as [[horse]]s and [[rabbit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monogastrics Vs Ruminents|url=http://brincksm.weebly.com/uploads/3/6/3/4/3634133/communication_artifact.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Herbivores with monogastric digestion can digest cellulose in their diets by way of symbiotic gut bacteria. However, their ability to extract energy from cellulose digestion is less efficient than in ruminants.&lt;ref name=Waikato&gt;[http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/farm/content/animalstructure.html Animal Structure &amp; Function]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Herbivores digest cellulose by microbial  [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. Monogastric herbivores which can digest [[cellulose]] nearly as well as ruminants are called [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]], while ruminants are called [[Foregut fermentation|foregut fermenters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcebiology.edublogs.org/2011/04/30/hindgut-versus-foregut-fermenters/ Hindgut versus Foregut Fermenters]&lt;/ref&gt;  These are subdivided into two groups based on the relative size of various digestive organs in relationship to the rest of the system: [[Colon (anatomy)|colonic]] fermenters tend to be larger species such as horses and [[rhino]]s, and [[cecum|cecal]] fermenters are smaller animals such as rabbits and rodents.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;[http://www.lafebervet.com/small-mammal-medicine/nutrition/adaptations-in-herbivore-nutrition/ Grant, Kerrin.

Monogastrics cannot digest the fiber molecule cellulose as efficiently as ruminants, though the ability to digest cellulose varies amongst species.&lt;ref name=Waikato/&gt;

A monogastric digestive system works as soon as the food enters the mouth. [[Saliva]] moistens the food and begins the digestive process. (Note that horses have no (or negligible amounts of) [[amylase]] in their saliva). After being swallowed, the food passes from the [[esophagus]] into the stomach, where [[stomach acid]] and [[enzymes]] help to break down the food. [[Bile salt]]s are stored in the [[gall bladder]] (note that horses do not have a gall bladder and bile is directly secreted into the small intestine) and secreted once the contents of the stomach have reached the [[small intestines]]  {{Dubious |Sentence does not make sense|reason=This defies most known vertebrate digestive biology|date=July 2017}} where most fats are broken down. The [[pancreas]] secretes enzymes and alkali to neutralize the stomach acid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">The '''Moorsom System''' is a method created in [[Great Britain]] of calculating the [[tonnage]] or cargo capacity of sailing ships as a basis for assessing harbour and other vessel fees. It was put into use starting in 1849 and became British law in 1854.

==Previous methods==
Previous methods of calculating tonnage, as [[Builder's Old Measurement]], were not being consistently applied and, because they were designed for sailing ships, could not be applied appropriately or fairly for steamships. Substantial portions of a steamship were required for boilers, machinery and coal, thus limiting the proportion of the ship's space available for cargo.

==Moorsom commission==
In 1849, Great Britain appointed a Commission with Admiral George Moorsom as secretary to resolve these problems. The Commission determined that fees should be proportional to the earning capacity of the ship, whether for cargo or passengers. 

The result was called The Moorsom System, which set forth the rules for the measurement of the internal volume of entire ship.
* The total internal volume was divided by {{convert|100|cuft}} to produce the gross register tonnage.
* Net register tonnage was the volume remaining after subtracting the volume of the space used for machinery and other non-revenue producing functions.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission sought to avoid a significant change in the fees charged to an existing vessel when the new system was implemented.

George Moorsom ordered the entire fleet of British merchant ships to be measured according to the new System and then divided the total gross tonnage by the total registered tonnage.

The result was {{convert|98.22|cuft}} per gross ton, which was rounded to {{convert|100|cuft|abbr=on}} per ton.&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Convention==
While the rules for measuring ships changed over the years, the standard of {{convert|100|cuft|abbr=on}} per ton remained in effect until a new system was established by The International Convention on the Tonnage Measurement of Ships, effective for new ships in July 1982.

A '''parallel text''' is a text placed alongside its translation or translations.  '''Parallel text alignment''' is the identification of the corresponding sentences in both halves of the parallel text. The [[Loeb Classical Library]] and the [[Clay Sanskrit Library]] are two examples of dual-language series of texts. Reference [[Bible translations|Bibles]] may contain the original languages and a translation, or several translations by themselves, for ease of comparison and study; [[Origen]]'s [[Hexapla]] (Greek for "sixfold") placed six versions of the Old Testament side by side.  The most famous example is the [[Rosetta Stone]].

Large collections of parallel texts are called '''parallel corpora''' (see [[text corpus]]). Alignments of parallel corpora at sentence level are prerequisite for many areas of [[linguistics|linguistic]] research. 
During translation, sentences can be split, merged, deleted, inserted or reordered by the translator. This makes alignment a non-trivial task.

==Types of parallel corpora==

Four main corpora types can be distinguished.

A ''noisy parallel corpus'' contains bilingual sentences that are not perfectly aligned or have poor quality translations. Nevertheless, most of its contents are bilingual translations of a specific document.

A ''comparable corpus'' is built from non-sentence-aligned and untranslated bilingual documents, but the documents are topic-aligned.

A ''quasi-comparable corpus'' includes very heterogeneous and non-parallel bilingual documents that may or may not be topic-aligned.

The rarest parallel corpora are corpora that contain translations of the same document into two or more languages, aligned at the sentence level at least.

==Noise in corpora==

Large corpora used as training sets for [[machine translation]] algorithms are usually extracted from large bodies of similar sources, such as databases of news articles written in the first and second languages describing similar events.

However, extracted fragments may be noisy, with extra elements inserted in each corpus. Extraction techniques can differentiate between [[bilingual]] elements represented in both corpora and [[monolingual]] elements represented in only one corpus in order to extract cleaner parallel fragments of bilingual elements. Comparable corpora are used to directly obtain knowledge for translation purposes. High-quality parallel data is difficult to obtain, however, especially for under-resourced languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | title = Noisy-Parallel and Comparable Corpora Filtering Methodology for the Extraction of Bi-Lingual Equivalent Data at Sentence Level | journal = Computer Science | year = 2015 | issue = 16.2 | pages = 169–184 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bitext ==
{{main|Bitext word alignment}}
In the field of [[translation studies]] a '''bitext''' is a merged document composed of both source- and target-language versions of a given text.

Bitexts are generated by a piece of software called an ''alignment tool'', or a ''bitext tool'', which automatically aligns the original and translated versions of the same text. The tool generally matches these two texts sentence by sentence. A collection of bitexts is called a ''bitext database'' or a ''bilingual corpus'', and can be consulted with a search tool.

===Bitexts and translation memories===
The concept of the ''bitext'' shows certain similarities with that of the [[translation memory]]. Generally, the most salient difference between a bitext and a translation memory is that a translation memory is a database in which its segments (matched sentences) are stored in a way that is totally unrelated to their original context; the original sentence order is lost. A bitext retains the original sentence order. However, some implementations of translation memory, such as [[Translation Memory eXchange]] (TMX), a standard [[XML]] format for exchanging translation memories between [[computer-assisted translation]] (CAT) programs, allow preserving the original order of sentences.

Bitexts are designed to be consulted by a human [[translation|translator]], not by a machine. As such, small alignment errors or minor discrepancies that would cause a translation memory to fail are of no importance.

In his original 1988 article, Harris also posited that bitext represents how translators hold their source and target texts together in their mental working memories
as they progress. However, this hypothesis has not been followed up.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, B. ''[http://mt-archive.info/LangMonthly-54-1988-Harris.pdf Bi-text, a new concept in translation theory]'', Language Monthly (UK)
54, p. 8-10, March 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''demonetization''' of [[postage stamp|postage]] and [[revenue stamp]]s is the process by which the stamps are rendered no longer valid. In general, stamp demonetization is a rare event, since any unused stamp is effectively equivalent to its face value, and there is no financial disadvantage if postal customers use old stamps on their mail. Demonetization chiefly occurs in connection with major upheavals in the postal system, such as a transfer from one country to another, or [[currency]] changes, such as [[decimalisation]], or a change of government. The process of exchanging millions or billions of stamps in the public's hands, plus that of exchanging post office stock, is usually complicated and difficult, and offers much interest for students of [[postal history]].

There are typically two parts to the process; first, the exchange of unused stamps for new ones of equivalent value. This normally occurs at post offices, with patrons bringing in their old stamps. The second part is the handling of mail with stamps already on it. Uncancelled letters, such as those dropped in mailbox, will get a grace period, ending at roughly the same time as the exchange of old stamps. Cancelled letters already in the mailstream may be accepted for a longer period, since remote post offices may not yet have exchanged their stamps, and sometimes there may be delays within the postal system itself.

== Eurozone ==
In the Eurozone, some countries have demonetized stamps denominated in the old currency while others have not. The countries where pre-euro stamps are still valid include [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]].

=== Austria ===
Austrian stamps denominated in [[Austrian schilling|schillings]] were demonetized on 1 July 2002.

=== Finland ===
Finnish stamps denominated in [[Finnish mark|marks]] were demonetized at the end of 2011.

=== Germany ===
German stamps denominated in [[Deutsche Mark]]s were demonetized on 1 July 2002. All stamps issued since 9 November 2000 are valid for postage.

=== Ireland ===
Irish stamps denominated in [[Irish pound|pounds]] were demonetized on 31 December 2002. Stamps issued since 2 August 2000 are valid for postage.&lt;ref name="ie"/&gt;

=== Malta ===
In Malta, all stamps denominated in [[Maltese pound]]s were demonetized in 2008. All stamps issued since 29 December 2006 are valid for postage. Mail franked with older stamps is marked STAMP NOT VALID and [[postage due]] is charged.

=== Netherlands ===
Stamps of the Netherlands denominated in [[guilder]]s were demonetized on 1 November 2013. It is not possible to exchange guilder stamps for ones denominated in euros.&lt;ref name="postnl"/&gt;

=== Portugal ===
Portuguese stamps denominated in [[Portuguese escudo|escudos]] were demonetized in 2002. All stamps issued since 15 March 1999 are valid for postage.

=== Spain ===
Spanish stamps denominated in [[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s were demonetized in 2002. All stamps issued since 8 January 2001 are valid for postage.

=== Vatican City ===
Stamps of the Vatican City denominated in [[Italian Lira|lire]] are no longer valid for postage.

== Australia ==

The six self-governing Australian colonies that formed the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901 operated their own postal service and issued their own stamps. Under section 51(v) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 1900, “postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services” became a Commonwealth responsibility.

The Commonwealth's Postmaster-General's Department became effective on 1 March 1901 (this agency would be disaggregated on 1 July 1975 in part into the Australian Postal Commission trading as Australia Post). All then-current colony stamps which continued on sale became de facto Commonwealth stamps. Some of these stamps continued to be used for some time following the introduction in 1913 of the Commonwealth's uniform postage stamp series. These stamps continued to be valid for postage until 14 February 1966 when the introduction of decimal currency made all stamps bearing the earlier currency invalid for use.

== Hong Kong ==
In [[Hong Kong]] postage stamps have been demonetized only once, which happened because of the 1997 [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]]. The postage stamps from before 1997 bear the portrait of the King/Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] (who at the time of handover was [[Queen Elizabeth II]]). Although there was already a series of politically neutral stamps issued (which did not bear the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II nor the words "Hong Kong, China", which appear on today's Hong Kong stamps) during the period of handover, [[Hongkong Post]] decided to let the old stamps bearing the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II be used for a few more years after the handover since there were some old stamps in the hands of Hong Kong people. Hong Kong people can also exchange those old stamps for new ones if they desire. After the transition period, those old stamps bearing the portrait of the King/Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] were declared invalid and hence demonetized. The politically neutral stamps were not demonetized however. All stamps issued now bear the word "Hong Kong, China", as required by [[Basic Law (Hong Kong)|Basic Law]]. As a side note, the [[Hong Kong dollar]] coins/notes that bear the portrait of the King/Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] were never demonetized, however they will not be recirculated when the banks receive them, primarily because of their old age rather than sovereignty issue.

== Poland ==
The country of Poland has a very recent example of demonetization involving the stamp issues of 1990 to 1994. During this period of time, the face values of stamps due to [[hyperinflation]] gradually changed the face values to thousands of złoty. Commemorative stamp issues from 1995 to 1997 are also demonetized now as are certain selected issues as announced by the Polish Post Office.

When a newer stamp issue is demonetized a date is announced; however, if a postal patron in a small town has not been notified of the demonetization or a postal patron does not visit their local Post Office often, then Polish Post Office will accept their obsolete stamps for letter franking well after the demonetization date.

== United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], earlier issues have been demonetized on several occasions. The first when stamps issued during the reigns of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] (issued 1840 to 1911) were declared{{When|date=February 2011}} no longer valid for postage. The second, early in 1970, when the stamps issued during the reigns of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] (issued 1911 to 1952) ceased to be valid and the third some months after the introduction in 1971 of decimal currency, when all stamps with pre-decimalization values were demonetized. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] £1 value stamps issued prior to 1971 are identifiable by design but remain valid for postage.

== United States ==
[[United States]] postage stamps have been demonetized only twice. The first time was in 1851, when the 5-cent and 10-cent stamps of the 1847 issue were declared invalid as of July 1 by the [[Act of March 3, 1851]] reducing the normal letter rate from five to three cents. A few dozen [[cover (philately)|cover]]s are known that carry 1847 stamps after the demonetization date; as stamp usage was then still optional (it would not be made mandatory until 1855), the demonetization seems to have had relatively little impact.

The second, more serious, demonetization was prompted by the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861. Southern post offices held substantial U.S. assets in the form of their stamp stocks, and the Confederates could theoretically have brought in some income by selling those stamps to private individuals in the North. Although in April 1861 [[John H. Reagan]], postmaster of the CSA, ordered the offices in his charge to return their stamps to Washington D.C., few seem to have done so, and by June 1861 U.S. postmaster-general [[Montgomery Blair]] ordered the severance of postal ties and the production of new stamps. In August the stamps of the [[U.S. 1861 issue]] began to be distributed throughout the Union, along with orders that postmasters should offer to exchange old stamps for new for a period of six days after giving "public notice through the newspapers and otherwise". After the six-day period was over, that post office was not to recognize the old stamps as paying postage. In addition, postmasters were to accept letters with old stamps from other post offices until set dates, ranging from September 10 in the East, to November 1 from letters arriving from the Far West. (Later the periods were extended for an additional two months.) The process stretched over some months; the large cities in the East were exchanging stamps in the third week of August, while some small remote offices did not start until November.
General confusion, combined with exhaustion of the new stamps at some post offices, led to some instances of the old stamps still being accepted on letters after demonetization, although surviving covers are rare.

The U.S. stamps of 1861, and all issued since then, continue to be valid on mail.&lt;ref name="brookman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="graham"/&gt;

[[File:Prac-screenshot.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of the PRAC natural-language interpreter on a desktop and a mobile client.]]
'''PRAC (Probabilistic Action Cores)''' is an [[natural language understanding|interpreter for natural-language]] instructions for [[robotics|robotic]] applications developed at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the [[University of Bremen]], [[Germany]], and is supported in parts by the [[European Commission]] and the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation (DFG)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Daniel |last1 = Nyga |title =  Interpretation of Natural-language Robot Instructions: Probabilistic Knowledge Representation, Learning, and Reasoning |journal = PhD thesis | year = 2017 | url = http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:gbv:46-00105882-13 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
The ultimate goal of the PRAC system is to make knowledge about everyday activities from websites like [[wikiHow]] available for service robots, such that they can autonomously acquire new high-level skills by browsing the [[World wide web|Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Daniel |last1 = Nyga |first2 = Michael |last2 = Beetz |title = Everything Robots Always Wanted to Know about Housework (But were afraid to ask) |journal = 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) | year = 2012 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6385923 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRAC addresses the problem that [[natural language]] is inherently vague and unspecific. To this end, PRAC maintains [[Statistical relational learning|probabilistic first-order knowledge bases]] over [[semantic network]]s represented in [[Markov logic network]]s. As opposed to other [[Semantics|semantic]] [[Machine learning|learning]] initiatives like [[Never-Ending Language Learning|NELL]] or [[IBM]]'s [[Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson]], PRAC does not aim at answering questions in [[natural language]], but to disambiguate and infer information pieces that are missing in natural-language instructions, such that they can be executed by a robot. "This problem formulation is substantially different to the problem of text understanding for question answering or machine translation. In those reasoning tasks, the vagueness and ambiguity of natural-language expressions can often be kept and translated into other languages. In contrast, robotic agents have to infer missing information pieces and disambiguate the meaning of the instruction in order to perform the instruction successfully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Daniel |last1 = Nyga |first2 = Michael |last2 = Beetz |title = Cloud-based Probabilistic Knowledge Services for Instruction Interpretation |journal = International Symposium of Robotics Research (ISRR) | year = 2015 | url = http://www.acat-project.eu/modules/BibtexModule/uploads/PDF/nygabeetz2015a.pdf |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Probability Theory|probabilistic]] relational models, PRAC uses the principles of [[Case-based reasoning|analogical reasoning]] and [[instance-based learning]] to infer completions of roles in semantic networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Daniel |last1 = Nyga |first2 = Mareike |last2 = Picklum | first3 = Sebastian | last3 = Koralewski | first4 = Michael |last4 = Beetz |title = Instruction Completion through Instance-based Learning and Semantic Analogical Reasoning |journal = International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Proto–Afroasiatic language''' is the reconstructed [[proto-language]] from which all modern [[Afroasiatic languages]] are descended. Though estimations vary widely, it is believed by scholars to have been spoken as a single language around 12,000 to 18,000 years ago. As Afroasiatic is the oldest established [[language family]] in the world, the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstruction]] of Proto-Afroasiatic is problematic and remains largely lacking. Moreover, there is no consensus as to where the [[Afroasiatic Urheimat]], the homeland of Proto-Afroasiatic speakers, was located.

Reconstructed words for fauna and flora and evidence of linguistic contact with language families known to have been spoken in Eurasia suggest that its home was in the [[Middle East]], probably the [[Levant]]. Some geneticists and archaeologists have argued for a back migration of proto-Afroasiatic speakers from [[Western Asia]] to Africa as early as the [[10th millennium BC]]. They suggest the [[Natufian culture]] might have spoken a proto-Afroasian language just prior to its disintegration into sub-languages.&lt;ref name="Dziebel2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dziebel|first=German|title=The Genius of Kinship: The Phenomenon of Human Kinship and the Global Diversity of Kinship Terminologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yo14jYY3pYC&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=13 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=978-1-934043-65-3|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nöth1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|author-link=Winfried Nöth|title=Origins of Semiosis: Sign Evolution in Nature and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4_It_sAuMYC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-087750-2|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis is supported by the Afroasiatic terms for early livestock and crops in both [[Anatolia]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5wKT-5SOAKQC&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Quantitative Approaches to Linguistic Diversity: Commemorating the Centenary of the Birth of Morris Swadesh|page= 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[Cushitic]] being formerly spoken in the south of Arabia also speaks for a Middle Eastern origin, but some proposals also claim [[Northern Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past.|last=Blench, Roger.|first=|publisher=Rowman: Altamira,|year=2006|isbn=9780759104662|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phil.muni.cz/jazyk/files/AAmigrationsCORR.pdf|title=Afro-Asiatic linguistic migrations: linguistic evidence.|last=Blažek, Václav|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proto-Oceanic''' (abbr. ''POc'') is a [[proto-language]] that [[comparative linguistics|language comparatists]] since [[Otto Dempwolff]] have proposed as the probable common ancestor to the group of [[Oceanic languages]]. Proto-Oceanic is itself an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] and so therefore a descendant of the [[Proto-Austronesian language]] (PAN), the common ancestor of the Austronesian languages.

Proto-Oceanic was probably spoken about 4200 years ago, in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Archaeologists and linguists currently agree that its community more or less coincides with the [[Lapita culture]].

==Linguistic characteristics==
The methodology of [[comparative linguistics]], together with the relative homogeneity of [[Oceanic languages]], make it possible to reconstruct with reasonable certainty the principal linguistic properties of their common ancestor, Proto-Oceanic. Like all scientific hypotheses, these reconstructions must be understood as obviously reflecting the state of science at a particular moment in time; the detail of these reconstructions is still the object of much discussion among [[Oceanic languages|Oceanicist]] scholars.

===Phonology===
The phonology of POc can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty.&lt;ref&gt;See Ross, Pawley, Osmond (1998: 15).&lt;/ref&gt;
Proto-Oceanic had five vowels:  *'''i''', *'''e''', *'''a''', *'''o''', *'''u''', with no length contrast. 

Twenty-three consonants are reconstructed. When the conventional transcription of a protophoneme differs from its value in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], the latter is indicated:

===Basic word order===
Many Oceanic languages of [[New Guinea]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Micronesia]] are [[subject–verb–object|SVO]], or verb-medial, languages. [[subject–object–verb|SOV]], or verb-final, word order is considered to be typologically unusual for Austronesian languages, and is only found in some Oceanic languages of New Guinea and to a more limited extent, the Solomon Islands. This is because SOV word order is very common in some non-Austronesian [[Papuan languages]] in contact with Oceanic languages. In turn, most [[Polynesian languages]], and several languages of [[New Caledonia]], have the [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] word order. Whether Proto-Oceanic had SVO or VSO is still debatable.

==Estimated date of work==

Most scholars contend that Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities was written sometime between the mid-first century CE and the mid-second century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, with Latin Text and English Translation|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|publisher=Brill|year=1996|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose that Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities was written shortly preceding the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and its temple in 70 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudo-Philo: Rewriting the Bible|last=Murphy|first=Frederick J.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-19-507622-2|location=Oxford|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars suggest that Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquites was written post-70 CE, possibly as late as shortly following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba]] revolt (132-136 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, with Latin Text and English Translation|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|publisher=Brill|year=1996|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=208-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very small minority of scholars suggest dates outside these bounds. Examples include Abram Spiro who suggests that it was composed in the second century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spiro|first=Abram|date=1951|title=Samaritans, Tobiads, and Judahites in Pseudo-Philo|url=|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research|volume=20|pages=282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. R. Porter who dates Pseudo-Philo to 25 CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Lost Bible | author1-first= J. R. | author1-last= Porter| year= 2010 |publisher= Metro Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4351-4169-8|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexander Zeron who posits that it was composed sometime in the third or fourth centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeron|first=Alexander|date=1980|title=Erwägungen zu Pseudo-Philos quellen und Zeit|url=|journal=Journal for the Study of Judaism|volume=11|pages=52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the evidence cited by scholars in support of a pre-70 CE date of composition is the depiction of the temple in Jerusalem as still standing and in use for sacrifices (e.g. LAB 22:8).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Harrington, “Pseudo-Philo,” in ''The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha'' (ed. James H. Charlesworth; 2 vols.; Garden City: Doubleday, 1983-1985), 2:299.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, [[Daniel J. Harrington]] writes: 'A date prior to AD 70 (and perhaps around the time of Jesus) is suggested by the kind of Old Testament text used in the book, the free attitude towards the text, the interest in the sacrifices and other things pertaining to cult, and the silence about the destruction of the temple'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel J. Harrington]], 'Outside the Old Testament' in Marinus de Jong (ed.) ''Outside the Old Testament'' (CUP, 1985), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard Jacobson, for example, treats this view dismissively, stating that "Simply put, there are no particularly cogent arguments in support of a pre-70 date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, With Latin Text and English Translation|year=1996|publisher=Brill Academic Publications|isbn=978-9004105539|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the evidence cited in support of a post-70 CE date of composition are thematic parallels with 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biblical Antiquities of Philo|last=James|first=M. R.|publisher=Ktav|year=1971|isbn=|location=New York|pages=46-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish texts composed post-70 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, with Latin Text and English Translation|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|publisher=Brill|year=1996|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and references to the destruction of the temple (e.g. LAB 19:7).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, with Latin Text and English Translation|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|publisher=Brill|year=1996|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original language and translational history==

The scholarly consensus is that Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities was not composed in Latin but, rather that it was composed in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and translated into [[Greek language|Greek]] before being translated into [[Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudo-Philo: Rewriting the Bible|last=Murphy|first=Frederick|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Daniel|date=1970|title=The Original Language of Pseudo-Philo’s Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum|url=|journal=Harvard Theological Review|volume=63|pages=503-514|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Leopold|date=1898|title=An Apocryphal work ascribed to Philo of Alexandria|url=|journal=Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=10|pages=308-312|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the fourth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, with Latin Text and English Translation|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|publisher=Brill|year=1996|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary evidence for this are the many difficult readings in Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities that are best explained by the existence of Hebrew and Greek antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, with Latin Text and English Translation|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|publisher=Brill|year=1996|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=223 (also pp. 215-224)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Short description of content==

Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities is a selective rewriting of Jewish scriptural texts and traditions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Daniel J. Harrington, “Pseudo-Philo,” in ''The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha'' (ed. James H. Charlesworth; 2 vols.; Garden City: Doubleday, 1983-1985), 2:297.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a basic narrative outline derived from the Jewish Scriptures, the work opens with the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]] (LAB 1) and concludes with the death of King [[Saul the King|Saul]] (LAB 65).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As Leopold Cohn observes, Pseudo-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities “passes rapidly over” or “omits” certain aspects of the scriptural narrative while elaborating other on others, even supplying “many quite novel additions” not paralleled in the Jewish Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Leopold|date=1898|title=An Apocryphal work ascribed to Philo of Alexandria|url=|journal=Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=10|pages=279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its additions have parallels in other Jewish traditions.

Some scholars have reasoned that the fact that it ends with the death of Saul implies that there were further parts of the work which are now missing while others believe that it is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Howard|title=A Commentary on Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, With Latin Text and English Translation|year=1996|publisher=Brill Academic Publications|isbn=978-9004105539|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The work as source of legends===

It is probably the earliest reference for many later legendary accretions to the Biblical texts, such as the casting of [[Abraham]] into the fire, [[Dinah]]'s marriage to [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], and [[Moses]] born circumcised. It also contains several other embellishments which deviate quite substantially from the norm, such as Abraham leading a rebellion against the builders of the [[Tower of Babel]] (the reason for him being cast into the fire).

It includes a lament about the symbolic [[human sacrifice]] of [[Jephthah's daughter]], with the daughter being the singer.  Commentators have noted that the characterisation of the daughter is (like other female characterisations in Pseudo-Philo) much stronger and more positive than that of her biblical counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Philip Alexander's 1988 article 'Retelling the Old Testament' in ''It Is Written: Scripture Citing Scripture'' (Cambridge: CUP) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521097622] and Frederick Murphy's 1993 book ''Pseudo-Philo: Rewriting the Bible'' (New York: OUP) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195076222]&lt;/ref&gt;  She has a name (Seila), and her role is as wise and willing, rather than passive and reluctant, participant.  One commentator has observed that 'the author has done his utmost to put this woman on the same level as the patriarchs, in this case especially Isaac'.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Horst, Pieter (1989) 'Portraits of Biblical Women in Pseudo-Philo's ''Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum' '', Journal for the Study of Pseudepigrapha 5, 29 - 46 (at 42)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9270">In [[computer science]], in particular in [[formal language theory]], the '''pumping lemma for context-free languages''', also known as the '''[[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel|Bar-Hillel]]{{clarify|reason="Why not known after all the co-authors|date=June 2014}} lemma''', is a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that gives a property shared by all [[context-free language]]s and generalizes the [[pumping lemma for regular languages]]. As the pumping lemma does not suffice to guarantee that a language is context-free there are more stringent necessary conditions, such as [[Ogden's lemma]].

with [[substring]]s &lt;math&gt;u, v, w, x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, such that

== Informal statement and explanation ==
The pumping lemma for context-free languages (called just "the pumping lemma" for the rest of this article) describes a property that all context-free languages are guaranteed to have.

The property is a property of all strings in the language that are of length at least &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a constant—called the ''pumping length''—that varies between context-free languages.

Say &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a string of length at least &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; that is in the language.

The pumping lemma states that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; can be split into five substrings, &lt;math&gt;s = uvwxy&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;vx&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty and the length of &lt;math&gt;vwx&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, such that repeating &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the same number of times (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; produces a string that is still in the language.  It is often useful to repeat zero times, which removes &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the string. This process of "pumping up" additional copies of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is what gives the pumping lemma its name.

[[Finite language]]s (which are regular and hence context-free) obey the pumping lemma trivially by having &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equal to the maximum string length in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; plus one. As there are no strings of this length the pumping lemma is not violated.

== Usage of the lemma ==

The pumping lemma is often used to prove that a given language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is non-context-free, by showing that arbitrarily long strings &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that cannot be "pumped" without producing strings outside &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the language &lt;math&gt;L = \{ a^n b^n c^n | n &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be non-context-free by using the pumping lemma in a [[proof by contradiction]]. First, assume that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is context free. By the pumping lemma, there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; which is the pumping length of language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the string &lt;math&gt;s = a^p b^p c^p&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The pumping lemma tells us that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;s = uvwxy&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u, v, w, x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are substrings, such that &lt;math&gt;|vwx| \leq p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|vx| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;uv^i wx^i y \in L&lt;/math&gt; for every integer &lt;math&gt;i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. By the choice of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and the fact that &lt;math&gt;|vwx| \leq p&lt;/math&gt;, it is easily seen that the substring &lt;math&gt;vwx&lt;/math&gt; can contain no more than two distinct symbols. That is, we have one of five possibilities for &lt;math&gt;vwx&lt;/math&gt;:

# &lt;math&gt;vwx = a^j&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;j \leq p&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;vwx = a^j b^k&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j+k \leq p&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;vwx = b^j&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;j \leq p&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;vwx = b^j c^k&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j+k \leq p&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;vwx = c^j&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;j \leq p&lt;/math&gt;.

For each case, it is easily verified that &lt;math&gt;uv^i wx^i y&lt;/math&gt; does not contain equal numbers of each letter for any &lt;math&gt;i \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;uv^2 wx^2 y&lt;/math&gt; does not have the form &lt;math&gt;a^i b^i c^i&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts the definition of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, our initial assumption that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is context free must be false.

While the pumping lemma is often a useful tool to prove that a given language is not context-free, it does not give a complete characterization of the context-free languages. If a language does not satisfy the condition given by the pumping lemma,
we have established that it is not context-free.

On the other hand, there are languages that are not context-free, but still satisfy the condition given by the pumping lemma, for example
&lt;math&gt;L = \{ b^j c^k d^l | j, k, l \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt;
∪ { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''d''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''i'', ''j'' ∈ ℕ, ''i''≥1 }: for ''s''=''b''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''d''&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; with e.g. ''j''≥1 choose ''vwx'' to consist only of ''b''’s, for ''s''=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''d''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; choose ''vwx'' to consist only of ''a''’s; in both cases all pumped strings are still in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John E.

A precursor of the pumping lemma was used in 1960 by Scheinberg to prove that &lt;math&gt;L = \{ a^n b^n a^n | n &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; is not context-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82210847.pdf | author=Stephen Scheinberg | title=Note on the Boolean Properties of Context Free Languages | journal=Information and Control | volume=3 | number= | pages=372-375 | month= | year=1960 }} Here: Lemma 3, and its use on p.374-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recursion''' in [[computer science]] is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to [[Iteration#Computing|iteration]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Most computer [[programming language]]s support recursion by allowing a [[function (computer science)|function]] to call itself from within its own code. Some [[functional programming]] languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion to repeatedly call code. [[Computability theory]] proves that these recursive-only languages are [[turing completeness|Turing complete]]; they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they can solve the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures such as {{code|while}} and {{code|for}}.
{{toclimit|3}}

==Recursive functions and algorithms==
A common [[computer programming]] tactic is to divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original, solve those sub-problems, and combine the results. This is often referred to as the [[divide-and-conquer method]]; when combined with a [[lookup table]] that stores the results of solving sub-problems (to avoid solving them repeatedly and incurring extra computation time), it can be referred to as [[dynamic programming]] or [[memoization]].

A recursive function definition has one or more ''base cases'', meaning input(s) for which the function produces a result [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]]ly (without recurring), and one or more ''recursive cases'', meaning input(s) for which the program recurs (calls itself).  For example, the [[factorial]] function can be defined recursively by the equations {{math|1=0! = 1}} and, for all {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|1=''n''! = ''n''(''n'' − 1)!}}. Neither equation by itself constitutes a complete definition; the first is the base case, and the second is the recursive case. Because the base case breaks the chain of recursion, it is sometimes also called the "terminating case".

The job of the recursive cases can be seen as breaking down complex inputs into simpler ones.  In a properly designed recursive function, with each recursive call, the input problem must be simplified in such a way that eventually the base case must be reached.  (Functions that are not intended to terminate under normal circumstances—for example, some [[Daemon (computer software)|system and server processes]]—are an exception to this.)  Neglecting to write a base case, or testing for it incorrectly, can cause an [[infinite loop]].

For some functions (such as one that computes the [[series (mathematics)|series]] for {{math|1=''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...}}) there is not an obvious base case implied by the input data; for these one may add a [[parameter]] (such as the number of terms to be added, in our series example) to provide a 'stopping criterion' that establishes the base case. Such an example is more naturally treated by co-recursion, where successive terms in the output are the partial sums; this can be converted to a recursion by using the indexing parameter to say "compute the ''n''th term (''n''th partial sum)".

==Recursive data types==
Many [[computer program]]s must process or generate an arbitrarily large quantity of [[data]].  Recursion is one technique for representing data whose exact size the [[programmer]] does not know: the programmer can specify this data with a [[Self reference|self-referential]] definition.  There are two types of self-referential definitions: inductive and [[Coinduction|coinductive]] definitions.

{{further|Algebraic data type}}

===Inductively defined data===
{{main|Recursive data type}}

An inductively defined recursive data definition is one that specifies how to construct instances of the data.  For example, [[linked list]]s can be defined inductively (here, using [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] syntax):

:&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;data ListOfStrings = EmptyList | Cons String ListOfStrings&lt;/source&gt;

The code above specifies a list of strings to be either empty, or a structure that contains a string and a list of strings.  The self-reference in the definition permits the construction of lists of any (finite) number of strings.

Another example of inductive [[definition]] is the [[natural numbers]] (or positive [[integers]]):

:&lt;code&gt;A natural number is either 1 or n+1, where n is a natural number.&lt;/code&gt;

Similarly recursive [[definition]]s are often used to model the structure of [[expression (programming)|expressions]] and [[statement (programming)|statements]] in programming languages.  Language designers often express grammars in a syntax such as [[Backus–Naur form]]; here is such a grammar, for a simple language of arithmetic expressions with multiplication and addition:

&lt;source lang="bnf"&gt;
 &lt;expr&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt;
          | (&lt;expr&gt; * &lt;expr&gt;)
          | (&lt;expr&gt; + &lt;expr&gt;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This says that an expression is either a number, a product of two expressions, or a sum of two expressions.  By recursively referring to expressions in the second and third lines, the grammar permits arbitrarily complex arithmetic expressions such as &lt;code&gt;(5 * ((3 * 6) + 8))&lt;/code&gt;, with more than one product or sum operation in a single expression.

===Coinductively defined data and corecursion===
{{main|Coinduction|Corecursion}}
A coinductive data definition is one that specifies the operations that may be performed on a piece of data; typically, self-referential coinductive definitions are used for data structures of infinite size.

A coinductive definition of infinite [[stream (computer science)|streams]] of strings, given informally, might look like this:

 A stream of strings is an object s such that:
  head(s) is a string, and
  tail(s) is a stream of strings.

This is very similar to an inductive definition of lists of strings; the difference is that this definition specifies how to access the contents of the data structure—namely, via the [[accessor]] functions &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;—and what those contents may be, whereas the inductive definition specifies how to create the structure and what it may be created from.

[[Corecursion]] is related to coinduction, and can be used to compute particular instances of (possibly) infinite objects.  As a programming technique, it is used most often in the context of [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] programming languages, and can be preferable to recursion when the desired size or precision of a program's output is unknown.  In such cases the program requires both a definition for an infinitely large (or infinitely precise) result, and a mechanism for taking a finite portion of that result.  The problem of computing the first n [[prime numbers]] is one that can be solved with a corecursive program (e.g. [[Fold (higher-order function)#Examples|here]]).

==Types of recursion==

===Single recursion and multiple recursion===
Recursion that only contains a single self-reference is known as '''{{visible anchor|single recursion}}''', while recursion that contains multiple self-references is known as '''{{visible anchor|multiple recursion}}'''. Standard examples of single recursion include list traversal, such as in a linear search, or computing the factorial function, while standard examples of multiple recursion include [[tree traversal]], such as in a depth-first search.

Single recursion is often much more efficient than multiple recursion, and can generally be replaced by an iterative computation, running in linear time and requiring constant space. Multiple recursion, by contrast, may require exponential time and space, and is more fundamentally recursive, not being able to be replaced by iteration without an explicit stack.

Multiple recursion can sometimes be converted to single recursion (and, if desired, thence to iteration). For example, while computing the Fibonacci sequence naively is multiple iteration, as each value requires two previous values, it can be computed by single recursion by passing two successive values as parameters. This is more naturally framed as corecursion, building up from the initial values, tracking at each step two successive values – see [[Corecursion#Examples|corecursion: examples]]. A more sophisticated example is using a [[threaded binary tree]], which allows iterative tree traversal, rather than multiple recursion.

===Indirect recursion===
{{main|Mutual recursion}}

Most basic examples of recursion, and most of the examples presented here, demonstrate {{anchor|direct recursion}}'''''direct'' recursion''', in which a function calls itself.  ''Indirect'' recursion occurs when a function is called not by itself but by another function that it called (either directly or indirectly). For example, if ''f'' calls ''f,'' that is direct recursion, but if ''f'' calls ''g'' which calls ''f,'' then that is indirect recursion of ''f.'' Chains of three or more functions are possible; for example, function 1 calls function 2, function 2 calls function 3, and function 3 calls function 1 again.

Indirect recursion is also called [[mutual recursion]], which is a more symmetric term, though this is simply a difference of emphasis, not a different notion. That is, if ''f'' calls ''g'' and then ''g'' calls ''f,'' which in turn calls ''g'' again, from the point of view of ''f'' alone, ''f'' is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of ''g'' alone, it is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of both, ''f'' and ''g'' are mutually recursing on each other. Similarly a set of three or more functions that call each other can be called a set of mutually recursive functions.

===Anonymous recursion===
{{main|Anonymous recursion}}

Recursion is usually done by explicitly calling a function by name. However, recursion can also be done via implicitly calling a function based on the current context, which is particularly useful for [[anonymous function]]s, and is known as [[anonymous recursion]].

===Structural versus generative recursion===
{{see also|Structural recursion}}

Some authors classify recursion as either "structural" or "generative".  The distinction is related to where a recursive procedure gets the data that it works on, and how it processes that data:

{{quote|text=[Functions that consume structured data] typically decompose their arguments into their immediate structural components and then process those components. If one of the immediate components belongs to the same class of data as the input, the function is recursive. For that reason, we refer to these functions as (STRUCTURALLY) RECURSIVE  FUNCTIONS.|author=Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnaurthi|source=''[[How to Design Programs]]'', 2001&lt;ref name="Felleisen HtDP 2001"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the defining characteristic of a structurally recursive function is that the argument to each recursive call is the content of a field of the original input.  Structural recursion includes nearly all tree traversals, including XML processing, binary tree creation and search, etc. By considering the algebraic structure of the natural numbers (that is, a natural number is either zero or the successor of a natural number), functions such as factorial may also be regarded as structural recursion.

'''{{visible anchor|Generative recursion}}''' is the alternative:

{{quote|text=Many well-known recursive algorithms generate an entirely new piece of data from the given data and recur on it.  [[How to Design Programs|''HtDP'' (''How to Design Programs'')]] refers to this kind as generative recursion.  Examples of generative recursion include: [[Euclidean algorithm|gcd]], [[quicksort]], [[binary search]], [[mergesort]], [[Newton's method]], [[fractal]]s, and [[adaptive quadrature|adaptive integration]].|author=Matthias Felleisen|source=''Advanced Functional Programming'', 2002&lt;ref name="Felleisen 2002 108"&gt;{{Cite book

This distinction is important in [[Termination analysis#Termination proof|proving termination]] of a function. 
* All structurally recursive functions on finite ([[Recursive data type|inductively defined]]) data structures can easily be shown to terminate, via [[structural induction]]: intuitively, each recursive call receives a smaller piece of input data, until a base case is reached. 
* Generatively recursive functions, in contrast, do not necessarily feed smaller input to their recursive calls, so proof of their termination is not necessarily as simple, and avoiding [[infinite loops]] requires greater care. These generatively recursive functions can often be interpreted as corecursive functions – each step generates the new data, such as successive approximation in Newton's method – and terminating this corecursion requires that the data eventually satisfy some condition, which is not necessarily guaranteed.
* In terms of [[loop variant]]s, structural recursion is when there is an obvious loop variant, namely size or complexity, which starts off finite and decreases at each recursive step. 
* By contrast, generative recursion is when there is not such an obvious loop variant, and termination depends on a function, such as "error of approximation" that does not necessarily decrease to zero, and thus termination is not guaranteed without further analysis.

==Recursive programs==

===Recursive procedures===

====Factorial====
A classic example of a recursive procedure is the function used to calculate the [[factorial]] of a [[natural number]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{fact}(n) =
 \begin{cases}
 1 &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
 n \cdot \operatorname{fact}(n-1) &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Pseudocode]] (recursive):
|-
|
 '''function''' factorial is:&lt;br /&gt;
 '''input''': integer ''n'' such that ''n'' &gt;= 0&lt;br /&gt;
 '''output''': [''n'' × (''n''-1) × (''n''-2) × … × 1]
 &lt;br /&gt;
     1. if ''n'' is 0, '''return''' 1
     2. otherwise, '''return''' [ ''n'' × factorial(''n''-1) ]
 &lt;br /&gt;
 '''end''' factorial
|}

The function can also be written as a [[recurrence relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = nb_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
This evaluation of the recurrence relation demonstrates the computation that would be performed in evaluating the pseudocode above:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Computing the recurrence relation for n = 4:
|-
|
 b&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;           = 4 * b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
              = 4 * (3 * b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)))
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * 1)))
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * 1))
              = 4 * (3 * 2)
              = 4 * 6
              = 24
|}

This factorial function can also be described without using recursion by making use of the typical looping constructs found in imperative programming languages:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Pseudocode (iterative):
|-
|
 '''function''' factorial is:&lt;br /&gt;
 '''input''': integer ''n'' such that ''n'' &gt;= 0&lt;br /&gt;
 '''output''': [''n'' × (''n''-1) × (''n''-2) × … × 1]
 &lt;br /&gt;
     1. '''create''' new variable called ''running_total'' with a value of 1
 &lt;br /&gt;
     2. '''begin''' loop
           1. if ''n'' is 0, '''exit''' loop
           2. '''set''' ''running_total'' to (''running_total'' × ''n'')
           3. '''decrement''' ''n''
           4. '''repeat''' loop
 &lt;br /&gt;
     3. '''return''' ''running_total''
 &lt;br /&gt;
 '''end''' factorial
|}

The imperative code above is equivalent to this mathematical definition using an accumulator variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}}'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\operatorname{fact}(n) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{fact_{acc}}(n, 1) \\
\operatorname{fact_{acc}}(n, t) &amp; = &amp;
 \begin{cases}
 t &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
 \operatorname{fact_{acc}}(n-1, nt) &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The definition above translates straightforwardly to [[functional programming language]]s such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]; this is an example of iteration implemented recursively.

====Greatest common divisor====
The [[Euclidean algorithm]], which computes the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers, can be written recursively.

''
Function definition'':
:&lt;math&gt; \gcd(x,y) =
 \begin{cases}
 x &amp; \mbox{if } y = 0 \\
 \gcd(y, \operatorname{remainder}(x,y)) &amp; \mbox{if } y &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Pseudocode]] (recursive):
|-
|
 '''function''' gcd is:
 '''input''': integer ''x'', integer ''y'' such that ''x'' &gt; 0 and ''y'' &gt;= 0
 &lt;br /&gt;
     1. if ''y'' is 0, '''return''' ''x''
     2. otherwise, '''return''' [ gcd( ''y'', (remainder of ''x''/''y'') ) ]
 &lt;br /&gt;
 '''end''' gcd
|}

[[Recurrence relation]] for greatest common divisor, where &lt;math&gt;x \% y&lt;/math&gt; expresses the [[remainder]] of &lt;math&gt;x / y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(x,y) = \gcd(y, x \% y)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;y \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(x,0) = x&lt;/math&gt;

The recursive program above is [[tail-recursive]]; it is equivalent to an iterative algorithm, and the computation shown above shows the steps of evaluation that would be performed by a language that eliminates tail calls.  Below is a version of the same algorithm using explicit iteration, suitable for a language that does not eliminate tail calls.  By maintaining its state entirely in the variables ''x'' and ''y'' and using a looping construct, the program avoids making recursive calls and growing the call stack.

The iterative algorithm requires a temporary variable, and even given knowledge of the Euclidean algorithm it is more difficult to understand the process by simple inspection, although the two algorithms are very similar in their steps.

====Binary search====
The [[binary search]] algorithm is a method of searching a [[sorted array]] for a single element by cutting the array in half with each recursive pass.  The trick is to pick a midpoint near the center of the array, compare the data at that point with the data being searched and then responding to one of three possible conditions: the data is found at the midpoint, the data at the midpoint is greater than the data being searched for, or the data at the midpoint is less than the data being searched for.

Recursion is used in this algorithm because with each pass a new array is created by cutting the old one in half.  The binary search procedure is then called recursively, this time on the new (and smaller) array.  Typically the array's size is adjusted by manipulating a beginning and ending index.  The algorithm exhibits a logarithmic order of growth because it essentially divides the problem domain in half with each pass.

Example implementation of binary search in C:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
 /*
  Call binary_search with proper initial conditions.

  INPUT:
    data is an array of integers SORTED in ASCENDING order,
    toFind is the integer to search for,
    count is the total number of elements in the array

  OUTPUT:
    result of binary_search

 */
 int search(int *data, int toFind, int count)
 {
    //  Start = 0 (beginning index)
    //  End = count - 1 (top index)
    return binary_search(data, toFind, 0, count-1);
 }

 /*
   Binary Search Algorithm.

   INPUT:
        data is a array of integers SORTED in ASCENDING order,
        toFind is the integer to search for,
        start is the minimum array index,
        end is the maximum array index
   OUTPUT:
        position of the integer toFind within array data,
        -1 if not found
 */
 int binary_search(int *data, int toFind, int start, int end)
 {
    //Get the midpoint.
    int mid = start + (end - start)/2;   //Integer division

    //Stop condition.
    if (start &gt; end)
       return -1;
    else if (data[mid] == toFind)        //Found?
       return mid;
    else if (data[mid] &gt; toFind)         //Data is greater than toFind, search lower half
       return binary_search(data, toFind, start, mid-1);
    else                                 //Data is less than toFind, search upper half
       return binary_search(data, toFind, mid+1, end);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Recursive data structures (structural recursion)===
{{main|Recursive data type}}

An important application of recursion in computer science is in defining dynamic data structures such as [[list (abstract data type)|lists]] and [[tree (data structure)|trees]].  Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to a theoretically infinite size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, the size of a static array must be set at compile time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Recursive algorithms are particularly appropriate when the underlying problem or the data to be treated are defined in recursive terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Wirth
  | first = Niklaus
  | title = Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs
  | publisher = Prentice-Hall
  | year = 1976
  | page = 127
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The examples in this section illustrate what is known as "structural recursion".  This term refers to the fact that the recursive procedures are acting on data that is defined recursively.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As long as a programmer derives the template from a data definition, functions employ structural recursion. That is, the recursions in a function's body consume some immediate piece of a given compound value.&lt;ref name="Felleisen 2002 108"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Linked lists====
{{main|Linked list}}

Below is a C definition of a linked list node structure.  Notice especially how the node is defined in terms of itself.  The "next" element of ''struct node'' is a pointer to another ''struct node'', effectively creating a list type.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
struct node
{
  int data;           // some integer data
  struct node *next;  // pointer to another struct node
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Because the ''struct node'' data structure is defined recursively, procedures that operate on it can be implemented naturally as recursive procedures.  The ''list_print'' procedure defined below walks down the list until the list is empty (i.e., the list pointer has a value of NULL).  For each node it prints the data element (an integer).  In the C implementation, the list remains unchanged by the ''list_print'' procedure.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
void list_print(struct node *list)
{
    if (list != NULL)               // base case
    {
       printf ("%d ", list-&gt;data);  // print integer data followed by a space
       list_print (list-&gt;next);     // recursive call on the next node
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Binary trees====
{{main|Binary tree}}

Below is a simple definition for a binary tree node.  Like the node for linked lists, it is defined in terms of itself, recursively.  There are two self-referential pointers: left (pointing to the left sub-tree) and right (pointing to the right sub-tree).
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
struct node
{
  int data;            // some integer data
  struct node *left;   // pointer to the left subtree
  struct node *right;  // point to the right subtree
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Operations on the tree can be implemented using recursion.  Note that because there are two self-referencing pointers (left and right), tree operations may require two recursive calls:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Test if tree_node contains i; return 1 if so, 0 if not.
int tree_contains(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node == NULL)
        return 0;  // base case
    else if (tree_node-&gt;data == i)
        return 1;
    else
        return tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;left, i) || tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;right, i);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
At most two recursive calls will be made for any given call to ''tree_contains'' as defined above.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Inorder traversal:
void tree_print(struct node *tree_node) {
        if (tree_node != NULL) {                  // base case
                tree_print(tree_node-&gt;left);      // go left
                printf("%d ", tree_node-&gt;data);   // print the integer followed by a space
                tree_print(tree_node-&gt;right);     // go right
        }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example illustrates an [[Tree traversal|in-order traversal]] of the binary tree.  A [[Binary search tree]] is a special case of the binary tree where the data elements of each node are in order.

====Filesystem traversal====
Since the number of files in a [[filesystem]] may vary, [[recursion]] is the only practical way to traverse and thus enumerate its contents.  Traversing a filesystem is very similar to that of [[tree traversal]], therefore the concepts behind tree traversal are applicable to traversing a filesystem.  More specifically, the code below would be an example of a [[preorder traversal]] of a filesystem.

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
import java.io.*;

public class FileSystem {

	public static void main (String [] args) {
		traverse ();
	}

	/**
	 * Obtains the filesystem roots
	 * Proceeds with the recursive filesystem traversal
	 */
	private static void traverse () {
		File [] fs = File.listRoots ();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; fs.length; i++) {
			if (fs[i].isDirectory () &amp;&amp; fs[i].canRead ()) {
				rtraverse (fs[i]);
			}
		}
	}

	/**
	 * Recursively traverse a given directory
	 *
	 * @param fd indicates the starting point of traversal
	 */
	private static void rtraverse (File fd) {
		File [] fss = fd.listFiles ();

		for (int i = 0; i &lt; fss.length; i++) {
			System.out.println (fss[i]);
			if (fss[i].isDirectory () &amp;&amp; fss[i].canRead ()) {
				rtraverse (fss[i]);
			}
		}
	}

}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code blends the lines, at least somewhat, between recursion and [[iteration]].  It is, essentially, a recursive implementation, which is the best way to traverse a [[filesystem]].  It is also an example of direct and indirect recursion.  The method "rtraverse" is purely a direct example; the method "traverse" is the indirect, which calls "rtraverse".  This example needs no "base case" scenario due to the fact that there will always be some fixed number of files or directories in a given filesystem.

==Implementation issues==
In actual implementation, rather than a pure recursive function (single check for base case, otherwise recursive step), a number of modifications may be made, for purposes of clarity or efficiency. These include:

* Wrapper function (at top)
* Short-circuiting the base case, aka "Arm's-length recursion" (at bottom)
* Hybrid algorithm (at bottom) – switching to a different algorithm once data is small enough

On the basis of elegance, wrapper functions are generally approved, while short-circuiting the base case is frowned upon, particularly in academia. Hybrid algorithms are often used for efficiency, to reduce the overhead of recursion in small cases, and arm's-length recursion is a special case of this.

===Wrapper function===
A [[wrapper function]] is a function that is directly called but does not recurse itself, instead calling a separate auxiliary function which actually does the recursion.

Wrapper functions can be used to validate parameters (so the recursive function can skip these), perform initialization (allocate memory, initialize variables), particularly for auxiliary variables such as "level of recursion" or partial computations for [[memoization]], and handle exceptions and errors. In languages that support [[nested function]]s, the auxiliary function can be nested inside the wrapper function and use a shared scope. In the absence of nested functions, auxiliary functions are instead a separate function, if possible private (as they are not called directly), and information is shared with the wrapper function by using [[pass-by-reference]].

===Short-circuiting the base case===
{{anchor|Arm's-length recursion}}
Short-circuiting the base case, also known as '''arm's-length recursion''', consists of checking the base case ''before'' making a recursive call – i.e., checking if the next call will be the base case, instead of calling and then checking for the base case. Short-circuiting is particularly done for efficiency reasons, to avoid the overhead of a function call that immediately returns. Note that since the base case has already been checked for (immediately before the recursive step), it does not need to be checked for separately, but one does need to use a wrapper function for the case when the overall recursion starts with the base case itself. For example, in the factorial function, properly the base case is 0! = 1, while immediately returning 1 for 1! is a short-circuit, and may miss 0; this can be mitigated by a wrapper function.

Short-circuiting is primarily a concern when many base cases are encountered, such as Null pointers in a tree, which can be linear in the number of function calls, hence significant savings for {{math|''O''(''n'')}} algorithms; this is illustrated below for a depth-first search. Short-circuiting on a tree corresponds to considering a leaf (non-empty node with no children) as the base case, rather than considering an empty node as the base case. If there is only a single base case, such as in computing the factorial, short-circuiting provides only {{math|''O''(1)}} savings.

Conceptually, short-circuiting can be considered to either have the same base case and recursive step, only checking the base case before the recursion, or it can be considered to have a different base case (one step removed from standard base case) and a more complex recursive step, namely "check valid then recurse", as in considering leaf nodes rather than Null nodes as base cases in a tree. Because short-circuiting has a more complicated flow, compared with the clear separation of base case and recursive step in standard recursion, it is often considered poor style, particularly in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth-first search====
A basic example of short-circuiting is given in [[depth-first search]] (DFS) of a binary tree; see [[#Binary trees|binary trees]] section for standard recursive discussion.

The standard recursive algorithm for a DFS is:

* base case: If current node is Null, return false
* recursive step: otherwise, check value of current node, return true if match, otherwise recurse on children
In short-circuiting, this is instead:
* check value of current node, return true if match,
* otherwise, on children, if not Null, then recurse.

In terms of the standard steps, this moves the base case check ''before'' the recursive step. Alternatively, these can be considered a different form of base case and recursive step, respectively. Note that this requires a wrapper function to handle the case when the tree itself is empty (root node is Null).

In the case of a [[perfect binary tree]] of height ''h,'' there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;1 nodes and 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''+1&lt;/sup&gt; Null pointers as children (2 for each of the 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt; leaves), so short-circuiting cuts the number of function calls in half in the worst case.

In C, the standard recursive algorithm may be implemented as:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
bool tree_contains(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node == NULL)
        return false;  // base case
    else if (tree_node-&gt;data == i)
        return true;
    else
        return tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;left, i) ||
               tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;right, i);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The short-circuited algorithm may be implemented as:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Wrapper function to handle empty tree
bool tree_contains(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node == NULL)
        return false;  // empty tree
    else
        return tree_contains_do(tree_node, i);  // call auxiliary function
}

// Assumes tree_node != NULL
bool tree_contains_do(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node-&gt;data == i)
        return true;  // found
    else  // recurse
        return (tree_node-&gt;left  &amp;&amp; tree_contains_do(tree_node-&gt;left,  i)) ||
               (tree_node-&gt;right &amp;&amp; tree_contains_do(tree_node-&gt;right, i));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the use of [[short-circuit evaluation]] of the Boolean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (AND) operators, so that the recursive call is only made if the node is valid (non-Null). Note that while the first term in the AND is a pointer to a node, the second term is a bool, so the overall expression evaluates to a bool. This is a common idiom in recursive short-circuiting. This is in addition to the short-circuit evaluation of the Boolean || (OR) operator, to only check the right child if the left child fails. In fact, the entire [[control flow]] of these functions can be replaced with a single Boolean expression in a return statement, but legibility suffers at no benefit to efficiency.

===Hybrid algorithm===
Recursive algorithms are often inefficient for small data, due to the overhead of repeated function calls and returns. For this reason efficient implementations of recursive algorithms often start with the recursive algorithm, but then switch to a different algorithm when the input becomes small. An important example is [[merge sort]], which is often implemented by switching to the non-recursive [[insertion sort]] when the data is sufficiently small, as in the [[tiled merge sort]]. Hybrid recursive algorithms can often be further refined, as in [[Timsort]], derived from a hybrid merge sort/insertion sort.

==Recursion versus iteration==
Recursion and [[iteration]] are equally expressive: recursion can be replaced by iteration with an explicit [[call stack]], while iteration can be replaced with [[tail call|tail recursion]]. Which approach is preferable depends on the problem under consideration and the language used. In [[imperative programming]], iteration is preferred, particularly for simple recursion, as it avoids the overhead of function calls and call stack management, but recursion is generally used for multiple recursion. By contrast, in [[functional programming|functional languages]] recursion is preferred, with tail recursion optimization leading to little overhead. Implementing an algorithm using iteration may not be easily achievable.

Compare the templates to compute x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; defined by x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = f(n, x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;) from x&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;:
{|
|-
|   
 function recursive(n)
     if n==base
         return x&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;
     else
         return f(n, recursive(n-1)) 
||
 function iterative(n)
     x = x&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;
     for i = n downto base
         x = f(i, x)
     return x
|}

For imperative language the overhead is to define the function, for functional language the overhead is to define the accumulator variable x.

For example, a [[factorial]] function may be implemented iteratively in [[C (programming language)|C]] by assigning to an loop index variable and accumulator variable, rather than by passing arguments and returning values by recursion:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
  unsigned int product = 1; // empty product is 1
  while (n) {
    product *= n;
    --n;
  }
  return product;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Expressive power===
Most [[programming language]]s in use today allow the direct specification of recursive functions and procedures. When such a function is called, the program's [[runtime environment]] keeps track of the various [[Instance (computer science)|instance]]s of the function (often using a [[call stack]], although other methods may be used). Every recursive function can be transformed into an iterative function by replacing recursive calls with [[Control flow|iterative control constructs]] and simulating the call stack with a [[stack (data structure)|stack explicitly managed]] by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Python Algorithms: Mastering Basic Algorithms in the Python Language|first=Magnus Lie|last=Hetland|publisher=Apress|year=2010|isbn=9781430232384|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cytGpIPYsAC&amp;pg=PA79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Data Structures and Algorithms in C++|first=Adam|last=Drozdek|edition=4th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781285415017|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRgLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, all iterative functions and procedures that can be evaluated by a computer (see [[Turing completeness]]) can be expressed in terms of recursive functions; iterative control constructs such as [[while loop]]s and [[do loop]]s are routinely rewritten in recursive form in [[functional language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/loop.pdf |title=The Anatomy of a Loop - A story of scope and control |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |first=Olin |last=Shivers |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lambda the Ultimate |url=http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1014 |title=The Anatomy of a Loop |publisher=Lambda the Ultimate |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice this rewriting depends on [[tail call elimination]], which is not a feature of all languages. [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are notable mainstream languages in which all function calls, including [[tail call]]s, may cause stack allocation that would not occur with the use of looping constructs; in these languages, a working iterative program rewritten in recursive form may [[stack overflow|overflow the call stack]], although tail call elimination may be a feature that is not covered by a language's specification, and different implementations of the same language may differ in tail call elimination capabilities.

===Performance issues===
In languages (such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]) that favor iterative looping constructs, there is usually significant time and space cost associated with recursive programs, due to the overhead required to manage the stack and the relative slowness of function calls; in [[functional languages]], a function call (particularly a [[tail call]]) is typically a very fast operation, and the difference is usually less noticeable.

As a concrete example, the difference in performance between recursive and iterative implementations of the "factorial" example above depends highly on the [[compiler]] used. In languages where looping constructs are preferred, the iterative version may be as much as several [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] faster than the recursive one. In functional languages, the overall time difference of the two implementations may be negligible; in fact, the cost of multiplying the larger numbers first rather than the smaller numbers (which the iterative version given here happens to do) may overwhelm any time saved by choosing iteration.

===Stack space===
In some programming languages, the maximum size of the [[call stack]] is much less than the space available in the [[Heap (programming)|heap]], and recursive algorithms tend to require more stack space than iterative algorithms. Consequently, these languages sometimes place a limit on the depth of recursion to avoid [[stack buffer overflow|stack overflow]]s; [[python (programming language)|Python]] is one such language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/sys.html |title=27.1. sys — System-specific parameters and functions — Python v2.7.3 documentation |publisher=Docs.python.org |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the caveat below regarding the special case of [[tail recursion]].

===Vulnerability===
Because recursive algorithms can be subject to stack overflows, they may be vulnerable to [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] or [[malware|malicious]] input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk J| title=Matching Wildcards: An Empirical Way to Tame an Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2014| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-empirical-way-to-t/240169123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some malware specifically targets a program's call stack and takes advantage of the stack's inherently recursive nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mueller| first=Oliver| title=Anatomy of a Stack Smashing Attack and How GCC Prevents It| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2012| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/security/anatomy-of-a-stack-smashing-attack-and-h/240001832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the absence of malware, a stack overflow caused by unbounded recursion can be fatal to the program, and [[exception handling]] [[logic]] may not prevent the corresponding [[process (computing)|process]] from being [[process state#Terminated|terminated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=.NET Framework Class Library| title=StackOverflowException Class| publisher=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]| year=2018| url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.stackoverflowexception(v=vs.110).aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiply recursive problems===
Multiply recursive problems are inherently recursive, because of prior state they need to track. One example is [[tree traversal]] as in [[depth-first search]]; though both recursive and iterative methods are used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Depth First Search (DFS): Iterative and Recursive Implementation| publisher=Techie Delight| year=2018| url=http://www.techiedelight.com/depth-first-search/}}&lt;/ref&gt; they contrast with list traversal and linear search in a list, which is a singly recursive and thus naturally iterative method. Other examples include [[divide-and-conquer algorithm]]s such as [[Quicksort]], and functions such as the [[Ackermann function]]. All of these algorithms can be implemented iteratively with the help of an explicit [[stack (data structure)|stack]], but the programmer effort involved in managing the stack, and the complexity of the resulting program, arguably outweigh any advantages of the iterative solution.

===Refactoring recursion===
Recursive algorithms can be replaced with non-recursive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Mitrovic| first=Ivan| title=Replace Recursion with Iteration| publisher=[[ThoughtWorks]]| url=https://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceRecursionWithIteration.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One method for replacing recursive algorithms is to simulate them using [[memory management|heap memory]] in place of [[stack-based memory allocation|stack memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=La| first=Woong Gyu| title=How to replace recursive functions using stack and while-loop to avoid the stack-overflow| publisher=CodeProject| year=2015| url=https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/418776/How-to-replace-recursive-functions-using-stack-and}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative is to develop a replacement algorithm entirely based on non-recursive methods, which can be challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Moertel| first=Tom| title=Tricks of the trade: Recursion to Iteration, Part 2: Eliminating Recursion with the Time-Traveling Secret Feature Trick| year=2013| url=http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-05-14-recursive-to-iterative-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recursive algorithms for [[matching wildcards]], such as [[Rich Salz]]' [[wildmat]] algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Salz| first=Rich| title=wildmat.c| publisher=[[GitHub]]| year=1991| url=https://github.com/trevor/transmission/blob/master/libtransmission/wildmat.c}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once typical. Non-recursive algorithms for the same purpose, such as the [[Krauss matching wildcards algorithm]], have been developed to avoid the drawbacks of recursion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk J| title=Matching Wildcards: An Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2008| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-algorithm/210200888}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have improved only gradually based on techniques such as collecting [[software testing|tests]] and [[profiling (computer programming)|profiling]] performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Krauss| first=Kirk J| title=Matching Wildcards: An Improved Algorithm for Big Data| publisher=Develop for Performance| year=2018| url=http://www.developforperformance.com/MatchingWildcards_AnImprovedAlgorithmForBigData.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tail-recursive functions==
Tail-recursive functions are functions in which all recursive calls are [[tail call]]s and hence do not build up any deferred operations. For example, the gcd function (shown again below) is tail-recursive.  In contrast, the factorial function (also below) is '''not''' tail-recursive; because its recursive call is not in tail position, it builds up deferred multiplication operations that must be performed after the final recursive call completes.  With a [[compiler]] or [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] that treats tail-recursive calls as [[goto|jumps]] rather than function calls, a tail-recursive function such as gcd will execute using constant space.  Thus the program is essentially iterative, equivalent to using imperative language control structures like the "for" and "while" loops.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Tail recursion]]:
! Augmenting recursion:
|-
|&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
//INPUT: Integers x, y such that x &gt;= y and y &gt; 0
int gcd(int x, int y)
{
  if (y == 0)
     return x;
  else
     return gcd(y, x % y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
//INPUT: n is an Integer such that n &gt;= 0
int fact(int n)
{
   if (n == 0)
      return 1;
   else
      return n * fact(n - 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The significance of tail recursion is that when making a tail-recursive call (or any tail call), the caller's return position need not be saved on the [[call stack]]; when the recursive call returns, it will branch directly on the previously saved return position. Therefore, in languages that recognize this property of tail calls, tail recursion saves both space and time.

==Order of execution==
In the simple case of a function calling itself only once, instructions placed before the recursive call are executed once per recursion before any of the instructions placed after the recursive call. The latter are executed repeatedly after the maximum recursion has been reached. Consider this example:

===Function 1===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void recursiveFunction(int num) {
   printf("%d\n", num);
   if (num &lt; 4)
      recursiveFunction(num + 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Recursive1.svg|350px]]

===Function 2 with swapped lines===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void recursiveFunction(int num) {
   if (num &lt; 4)
      recursiveFunction(num + 1);
   printf("%d\n", num);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Recursive2.svg|350px]]

==Time-efficiency of recursive algorithms==
The [[time complexity|time efficiency]] of recursive algorithms can be expressed in a [[recurrence relation]] of [[Big O notation]].  They can (usually) then be simplified into a single Big-O term.

===Shortcut rule (master theorem)===
{{Main|Master theorem (analysis of algorithms)}}
If the time-complexity of the function is in the form

&lt;Math&gt;T(n) = a \cdot T(n / b) + f(n)&lt;/Math&gt;

Then the Big O of the time-complexity is thus:

* If &lt;Math&gt;f(n) = O(n ^ { \log_b a - \epsilon})&lt;/Math&gt; for some constant &lt;Math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/Math&gt;, then &lt;Math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(n ^ {\log_b a})&lt;/Math&gt;
* If &lt;Math&gt;f(n) = \Theta(n ^ { \log_b a })&lt;/Math&gt;, then &lt;Math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(n ^ { \log_b a} \log n)&lt;/Math&gt;
* If &lt;Math&gt;f(n) = \Omega(n ^ { \log_b a + \epsilon})&lt;/Math&gt; for some constant &lt;Math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/Math&gt;, and if &lt;Math&gt;a \cdot f(n / b) \leq c \cdot f(n)&lt;/Math&gt; for some constant {{mvar|c}} &amp;lt; 1 and all sufficiently large {{mvar|n}}, then &lt;Math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(f(n))&lt;/Math&gt;

where {{mvar|a}} represents the number of recursive calls at each level of recursion, {{mvar|b}} represents by what factor smaller the input is for the next level of recursion (i.e. the number of pieces you divide the problem into), and {{math|''f''&amp;thinsp;(''n'')}} represents the work the function does independent of any recursion (e.g. partitioning, recombining) at each level of recursion.

A '''remote radio head''' (RRH), also called a '''remote radio unit''' (RRU) in wireless networks, is a remote radio transceiver that connects to an operator radio control panel via electrical or wireless interface. When used to describe aircraft radio cockpit radio systems, the control panel is often called the '''radio head'''.

In wireless system technologies such as [[GSM]], [[CDMA]], [[UMTS]], [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] the radio equipment is remote to the [[Base transceiver station|BTS]]/NodeB/eNodeB. The equipment is used to extend the coverage of a BTS/NodeB/eNodeB  in challenging environments such as rural areas or tunnels. They are generally connected to the BTS/NodeB/eNodeB via a fiber optic cable using [[Common Public Radio Interface]] protocols.

[[File:CableFree LTE Remote Radio Head (RRH).jpg|thumb|right|CableFree LTE Remote Radio Head (RRH) with 2x2 MIMO 2x20W RF Transmit Power and CPRI Interfaces]]
RRHs have become one of the most important subsystems of today's new distributed base stations. The RRH contains the base station's RF circuitry plus analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters and up/down converters. RRHs also have operation and management processing capabilities and a standardized optical interface to connect to the rest of the base station. This will be increasingly true as LTE and [[WiMAX]] are deployed. Remote radio heads make [[MIMO]] operation easier; they increase a base station's efficiency and facilitate easier physical location for gap coverage problems. RRHs will use the latest RF component technology including [[Gallium nitride]] (GaN) [[radio frequency|RF]] power devices and envelope tracking technology within the RRH RF power amplifier (RFPA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abiresearch.com/research/product/1008995-remote-radio-heads/&lt;/ref&gt;

==RRH protection in fiber to the antenna systems==

Fourth-generation (4G) and beyond infrastructure deployments will include the implementation of Fiber to the Antenna (FTTA) architecture. FTTA architecture has enabled lower power requirements, distributed antenna sites, and a reduced base station footprint than conventional tower sites. The use of FTTA will promote the separation of power and signal components from the base station and their relocation to the top of the tower mast in a Remote Radio Head (RRH).

According to the [[Telcordia]] industry standard that establishes generic requirements for Fiber to the Antenna (FTTA) protection [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3177&amp; GR-3177],&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3177&amp; GR-3177, Generic Requirements for Remote Radio Head Protection Used in Fiber to the Antenna (FTTA) Systems,''] Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt; the RRH shifts the entire high-frequency and power electronic segments from the base station to a location adjacent to the antenna. The RRH will be served by optical fiber and DC power for the optical-to-electronic conversion at the RRH.

RRHs located on cell towers will require Surge Protective Devices (SPDs) to protect the system from lightning strikes and induced power surges. There is also a change in electrical overstress exposure due to the relocation of the equipment from the base station to the top of the mast.

===Protection from lightning damage===

RRHs can be installed in a low-profile arrangement along a rooftop, or can involve a much higher tower arrangement. When installed at the highest point on a structure (whether a building or a dedicated cell tower), they will be more vulnerable to receiving a direct lightning strike and higher induced lightning levels, compared with those installed in a lower profile manner below the upper edges of the building.

As noted in GR-3177, while surges can be induced into the RRH wiring for lightning striking the nearby rooftop or even the base station closure, the worst case will occur when a direct strike occurs to the antenna or its supporting structure. Designing the electrical protection to handle this situation will provide protection for less damaging scenarios...
it can also be use in optical fiber communication but different type.

'''Sight words''', often also called high frequency sight words, are commonly used words that young children are encouraged to memorize as a whole by sight, so that they can automatically recognize these words in print within three seconds without having to use any strategies to decode.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.weareteachers.com/what-are-sight-words/|title=What Are Sight Words?|date=2018-04-25|work=WeAreTeachers|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sight words don’t follow the standards rules of phonics or the six syllable types. The term sight words is often confused with '''sight vocabulary''', which is defined as each person's own vocabulary that the person recognizes from memory without the need to decode for understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, S. (1999-09-29). [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-09-29/features/9909290393_1_word-labels-word-every-time-child Recognizing words on sight; activity].

(2007). ''EdSpeak: A Glossary of Education Terms, Phrases, Buzzwords, and Jargon''. Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision &amp; Curriculum Development, {{ISBN|1416605754}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sight words account for a large percentage (up to 75%) of the words used in beginning children's print materials.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kear, D. J., &amp;  Gladhart, M. A. |doi=10.2466/pms.1983.57.3.807 |title=Comparative Study to Identify High-Frequency Words in Printed Materials |year=1983 |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=807}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage for children being able to recognize sight words automatically is that a beginning reader will be able to identify the majority of words in a beginning text before they even attempt to read it; therefore, allowing the child to concentrate on meaning and comprehension as they read without having to stop and decode every single word.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; Advocates of whole-word instruction believe that being able to recognize a large number of sight words gives students a better start to learning to read.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Recognizing sight words automatically is said to be advantageous for beginning readers because many of these words have unusual spelling patterns, cannot be sounded out using basic phonics knowledge and cannot be represented using pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Phonological Ability |url=http://dx.doi.org.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/10.4135/9781483340333.n296 |work=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Contemporary Early Childhood Education |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |doi=10.4135/9781483340333.n296 |isbn=9781483340357 |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word "was" does not follow a usual spelling pattern, as the middle letter "a" makes an {{IPA|/ɒ~ʌ/}} sound and the final letter "s" makes a {{IPA|/z/}} sound, nor can the word be associated with a picture clue since it denotes an abstract state (existence). Another example, is the word “said”,it breaks the phonetic rule of ai normally makes the long a sound, ay. In this word it makes the short e sound of eh. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thephonicspage.org/On%20Reading/sightwords.html|title=Sight Words|website=www.thephonicspage.org|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;The word "said" is pronounced as /s/ /e/ /d/. The word “has” also breaks the phonetic rule of s normally making the sss sound, in this word the s makes the z sound, /z/." The word is then pronounced /h/ /a/ /z/.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A number of sight word lists have been compiled and published; among the most popular are the [[Dolch word list|Dolch sight words]] and the magic 100 words.  These lists have similar attributes, as they all aim to divide words into levels which are prioritized and introduced to children according to frequency of appearance in beginning readers' texts.  Although many of the lists have overlapping content, the order of frequency of sight words varies and can be argued depending on contexts such as geographical location, empirical data, samples used, and year of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Otto, W.  |author2=Chester, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1972 |title= Sight words for beginning readers |journal= The Journal of Educational Research |pages= 435–443 |volume=65 |issue=10 |jstor=/27536333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research shows that the use of sight words does not relate to phonological awareness. The [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|dual route theory]] states that the use of sight words as a reading strategy involves out-of-context memorization rather than the development of phonological skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reading Acquisition |last=Ehri |first=Linnea C. |publisher=Routledge |year=2017 |isbn=9781351236898 |location=London |pages=107-143 |chapter=Reconceptualizing the Development of Sight Word Reading and Its Relationship to Recoding}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is suggested that children first learn to identify individual letter-sound correspondences before blending and segmenting letter combinations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/590631697|title=Literacy teaching guide : phonics.|date=2009|publisher=New South Wales Dept. of Education and Training|others=New South Wales. Department of Education and Training.|isbn=9780731386093|location=[Sydney, N.S.W.]|oclc=590631697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exponents of [[synthetic phonics]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/opinion/item/10752-why-johnny-still-cant-read&lt;/ref&gt; argue that children must first learn the alphabet, then the sounds represented by the letters, then the blends of those sounds, and that children should never memorize words as visual designs.

| 1939-1944|| || Proposal || Troyanskii approaches the Academy of Sciences in Russia with his proposal for machine translation, seeking to work with linguists. Discussions continue till 1944, but not much comes out of it.&lt;ref name=troyanskii/&gt;
|-
| 1949 || July || Proposal || [[Warren Weaver]], working for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in the United States, puts forward a proposal for machine translation based on [[information theory]], successes of [[cryptography|code breaking]] during the [[World War II|second world war]] and speculation about universal underlying principles of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/WJHutchins/Weaver49.htm|title=Weaver memorandum|date=March 1949|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005232830/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/WJHutchins/Weaver49.htm|archivedate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| 1954 || January 7 || Demonstration || The [[Georgetown-IBM experiment]], held at the IBM head office in [[New York City]] in the United States, offers the first public demonstration of machine translation. The system itself, however, is no more than what today would be called a "toy" system, having just 250 words and translating just 49 carefully selected Russian sentences into English — mainly in the field of [[chemistry]]. Nevertheless, it encourages the view that machine translation was imminent — and in particular stimulates the financing of the research, not just in the US but worldwide.&lt;ref name=nutshell&gt;{{cite web|author=Hutchins, J.|year=2005|url=http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/Nutshell-2005.pdf|title=The history of machine translation in a nutshell}}{{self-published source|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| 1958-1960 || || Report || In 1958, linguist [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]] travels around the world visiting machine translation centers to better understand the work they were doing. In 1959, he writes up a report (intended primarily for the US government) pointing out some key difficulties with machine translation that he believed might doom the efforts then underway. An expanded version of the report is published in 1960 in the annual review journal ''Advances in Computers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/Bar-Hillel-2000.pdf|title = Yehoshua Bar-Hillel: A Philosopher's Contribution to Machine Translation|last = Hutchins|first = John|year = 2000|accessdate = February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that existing methods offered no way of resolving [[semantic ambiguity|semantic ambiguities]] whose resolution required having an understanding of the terms being used, such as the ambiguity arising from a single word having multiple meanings.
|-
| 1966 || || Report || [[ALPAC]] publishes a report commissioned by the United States government. The report concludes that machine translation is more expensive, less accurate and slower than human translation, and that despite the expenses, machine translation is not likely to reach the quality of a human translator in the near future. It recommends that tools be developed to aid translators — automatic dictionaries, for example — and that some research in computational linguistics should continue to be supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9547|title = Languages and Machines: Computers in Translation and Linguistics|publisher = [[ALPAC]]|year = 1966|accessdate = February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/ALPAC-1996.pdf|title = ALPAC: the (in)famous report|last = Hutchins|first = John|year = 1996|accessdate = February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report causes a significant decline in government funding for machine translation in the US, and to a lesser extent in the UK and Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17803">'''Verificationism''', also known as the verification idea or the '''verifiability criterion of meaning''', is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] doctrine that only statements that are [[empiricism|empirically]] verifiable (i.e. verifiable through the [[sense]]s) are cognitively meaningful, or else they are truths of logic ([[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]).

Verificationism thus rejects as cognitively "meaningless" statements specific to entire fields such as [[metaphysics]], [[spirituality]], [[theology]], [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Such statements may be meaningful in influencing emotions or behavior, but not in terms of [[truth value]], information or factual content.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626091/verifiability-principle "Verifiability principle"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Website accessed 12 Mar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Verificationism was a central thesis of [[logical positivism]], a movement in [[analytic philosophy]] that emerged in the 1920s by the efforts of a group of philosophers who sought to unify philosophy and science under a common [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]].

==Origins==
Although verificationist principles of a general sort—grounding scientific theory in some verifiable [[empiricism|experience]]—are found retrospectively even with the American [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] and with the French [[conventionalism|conventionalist]] [[Pierre Duhem]]&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt; who fostered [[instrumentalism]],&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;Miran Epstein, ch 2 "Introduction to philosophy of science", in Clive Seale, ed, ''Researching Society and Culture'', 3rd edn (London: Sage Publications, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uhBCvNlypL4C&amp;pg=PA18 pp 18–19].&lt;/ref&gt; the vigorous program termed ''verificationism'' was launched by the [[logical positivists]] who, emerging from [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and [[Vienna Circle]] in the 1920s, sought [[epistemology]] whereby philosophical discourse would be, in their perception, as authoritative and meaningful as [[empirical science]].

Logical positivists garnered the verifiability criterion of cognitive meaningfulness from young [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s [[philosophy of language]] posed in his 1921 book ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'',&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt; and, led by [[Bertrand Russell]], sought to [[analytic–synthetic distinction|reformulate the analytic–synthetic distinction]] in a way that would reduce mathematics and logic to [[semantics|semantical]] conventions. This would be pivotal to verificationism, in that logic and mathematics would otherwise be classified as [[synthetic a priori]] knowledge and defined as "meaningless" under verificationism.

Seeking grounding in such [[empiricism]] as of [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;Despite Hume's radical empiricism, set forth near 1740, Hume was also committed to [[common sense]], and apparently did not take his own skepticism, such as the [[problem of induction]], as drastically as others later did [Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156 "Hume"], p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auguste Comte]], and [[Ernst Mach]]—along with the [[positivism]] of the latter two—they borrowed some perspectives from [[Immanuel Kant]], and found the exemplar of science to be [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

==Revisions&lt;!--'Confirmationism' redirects here--&gt;==
Logical positivists within the [[Vienna Circle]] quickly recognized that the verifiability criterion was too stringent. Notably, all [[universal generalization]]s are empirically unverifiable, such that, under verificationism, vast domains of science and reason, such as scientific [[hypothesis]], would be rendered meaningless.&lt;ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer&gt;Sahotra Sarkar and Jessica Pfeifer, eds, ''The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1: A–M (New York: Routledge, 2006), "Rudolf Carnap", [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA83 p 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Philipp Frank]] led a faction seeking to make the verifiability criterion more inclusive, beginning a movement they referred to as the "liberalization of empiricism". [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]] led a "conservative wing" that maintained a strict verificationism. Whereas Schlick sought to reduce universal generalizations to frameworks of 'rules' from which verifiable statements can be derived,&lt;ref name=Schlick&gt;Moritz Schlick, 1931, "Die Kausalität in der gegenwärtigen Physik", ''Die Naturwissen-schaften'', 19: 145–162; transl. "Causality in Contemporary Physics" in Schlick 1979b, pp. 176–209&lt;/ref&gt; Hahn argued that the verifiability criterion should accede to less-than-conclusive verifiability.&lt;ref name=Hahn&gt;Hahn, Hans, 1933, Logik, Mathematik und Naturerkennen, Wien: Gerold, transl. "Logic, Mathematics, and Knowledge of Nature", in B. McGuiness 1987, pp. 24–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other ideas espoused by the liberalization movement were [[physicalism]], over [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]], [[coherentism]] over [[foundationalism]], as well as [[pragmatism]] and [[fallibilism]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flew-Neurath&gt;Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA245 "Neurath"], p 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Carnap sought a switch from verification to ''confirmation''.&lt;ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer/&gt; Carnap's confirmability criterion ('''confirmationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) would not require conclusive verification (thus accommodating for universal generalizations) but allow for partial testability to establish "degrees of confirmation" on a probabilistic basis. Carnap never succeeded in formalizing his thesis despite employing abundant logical and mathematical tools for this purpose. In all of Carnap's formulations, a universal law's degree of confirmation is zero.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap&gt;Mauro Murzi [http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap "Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970)"], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 12 Apr 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year saw the publication of [[A. J. Ayer]]'s work, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', in which he proposed two types of verification: ''strong'' and ''weak''. This system espoused conclusive verification, yet accommodated for probabilistic inclusion where verifiability is inconclusive. Ayer also distinguished between practical and theoretical verifiability. Under the latter, propositions that cannot be verified in practice would still be meaningful if they can be verified in principle.

[[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' proposed [[falsificationism]] as a criterion under which scientific hypothesis would be tenable. Falsificationism would allow hypotheses expressed as universal generalizations, such as "all swans are white", to be provisionally true until falsified by evidence, in contrast to verificationism under which they would be disqualified immediately as meaningless.

Though widely recognized as a revision of verificationism,&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hacohen/&gt; Popper intended falsificationism as a methodological standard specific to the sciences rather than as a theory of meaning.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Karl Popper, ch 4, subch "Science: Conjectures and refutations", in Andrew Bailey, ed, ''First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy'', 2nd edn (Peterborough Ontario: [[Broadview Press]], 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ngXNqiH_cDQC&amp;pg=PA338 pp 338–42].&lt;/ref&gt; Popper regarded scientific hypotheses to be unverifiable, as well as not "confirmable" under [[Rudolph Carnap|Carnap]]'s thesis.&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Godfrey-Smith&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith, ''Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=k23egtSWrb8C&amp;pg=PA57 p 57–59].&lt;/ref&gt; He also found unscientific, metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic statements often rich in meaning and important in the origination of scientific theories.&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falsificationism is simply Popper's ''scientific'' epistemology, whereas [[critical rationalism]] is Popper's ''general'' [[epistemology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
The 1951 article "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], attacked the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic division]] and apparently rendered the verificationist program untenable. [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], one of verificationism's greatest internal critics, had recently concluded the same as to the verifiability criterion.&lt;ref name=Fetzer&gt;James Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2013): "However surprising it may initially seem, contemporary developments in the [[philosophy of science]] can only be properly appreciated in relation to the historical background of [[logical positivism]]. [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] himself attained a certain degree of prominence as a critic of this movement.  ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' (1936; 2nd edition, 1946), authored by [[A. J. Ayer|A J Ayer]], offers a lucid exposition of the movement, which was—with certain variations—based upon the analytic/synthetic distinction, the observational/theoretical distinction, and the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hempel (1950, 1951), meanwhile, demonstrated that the verifiability criterion could not be sustained.  Since it restricts empirical knowledge to observation sentences and their deductive consequences, scientific theories are reduced to logical constructions from observables.  In a series of studies about cognitive significance and empirical testability, he demonstrated that the verifiability criterion implies that existential generalizations are meaningful, but that universal generalizations are not, even though they include general laws, the principal objects of scientific discovery. Hypotheses about relative frequencies in finite sequences are meaningful, but hypotheses concerning limits in infinite sequences are not.  The verifiability criterion thus imposed a standard that was too strong to accommodate the characteristic claims of science and was not justifiable".&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]] explained that even direct observations must be collected, sorted, and reported with guidance and constraint by theory, which sets a horizon of expectation and interpretation, how observational reports, never neutral, are [[theory-laden|laden with theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Caldwell, ''Beyond Positivism: Economic Methodology in the 20th Century'', rev edn (London: [[Routledge]], 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrqLZsCOg4sC&amp;pg=PA47 p 47–48].&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was also recognized as being [[self-refuting]]: it cannot itself be empirically verified, and it is not a logical tautology, so must be meaningless under its own terms.

[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s landmark book of 1962, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''—which identified ''[[normal science|paradigms of science]]'' overturned by [[revolutionary science]] within [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—critically destabilized confidence in scientific [[foundationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Samir Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly if erroneously attributed to verificationism.&lt;ref&gt;"But for a brief lapse around 1929/30, then, the post-''[[The Logical Structure of the World|Aufbau]]'' [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] fully represents the position of [[Vienna Circle]] anti-foundationalism. In this he joined [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]] whose long-standing anti-foundationalism is evident from his famous simile likening scientists to sailors who have to repair their [[Neurath's boat|boat]] without ever being able to pull into dry dock (1932b). Their positions contrasted at least ''[[prima facie]]'' with that of [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]] (1934) who explicitly defended the idea of foundations in the Circle's protocol-sentence debate. Even Schlick conceded, however, that all scientific statements were [[fallibilism|fallible]] ones, so his position on [[foundationalism]] was by no means the traditional one. The point of his 'foundations' remained less than wholly clear and different interpretation of it have been put forward. ... While all in the [[Vienna Circle|Circle]] thus recognized as futile the attempt to restore certainty to scientific knowledge claims, not all members embraced positions that rejected foundationalism ''[[tout court]]''. Clearly, however, attributing [[foundationalist]] ambitions to the Circle as a whole constitutes a total misunderstanding of its internal dynamics and historical development, if it does not bespeak wilfull ignorance. At most, a foundationalist faction around Schlick can be distinguished from the so-called left wing whose members pioneered anti-foundationalism with regard to both the empirical and [[formal science]]s" [[Thomas Uebel]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"], sec "3.3 Reductionism and foundationalism: Two criticisms partly rebutted", in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Summer 2012 edn).&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper, who had long claimed to have killed verificationism but recognized that some would confuse his falsificationism for more of it,&lt;ref name=Hacohen&gt;Malachi Haim Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years, 1902–1945: Politics and Philosophy in Interwar Vienna'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212 pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt; was [[knighted]] in 1965.  In 1967, [[John Passmore]], a leading historian of 20th-century philosophy, wrote, "Logical positivism is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes"—a general view among philosophers.&lt;ref name=Hanfling&gt;Oswald Hanfling, ch 5 "Logical positivism", in Stuart G Shanker, ''Philosophy of Science, Logic and Mathematics in the Twentieth Century'' (London: [[Routledge]], 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jIzT7AT3ILIC&amp;pg=PA193 pp 193–94].&lt;/ref&gt;  Logical positivism's fall heralded [[postpositivism]], where Popper's view of human knowledge as hypothetical, continually growing, and open to change ascended,&lt;ref name=Hacohen/&gt; and verificationism became mostly maligned.&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Karl Popper]] has been the only philosopher of science often praised by scientists,&lt;ref name=Godfrey-Smith/&gt; whereas [[logical positivists|verificationists]] have been likened to economists of the 19th century who took circuitous, protracted measures to refuse falsification, that is, refutation, of their preconceived principles.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Blaug ''The Methodology of Economics: Or, How Economists Explain'', 2nd edn (Cambridge UK: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1992), ch 3 "The verificationists, a largely nineteenth-century story", [https://books.google.com/books?id=T4y7HyduGnIC&amp;pg=PA51 p 51].&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, logical positivists practiced Popper's principles—conjecturing and refuting—until they ran their course, catapulting Popper, initially a contentious misfit, to carry the richest philosophy out of [[interwar]] Vienna.&lt;ref name=Hacohen/&gt;  And his [[falsificationism]], as did verificationism, poses a criterion, ''falsifiability'', to ensure that empiricism anchors scientific theory.&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt;

In a 1979 interview, [[A. J. Ayer|A J Ayer]], who had introduced logical positivism to the [[English-speaking world]] in the 1930s, was asked what he saw as its main defects, and answered that "nearly all of it was false".&lt;ref name=Hanfling/&gt;  Still, he soon admitted still holding "the same general approach".&lt;ref name=Hanfling/&gt;  The "general approach" of empiricism and [[reductionism]]—whereby mental phenomena resolve to the material or physical, and philosophical questions largely resolve to ones of language and meaning—has run through Western philosophy since the 17th century and lived beyond logical positivism's fall.&lt;ref name=Hanfling/&gt;

In 1977, Ayer had noted, "The verification principle is seldom mentioned and when it is mentioned it is usually scorned; it continues, however, to be put to work.  The attitude of many philosophers reminds me of the relationship between Pip and Magwitch in [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations]]''.  They have lived on the money, but are ashamed to acknowledge its source".&lt;ref name=Misak/&gt;  In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the general concept of verification criteria—in forms that differed from those of the logical positivists—was defended by [[Bas van Fraassen]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[Crispin Wright]], [[Christopher Peacocke]], [[David Wiggins]], [[Richard Rorty]], and others.&lt;ref name=Misak&gt;C J Misak, ''Verificationism: Its History and Prospects'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EObr91F6rJ8C&amp;pg=PR8 p viii].&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a more modern term for this is '''radiotelegraphy'''.  Due to its simplicity, radiotelegraphy was the first means of [[radio communication]]; the first practical radio [[transmitter]]s and [[radio receiver|receivers]] invented in 1894-5 by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] used radiotelegraphy.  It continued to be the only type of radio transmission during the first three decades of radio, called the "wireless telegraphy era" up until [[World War 1|World War I]], when the development of [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) [[radiotelephony]] allowed sound ([[audio signal|audio]]) to be transmitted by radio.  In radiotelegraphy, information is transmitted by pulses of radio waves of two different lengths called "dots" and "dashes", which spell out text messages, usually in [[Morse code]].  In a manual system, the sending operator taps on a [[switch]] called a [[telegraph key]] which turns the transmitter on and off, producing the pulses of radio waves.  At the receiver the pulses are audible in the receiver's speaker as beeps, which are translated back to text by an operator who knows Morse code.   

Before about 1910 when radio became dominant, the term ''wireless telegraphy'' was also used for various other experimental technologies for transmitting telegraph signals without wires, such as [[electromagnetic induction]], and ground conduction telegraph systems.&lt;ref name="Maver"&gt;{{cite book

Radiotelegraphy was used for long distance person-to-person commercial, diplomatic, and military text communication throughout the first half of the 20th century.  It became a strategically important capability during the two [[world war]]s, since a nation without long distance radiotelegraph stations could be isolated from the rest of the world by an enemy cutting its [[submarine telegraph cable]]s.  Beginning about 1908, powerful transoceanic radiotelegraphy stations transmitted commercial [[telegram]] traffic between countries at rates up to 200 words per minute.   Radiotelegraphy was transmitted by several different [[modulation]] methods during its history.  The primitive [[spark gap transmitter]]s used until 1920 transmitted [[damped wave]]s, which had very large [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and tended to interfere with other transmissions. This type of emission was banned by 1930.  The [[vacuum tube]] (valve) transmitters which came into use after 1920 transmitted code by pulses of unmodulated [[sinusoidal]] [[carrier wave]] called [[continuous wave]]s (CW), which is still used today.  To make CW transmissions audible, the receiver requires a circuit called a [[beat frequency oscillator]] (BFO).   A third type of modulation, [[frequency shift keying]] (FSK) was used mainly by [[radioteletype]]s. Morse code radiotelegraphy was gradually replaced by [[radioteletype]] networks (RTTY) in most high volume applications by [[World War 2]].  Today it is nearly obsolete, the only remaining users are the [[radio amateur]] community and some limited training by the military for emergency use.

==Overview==
[[File:NW7US at the Morse-code Key.jpg|thumb| Amateur radio operator transmitting Morse code]]

Wireless telegraphy or radiotelegraphy, commonly called CW (continuous wave) transmission, is a [[radio communication]] method in which the sending operator taps on a [[switch]] called a [[telegraph key]], which turns the radio transmitter on and off, producing pulses of unmodulated [[carrier wave]] of different lengths called "dots" and "dashes", which encode characters of text, usually in [[Morse code]].   At the receiving location the code is audible in the [[radio receiver]]'s earphone or speaker as a sequence of buzzes or beeps, which is translated back to text by an operator who knows Morse code. 

Although this type of communication has been mostly replaced since its introduction over 100 years ago by other means of communication it is still used by [[amateur radio]] operators as well as some military services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swling.com/blog/2015/12/morse-code-training-in-the-air-force/ Morse code training in the Air Force]&lt;/ref&gt; A CW coastal station, KSM, still exists in California, run primarily as a museum by volunteers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomarine.org/#pab1_2 Coast Station KSM]&lt;/ref&gt; and occasional contacts with ships are made. [[Radio beacons]], particularly in the aviation service, but also as "placeholders" for commercial ship-to-shore systems, also transmit Morse but at very slow speeds. The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] issues a lifetime commercial Radiotelegraph Operator License. This requires passing a simple written test on regulations, a more complex written exam on technology, and demonstrating Morse reception at 20 words per minute plain language and 16 wpm code groups. (Credit is given for amateur extra class licenses earned under the old 20 wpm requirement.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1c43fdcd331fb879a486282b2417dd56&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title47/47cfr13_main_02.tpl TITLE 47—Telecommunication CHAPTER I—FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION SUBCHAPTER A—GENERAL PART 13—COMMERCIAL RADIO OPERATORS]&lt;/ref&gt; Wireless telegraphy is still used widely today by [[amateur radio]] hobbyists where it is commonly referred to as radio telegraphy, [[continuous wave]], or just CW. However, its knowledge is not required to obtain any class of amateur license.

[[Continuous wave]] (CW) radiotelegraphy is regulated by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) as emission type A1A.

{{further|History of telecommunication}}

Efforts to find a way to transmit telegraph signals without wires grew out of the success of [[electric telegraph]] networks, the first instant telecommunication systems.  Developed beginning in the 1830s, a [[telegraph line]] was a person-to-person text message system consisting of multiple [[telegraph office]]s linked by an overhead wire supported on [[telegraph pole]]s.  To send a message, an operator at one office would tap on a [[switch]] called a [[telegraph key]], creating pulses of electric current which spelled out a message in [[Morse code]].  When the key was pressed, it would connect a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] to the telegraph line, sending current down the wire.  At the receiving office the current pulses would operate a [[telegraph sounder]], a device which would make a "click" sound when it received each pulse of current.   The operator at the receiving station who knew Morse code would translate the clicking sounds to text and write down the message.  The [[ground (electricity)|ground]] was used as the return path for current in the telegraph circuit, to avoid having to use a second overhead wire.

By the 1860s, telegraph was the standard way to send most urgent commercial, diplomatic and military messages, and industrial nations had built continentwide telegraph networks, with [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowing telegraph messages to bridge oceans.   However installing and maintaining a [[telegraph line]] linking distant stations was very expensive, and wires could not reach some locations such as ships at sea.  Inventors realized if a way could be found to send electrical impulses of Morse code between separate points without a connecting wire, it could revolutionize communications.    

The successful solution to this problem was the discovery of [[radio wave]]s in 1887, and the development of practical radiotelegraphy transmitters and receivers by about 1899, described in the next section.  However this was preceded by a 50 year history of ingenious but ultimately unsuccessful experiments by inventors to achieve wireless telegraphy by other means.   

===Ground, water, and air conduction===
A number of wireless electrical signaling schemes based on the (sometimes erroneous) idea that electric currents could be conducted long range through water, ground, and air were investigated for telegraphy before practical radio systems became available.

The original telegraph lines used two wires between the two stations to form a complete [[Electrical network|electrical circuit]] or "loop". In 1837, however, [[Carl August von Steinheil]] of [[Munich]], [[Germany]], found that by connecting one leg of the apparatus at each station to metal plates buried in the ground, he could eliminate one wire and use a single wire for telegraphic communication. This led to speculation that it might be possible to eliminate both wires and therefore transmit telegraph signals through the ground without any wires connecting the stations. Other attempts were made to send the electric current through bodies of water, in order to span rivers, for example. Prominent experimenters along these lines included [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] in the United States and [[James Bowman Lindsay]] in Great Britain, who in August 1854, was able to demonstrate transmission across a mill dam at a distance of {{convert|500|yd|m|0|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fahie, J. J., ''A History of Wireless Telegraphy, 1838–1899'', 1899, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wireless Energy Principle.jpg|thumb|Tesla's explanation in the 1919 issue of "Electrical Experimenter" on how he thought his wireless system would work]]

US inventors [[William Henry Ward]] (1871) and [[Mahlon Loomis]] (1872) developed an electrical conduction systems based on the erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Cooper, The Truth About Tesla: The Myth of the Lone Genius in the History of Innovation, Race Point Publishing, 2015, pages 154, 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Rappaport, Brian D. Woerner, Jeffrey H. Reed, Wireless Personal Communications: Trends and Challenges, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012, pages 211-215&lt;/ref&gt; They thought atmosphere current, connected with a return path using "Earth currents" would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Cooper, The Truth About Tesla: The Myth of the Lone Genius in the History of Innovation, Race Point Publishing, 2015, page 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec021.htm THOMAS H. WHITE, section  21, MAHLON  LOOMIS]&lt;/ref&gt; A more practical demonstration of wireless transmission via conduction came in [[Amos Dolbear]]'s 1879 magneto electric telephone that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.&lt;ref name="Christopher Cooper 2015, page 165"&gt;Christopher Cooper, The Truth About Tesla: The Myth of the Lone Genius in the History of Innovation, Race Point Publishing, 2015, page 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s inventor [[Nikola Tesla]]  worked on an air and ground conduction [[Wireless power transfer|wireless electric power transmission system]], similar to Loomis',&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute - Volume 78 - Page 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page H-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc J. Seifer, Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius, Citadel Press - 1996, page 107&lt;/ref&gt; which he planned to include wireless telegraphy. Tesla's experiments had led him to incorrectly conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, W. Bernard (2013). Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age. Princeton University Press. p. 301. {{ISBN|1400846552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cooper 2015, page 165"/&gt; and his 1901 large scale application of his ideas, a high-voltage wireless power station, now called [[Wardenclyffe Tower]], lost funding and was abandoned after a few years. 

Telegraphic communication using earth conductivity was eventually found to be limited to impractically short distances, as was communication conducted through water, or between trenches during World War I.

===Electrostatic and electromagnetic induction===
[[File:Pat465971.png|thumb|Thomas Edison's 1891 patent for a ship-to-shore wireless telegraph that used electrostatic induction]]
Both electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were used to develop wireless telegraph systems that saw limited commercial application. In the United States, [[Thomas Edison]], in the mid-1880s, patented an electromagnetic induction system he called "grasshopper telegraphy", which allowed telegraphic signals to jump the short distance between a running train and telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks.&lt;ref&gt;({{US patent|465971}}, ''Means for Transmitting Signals Electrically, US 465971 A'', 1891&lt;/ref&gt; This system was successful technically but not economically, as there turned out to be little interest by train travelers in the use of an on-board telegraph service. During the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]], this system was used to send and receive wireless messages from [[railroad|trains]] buried in snowdrifts. The disabled trains were able to maintain communications via their Edison induction wireless telegraph systems,&lt;ref&gt;"Defied the storm's worst-communication always kept up by 'train telegraphy,'" [[New York Times]], March 17, 1888, page 8. Proquest Historical Newspapers (subscription). Retrieved February 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the first successful use of wireless telegraphy to send distress calls. Edison would also help to patent a ship-to-shore communication system based on electrostatic induction.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher H. Sterling, Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set, Routledge - 2004, page 833&lt;/ref&gt;

The most successful creator of an electromagnetic induction telegraph system was [[William Preece]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Beginning with tests across the [[Bristol Channel]] in 1892, Preece was able to telegraph across gaps of about {{convert|5|km|mi|1|abbr=off}}. However, his induction system required extensive lengths of [[Antenna (radio)|antenna wires]], many kilometers long, at both the sending and receiving ends. The length of those sending and receiving wires needed to be about the same length as the width of the water or land to be spanned. For example, for Preece's station to span the [[English Channel]] from [[Dover, England]], to the coast of [[France]] would require sending and receiving wires of about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} along the two coasts. These facts made the system impractical on ships, boats, and ordinary islands, which are much smaller than [[Great Britain]] or [[Greenland]]. In addition, the relatively short distances that a practical Preece system could span meant that it had few advantages over [[underwater telegraph cable]]s.

Over several years starting in 1894, the Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] worked on adapting the newly discovered phenomenon of [[radio wave]]s to communication, turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment up to that point into a useful communication system,&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of Invention: The Makers of the Modern World from Gutenberg to Gates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA162|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34743-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mulvihill, Mary |title=Ingenious Ireland: A County-by-County Exploration of the Mysteries and Marvels of the Ingenious Irish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exics12jmtwC&amp;pg=PA313+|date=2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-02094-5|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; building the first radiotelegraphy system using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=British+High+Court+upheld+patent+7777&amp;oi=book_result#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Marconi sent wireless telegraphic signals across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901, the system began being used for regular communication including ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship comuntication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mizenhead.net/marconi.html |title=Marconi at Mizen Head Visitor Centre Ireland Visitor Attractions |publisher=Mizenhead.net |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With this development wireless telegraphy came to mean ''radiotelegraphy'', [[Morse code]] transmitted by radio waves. The first [[radio transmitter]]s, primitive [[spark gap transmitter]]s used until World War I, could not transmit voice ([[audio signal]]s). Instead, the operator would tap out the text message on a [[telegraph key]], which turned the transmitter on and off, producing short ("dot") and long ("dash") pulses of radio waves, groups of which comprised the letters and other symbols of the Morse code. At the receiver, the signals could be heard as musical "beeps" in the [[earphones]] by the receiving operator, who would translate the code back into text. By 1910, communication by what had been called "Hertzian waves" was being universally referred to as "[[radio]]",&lt;ref&gt;[https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec022.htm earlyradiohistory.us, UNITED STATES EARLY RADIO HISTORY, THOMAS H. WHITE, section 22, Word Origins-Radio]&lt;/ref&gt; and the term wireless telegraphy has been largely replaced by the more modern term "radiotelegraphy".

===Continuous waves (CW)===
The primitive spark transmitters used until 1920 transmitted by a modulation method called [[damped wave]]s.  As long as the telegraph key was pressed, the transmitter would produce a string of transient pulses of radio waves which repeated at an audio rate, usually between 50 and several thousand [[hertz]].  In a receiver's earphone this sounded like a musical tone, rasp or buzz.  Thus the Morse code "dots" and "dashes" sounded like beeps.  Damped waves had a large frequency [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]  meaning that the radio signal was not a single frequency but occupied a wide band of frequencies.  Damped wave transmitters had a limited range, and interfered with the transmissions of other transmitters on adjacent frequencies.  

After 1905 new types of radiotelegraph transmitters were invented which transmitted code using a new modulation method: [[continuous wave]]s (CW) (designated by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] as emission type A1A).  As long as the telegraph key was pressed, the transmitter produced a continuous [[sine wave|sinusoidal wave]] of a constant amplitude.  Since all the radio wave's energy was concentrated at a single frequency, CW transmitters could transmit further with a given power, and also caused virtually no interference to transmissions on adjacent frequencies.  The first transmitters able to produce continuous waves were the [[arc converter]] (Poulsen arc) transmitter, invented by Danish engineer [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in 1903, and the [[Alexanderson alternator]], invented 1906-1912  by [[Reginald Fessenden]] and [[Ernst Alexanderson]].  These slowly replaced the spark transmitters in high power radiotelegraphy stations.  

However the radio receivers used for damped waves could not receive continuous waves.  Because the CW signal produced while the key was pressed was just an unmodulated [[carrier wave]], it made no sound in a receiver's earphones.  In order to receive a CW signal, some way had to be found to make the Morse code carrier wave pulses audible in a receiver.  

This problem was solved by Reginald Fessenden in 1901.  In his "heterodyne" receiver, the incoming radiotelegraph signal is mixed in the receiver's [[detector (radio)|detector]] crystal or vacuum tube with a constant sine wave generated by an [[electronic oscillator]] in the receiver called a [[beat frequency oscillator]] (BFO).  The frequency of the oscillator &lt;math&gt;f_\text{BFO}&lt;/math&gt; is offset from the radio transmitter's frequency &lt;math&gt;f_\text{IN}&lt;/math&gt;.  In the detector the two frequencies subtract, and a [[beat frequency]] ([[heterodyne]]) at the difference between the two frequencies is produced:  &lt;math&gt;f_\text{BEAT} = |f_\text{IN} - f_\text{BFO}|&lt;/math&gt;.  If the BFO frequency is near enough to the radio station's frequency, the beat frequency is in the [[audio frequency]] range and can be heard in the receiver's earphones.  During the "dots" and "dashes" of the signal, the beat tone is produced, while between them there is no carrier so no tone is produced.  Thus the Morse code is audible as musical "beeps" in the earphones. 

The BFO was rare until the invention in 1913 of the first practical electronic oscillator, the vacuum tube feedback [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] by [[Edwin Armstrong]].  After this time BFOs were a standard part of radiotelegraphy receivers.   Each time the radio was tuned to a different station frequency, the BFO frequency had to be changed also, so the BFO oscillator had to be tunable.  In later [[superheterodyne]] receivers from the 1930s on, the BFO signal was mixed with the constant [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) produced by the superheterodyne's detector.  Therefore the BFO could be a fixed frequency. 

Continuous wave vacuum tube transmitters replaced the other types of transmitter with the availability of power tubes after [[World War 1]] because they were cheap.  CW became the standard method of transmitting radiotelegraphy by the 20s, damped wave spark transmitters were banned by 1930 and CW continues to be used today.  Even today most [[communications receiver]]s produced for use in shortwave communication stations have BFOs.

===The radiotelegraphy industry===

Balloons at [[Tempelhofer Field]], Germany, 1908.]]

The International Radiotelegraph Union was unofficially established at first International Radiotelegraph Convention in 1906, and was merged into the [[International Telecommunication Union]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/icao_and_the_international_telecommunication_union.htm ICAO and the International Telecommunication Union] - ICAO official website&lt;/ref&gt; When the United States entered [[World War I]], private radiotelegraphy stations were prohibited, which put an end to several pioneers' work in this field. By the 1920s, there was a worldwide network of commercial and government radiotelegraphic stations, plus extensive use of radiotelegraphy by ships for both commercial purposes and passenger messages. The transmission of sound ([[radiotelephony]]) began to displace radiotelegraphy by the 1920s for many applications, making possible radio [[broadcasting]]. Wireless telegraphy continued to be used for private person-to-person business, governmental, and military communication, such as [[telegram]]s and [[diplomatic communications]], and evolved into [[radioteletype]] networks.  The ultimate implementation of wireless telegraphy was [[teleprinter|telex]], using radio signals, which was developed in the 1930s and was for many years the only reliable form of communication between many distant countries. The most advanced standard, [[ITU-T|CCITT]] [[R.44]], automated both routing and encoding of messages by [[short wave]] transmissions. 

Today, due to more modern text transmission methods, Morse code radiotelegraphy for commercial use has become obsolete.  On shipboard the computer and satellite linked [[GMDSS]] system has largely replaced Morse as a means of communication.

A '''woody plant''' is a [[plant]] that produces [[wood]] as its structural tissue. Woody plants are usually either [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, or [[liana]]s. These are usually [[perennial plant]]s whose stems and larger roots are reinforced with wood produced from secondary [[xylem]]. The main stem, larger branches, and roots of these plants are usually covered by a layer of [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. Wood is a structural [[cell (biology)|cellular]] adaptation that allows woody plants to grow from above ground stems year after year, thus making some woody plants the largest and tallest [[terrestrial plant]]s.

Wood is primarily composed of xylem cells with [[cell wall]]s made of [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. Xylem is a [[vascular tissue]] which moves water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Most woody plants form new layers of woody tissue each year, and so increase their stem diameter from year to year, with new wood deposited on the inner side of a [[vascular cambium]] layer located immediately beneath the bark. However, in some [[monocotyledons]] such as [[Arecaceae|palms]] and [[Dracaena (plant)|dracaenas]], the wood is formed in bundles scattered through the interior of the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Mark W. |year=2004 |title=Monocot relationships: an overview |journal=[[American Journal of Botany|Am. J. Bot.]] |volume=91 |issue=10 |pages=1645–1655 |doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1645 |pmid=21652314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woody herbs are [[herbaceous plant]]s that develop hard woody stems. They include such plants as ''[[Uraria picta]]'' and certain species in family [[Polygonaceae]]. These herbs are not truly woody but have hard densely packed stem tissue. Other herbaceous plants have woody stems called a [[caudex]], which is a thickened stem base often found in plants that grow in [[alpine climate|alpine]] or dry environments.

Under specific conditions, woody plants may [[Decomposition|decay]] or may in time become [[petrified wood]].

The symbol for a woody plant, based on ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] is [[Image:Saturn symbol.svg|14px|♃]], which is also the [[astronomical symbol]] for the planet [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearn |first=William T. |title=Botanical Latin |edition=Fourth |origyear=1966 |year=1992 |location=Portland |publisher=Timber Press |isbn=0881923214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
