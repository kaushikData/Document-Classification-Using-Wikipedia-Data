The '''1938-1939 German Expedition to Tibet''' was a German scientific expedition from April 1938 to August 1939, led by German zoologist and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Ernst Schäfer]].

== Origins ==
The Reichsführer-SS [[Himmler]] was attempting to avail himself of the reputation of Schäfer for [[Nazi propaganda]] and asked about his future plans. Schäfer responded he wanted to lead another expedition to Tibet. Schäfer requested that his expedition be under the patronage of the cultural department of the foreign affairs department or of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] ("German Research Foundation").&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Detlev Rose, [http://www.voxnr.com/cc/d_allemagne/EEykuApZAydnrSWacD.shtml L'expédition allemande au Tibet de 1938-39. Voyage scientifique ou quête de traces à motivation idéologique ?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153643/http://www.voxnr.com/cc/d_allemagne/EEykuApZAydnrSWacD.shtml |date=2008-11-20 }}, in ''Synergies européennes - Bruxelles-Munich-Tübingen'', novembre 2006 (article tiré de la revue ''Deutschland in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', No 3-2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler was fascinated by Asian mysticism and therefore wished to send such an expedition under the auspices of the SS [[Ahnenerbe]] (SS Ancestral Heritage Society), and he desired that Schäfer perform research based on [[Hanns Hörbiger]]’s pseudoscientific theory of "[[Glacial Cosmogony]]" promoted by the Ahnenerbe. Schäfer had scientific objectives and therefore refused to include [[Edmund Kiss]], an adept of this theory, in his team and required 12 conditions to ensure scientific freedom. [[Wolfram Sievers]], from the Ahnenerbe, therefore expressed criticism concerning the objectives of the expedition, and Ahnenerbe would not sponsor it. Himmler was agreeable to the expedition going ahead provided all members joined the SS and Schäfer found he had no alternative but to accept this condition even without sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Isrun Engelhardt 1939"&gt;Isrun Engelhardt, ''The Ernst-Schaefer-Tibet-Expedition (1938-1939):/new light on the political history of Tibet in the first half of the 20th century '' in McKay Alex (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Designations ==
While preparing the expedition, Ernst Schäfer used the term "Schaefer Expedition 1938/1939" on his letterhead and to apply for sponsorship from businessmen.&lt;ref name="Isrun Engelhardt 1939"/&gt;  The official expedition name had to be changed on order of the "Ahnenerbe", however, to "German Tibet-Expedition Ernst Schaefer" (in big letters), "under the patronage of the Reichsführer-SS Himmler and in connection with the Ahnenerbe" (in small letters).&lt;ref&gt;Detlev Rose, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2405049/Lexpedition-allemande-au-Tibet-de-193839-Detlev-ROSE L'expédition allemande au Tibet de 1938-39. Voyage scientifique ou quête de traces à motivation idéologique ?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102091737/http://www.scribd.com/doc/2405049/Lexpedition-allemande-au-Tibet-de-193839-Detlev-ROSE |date=2012-11-02 }}, in ''Synergies européennes - Bruxelles-Munich-Tübingen'', novembre 2006 (article taken from the ''Deutschland in Geschichte und Gegenwart'' journal, No 3-2006): "Le nom officiel de l’expédition était le suivant : « Expédition allemande Ernst Schäfer au Tibet » (= « Deutsche Tibetexpedition Ernst Schäfer »).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isrun Engelhardt, ''The Ernst-Schaefer-Tibet-Expedition (1938-1939) : new light on the political history of Tibet in the first half of the 20th century '', in McKay Alex (ed.), ''Tibet and Her Neighbours : A History'' 2003, Edition Hansjörg Mayer (London), {{ISBN|3-88375-718-7}}: "The expedition’s name, however, had to be changed on the order of the 'Ahnenerbe' to 'German Tibet-Expedition Ernst Schaefer' (in big letters), under the patronage of the Reichsführer-SS Himmler and in connection with the Ahnenerbe (in small letters)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This designation is also used by the [[Namgyal Institute of Tibetology]], [http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/nit/exhibitions/index.htm Historic photographs of Sikkim ‘Who is behind the camera?’] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628040015/http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/nit/exhibitions/index.htm |date=2010-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German Consul-General in Calcutta criticised the letterhead in a report to the German Foreign Office, "arguing that the prescribed letterhead was counter-productive and immediately generated mistrust among the British", Schäfer "ordered a new, discreet letterhead in Antiqua font, which read 'Deutsche Tibet Expedition Ernst Schäfer'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Tibet-1938-1939-Ernst-Schaefer-Expedition-Engelhardt.html »Tibet in 1938–1939: The Ernst Schäfer Expedition to Tibet«], Engelhardt 2007, p.17 and Note 38 p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; During the expedition, Schäfer used only the latter letterhead or his original "Schaefer Expedition" paper. The Ahnenerbe prescribed letterhead was only used prior to the expedition's departure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Nazis-of-Tibet-A-Twentieth-Century-Myth_Engelhardt.html ''The Nazis of Tibet: A Twentieth Century Myth''], Isrun Engelhardt, in: Monica Esposito (ed.), »Images of Tibet in the 19th and 20th Centuries.« Paris: École française d’Extrême-Orient (EFEO), coll. Études thématiques 22, vol. I, 2008, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer Christopher Hale claims that one cannot infer that Schäfer was independent of the SS and was able to do "pure science" simply from the special letterhead that he got printed for the expedition: to all intents and purposes, the expedition remained under Himmler's patronage and Schäfer had no interest in losing his support.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hale (2003): "He was careful to remove that second line when he arrived in Gangtok in British India. [...] Some German historians have concluded from this that Schäfer was independent of the SS and was thus able to do 'pure science'. This was not the case. Himmler remained the expedition's patron and Schäfer clearly had no interest in losing his support."&lt;/ref&gt;

In its time, the expedition was also commonly referred to in German newspapers and academic journals as the "[[SS]] Tibet Expedition" as it had Heinrich Himmler as its patron and all five members were officers in the [[SS]].&lt;ref&gt;Konrad von Rauch, ''Die Erste Deutsche SS-Tibet-Expedition'', in ''Der Biologe'' 8, 1939, S. 113-127.&lt;/ref&gt; The "SS Tibet Expedition" designation was used by Ernst Schäfer himself in the ''Atlantis'' Journal.&lt;ref&gt;"an article by Ernst Schaefer from the magazine ''Atlantis'' date October 1939. This article had the sub-heading 'von Dr Ernst Schaefer Leiter der SS-Tibet-Expedition' ", (Ofcom, ''Broadcast Bulletin'', Issue number 85 - 21/05/07, Fairness and Privacy Cases, Not Upheld, [http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb85/ Complaint by Mr Roger Croston on behalf of Dr Bruno Beger Secret History: The Nazi Expedition, Channel 4, 12 July 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523111746/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb85/ |date=2007-05-23 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  "SS Tibet Expedition" is the title used in a 1946 report by US military intelligence in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5hdkF1Mub?url=http://www.systemglitch.ca/oifir.html ''The Activities of Dr. Ernst Schaefer''], United States Forces - European Theater Military Intelligence Service Center, APO 757 Final Interrogation Report (OI-FIR) No. 32, Feb. 12, 1946: "A new Tibetan expedition, to be called the SS Tibet Expedition, was then in preparation."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Register of the [[Heinrich Himmler]] Papers", 1914–1944, archived at Stanford University's Hoover institution, the folder containing the material pertaining to the expedition bears the title "The SS-Tibet-Expedition, 1939''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf2w1002fp;style=oac4;view=dsc Online Archive of California (OAC)].&lt;/ref&gt;

This designation is still in use by modern scholars, such as Mechtild Rössler in 2001&lt;ref&gt;"Probably the best known expedition was the ''SS Tibet expedition, undertaken in 1943''" (Mechtild Rössler, Geography and Area Planning under National Socialism, in Margit Szöllösi-Janze, ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e6AfjhwkifAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Science in the Third Reich''], Oxford and New York: Berg Publishers, 2001, 289 p., pp. 59-79, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; and Suzanne Heim in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;"SS-Tibet-Expedition Schäfer 1938-1939" (Suzanne Heim, ''Geschichte der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus'', 2002, p. 131)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by writer Peter Lavenda in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levenda, ''Unholy alliance: a history of Nazi involvement with the occult'', 2nd edition, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, 423 p., p. 192: "the efforts and adventures of the SS-Tibet expedition."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
According to Christopher Hale, as Ernst Schäfer was demanding more than 60,000 Reichsmarks for his expedition and the coffers of the SS were depleted at the time, he was forced to raise the funds himself.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hale, ''Himmler's Crusade. The Nazi Expedition to Find the Origins of the Aryan Race'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken (NJ), 2003, 422 p.: "the coffers of the SS were much depleted (Schäfer was demanding more than sixty thousand Reichsmarks [...] Schäfer was now faced with a formidable task: he would have to raise the funds himself."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to researcher Isrun Engelhardt, the expedition was not funded by the Ahnenerbe.&lt;ref&gt;Isrun Engelhardt, ''[http://info-buddhism.com/Tibet-1938-1939-Ernst-Schaefer-Expedition-Engelhardt.html The Ernst-Schaefer-Tibet-Expedition (1938-1939)] : new light on the political history of Tibet in the first half of the 20th century '' in McKay Alex (ed.), ''Tibet and Her Neighbours : A History'' 2003, Edition Hansjörg Mayer (London), {{ISBN|3-88375-718-7}}, {{quote|Schaefer, in order to obtain the scientific freedom he needed, asked for the acceptance of twelve conditions, all of which were granted by Himmler himself. However, Sievers, the head of the "Ahnenerbe", declared in January 1938, "The task of the expedition in the meantime had diverged too far from the targets of the Reichsführer-SS and does not serve his ideas of cultural studies." Thus, in the end, the expedition was ''not'' sponsored by the "Ahnenerbe"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst Schäfer raised the funds by himself, 80% of which came from Public Relations and [[Advertising Council of German Industry]] (Werberat der deutschen Wirtschaft) as well as large German business enterprises, [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (German Research Foundation) and [[Brooke Dolan II]]. Himmler's personal friends sponsored only the flight back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Isrun Engelhardt (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United States Forces, the expedition's funding was provided by various public and private contributors, with the return flight to Germany paid for by the SS. The cost of equipping the expedition was RM 65,000, and the expedition itself cost another RM 65,000, excluding the flight back.&lt;ref name="activities"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5hdkF1Mub?url=http://www.systemglitch.ca/oifir.html ''The Activities of Dr. Ernst Schaefer''], United States Forces - European Theater, Military Intelligence Service Center, APO 757 Final Interrogation Report (OI-FIR) No. 32, Feb. 12, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Schäfer]] was a member of the SS when he arrived at the German consulate in [[Chongqing|Chungking]] in 1935. Schäfer had just returned from a trip through parts of Asia, mainly India and China, in which the other two heads of the expedition had abandoned him in fear of native tribes.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt; Schäfer turned the expedition from a complete failure into a great success, and the SS took note, sending him a letter informing him of a promotion to SS-[[Untersturmführer]] and summoning him back to Germany from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. In June 1936, Schäfer met with Himmler, who consequently informed Sievers and Galke to start organizing an expedition to Tibet.

Schäfer recruited young, fit men who would be well suited for an arduous journey.&lt;ref name=Pringle&gt;Pringle, Heather, ''The Master Plan: Himmler’s Scholars and the Holocaust'', Hyperion, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 24, [[Karl Wienert]] (an assistant of [[Wilhelm Filchner]], a famous explorer) was the team's geologist. Also age 24, [[Edmund Geer]] was selected as the technical leader to organize the expedition. A relatively old teammate at the age of 38 was [[Ernst Krause (entomologist)|Ernst Krause]] (not to be confused with the German biologist of the same name), who was to double as a filmmaker and entomologist. [[Bruno Beger]] was a 26-year-old Rassekunde expert and student of [[Hans F.K. Günther]]'s who was to be the team's anthropologist.

== Objectives ==

Researcher Roger Croston described the objective of the expedition as "an holistic creation of a complete biological record of Tibet alongside a synthesis of inter-relating natural sciences with regard to geography, cartography, geology, earth magnetics, climate, plants, animals and mankind."&lt;ref name=Croston&gt;Roger Croston, [http://descrier.co.uk/science/2012/10/is-the-space-buddha-a-counterfeit ''Is the Space Buddha a Counterfeit?''], 24 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Schäfer, ''Geheimnis Tibet''.  München: Bruckmann 1943, 7-16, see also Engelhardt, Isrun, [http://info-buddhism.com/Nazis-of-Tibet-A-Twentieth-Century-Myth_Engelhardt.html Nazis of Tibet: A Twentieth Century Myth]. In: Monica Esposito (ed.), ''Images of Tibet in the 19th and 20th Centuries.'' Paris: École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO), coll. Études thématiques 22, vol. I, 2008, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to Dr Isrun Engelhardt's conclusions that the Schäfer Expedition was "purely scientific" and her claim that the historical context of Germany in the 1930s makes the expedition's goals appear as somehow sinister,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hale (2003): "Dr Isrun Engelhardt has concluded that the Schäfer Expedition was ‘purely scientific’. It is only because of the historical context of Germany in the 1930s, she argues, that we view its goals as somehow sinister."&lt;/ref&gt; British writer Christopher Hale observes that "while the idea of ‘Nazi botany’ or ‘Nazi ornithology’ is probably absurd, other sciences are not so innocent – and Schäfer's small expedition represented a cross-section of German science in the 1930s." To Hale, this has considerable significance as "under the Third Reich anthropology and medicine were cold-bloodedly exploited to support and enact a murderous creed."&lt;ref name=Hale /&gt; There have been allegations that one of the expedition's purposes was to determine whether Tibet was the cradle of the "Aryan race". The taking of cranial measurements and making of facial casts of local people by anthropologist Bruno Beger did little to dissipate the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Reilly, [http://www.johnreilly.info/himcru.htm Review of Christopher Hale's book, ''Himmler's Crusade''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621210214/http://www.johnreilly.info/himcru.htm |date=2006-06-21 }}, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken (NJ), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale also recalls the existence of a secret warning issued by propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] to German newspapers in 1940 saying that "the chief task of the Tibet expedition," was "of a political and military nature" and "had not so much to do with the solution of scientific questions," adding that details could not be revealed.&lt;ref name=Hale /&gt;

However, Croston agrees with Engelhardt and states that the expedition "was planned as a scientific mission […] but it was caught up in the politics of the time. […] Schaefer’s vehement refusal to accept Himmler’s plans led, eventually, to the expedition not being sponsored by Himmler’s SS or its organisations 'because it would lie outside the scope of his work'."&lt;ref name=Croston /&gt;

Chinese journalist Ren Yanshi, quoting the Austrian weekly ''[[Wochenpresse]]'', writes that the first major task of the expedition was "to investigate the possibility of establishing the region as a base for attacking the British troops stationed in India" while its second major assignment was "to verify Heinrich Himmler's Nazi racial theory that a group of pure-blooded Aryans had settled in Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Ren Yanshi, [http://il.china-embassy.org/eng/xwdt/t425136.htm Nazi Author's Seven Years in Tibet] (article first published in March 1998 in ''Beijing Review''), ''Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the State of Israel'', April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to American journalist [[Karl E. Meyer]], one of the expedition's aims was to prepare maps and survey passes "for possible use of Tibet as a staging ground for guerrilla assaults on British India."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Meyer, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/07/opinion/nazi-trespassers-in-tibet.html?pagewanted=1?pagewanted=1 Nazi Trespassers in Tibet], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 July 1999: "Schäfer's team filmed and measured Tibetans, but also prepared maps and surveyed passes for possible use of Tibet as a staging ground for guerrilla assaults on British India."&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian essayist [[Claudio Mutti]] states that the official plan included research on the landforms, climate, geography, and culture of the region,&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Schäfer, Forschungsraum Innerasien, in ''Asienberichte. Vierteljahresschrift für asiatische Geschichte und Kultur'', No 21, April 1944, pp. 3-6: "the geology, flora, wildlife and people (of Tibet) were the objects of our expedition."&lt;/ref&gt; and contacting the local authorities for the establishment of representation in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Claudio Mutti, [http://www.claudiomutti.com/index.php?id_news=16&amp;imag=6&amp;url=6 Les SS au Tibet], in ''Claudiomutti.com'', Octobre 10, 2005: "Le but officiel de l'expédition était d'étudier la région tibétaine du point de vue anthropologique, géographique, zoologique et botanique. Mais pour Himmler il importait aussi d'établir le contact avec l'abbé Reting, devenu Régent du pays en 1934, un an après la mort du treizième Dalaï-lama.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-KA-03-100, Tibetexpedition, Expeditionsteilnehmer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph of the expedition]]

According to Claudio Mutti, the group of five researchers intended to contact the Regent of Tibet&lt;ref name="Mutti"&gt;Claudio Mutti, [http://www.claudiomutti.com/index.php?id_news=16&amp;imag=6&amp;url=6 Les SS au Tibet], Claudiomutti.com, 10 October 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and visit the sacred cities of [[Lhasa]] and [[Shigatse]]. Even with wartime difficulties the group was able to contact the Tibetan authorities and people.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Reilly, [https://web.archive.org/web/20121003051534/http://www.johnreilly.info/himcru.htm Review of Christopher Hale's book, ''Himmler's Crusade''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken (NJ), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to [[Germany]] with a complete edition of the Tibetan sacred text the [[Kangyur]] (108 volumes), examples of [[Mandala]], other ancient texts, and one alleged document regarding the "Aryan race". These documents were kept in [[Ahnenerbe]] archives.

== Expedition details ==

In July 1937, the team suffered a setback when [[Japan]] invaded Manchuria, [[China]], ruining Schäfer's plans to use the [[Yangtze River]] to reach Tibet. Schäfer flew to London to seek permission to travel through India, but was turned down by the British government who feared an imminent war with Germany.

Another problem in the preparations for the Tibetan expedition occurred during a duck hunting accident on November 9, 1937, when Schäfer, his wife of four months and two servants were in a rowboat. A sudden wave caused Schäfer to drop his gun which broke in two and discharged, mortally wounding his wife. Despite subsequent emotional problems, Schäfer was back to work on the expedition in eight weeks.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

In a move that lost the Ahnenerbe's support, Schäfer asked Himmler for permission to simply arrive in India and try to force his way into Tibet. Himmler agreed with this plan, and set about furthering it by contacting influential people, including Germany's foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. On April 21, 1938, the team departed from [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], on their way to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] where they would then travel to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[British Raj|British India]].

The day before the team left Europe the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' ran an article on the expedition, alerting British officials of its intentions. Schäfer and Himmler were both enraged: Schäfer complained to SS headquarters and Himmler in turn wrote to [[Barry Domvile|Admiral Barry Domvile]]. Domvile was a Nazi supporter and former head of British naval intelligence who gave the letter to Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].  Chamberlain permitted the SS team to enter [[Sikkim]], a region bordering Tibet.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

=== Journey through Sikkim ===
In Sikkim's capital of [[Gangtok]], the team assembled a 50-mule caravan and searched for [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] and Tibetan [[Interpreter (communication)|interpreters]]. Here, the British official, [[Basil Gould|Sir Basil Gould]], observed them, describing Schäfer as "interesting, forceful, volatile, scholarly, vain to the point of childishness, disregardful of social convention," and noted that he was determined to enter Tibet regardless of permission.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

The team began their journey June 21, 1938, traveling through the [[Teesta River]] valley and then heading north. Krause worked light traps to capture insects, Wienert toured the hills making measurements, Geer collected bird species and Beger offered locals medical help in exchange for allowing him to take measurements of them.

In August 1938, a high official of the [[Rajah Tering]], a member of the Sikkimese royal family living in Tibet, entered the team's camp. Although Beger wished to ask the guest's permission to measure him, he was dissuaded by the Tibetan porters who encouraged him to wait for Schäfer to return from a hunting trip. Schäfer met with the official, and presented him with mule-loads of gifts.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

In December 1938 the Tibetan council of ministers invited Schäfer and his team to Tibet, but forbade them from killing any animals during their stay, citing religious concerns.&lt;ref name=Hale&gt;[[Christopher Hale]], ''Himmler’s Crusade: The Nazi Expedition to Find the Origins of the Aryan Race'', Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; After a supply trip back to Gangtok, Schäfer learned he had been promoted to SS-[[Hauptsturmführer]], and the rest of the team had been promoted to SS-[[Obersturmführer]].&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

=== Trip To Lhasa ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-KB-16-055, Tibetexpedition, Passang.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A Tibetan labeled Passang.]]
During the trip to Tibet's highlands, Beger began making facial casts of local people, including his personal servant, a [[Nepal]]ese [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] named Passang. During the first casting, paste got into one of Passang's nostrils and he panicked, tearing at the mask. Schäfer threatened to terminate the employment of the porters who had seen the incident, if they told anyone. Most of the Tibetans had a much more friendly and light-hearted attitude, however, and photographic and film footage remains of smiling and laughing Tibetans undergoing facial and skull feature measurements.

On January 19, 1939, the team reached [[Lhasa]], the capital of Tibet. Schäfer proceeded to pay his respects to the Tibetan ministers and a nobleman. He also gave out Nazi pennants, explaining the reverence shown for the shared symbol in Germany.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt; His permission to remain in Lhasa was extended, and he was permitted to photograph and film the region. The team spent two months in Lhasa, collecting information on agriculture, culture, and religion.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

As the arrival of the expedition had been announced in advance, its members, according to Bruno Beger's testimony,  were welcome everywhere in Tibet and provided with all the things they needed for their trip and sojourn. In Lhasa itself, they got into close touch with government officials and other noteworthy people.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Bruno Beger, [https://web.archive.org/web/20021220183452/http://www.tibet.com/Status/bruno.html The Status of Independence of Tibet in 1938/39 according to the travel reports (memoirs)], ''Tibet.com'', 1996: "The arrival of our expedition had been announced beforehand in advance, and for this reason we were welcome and well-received everywhere and provided with the necessary things on our way through the Chumbi Valley, then from Gyantse to Lhasa and from there via Samye across the Yarlung Valley to Shigatse and back again to Gangtok via Gyantse. In Lhasa itself we were received in a very friendly way and got into close contact with government officials and other influential people of the country."&lt;/ref&gt;

Schäfer met the Regent of Tibet, [[Reting Rinpoche]], on several occasions. During one of their meetings, the Regent asked him point blank whether his country would be willing to sell weapons to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Reilly, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110407140828/http://www.johnreilly.info/himcru.htm Review of Christopher Hale's ''Himmler's Crusade. The Nazi Expedition to Find the Origins of the Origins of the Aryan Race'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken (NJ), 2003]: "The Regent granted Schäfer long interviews at short notice, a most unusual practice, during one of which he asked point blank whether Germany would be interested in selling arms to Tibet."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trip to Gyantse and Shigatse ===

In March 1939, the expedition left Lhasa, heading for [[Gyantse]] and escorted by a Tibetan official. After exploring the ruins of the ancient deserted capital city of Jalung Phodrang, they reached [[Shigatse]], the city of the panchen lamas, in April. They received a warm welcome from the locals, with thousands coming out to greet them.&lt;ref name="Mutti" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hale, Himmler's Crusade. The Nazi Expedition to Find the Origins of the Aryan Race, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken (NJ), 2003, 422 p.: "When the German Tibet Expedition arrived in Shigatse, thousands came out to greet them."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1946 "Final Interrogation Report by American Intelligence", Schäfer claims to have met "the pro-German regent of Shigatse"&lt;ref&gt;''The Activities of Dr. Ernst Schaefer'': "In any event he claims to have been told by the pro-German regent of Shigatse" [...].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex McKay, The History of Tibet: 1895-1959, the encounter with modernity, RoutledgeCurzon, 2003, 737 p., p. 32: "As with the Dalai Lama, Regents were appointed at Shigatse during the periods between ruling Panchen Lamas."&lt;/ref&gt; (the 9th Panchen Lama had died in 1937 and the 10th was not to arrive before 1951). In May, the expedition returned to Gyantse where negotiations were held with local British officials about the trip back to India and transport of the expeditions's gear and collections.

== Communications with Germany ==
Throughout his stay in Lhasa, Ernst Schäfer remained in touch with Germany through mail and the Chinese Legation's radio.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Reilly, [http://www.johnreilly.info/himcru.htm Review of Christopher Hale's "Himmler's Crusade. The Nazi Expedition to Find the Origins of the Origins of the Aryan Race"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621210214/http://www.johnreilly.info/himcru.htm |date=2006-06-21 }}: "Not that mail was Schäfer’s only means of communication: the Chinese legation let him use their radio."&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler is reported to have followed the expedition enthusiastically, writing several letters to Schäfer and even broadcasting Christmas greeting to him via shortwave.&lt;ref&gt;''The Activities of Dr. Ernst Schaefer'': "Himmler followed the expedition with enthusiasm and wrote several letters to Schaefer [...]. Himmler promoted Schaefer to SS Hauptsturmfuehrer, and on Christmas 1938 broadcast special Christmas greetings to him via shortwave.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results of the research ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-12-37-25, Tibetexpedition, Golok Mädchen.jpg|thumb|A [[Golok people|Golok]] woman, photographed by [[Ernst Schäfer]]]]

The Germans collected anything they could: thousands of artifacts, a huge number of plants and animals, including live specimens. They sent back specimens of three breeds of Tibetan dogs, rare feline species, wolves, badgers, foxes, animal and bird skins.&lt;ref name="brewis"&gt;Kathy Brewis, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1151361.ece Quest of the Nazis], ''The Sunday Times'', July 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition members collected a huge quantity of plants, in particular hundreds of varieties of barley, wheat and oats. The seeds were later stored in the SS-Institute for Plant Genetics in Lannach near Graz, Austria, a research centre run by SS botanist [[Heinz Brücher]]. Brücher entertained hopes of using both the Tibet collection and that of the Vavilov Institute in the Eastern territories to select crop plants able to withstand the climate of Eastern Europe – considered at the time as part of the Nazi [[Lebensraum]] or "living space" – with a view to reaching autarky.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wieland, [http://www.johost.eu/print.asp?oid=87 Autarky and Lebensraum. The political agenda of academic plant breeding in Nazi Germany]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Host, Journal of Science and Technology]]'', vol. 3, automne 2009: "Due to the growing interest of breeders in wild-type plants, in 1939, geneticist [[Fritz von Wettstein]](1895–1945) argued for an institute for crop plant research to be established by the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. About the same time, members of Himmler’s research and teaching community Das Ahnenerbe also developed the idea of founding an institute. Its objective should be to analyze the wild-type plants compiled during the 1938 expedition of the SS to Tibet […]. The SS-Institute in Lannach was set up and directed by Heinz Brücher (1915–1991), who, in June 1943, joined a task force established by the SS to rob the assortments of wild and cultivated plants from the Vavilov institutes in the occupied territories. Drawing upon these assortments as well as on those of the 1938 SS Tibet expedition, Brücher wanted to start "breeding cold and drought resistant crop plants for the Eastern territory".&lt;/ref&gt;

Wienert took four sets of geomagnetic data. Krause studied Tibetan wasps. Schäfer observed Tibetan rituals, including [[sky burial]] (he even bought some human skulls). They took stills and film footage of local culture, notably the spectacular New Year celebrations when tens of thousands of pilgrims flocked to Lhasa. [[Bruno Beger]] recorded the measurements of 376 people and took casts of the heads, faces, hands and ears of 17 more, as well as fingerprints and hand prints from another 350. To carry out his research, he posed as a medicine man to win the favour of Tibetan aristocrats, dispensing drugs and tending to monks with sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="brewis" /&gt;

Schäfer kept meticulous notes on the religious and cultural customs of the Tibetans, from their various colorful Buddhist festivals to Tibetan attitudes towards marriage, rape, menstruation, childbirth, homosexuality and masturbation. In his account of Tibetan homosexuality he describes the various positions taken by older lamas with younger boys and then goes on to explain how homosexuality played an important role in the higher politics of Tibet. There are pages of careful observation of Himalayan people engaged in a variety of intimate acts.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levenda, ''Unholy alliance: a history of Nazi involvement with the occult'', 2nd edition, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, 423 p., p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schäfer presented the results of the expedition on 25 July 1939 at the Himalaya Club Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;Engelhardt Isrun, ''[http://info-buddhism.com/Tibet-1938-1939-Ernst-Schaefer-Expedition-Engelhardt.html Tibet in 1938–1939: The Ernst Schäfer Expedition to Tibet]'', pp. 55–57, 2007, in ''Tibet in 1938-1939: Photographs from the Ernst Schäfer Expedition to Tibet'', Edited by Isrun Engelhardt,1-932476-30-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return home ==
After Schäfer read a letter from his father who reported to him about the imminent threat of war, and urged him to return to Germany as quickly as possible, Schäfer decided to return to Germany. After being given two complimentary letters – one to Hitler and the other to Himmler, Schäfer and his companions left Lhasa in August 1939.&lt;ref name="activities" /&gt; They also took with them two presents for Hitler consisting of a Lhama dress and a hunting dog, as well as a copy of the Tibetan "Bible", the 120-volume [[Kangyur]]. They headed south to Calcutta, boarding a seaplane at the mouth of the [[Hooghly River]], and began the journey home.

According to Engelhardt:&lt;ref&gt;Engelhardt Isrun (2003), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bquote|From [[Calcutta]] the expedition first took a [[British Airways]] seaplane to [[Baghdad]], which developed engine trouble and was forced to make an emergency water landing in [[Karachi]]. In Baghdad they were fortunate to be able to continue their flight to [[Athens]] on a [[Lufthansa]] [[Junkers Ju 52|JU 52]]. They learned a few hours later that their previous British Airways seaplane had sunk off [[Alexandria]]. A surprise awaited them in Athens, where they boarded a special new aircraft that was placed at their disposal by the German government for their safe return home.}}

According to Trimondis at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] in Berlin, they were greeted on the runway by an ecstatic Heinrich Himmler&lt;ref name=Hale /&gt; who presented Schäfer with the SS [[Totenkopfring|skull ring]] and dagger of honor.&lt;ref&gt;Victor and Victoria Trimondi, [http://www.iivs.de/~iivs01311/SDLE/Part-2-12.htm The Shadow of the Dalai Lama – Part II – 12. Fascist occultism and its close relationship to Buddhist Tantrism]: "Upon his return in August 1939, the scientist was presented with the SS skull ring and dagger of honor in recognition."&lt;/ref&gt;

When grilled by US military intelligence in February 1946, Schäfer stated that after his return, he had a meeting with Himmler in which he outlined his plans to launch another expedition to Tibet in case of war. The idea was to win Tibet over to the German side and organize a resistance movement there.&lt;ref name="activities" /&gt; The project never took off.

After returning to Germany, Wienert, Krause and Geer went back to civilian life and were heard of no more.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cummins, ''History's great untold stories'', National Geographic, 2006, 367 p., p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Beger worked together with [[August Hirt]] at the [[Reichsuniversität Straßburg]]. His assignment, which he carried out, was to provide the Nazi physician with a selection of detainees of diverse ethnic types from Auschwitz in order to serve Hirt's racial experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle (2006), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John J. Reilly (2003): "The SS wanted racial classifications of its prisoners, so Beger was sent to Auschwitz to select interesting subjects (...). He made the familiar measurements of the living subjects. Soon after the measurements were taken, these people were gassed and pickled. The idea was to reduce them to skeletons for a large collection that could be systematically compared with the measurements taken from living bodies."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Schäfer was given his own institute within the [[Ahnenerbe]]. He named it "the [[Sven Hedin]] Institute for Inner Asian Research" after a Swedish explorer who visited Tibet in 1907.&lt;ref name="brewis" /&gt;

1943 also saw the release of the film ''Geheimnis Tibet'' put together from the various rolls brought back from Tibet. It premiered on January 16, during the inauguration of the Sven Hedin Institute, with the Swedish explorer himself in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Victor Trimondi and Victoria Trimondi, [http://www.iivs.de/~iivs01311/francais/film.fr..htm Le film SS « Le secret du Tibet »], ''Online Magazine'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the war, Schäfer's writings about the trip were not published until 1950, under the title "Festival of the White Gauze Scarves: A research expedition through Tibet to Lhasa, the holy city of the god realm."

All through the expedition, Beger kept a travel diary which was published in book form 60 years later, ''Mit der deutschen Tibetexpedition Ernst Schäfer 1938/39 nach Lhasa'' (Wiesbaden, 1998). Only 50 copies of it exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Detlev Rose (2006): "Bruno BEGER, ''Mit der deutschen Tibetexpedition Ernst Schäfer 1938/39 nach Lhasa'', Wiesbaden, 1998, page 6. Ce livre récapitule les notes du journal de voyage de Beger, réadaptées pour publication. Il n’a été tiré qu’à une cinquantaine d’exemplaires."&lt;/ref&gt;

After three days, the mourners ritualistically circle the grave three times, promising [[venison]] to the spirit, which is then brought when the grave is visited.

The [[psychopomp]]s [[Pinga]] and [[Anguta]] bring the souls of the dead to Adlivun, where they must stay for one year before moving on.

'''Athenian sacred ships''' were [[Classical Athens|ancient Athenian]] ships, often [[trireme]]s, which had special religious functions such as serving in sacred [[procession]]s (''theoria'') or embassies or racing in boat races during religious festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, ''Athenian Navy'', 154-157.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most famous such ships were the ''[[Paralus (ship)|Paralus]]'' and the ''[[Salaminia]]'', which also served as the messenger ships of the Athenian government in the 5th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, ''Athenian Navy'', 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable ships included one possibly named the ''Delias'', a ''triakonter'' (thirty-oared galley) believed to be the ship in which [[Theseus]] had sailed to [[Crete]], and which was involved in several traditional theoria to [[Delos]]; the vessel was constantly repaired by replacing individual planks to keep it seaworthy while maintaining its identity as the same [[ship]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, ''Athenian Navy'', 160-161.&lt;/ref&gt; (For the philosophical question of the ship's identity, see [[Ship of Theseus]].) After the reforms of [[Cleisthenes]], a ship was named for each of the ten tribes that political leader had created; these ships may also have been sacred ships.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, ''Athenian Navy'', 179; see however Lewis, ''Athenian Navy'', 71, for scholarly caution on expanding the number of sacred ships too far.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Paralus'' and the ''Salaminia'', and possibly some other sacred ships, served in the Athenian combat fleet. Those two vessels, being particularly swift, were used as scout and messenger ships, but also fought in the line of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, ''Athenian Navy'', 158-159, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Paralus'' and ''Salaminia'', meanwhile, also performed various tasks for the government; the ''Paralus'' appears to have carried most diplomatic missions,&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, ''Athenian Navy'', 173.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Salaminia'' carried official state messages;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, ''Athenian Navy'', 166.&lt;/ref&gt; most famously, it was sent to arrest [[Alcibiades]] while that politician was commanding the [[Sicilian Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'' [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 6/6:53|6.53]].&lt;/ref&gt; These two triremes also had dedicated treasurers, or ''tamiai''.&lt;ref&gt;Treasurers for the Paralus and another sacred vessel, the ''Ammonias'', are attested at Aristotle, ''Constitution of the Athenians'', [[s:Ath. Pol.#61|61]]; and most modern scholars, believing that the ''Ammonias'' had replaced the ''Salaminia'', assign a treasurer to the ''Salaminia'' as well (see Lewis, ''Athenian Navy'', 71), although Jordan (''Athenian Navy'', 167, 177) disagrees and assigns the treasurer only to the ''Ammonias''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bluetongue Lizard''' is an old man in Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] mythology. He is a [[trickster]] and a powerful [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] as well.  The myth involving him is the wellspring of the [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] fire ceremonies. He is often regarded as a deity, but this notion is not exactly true.

== Story ==
Bluetongue Lizard had two sons, and the three of them camped in the Place of Fire, which was known as Warlukurlangu. He pretended he was [[Blindness|blind]] so his sons would [[hunting|hunt]] for him. However, once they were gone, he would leave to hunt his own food, which he ate on the spot. The place he went hunting was Ngama, also known as the Cave of the Rainbow Snake. It was there he gained his sorcery skills. One day, the two sons went hunting and killed a [[kangaroo]], which they presented to their father to eat. The two sons did not know this kangaroo was sacred and used to speak to Bluetongue Lizard, telling him secrets. Upon learning of the kangaroo's slaying, Bluetongue Lizard was filled with rage and summoned a magic [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]], sending it after his sons. The fire followed them wherever they went. It would die down at night, but start up again in the morning, driving Bluetongue Lizard's sons around all of the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Tjukurrpa]]. Finally, the sons stopped at the Ngarra [[salt lake]] and drowned there, too fatigued to go on.&lt;ref name=Philip&gt;{{cite book |last=Philip |first=Neil |title=Mythology of the World |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=07PuhprzBP4C&amp;dq=Mythology+of+the+World&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CG3EUegqlNvgA_iHgNgJ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA|location=Boston, MA|year=2004 |publisher=Kingfisher |page=135 |isbn=978-0-7534-0964-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect ==
The [[Warlpiri people]] recapture the spirit of Bluetongue Lizard with dramatic fire ceremonies that involve a young male dancer emerging from total darkness into the glow of a ceremonial fire. The dancer selected moves carefully and willingly and then kneels by the fire, shaking his shoulders. He takes brushes from the fire and proceeds to scatter the [[ember]]s over his back.  The Warlpiri [[elder (administrative title)|elder]]s walk by the youth to coach him in the proper performance of the dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moreton|first=Romaine|title=Blood Brothers - Jardiwarnpa|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/documentaries/jardiwarnpa-blood-brothers/clip3/|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ngarra is one of the most [[sacred]] sites of the Warlpiri &amp;ndash; so sacred, only men are permitted to go there.&lt;ref name=Philip /&gt;

{{Joseph Smith, Jr.}}

The children of [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith Jr.]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], and his wife [[Emma Smith]], are historically significant because of their roles in establishing and leading the [[Latter Day Saint Movement]], which includes [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church, now called [[Community of Christ]]), [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]] (Bickertonite), the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)|Church of Christ]] (Temple Lot) and [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|several other sects]].  Several Latter Day Saint sects, including the RLDS believed that leadership of the church would flow through Smith's descendants, ([[Lineal succession (Latter Day Saints)|Lineal succession]]).  In 1860, [[Joseph Smith III]] became its prophet and president of the RLDS Church. The larger LDS Church was led following Joseph's death by Brigham Young.

Joseph Smith publicly condemned [[polygamy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitmer|1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n06.htm ''Times and Seasons'', Volume 5, page 474]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n03.htm ''Times and Seasons'', Volume 5, page 423]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Latter-Day Saints' Millennial Star'' 4 [January 1844]: 144&lt;/ref&gt; but there is ample evidence that Smith both taught in its favor and practiced it, had a number of wives sealed to him. "The number of Smith's polygamous offspring is a bit of a mystery. "Several women later did testify that they were wives in the full sense of the word.  Emily D. P. Partidge said she 'roomed' with him, and Melissa Lott Willes testified that she was his wife 'in very deed.'&lt;/ref&gt; Though there were allegations of paternity in some of these polygamous marriages, no children have ever been proven to be Smith's. There is ongoing genetic research to determine if any descendants of alleged children have Smith's genetic markers, and so far all tests have been negative, so this list only contains his children with Emma or adopted &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perego|Myers|Woodward|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title =  Research focuses on Smith family | date = 2005-05-28 | work = [[Deseret News]] | url = http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,600137517,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title = DNA tests rule out 2 as Smith descendants: Scientific advances prove no genetic link | date = 2007-11-10 | work = [[Deseret News]] | url = http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226318,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormontimes.com/ME_familyhistory.php?id=471 Moore, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7523">'''Demonization''' is the reinterpretation of [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities as [[evil]], lying [[demon]]s by other [[religion]]s, generally [[monotheism|monotheistic]] and [[henotheistic]] ones. The term has since been expanded to refer to any characterization of individuals, groups, or political bodies as evil.

== Religion ==
Religions, even those that are radically monotheistic, do not necessarily deny the existence of other gods or spiritual beings. On the contrary, they claim other [[deity|gods]] are not worthy of worship and in actuality are demons who mislead followers from proper belief or practice. [[Christian]] [[missionaries]] often employed demonization tactics when converting [[pagan]]s, although [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and other religions have similar histories. Demonization is not limited to focusing on other religions but can also be directed inward to condemn various schools of thought or movements. 

From a secular viewpoint, demonization can be used to denigrate an opposed individual or group, making adherents to your own religion or viewpoint less inclined to do business with them (and possibly convert) and more inclined to fight against them. If foreigners are evil and corrupted by demonic influence, then any means of self-defense is easily portrayed as legitimate. The portrayal of almost all pagans in the Middle East as [[Baal]]-worshippers in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;"Ye shall destroy their [[altar]]s, and break in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their groves, and the [[Idolatry|graven images]] of their gods ye shall burn with fire." [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and [[donkey|ass]], with the edge of the sword." [[Joshua]] 6:21&lt;/ref&gt; If pagans are corrupted by the demon-"god" Baal, then clearly they must be fought or at least oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;"Demons in the Old Testament", Dennis Bratcher, 2006, retrieved 6 May 207.[http://www.crivoice.org/demonsot.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the earlier books of the Hebrew Bible, foreign deities are portrayed as existing and corrupting entities rather than being mere powerless [[idolatry|idols]]. Some would argue this later transferred to Christianity after [[Constantine I]]'s ascension in its [[persecution of Ancient Roman religion|suppression of Roman paganism]].&lt;ref name="jerome"/&gt; Some of the most known of these demonizations are [[Lucifer]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Baphomet]] up to the extend that they became [[synonym]] for the [[devil]]/[[satan]] of [[Abrahamic religions]]. Later, the language of demonization would be invoked during the [[Spanish Inquisition]], leading to the expulsion of [[Jews]] and [[Morisco]]s from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;"Edict of the Expulsion of the Jews", 1492, Translated from the Castilian by Edward Peters, retrieved 6 May 2007.[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/decree.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of early Judaism treating foreign deities as devils and later Judaism treating them as non-existent is not universal. Psalms 96:5, for example, is alternately translated as, "For all the Gods of the gentiles are nothing," "For all the Gods of the gentiles are devils" ([[Vulgate]]), and "For all the gods of the peoples are idols."([[NRSV]]) The Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of that passage, used by the early Christian Church, used the "devils" version.&lt;ref name="jerome"&gt;"The Greek [[Septuagint]] translated into English", Psalm 95:5, translated by Sir Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton, 1851.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] would follow the Greek text rather than the Hebrew when he translated the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] edition of the Bible. The "devils" epithet would still appear in Bibles up until the end of the 20th century when the consensus reverted to the original Hebrew text for modern translations.

Analogs to demonization exist outside monotheistic religions, as well. [[Polytheism]] easily accepts foreign gods in general, and in times of conflict, a foreign nation's gods would sometimes be portrayed as evil. Less commonly, it would be applied to other religions as well. For example, Buddha's portrayal in Hinduism varies: Some strains of [[Hinduism]] consider the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] an [[Buddha from the Hindu perspective|incarnation of Vishnu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cuhcs/info.faq.php Cambridge University Hindu Cultural Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203192324/http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cuhcs/info.faq.php |date=3 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some texts such as the [[Puranas]], he is portrayed as an avatar born to mislead those who deny the Vedic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Holt2008p18"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Clifford Holt|title=The Buddhist Viṣṇu: Religious Transformation, Politics, and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvuDlhpvvHwC&amp;pg=PA18 |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-3269-5|pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p96"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D. Ryan|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2006|publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The reverse is found in Buddhist texts which similarly caricature Hindu sacred figures. According to Alf Hiltebeitel and other scholars, some of the stories in Buddha-related Jataka tales found in Pali texts seem slanderous distortions of Hindu legends, but these may reflect the ancient local traditions and the complexities of early interaction between the two Indian religions.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel1990p64"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=The Ritual of Battle: Krishna in the Mahabharata|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vwWGX08JAx8C|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0250-4|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In a certain way, the demonization had sometimes a positive side. For example, during [[Catholic missions]] in [[South America]], the demonization of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] beliefs or acts make those peoples be regarded as so [[Human nature|human]] as the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Puls, M. (2015). Cristianismo negociado. ''Pesquisa FAPESP'' 237: 86-89 (in Portuguese), [http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/2015/11/17/cristianismo-negociado/].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political conflicts ===
Demonization is sometimes used against what are arguably political opponents rather than religious ones. The [[Knights Templar]] were destroyed by accusations that they worshipped [[Baphomet]] from King [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Baphomet, often thought to be [[Beelzebub]], may have been used because of the likeness of this [[horn (anatomy)|horned]] deity with the Christian images of [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_pent.htm " Pentacles and Pentagrams", Religious Tolerance, retrieved 6 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Baphomet |volume=3 |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
In colloquial usage, the term demonization is used metaphorically to refer to [[propaganda]] or [[moral panic]] directed against any individual or group.

'''Germanos Adam''' (born in 1725 in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] - died on 10 November 1809 in [[Zouk Mikael]], [[Lebanon]]) was the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Catholic]] [[bishop]] of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Aleppo]] during the late 18th century and a [[Christian theologian]].

==Life==
Germanos Adam was born in 1725&lt;ref name="Raquez"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raquez |first=Olivier |editor=Metzler J. |title=Sacrae Congregationis de Propaganda Fide Memoria Rerum |volume=III/2 |year=1976 |publisher=Herder |isbn=3-451-16354-3 |chapter=Rapports avec les Eglises Orientales |page=4÷5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], and studied in the [[College of the Propaganda]] in [[Rome]]. In December 1774 he was appointed eparch and on December 25 of the same year consecrated Melkite Catholic eparch of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] by [[Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East|Melkite Patriarch of Antioch]], [[Theodosius V Dahan]]. In July 1777 he became archbishop of Aleppo; anyway due to the persecution by the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]] he dwelt for most of his life in [[Zouk Mikael]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="DHGE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Vailhé S. |title=Adam (Germain) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionnaire d'histoire et de géographie ecclésiastiques]] |volume=1 |pages=494–495 |publisher=Letouzey et Ané |location=Paris |year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1792 to 1798 he traveled in [[Italy]], where he came in contact with [[Jansenist]] circles and in particular with [[Scipione de' Ricci]].
Returned to Syria he was highly esteemed by Patriarch [[Agapius II Matar]] and played an important role in the 1806 Melkite Catholic Church's [[synod]] in Qarqafe (or ''Karkafeh'').
Germanos Adam died in Zouk Mikael on 10 November 1809.&lt;ref name="DHGE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/alep0.htm gcatholic.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
The doctrine of Germanos Adam was deeply influenced by the theological works of the 18th century [[Gallicanism|Gallicans]] and [[Jansenist]]s (like [[Febronius]]), which he read during his studies in Rome, and mainly by his 1792-8 travel in Italy where he became friend of the Jansenist Scipione de' Ricci.
Consequently, in his 1799 book ''"Réponse de Mgr Germain Adam éveque d'Alep et de ses environs à l'ouvrage intitulé: Voix des Perés missionaires"'' Adam supported the doctrine of [[Conciliarism]], and stated that the [[papal]] authority was more honorary than actual.&lt;ref name="Frazee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazee| first=Charles A.|title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453–1923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further he affirmed that an explicit [[epiclesis]] was essential in the [[Eucharistic]] consecration, a statement that implied the non-validity of the [[Latin Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref name="Frazee"/&gt;

His works were attacked by the [[Maronite]] Patriarch [[Joseph Tyan]] who in March 1801 wrote an [[encyclical]] to his faithfuls against Adam's ideas, but the Melkite Patriarch [[Agapius II Matar]] in June 1801 defended the doctrine of Adam as correct. Moreover, Germanos Adam wrote a [[catechism]] that was used for popular instruction. Adam's doctrine was confirmed by the 1806 Melkite [[synod]] of Qarqafe, which acts were signed also by Patriarch Joseph Tyen and by Aloisio Gandolfi, the [[Apostolic Legate]].

The next years were marked by the reaction to his ideas. Adam himself made amends for the [[sacrament]]al part of his work and before he died he humbly submitted all his works to [[Papacy|Rome]] for examination. In 1812 a formal condemnation of the Jansenist and Gallican doctrine, issued by [[Propaganda Fide]], was signed by all the [[Eastern Catholic Church]]es. On 3 June 1816 [[Pope Pius VII]] condemned Adam's works and his catechism.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, Adrian and George D. Smith, ''The Uniate Eastern Churches'', (First Giorgas Press, 2001), 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The actions of the 1806 Melkite Synod of Qarqafe were finally condemned by the [[Ecclesiastical letter#Letters of the Popes in modern times|Apostolic Letter]] ''Melchitarum Catholicorum Synodus'' ({{lang-en|Of the synod of Melkite Catholics}}) issued by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on 3 June 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PUsXAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=RA1-PA242#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Melchitarum Catholicorum synodus'']: full text available online {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2171">The '''Grand Imam of al-Azhar'''  ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الإمام الأكبر), also known as '''Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: شيخ الأزهر الشريف), currently [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], is a prestigious [[Sunni Islam]] title and a prominent official title in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beattie|2000|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered by some Muslims to be the highest authority in Sunni Islamic thought and [[Islamic jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|2005|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holds a great influence on followers of the theological [[Ash'ari]] and [[Maturidi]] traditions worldwide. The Grand Imam Heads the [[al-Azhar Mosque]], and by extension [[al-Azhar University]], and is responsible for official religious matters along with the [[Grand Mufti of Egypt]].

==History of the title==
The title of the '''Grand Imam of al-Azhar''' was officially established in 1961. In the 14th century the head of al-Azhar was granted the title of ''Mushrif of al-Azhar'', then later ''Nazir  of Al-Azhar''&lt;ref name=dodge83&gt;{{harvnb|Dodge|1961|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, during the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar. Today the holder of the title also carries the title of the Grand Sheikh.

== ''Haibutsu kishaku'' in history ==
An early example of ''haibutsu kishaku'' is the [[Mononobe clan]]'s [[Persecution of Buddhists|anti-Buddhist]] policies during the time of Buddhism's early introduction to Japan in the [[Kofun period]].&lt;ref name="EOS.HK"/&gt; The Mononobe were opposed to the spread of Buddhism not on religious grounds, but rather because of nationalism and xenophobia. The [[Nakatomi clan]], ancestors of the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]], were allies of the Mononobe in their opposition to Buddhism.

Another example is the policies of temple closure and monk defrocking of the [[Okayama Domain|Okayama]], [[Aizu Domain|Aizu]], and [[Mito Domain]]s, also adopted for political and economic, rather than religious, reasons during the early modern period.&lt;ref name="EOS.HK"/&gt; These [[Han (country subdivision)|domain]]al policies were in general based on [[Confucianism|Confucian]] anti-Buddhist thought.&lt;ref name="EOS.HK"/&gt; The Meiji period form of ''haibutsu kishaku'', based on [[kokugaku]] and Shinto-centrism, was instead dictated by a desire to distinguish between foreign Buddhism and a purely Japanese Shinto.&lt;ref name="EOS.HK"/&gt;

== ''Haibutsu kishaku'' during the Meiji Restoration ==
[[File:Nagane Tanaka Haibutsu Kishaku.jpg|thumb|left|Temple bells being smelted for bronze during the ''haibutsu kishaku'']]
The ''haibutsu kishaku'' during the [[Meiji Restoration]], the most famous instance of the phenomenon, was an event triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (or ''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'') &lt;ref name="EOS.HK"/&gt; that after 1868 caused great damage to Buddhism in Japan. The destruction of Buddhist property took place on a large scale all over the country. For example, [[Kōfuku-ji]] in Nara suffered greatly. The temple, which is now a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]], was hit with full force by the movement. The temple's land was seized, the priests forced to become Shinto priests, walls were torn down, trees were planted, and the area became part of one of the city's parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=www.japannavigator.com

Between 1872 and 1874, 18 thousand temples were eradicated, and maybe as many again from 1868 to 1872.&lt;ref name="Breen"/&gt; Japanologist Martin Collcutt believes Japanese Buddhism was on the verge of total eradication.&lt;ref name="Breen"&gt;{{cite book

The violence had just released pent-up popular anger at the Buddhists which had been brewing for centuries because of their close alliance with the Tokugawa in the [[Danka system|''danka'' system]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press_kits/2006/kyoto/bg_foundation.pdf Releasing the Spirit of Kyoto: Historical Background]{{dead link|date=September 2013}} accessed on March 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; an alliance from which the religion had derived immense benefit. Although the shogunate's official philosophy was lay [[Neo-Confucianism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willamette.edu/~rloftus/neoconfucianism.html Ronald Loftus, Willamette University - Neoconfucianism], accessed on March 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism had become an integral part of the state as a consequence of the Tokugawa's anti-Christian policy. To stop the propagation of the Christian religion, they had introduced the ''danka'' system, which obliged families to affiliate themselves with a Buddhist temple&lt;ref name="review"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120207151137/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/itinerario/bookreviews-16.html Paul B. Watt, Review of ''Nam-Lin Hur, Death and Social Order in Tokugawa Japan: Buddhism, Anti-Christianity, and the Danka System''], Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; and, in return, this would certify that they were not Christian. Without this certification a normal life in Tokugawa Japan was impossible.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; Because of this, temples could and often would blackmail parishioners.&lt;ref name="hur"&gt;Nam-Lin Hur, Death and social order in Tokugawa Japan: Buddhism, anti-Christianity, and the danka system, Harvard University Asia Center, 2007; pp. 1-30 (The Rise of Funerary Buddhism in Tokugawa Japan). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120331070517/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/publications/pdfs/Hur%20intro.pdf Internet archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[danka system|''danka'' system]] families had by law several obligations towards Buddhist institutions, among them monetary donations to their affiliated temple.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; Because there were some 100,000 temples in a country of 30 million people, on average 300 persons had to support a temple, so the burden was considerable.&lt;ref name="hur"/&gt;  Buddhism, as an institution, had a vested interest in the shogunate system, and therefore became a target of all the parties working for the downfall of the shogunate.

There were definite political and economic motivations too, in that the domainal governments wanted to restore public finances at Buddhists's expense, and the ''shinbutsu bunri'' offered a pretext to appropriate Buddhist lands.&lt;ref name="EOS.HK"/&gt;

It is estimated that 40,000 Buddhist temples were destroyed in Japan during this disastorous nationwide anti-Buddhist mayhem, and in certain places the percentage of Buddhist temples destroyed reached 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=rz2wCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=japan+destroyed+40,000+temples&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xHes1RH_nY&amp;sig=CJuhBQY5HUH5Ojg3DIAiPnC5kwk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPm-rZjr3RAhWMqY8KHaEzCIYQ6AEIGDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=japan%20destroyed%2040%2C000%20temples&amp;f=false | title=Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhism: Myōshinji, a living religion
| author=Jørn Borup | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to estimate how many temples were closed during the turmoil, because it seems likely that many disappeared simply because Buddhist authorities, taking advantage of the fall of the Tokugawa, were trying to streamline the system and eliminate redundancies.&lt;ref name="ananda"&gt;Jason Ānanda Josephson, When Buddhism Became a “Religion”, Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 33 (1), 143-168, 2006. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131229183011/http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2889 Internet archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the shogunate, obtaining the permission to open or close a temple had not been easy. However, the complete disappearance of Buddhist temples from domains like [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] was indeed due to the ''haibutsu kishaku''.&lt;ref name="ananda"/&gt;

'''Hinduism in Ghana''' was first introduced by [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] [[Sindhi diaspora|settlers]] who migrated to [[Ghana]] after India was divided in 1947.&lt;ref name="Ghana's unique African-Hindu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71304.htm International freedom Report 2006] - US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; It was spread to Ghana actively by [[Hindu Monastery of Africa|Ghana's Hindu Monastery]] headed by [[Swami Ghanananda (Ghana)|Swami Ghananand Saraswati]]&lt;ref name="Ghana's unique African-Hindu"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/10401741.stm Ghana's unique African-Hindu temple - BBC News] By [[Rajesh Joshi]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON).

==Population==
In 2009, of the 12,500 Hindus in Ghana, 10,000 are indigenous Africans. [[Swami Ghanananda (Ghana)|Swami Ghananand Saraswati]] has set up five temples in Ghana which have been the cornerstone of the African Hindu Monastery (AHM). The Indian community in Ghana participates in the AHM, but also has its own temples (most for the [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] community).&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf Indians in Ghana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206063957/http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf |date=2012-02-06 }} - Indian Diaspora&lt;/ref&gt; ISKCON also has a fairly large presence in the nation, as do [[Guru-shishya tradition|śishya]] (disciples) of [[Sathya Sai Baba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehelka.com/story_main42.asp?filename=hub150809the_swami.asp The Swami Of Accra] Tehelka - August 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is the fastest growing religion in Ghana.&lt;ref name="Ghana's unique African-Hindu"/&gt;

==Beliefs and practices of Ghanaian Hindus==
Aside from the basic beliefs of Reincarnation and Karma that are attributed to a vast majority of Hindus, Ghanaian followers of Hindu tradition have a few specific beliefs and practices that are primarily emphasized. First and foremost, the primary indication that a person in Ghana is a believer of the Hindu faith is that he or she has made the decision to not include meat in their diet. This is considered a primary indicator because other Hindu practices such as prohibition from illicit sex and abstinence from alcohol are also commonly demanded by other Ghanaian religions, while the avoidance of meat is rather unusual. Ghanaian Hindus tend to avoid meat consumption due to the belief that every life is sacred and manifestation of supreme God. Eating consciously when other sources of food are available in order not to harm anyone. Stemming from this idea, the second defining belief of Hindus in Ghana is the notion that cows are sacred beings that must not be harmed, but rather revered. This belief comes from the understanding that when the Hindu deity Krishna was incarnated on Earth, he came as a cowherd. Also, the Vedic Hindu Goddess [[Aditi]] is portrayed as a cow who's milk is identified with the invigorating drink "soma" which is believed to nourish creation. This Ghanaian Hindu belief is also a defining one, as not only do a majority of Ghanaians eat cow's meat daily, but the remaining resources from the cow's body are also commonly used for other practical tasks in traditional Ghanaian lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Wuaku, Albert. 2009.

An '''independent minyan''' is a lay-led [[Judaism|Jewish]] worship and study community that has developed independently of established denominational and synagogue structures within the organized Jewish community.  Some began in the late 1990s and most since the year 2000,&lt;ref name="EK"&gt;[http://allianceforcre.org/acre-conferences/20089-acre-conference/conference-summary/independent-minyanim Speech by Elie Kaunfer, Nov. 9, 2009, at the Alliance for Continuing Rabbinic Education (ACRE).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524001620/http://allianceforcre.org/acre-conferences/20089-acre-conference/conference-summary/independent-minyanim |date=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though some are several decades older.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtoncentreminyan.org/&lt;/ref&gt; These new groups often combine a commitment to [[halakha]]/Jewish law with [[egalitarianism]], and strive to create worship services where traditional prayer can become "spiritual experiences."&lt;ref name="EK"/&gt;

The name, [[minyan]], comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ('''מנין''') for the prayer quorum traditionally required for a full Jewish prayer service.

==Independent minyan phenomenon==
[[File:DCMinyan Hanukkah.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Members of the [[DC Minyan]] light candles in celebration of the Festival of [[Hanukkah]].]]
Scholars of religion are looking very closely at the development of these lay-led congregations, most of which are held in locations other than synagogues, although some use synagogue space while maintaining separate leadership and organizational structures.  Some synagogue and Jewish community leaders take a negative position on this development, seeing the new groups as a threat to conventional synagogue and Jewish community organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/28/us/28minyan.html?_r=1 "Challenging Tradition, Young Jews Worship on Their Terms," New York Times, Nov 28, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are those who view the trend as extremely positive, and one that will ultimately lead to new approaches to religion and spirituality within the modern Jewish community: a "triumphant story of day-school education and egalitarianism."&lt;ref name="JI"&gt;[http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/detail/continue-reading-a-minyan-grows-in-washington-dc Jack Wertheimer, "Vital Signs: A Minyan Grows in Washington, D.C.," ''Jewish Ideas Daily,'' April 29, 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503174411/http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/detail/continue-reading-a-minyan-grows-in-washington-dc |date=May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Jack Wertheimer]], a Professor of Jewish History at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] has written that:

{{quote|For some who take a longer view, the independent minyanim seem reminiscent of the [[Chavurah|Havurah movement]] of the 1970s, when numbers of young American Jews rejected the suburban synagogues of their parents in favor of small-group gatherings for study, prayer, and community.  Commenting on the parallels between then and now, the scholar Riv-Ellen Prell has also underscored the differences.  One salient difference is today's higher level of Jewish and Hebrew fluency, itself a testament to the organized community's investment in intensive Jewish education over the past two decades.
 
The historical moment is also different; members of today's independent minyanim are not counter-cultural types in rebellion against their parents or committed to smashing existing institutions but a generation that is at once self-sufficient and open to compromise. An example of the newer spirit is the DC Minyan's commitment to separate seating, an infringement on the principle of strict sexual egalitarianism that is maintained for the sake of accommodating the group's diverse population. In the present moment, pluralism is valued over purity.&lt;ref name="JI"/&gt;}}

==Nomenclature==

Some sources refer to the "independent minyan movement", drawing a parallel between the increasing number of independent minyanim and the past creation of established Jewish denominations (known as "movements").  Others reject the "movement" terminology and refer instead to the "independent minyan phenomenon" or simply to "independent minyanim" without a collective noun, because independent minyanim are not affiliated with a set of central organizations, and do not share a religious ideology.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewschool'', December 14, 2008, [http://jewschool.com/2008/12/14/14341/independent-minyan-conference-closing-plenary/ "Independent Minyan Conference closing plenary"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others still refer to the "independent minyan movement", understanding "movement" not in the sense of [[Jewish religious movements]], but in the sense of [[social movement]]s (such as the [[civil rights movement]], or more closely parallel, the [[havurah]] movement); or a community/cultural movement, such as the [[Jewish Community Center]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web |url=http://www.jcca.org/about_us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104074527/http://www.jcca.org/about_us.html |archivedate=2011-01-04 |df= }} "About JCC Association," which includes a description of the "JCC Movement" dating back to 1854, with the opening of the first [[Young Men's Hebrew Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Others reject this sense of "movement" as well, because the connotation of "movement" among some members of the American Jewish community is too strongly related to its use regarding "denominations" (a fact that has led to confusion in the case of the havurah movement), and because independent minyanim arise for a number of different reasons, so that not all can be attributed to the same "movement".

Some (see "2007 Spiritual Communities Study," below) have argued for incorporating the independent minyan model as a subcategory of a broader "Jewish Emergent" phenomenon (named after a parallel movement in the Christian church). "Jewish emergent" encompasses both the independent minyan movement&lt;ref&gt;"Turned off by Traditional Services, Young Jews Form New Prayer Groups." Jewish Telegraphic Agency, September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and so-called "rabbi-led emergent" communities, such as [[IKAR (Jewish congregation)|IKAR]] and [[Kavana Cooperative|Kavana]].

==Characteristics==
Rabbi [[Elie Kaunfer]], executive director of [[Yeshivat Hadar|Mechon Hadar]] and a [[rosh yeshiva]] (Rabbinic dean) of Yeshivat Hadar has defined today's "independent minyan" as a congregation meeting three requirements: (1) volunteer-led and organized with no paid clergy; (2) no denomination/movement affiliation; and (3) founded in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="EK"/&gt; Kaunfer adds the goal of "spiritual prayer" to this list, noting that he himself often experienced worship services more as a "community experience" than as a "spiritual one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/arts/books/get_serious_about_your_jewish_life_interview_elie_kaunfer "Get Serious About Your Jewish Life: An Interview with Elie Kaunfer," The New York Jewish Week, April 7, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaunfer notes that [[Kehilat Hadar]] began in New York as a result of a number of young Jews who were "looking for new ways to connect to the substance of their religion and tradition"—but instead of becoming "just a local minyan," "it became a model of grassroots religious community that spread dramatically across the United States and Israel. That model of community came to be known as an "independent minyan."&lt;ref name="EK"/&gt; An article on [[Kol Zimrah]], another independent minyan on New York's Upper West Side, called many of the new independent minyans "part of what some have called a Jewish spiritual renaissance, with its emphasis on personal spirituality and connection with the divine."
&lt;ref name="Michaelson"&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/7093 Jay Michaelson, "A Prayer Group of Their Own: Kol Zimrah and Other Do-It-Yourself Minyans Unite the Independent Minded," The Forward, Nov 14, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaunfer emphasizes that the word "independent" means that many of these groups developed independently in terms of volunteers coming together to create and lead it, but—in agreement with Wertheimer's assessment of these minyanim—they are not nor do they seek to be independent of the larger Jewish community in terms of their vision or self-identity. "Quite the contrary," he says, "they see themselves filling a need not being met by existing institutions, but operating within the larger Jewish map, not outside or against it."&lt;ref name="EK"/&gt;

In his view, the phenomenon represented by the increasingly large number of independent minyans (Hebrew: minyanim) on both the national and international scene carries an important message for Jewish community leaders:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among American Jews, there is a significant demand for meaningful, engaged Jewish life. There is a temptation to assume that Jews – especially young adults – are only interested in surface level engagement with Jewish culture: jokes, bagels, singles events. Anything challenging, deep or smacking of religion might scare people away. This is simply not the case. Jews are in search of meaning and engagement, and they are interested in the wisdom of their own heritage. They may not find that engagement in existing institutions, but that does not mean they aren't looking for it. They are looking for more than a class; they want to build real community. They want substance, and they want the skills to own their Jewish lives.&lt;ref name="EK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experts like [[Jonathan Sarna]], professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, agree, noting that the values that participants are bringing to these groups can add a new vision to the community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is an interesting mix between the egalitarian, pluralistic, inclusive values coming from the left and the values of learning and of observance coming from the right. They are making a new synthesis of these traditional and modern values that we haven't seen before.&lt;ref name="Salmon"&gt;[http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/jun/06/new-judaism Jackquelin L. Salmon, "New Judaism," ''Washington Post'', June 6, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ari Kelman, a professor of American studies at the University of California at Davis, predicts that, "They are going to have a huge impact, because we are living in a moment where denominations are really not very successful, particularly with these 20- and 30-somethings."&lt;ref name="Salmon"/&gt;

===2007 Spiritual Communities Study===

In 2007, [[Hebrew Union College]] [[sociologist]] [http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/SteveCohen.shtml Steven Cohen] conducted a survey on behalf of the S3K Synagogue Studies Institute and Mechon Hadar.&lt;ref name="SCS"&gt;[http://www.minyannaaleh.org/uploads/1/7/7/2/1772619/jta-11-30-07.pdf Sue Fishkoff, "First Study of Independent minyans: Young Jews Praying on Own Terms," JTA, Nov 30, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on 1354 responses to an [http://www.jewishemergent.org/survey/documents/NatSpirComStudy_SurveyInstrument.pdf online questionnaire], the study, co-authored by [[Shawn Landres]], Elie Kaunfer, and Michelle Shain, found that social networking, not institutional structures, was the primary way that information about independent minyans spread.  Additional findings included the fact that participants that the majority of participants had some day school education, or experience in Jewish summer camps, or college organizations like Hillel; 40% grew up in the Conservative movement; most were unmarried, and under 40; one third were male, and two thirds female; and most were "comfortable in Hebrew."  More than half of the respondents had spent more than four months in Israel.  Additionally, most attended services at least once a month, and two thirds prayed with more than one congregation.&lt;ref name="SCS"/&gt;

In terms of affiliation with one of the religious movements within Judaism, the study found that:

{{quote|Many minyan participants raised Orthodox or Conservative still identify as such, even if the minyan itself is not institutionally affiliated. But virtually all of those who were raised Reform no longer identify with that religious stream: Less than 3% of those involved with independent minyanim consider themselves Reform Jews.&lt;ref name="SCS"/&gt;}}

While the study's findings are subject to interpretation, it is clear that the majority of participants in independent minyanim have benefited from the institutions and programs of the organized Jewish community, but are now seeking to add something new:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can see the growth of independent minyanim as proof of the failure, or of the success, of the established U.S. Jewish community's efforts to keep the next generation involved. Those efforts include the expansion of Jewish day schools, of the on-campus Hillel movement for Jewish students, and of programs in Israel for young Jews. Independent minyan members, much more than other American Jews, are alumni of all these programs. The 2007 study showed that over half had spent four months or more in Israel for a single visit -- far above the proportion for the wider Jewish community. Yet they haven't found their place in the established synagogues. They're likely to say they are "nondenominational" -- a term usually, and mistakenly, taken as meaning that someone is drifting away from Judaism. Instead, they've created a traditional Judaism with an anarchic accent, in which participants expect rabbis to teach them but not to lead their services or be religious in their place.&lt;ref name="GG"&gt;[http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=a_fresh_take_on_the_jewish_faith Gershom Goremberg, "A Fresh Take on the Jewish Faith: A new community of American Judaism is embracing religious traditionalism and social liberalism," The American Prospect, March 12, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is also clear that participants in the minyans support the idea of Jewish community, in the United States and abroad, but think for themselves. So, for example, the study showed that the majority felt "very emotionally attached to Israel," but only the minority answered yes to the question of whether they are "always" proud of Israel.&lt;ref name="GG"/&gt;

==Tradition and egalitarianism==
[[File:Tikkun Leil Purim.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Members of independent minyan [[Tikkun Leil Shabbat]] celebrate the Jewish holiday of  [[Purim]]]]

Many independent minyanim seek approaches within traditional Jewish law as foundation for egalitarianism, and an expanded role of women both in the worship service and in the leadership structure.  Jerusalem's Kehilat Shira Hadasha is credited as being the first Jewish congregation to implement an opinion by [[Modern Orthodox]] Rabbi [[Mendel Shapiro]], whose writing, [http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/1_2_shapiro.pdf  "Qeri’at ha-Torah by Women: A Halakhic Analysis"],&lt;ref&gt;Mendel Shapiro, [http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/1_2_shapiro.pdf  "Qeri’at ha-Torah by Women: A Halakhic Analysis," Edah 1:2, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt; cites and explains some precedents for allowing women to read from the Torah. (Some minyanim, like the [http://leader-minyan.helping.org.il Leader Minyan], also in Jerusalem, had a similar practice since the 1990s, before Rabbi Shapiro's opinion was released.)

Another Modern Orthodox rabbi whose writings are frequently cited by minyanim like Shira Hadasha is [[Daniel Sperber]].  Like Shapiro, Sperber argues in [http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/3_2_Sperber.pdf "Congregational Dignity and Human Dignity: Women and Public Torah Reading"] that many past opinions recognized that there was religious legal support for the increased participation of women, but that this participation was not allowed because it was considered in societal/sociologial terms to be an "affront to the congregation" (Hebrew: kevod ha-tsibur).  Based on changes in society—at least within the context of the communities that make up some specific minyanim—rabbis like Shapiro and Sperber support such participation as no longer being an affront to the participants.  Furthermore, Sperber argues that human dignity (Hebrew: kevod ha beriyot) should be recognized as the value that should drive changes in the participation of women in services.&lt;ref&gt;The Edah Journal, 1:2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the positions of rabbis like Shapiro and Sperber have been criticized by some others, Shapiro responds that, "Among Jews there have been disputes throughout all the generations."&lt;ref name="critics"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3262945,00.html Neta Sela, "Battle Over Women's Rights to Pray: Jerusalem Synagogue 'Shira Hadasha' Stirs Controversy After Permitting Women to Join Minyan," Israel Jewish Scene, June 14, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Shapiro, who himself prays at Shira Hadasha, adds, "This is a synagogue where the congregants are people who are interested in religious development. We don't want to harm anyone, and we don't want others to harm us."&lt;ref name="critics"/&gt;

In addition to its early use of opinions like those of Shapiro and Sperber, Shira Hadasha is also generally recognized as the first independent minyan to come up with the hybrid of tradition and egalitarianism that adds to the prayer quorum requirement of ten men the additional requirement of ten women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shirahadasha.com/Shira_Hadasha/Reading.html Shira Hadasha website.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, many other independent minyanim follow this approach, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaism.about.com/od/feminism/a/shirahadasha.htm Shira Hadasha, About.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Australian congregation Shira Melbourne notes on its website that it is "modeled on the Shira Hadasha community in Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shira.org.au/about Shira Melbourne website.]&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Los Angeles]] minyan, which also notes that it is "modeled after Shira Hadasha in Jerusalem," takes its name from this practice, calling itself the "Ten and Ten Minyan."&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/10and10-Minyan Ten and Ten Minyan.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some other minyanim, like [[MigdalOr]] admit that they "struggle" with the concept, but sometimes find it impractical to implement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Migdalor#"Ten and Ten" policy|MigdalOr article, "Ten and Ten policy" section.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though independent minyanim indeed operate independently and share no formal "movement" structure, there are strong informal links between these communities in different cities.  Thus, many groups cite others as models, learning from and even modeling themselves after others:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The founders of these independent minyans have all learned from one another. Indeed, most know each other through networks such as the [http://www.college.columbia.edu/students/fellowships/catalog/dorot-fellowship Dorot Fellowship’s] alumni organization and have shared ideas and inspiration. D.C. Minyan founder Jessica Lieberman explicitly took Hadar as a model. Tiferet founder Evan Hochberg said he and his co-founders "were inspired by Darchei Noam and by Shira Hadasha in Jerusalem. We wanted to create a safe space for people to be Orthodox and [[feminism|feminist]] at the same time."&lt;ref name="Michaelson"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, the leaders of many of these groups see the commitment to tradition on the one hand, and to egalitarianism (or feminism) on the other, as the "core values" of the vision that gives their communities foundation—although individual participants and individual congregations take different positions on exactly "how these values should intersect." For example, the website for [http://www.minyannaaleh.org Minyan Na'aleh] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At Minyan Na'aleh, you can expect a traditional and complete davening that is conducted mainly in Hebrew. We are completely lay-led and have no official Rabbi or affiliation with a particular movement. Our Friday night service is completely egalitarian, with men and women seated together, while Shabbat morning and some of our other services (Shavuot and Kol Nidrei ) are conducted in an Orthodox egalitarian style (women lead some, but not all, parts of the service and seating is separated by gender). Why do we conduct services differently at different times? Because adherence to tradition and egalitarianism are core values for us, and because members of our community have differing opinions about how these values should intersect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minyannaaleh.org/what-to-expect.html Minyan Na'aleh: "What to Expect."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An article about Minyan Shivyoni, in the [[Baka, Jerusalem|Baka]] area of Jerusalem, describes how the resolution of these "differing opinions" often results in a process of struggle among participants that is not easy, but the goal is "communal consensus":

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the Minyan Shivyoni navigates the process of becoming more egalitarian, each decision begins with open communal learning on the topic of discussion. From that point, there is an e-mail follow-up, disseminating the traditional sources discussed, which lead to more ideological and value-driven missives. Then, there is a vote. "There is a shared culture and atmosphere, even though there are great gaps between the different people in the minyan," [Co-founder Yair] Furstenburg said. "People give different weight to different elements—values, custom, traditional legal texts, atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presentense.org/magazine/minyans-of-the-people "Minyans of the People: The Rise of Lay-Led Congregations," Present Tense, August 21, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One new term being used to describe the synthesis of traditional Jewish law and equal participation by men and women is "halakhic egalitarian."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeminyan.org/pages/mission.htm Cambridge Minyan website: "Mission."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to "core values" such as halakha and egalitarianism, some congregations, like [http://www.darcheinoam.org.il Darchei Noam, in [[Modiin]], Israel,] add a "commitment to social justice," as well—a concept that many participants believe includes egalitarianism, but is not limited to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcheinoam.org.il/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:welcome&amp;catid=1:darchei&amp;lang=en&amp;Itemid= Darchei Noam website: Orthodox Egalitarian Community in Modiin.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Minyan Project==
Within the overall rubric of the independent minyan phenomenon described by experts like Wertheimer, Kaunfer, Sarna, Kelman, and others who are studying it, many independent minyanim work as active participants in [http://www.mechonhadar.org/minyan-project The Minyan Project], an international effort to support lay-led congregations, under the leadership of New York's Mechon Hadar, an institution that developed as a result of the growth of Kehilat Hadar.

It is "designed to empower vibrant prayer communities," offering one-on-one consulting, including resources and strategic planning advice, to leaders of groups around the county. In addition, it offers both on-line and traditional classes and courses. In November 2008, it facilitated a three-day leadership conference for over 90 representatives from 32 communities to create a system of networking and mutual support, in an effort to share best practices, lessons learned, and define ongoing and upcoming issues.  It also held a one-day public forum at [[Brandeis University]] that attracted 120 representatives from conventional Jewish institutions, and included a keynote address in addition to eight panel discussions, involving scholars, Jewish professionals, and community worship leaders.  Mechon Hadar organized another conference in April 2010 which included sessions on such issues as "Building a Singing Community," "expanding the concept" of egalitarianism, the "theory and practice" of pluralism, "empowering" existing communities, and the challenges and rewards of holding simultaneous multiple worship services within a synagogue setting.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;[http://www.mechonhadar.org/minyan-project1 ''Mechon Hadar'' website, ''Minyan Project'' section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514153121/http://www.mechonhadar.org/minyan-project1 |date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of this ongoing effort, the Minyan Project has developed a "Halakhic Think Tank" to provide a forum for discussion and guidance on "crucial halakhic issues facing ... burgeoning communities, including gender, kashrut, defining relationships and boundaries with the non-Jewish world ... [and] navigating different levels of observance with the Jewish community."&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

{{main|Partnership minyan}}
{{main|Guide for the Halakhic Minyan}}

While many independent minyanim do not identify with any one of the [[Jewish religious movements]], [[Partnership minyan]] is a term being used by the [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]] (JOFA) to describe those that seek to expand the leadership role of women while still identifying themselves as part of the [[Modern Orthodox]] community, within the overall rubric of [[Orthodox Judaism]].

In 2008, members of JOFA approached two PhD candidates in [[New England]] who were working as consultants to a number of minyanim, with the recommendation that a guide be created to help groups such as Partnership minyanim.
&lt;ref name="GHM"&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3505012,00.html "New Guide for the Halachic and Egalitarian, Ynet.news, Oct 2, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714100817/http://minyanurim.com/uploads/Guideline%20for%20Halachic%20Minyanim%20January%2019%20-%20English.pdf "Guide for the 'Halakhic Minyan.'"] was published. 
The guide is meant to help minyanim seeking halakhic justification for expansion of women in leadership roles in different areas of the service and in different ways, whether or not complete egalitarianism, equal roles, is part of the minyan's self-described vision or goals: "While many ... minyanim aim to extend participation to women as far as Halacha permits, they are by no means egalitarian - hence the phrase 'halachic minyan' in the title of the guide, and not 'egalitarian minyan.'"&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=92578 "First Guide for Inclusive Prayer Services is Published," ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', Feb 19, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irma Stern''' (1894, [[Schweizer-Reneke]], [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] – 23 August 1966, [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]) was a major South African artist who achieved national and international recognition in her lifetime.

== Life ==
She was born in Schweizer-Reneke, a small town in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], of German-Jewish parents. Her father was interned in a concentration camp by the British during the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] because of his pro-[[Boer]] leanings.[1] Irma and her younger brother, Rudi, were thus taken to Cape Town by their mother. After the war, the family returned to Germany and constant travel. This travel would influence Irma's work.

In 1913 Stern studied art in Germany at the [[Weimar Academy]], in 1914 at the Levin-Funcke Studio and notably from 1917 with [[Max Pechstein]], a founder of the Novembergruppe. Stern was associated with the German Expressionist painters of this period. She held her first exhibition in Berlin in 1919. In 1920 Stern returned to Cape Town with her family where she was first derided and dismissed as an artist before becoming an established artist by the 1940s.

In 1926 she married Dr Johannes Prinz, her former tutor, who subsequently became professor of German at the University of Cape Town. They were divorced in 1934.

Irma Stern travelled extensively in Europe and explored Southern Africa, [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Congo region]]. These trips provided a wide range of subject matter for her paintings and gave her opportunities to acquire and assemble a collection of artifacts. Stern's dream was to travel extensively in her lifetime: in 1930 to Madeira, in 1937 and 1938 to Dakar, Senegal, 1939 Zanzibar, 1942 Congo, 1945 Zanzibar, 1946 Central Africa, 1952 Madeira, 1955 Congo, 1960 Spain and 1963 France. Stern travelled extensively in South Africa, for example in 1926 to [[Swaziland]] and [[Pondoland]], in 1933 to [[Namaqualand]], in 1936 generally, and in 1941 to the Eastern Cape. In 1931 she visited [[Madeira]] and [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], in 1937 and 1938. Irma Stern refused to either travel or exhibit in [[Germany]] during the period 1933 - 1945. Instead, she undertook several journeys into Africa; going to [[Zanzibar]] twice in 1939 and 1945 and then planned three trips to the [[Congo region]] in 1942, 1946 and 1955. These expeditions resulted in a wealth of artistic creativity and energy as well as the publication of two illustrated journals; ''Congo'' published in 1943 and ''Zanzibar'' in 1948.

Almost one hundred solo exhibitions were held during her lifetime both in South Africa and Europe: including Germany, France, Italy and England. Although accepted in Europe, her work was unappreciated at first in South Africa where critics derided her early exhibitionsin the 1920s with reviews titled "Art of Miss Irma Stern - Ugliness as a cult".

The Irma Stern Museum was established in 1971 and is the house the artist lived in for almost four decades. She moved into ''The Firs'' in [[Rondebosch]] in 1927 and lived there until her death. Several of the rooms are furnished as she arranged them while upstairs there is a commercial gallery used by contemporary South African artists.

On 8 May 2000, one of her works sold at Sotheby’s South Africa in Johannesburg for an all-time record of  R1.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vgallery.co.za/99stern/vzine.htm Irma Stern at V Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; This record was soon broken, however, and in March 2007 Stern's work was sold for R6.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artthrob.co.za/07mar/news/auction.html Auction action in Cape Town]&lt;/ref&gt; Stern's Gladioli was sold for an all-time high of R13.3 million in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/article704000.ece/Irma-Stern-work-sells-for-record-R13.3m Irma Stern work sells for record R13.3m]&lt;/ref&gt; but was then followed by the sale of Bahora Girl for R26.7 million later that month&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.timeslive.co.za/minor/2010/10/28/new-irma-stern-record/ New Irma Stern record]&lt;/ref&gt; - both were also records for sales of South African art at the time. A new South African record was set in March 2011, when a Stern painting sold for R34 million at Bonham's, London.

On 11 November 2012, Stern’s painting, Fishing Boats, was stolen along with four other paintings from a museum in Pretoria. A tip-off led South African police to a cemetery in Port Elizabeth where four of the five paintings were recovered from under a bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The arrival of '''Islam in Zambia''' dates to the fourth Hijri century when Muslims established emirates on the coast of [[East Africa]]. During that period Muslim slave merchants extended their business to the interior regions reaching [[Zambia]] in the period of the Omani dynasty [[Al Bu Sa'id Dynasty|Al Bu Said]]. [[Arab slave trade]]rs entered Zambia from their trading bases on the coast of [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]]. Over a period of hundreds of years more than four million slaves were stolen from Zambia and surrounding countries and exported from Swahili ports by Arab traders to India and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;http://mondediplo.com/1998/04/02africa&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslims entered Zambia during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] period, primarily came from the [[Indian subcontinent]] establishing themselves along the railways in the central part of the country from [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] to [[Lusaka]].

Muslims account for less than 1% of the total population of 17 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148728.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010 - Zambia]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Zambia is officially a "Christian Nation" there is freedom of religion and Muslims generally are accepted in the society. The vast majority of [[Muslim]]s in Zambia are [[Sunni]]. A small [[Ismaili]] Shia community is also present. There are about 500 people belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbElAQAAIAAJ&amp;q&amp;dq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pYw4U-DwBKKt0QWB1oH4DA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Some basics of religious education in Zambia|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:James the Persian (Menologion of Basil II).jpg|thumb]]
'''Saint James Intercisus''', also known as '''Saint James the Mutilated''' (died 421) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] Christian [[saint]].  His [[surname]], ''Intercisus'', is derived from the [[Latin]] word for "cut into pieces," which refers to the manner of his [[martyrdom]]: he was slowly [[Lingchi|cut into twenty-eight pieces]].  He survived this loss of limbs before being ultimately [[decapitation|beheaded]].

Tradition states that he was a military officer and [[courtier]] to [[Yazdegerd I]] who had [[apostasy|apostatized]] after this ruler began to persecute Christians.  Under the influence of his Christian family, however, he expressed his faith to Yazdegerd's successor, [[Bahram V]], and was tortured and killed.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Delaney, ''Dictionary of saints'', (Image, 2005), 323.&lt;/ref&gt;  His death started the [[Roman-Sassanid War (421-422)]]. He was killed in [[Gundishapur]]. The ruins of this city are near [[Dezful]], [[Iran]].
Somehow, his body was sent to the Portuguese cathedral of [[Braga]] and put into a sarcophagus in the Relics Chapel.

James' story is recounted in ''[[The Golden Legend]]''.

The [[Church of St. James Intercisus]] in the [[Armenian Quarter]] of [[Jerusalem]] is dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. Boas, ''Jerusalem in the time of the Crusades'', (Routledge, 2001), 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Monastery of St. Jacob Persian]] in Sireţi, [[Străşeni]] [[Moldova]], the [[Monastery of St. Jacob Persian]] in Deddeh, [[Lebanon]] and the [[Monastery of Saint James the Mutilated (Qara)|monastery of St James the Mutilated]] in Qara, Syria are all dedicated to him.

His feast day is November 27.

'''Joseph Bau''' ({{lang-he|יוסף באו}}; 13 June 1920 – May 24 2002) was a [[Polish diaspora#Israel|Polish-Israeli]] artist, philosopher, inventor, animator, comedian, commercial creator, copy-writer, poet, and survivor of the [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp|Płaszów concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/10/guardianobituaries.israel|title=Obituary: Joseph Bau|last=Joffe|first=Lawrence|date=10 July 2002|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Life ==
Bau was trained as a graphic artist at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]]. His education was interrupted by World War II and he was transferred to the [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp|Płaszów concentration camp]] in late 1942 from the [[Kraków Ghetto]]. Having a talent in gothic lettering, he was employed in the camp for making signs and maps for the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]. While in Płaszów, Bau created a miniature - the size of his hand – illustrated book with his own poetry. He also forged documents and identity papers for people who managed to escape from the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-03/news/9811030137_1_joseph-bau-holocaust-survivor-concentration-camp|title=Artist's Work Defies The Horror|last=Ko|first=Michael|date=3 November 1998|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his imprisonment, Bau fell in love with another inmate, Rebecca Tennenbaum. They were secretly married, despite the prohibition by the Germans, in the women's barracks of Płaszów. This was dramatized in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Academy Award]]-winning movie ''[[Schindler's List]]'', where he was played by [[Rami Heuberger]]. Bau himself appears in the film's epilogue placing a stone on [[Oskar Schindler|Oskar Schindler's]] grave in [[Jerusalem]], along with his wife Rebecca.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-06-14/news/0206140210_1_joseph-bau-nazi-industrialist-oskar-schindler-clandestine-wedding|title=Joseph Bau, 81|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2002|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1396465/Joseph-Bau.html|title=Joseph Bau|last=|first=|date=6 June 2002|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Płaszów, Bau was transferred to [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]] and then to [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Schindler's camp]] where he stayed until the end of the war, while Rebecca was sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-12-19/news/9312190196_1_rebecca-tannenbaum-plaszow-schindler-jews|title=`Schindler' Couple Recall Terror|last=Hundley|first=Tom|date=19 December 1993|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After liberation, Bau was reunited with his wife finished his degree at University of Plastic Arts in Kraków. In 1950, he immigrated to [[Israel]] together with his wife and three-year-old daughter, Hadassah, where their other daughter, Clila, was born. He worked as a graphic artist at the Brandwein Institute in [[Haifa]] and for the government of Israel. Bau opened his own studio in 1956 in [[Tel Aviv]], which is now a museum managed by daughters Hadassa and Clila. He was well known for creating graphic fonts and drawing titles for Israeli movies in the 1960s and 1970s. He also authored a number of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] books and continued to write poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.josephbau.com/?module=category&amp;item_id=8|title=Joseph Bau|website=www.josephbau.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bau's wife Rebecca died in 1997. Bau died from [[pneumonia]] in [[Tel Aviv]] on May 24, 2002, at age 81.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/13/local/me-bau13|title=Joseph Bau, 81; Israeli Artist, Animator, Holocaust Survivor|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=2002-06-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
The English version of Joseph Bau's memoir, ''Dear God, Have You Ever Gone Hungry?'' came out in June 1998. It was first published in Hebrew and Polish and was published in several languages, including Chinese.

Joseph Bau also created his own animated films, for which he has been referred to in the press as the "Israeli Walt Disney"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or as the "founder of Israel's animation industry".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His paintings and drawings have been listed by Sotheby's as significant contributions to the art of the Holocaust and his works have been shown in galleries in New York, Baltimore, Chicago, and Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Joseph Bau's art is filtered through the prism of his own experiences. It reflects both the brutal reality of life during the war, as well as the joy and humour he observed in later years in Israel. Joseph Bau was nominated for the prestigious [[Israel Prize]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Lake Iguaque''' is a [[lake]] located in the [[Boyacá Department]] of [[Colombia]]. The lake and the surrounding area was declared a [[List of national parks of Colombia|Flora and Fauna Sanctuary]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} {{cite web | url=http://www.parquesnacionales.gov.co/PNN/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=01.022907 | title=Santuario de Fauna y Flora Iguaque | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HEw84WMH?url=http://www.parquesnacionales.gov.co/PNN/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=01.022907 | archivedate=2013-06-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography and climate==
Lake Iguaque is located northeast of [[Villa de Leyva]] and is part of the SFF Iguaque. The predominant [[ecosystem]] is the [[páramo]], with presence of [[frailejón]] plant, [[fern]]s, [[lichen]]s and [[Puya (genus)|puya]]s. The average temperature is 12&amp;nbsp;°C. The route of access to the natural reservation is: [[Bogotá]] – [[Tunja]] (147&amp;nbsp;km) /Tunja – [[Villa de Leyva]] (39&amp;nbsp;km). The visitor center Furachiogua offers accommodation for up to 48 persons, and [[camping]] zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.ecomochilas.com/santuario-de-flora-y-fauna-de-iguaque/ Ecomochila - Lake Iquaque]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural value ==
Lake Iguaque was considered a sacred place for the [[Muisca people|Muisca]]. According to [[Muisca religion|legend]], mankind was originated in the Iguaque lake, when the goddess [[Bachué]] came out from the [[lake]] with a boy in her arms. When the boy grew, she married him and their children populated the Earth. They are considered the ancestors of the human race. Finally Bachué and her husband and son disappeared unto the lake in the shape of [[snake]]s.

== Biology ==
The in 2006 described [[Halictidae|sweat bee]] ''[[Neocorynura muiscae]]'' was found in the sanctuary near the lake and named after the Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;[https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/melittology/article/download/4812/4412.pdf ''Neocorynura muiscae'' found at an elevation of 2850 m]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonardo Boff''' ({{IPA-pt|leoˈnaʁdu ˈbɔf}}, born December 14, 1938), born as '''Genézio Darci Boff''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒeˈnɛzju daʁˈsi ˈbɔf|pron}}), is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[theologian]] and writer, known for his active support for [[liberation theology]]. He currently serves as Professor Emeritus of Ethics, Philosophy of Religion, and Ecology at the [[Rio de Janeiro State University]].

==Studies as a priest==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Boff was born in [[Concórdia]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], Brazil, he entered the [[Franciscan Order]] in 1959 and was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1964.  He spent the following years studying for a [[doctorate]] in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Munich]], which he received in 1970. Boff's doctoral [[thesis]] studied in what measure the Church can be a sign of the sacred and the divine in the secular world and in the process of liberation of the oppressed.  He has since published his thesis as a book available in [[German language|German]], entitled ''Die Kirche als Sakrament im Horizont der Welterfahrung''.

His brother is the theologian [[Clodovis Boff]].

==Liberation theology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Boff became one of the best-known supporters (along with [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], [[Juan Luis Segundo]] and [[Jon Sobrino]]) of the early [[liberation theology|liberation theologians]]. He was present in the first reflections that sought to articulate indignation against poverty and marginalization with a promissory discourse on [[faith]], leading to [[liberation theology]]. He continues to be a controversial figure in the [[Catholic Church]], primarily for his sharp criticism of the church's hierarchy, which he sees as "fundamentalist", but also for his past critical support of [[communist]] régimes.

==Political views==
Boff is critical of secular power as well of American foreign policy. He opposed the Iraq War and considered [[George W. Bush]] and [[Ariel Sharon]]'s leadership to be similar to that of "fundamentalist terrorist states." He also criticizes despotic rulers in the [[Middle East]]: "Those [emirs and kings] are despotic, they do not even have a constitution. Though extremely rich, they maintain the people in poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.comunitaitaliana.com.br/Entrevistas/boff.htm Interview to the Comunità Italiana]: "[Os USA] fizeram alianças espúrias com os emires e reis. Estes são despóticos, sequer possuem constituição. Embora riquíssimos, mantém o povo na pobreza." November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Boff has voiced his supported for the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&amp;mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|last=|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secularization==
Authorities in the Roman Catholic Church did not consider Boff's views of the Church's leadership acceptable.  They also saw his support of liberation theology as having "politicized everything" and reproached his proximity to [[Marxism]].  In 1985, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], directed at that time by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), silenced him for a year for his book ''Church: Charism and Power''.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, The Silencing of Leonardo Boff: The Vatican and the Future of World Christianity (Oak Park, Ill.: Meyer Stone Books, 1988), pp. 178-88 &lt;/ref&gt; He later accused Ratzinger of "religious terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.comunitaitaliana.com.br/Entrevistas/boff.htm Interview to the Comunità Italiana]: "Um Cardeal como J. Ratzinger, [...], comete terrorismo religioso, [...]."  November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Boff was almost silenced again in 1992 by [[Holy See|Rome]], this time to prevent him from participating in the Eco-92 [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which finally led him to leave the [[Franciscan]] religious order and the priestly ministry. 

Boff joined the international group of Catholic Scholars who in 2012 issued the [[Jubilee Declaration on reform of authority in the Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchauthority.org/sponsors/sponsorsa-b.asp#boff|title=Sponsors of the Catholic Scholars' Declaration A-B|work=Authority in the Catholic Church|publisher=[[John Wijngaards Catholic Research Centre]]|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of his life Boff has worked as a professor in the academic fields of [[theology]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]] throughout Brazil and also as lecturer in many universities abroad such as [[University of Lisbon]], [[University of Barcelona]], [[University of Lund]], [[University of Oslo]], [[University of Torino]] and others.

Boff commented on the election of [[Pope Francis]] in March 2013: "I am encouraged by this choice, viewing it as a pledge for a church of simplicity and of ecological ideals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmall|first=Emily|title=A Conservative With a Common Touch|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/new-pope-theologically-conservative-but-with-a-common-touch.html|accessdate=20 March 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the new pope was conservative in many respects but had liberal views on some subjects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L. Boff: "Bergoglio aprobó que una pareja gay adoptara un niño"|url=http://www.periodistadigital.com/religion/america/2013/03/17/leonardo-boff-bergoglio-aprobo-que-una-pareja-gay-adoptara-un-nino-iglesia-religion-es-mas-liberal-de-lo-que-se-piensa-papa-francisco.shtml|accessdate=20 March 2013|newspaper=Religion Digital|date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of monastic houses in Scotland''' is a catalogue of the [[abbey]]s, [[priory|priories]], [[friary|friaries]] and other monastic religious houses of Scotland.

In this article [[alien house]]s are included, as are smaller establishments such as [[Monastic cell|cell]]s and notable [[monastic grange]]s (particularly those with resident monks).  The numerous [[Hospitals in medieval Scotland|monastic hospital]]s ''per se'' are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have, the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary or [[preceptory]]/[[Commandery (feudalism)|commandery]].

The geographical co-ordinates provided are sourced from details provided by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments in Scotland]] (RCAHMS)&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/]&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Ordnance Survey of Great Britain|Ordnance Survey]] publications.

The '''Local Government (Religious etc. Observances) Act 2015''' is an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed in 2015. It was created to affirm the rights of local councils to hold [[prayer]]s before council and committee meetings.

== Background ==
In 2012, [[Bideford Town Council]] held prayers as the first action at meetings. A former councillor supported by the [[National Secular Society]] challenged the Council in court over the Christian prayers which had been held traditionally since the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Owen Bowcott and Steven Morris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/10/local-councils-prayers-eric-pickles |title=Local councils have right to say their prayers, says Eric Pickles |work=The Guardian |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of England and Wales]] held that there was no legal authority for councils to pray at their meetings as it was not specifically mentioned in the [[Local Government Act 1972]] as not being "conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions". Both MPs and bishops of the [[Church of England]] condemned the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bingham |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9074872/High-Court-council-prayers-ruling-an-attack-on-centuries-old-Christian-traditions.html |title=High Court council prayers ruling 'an attack on centuries-old Christian traditions' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Communities Secretary]] [[Eric Pickles]] expressed disappointment at this judgment and signed a Parliamentary Order to bring forward the introduction of the general power of competence for principal local authorities passed as part of the [[Localism Act 2011]]. Pickles asserted that the power would permit councils to pray at their meetings, and therefore overturned the court's judgment within a week.&lt;ref name=g&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Wilding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/apr/05/eric-pickles-localism-town-hall-prayers-confusion |title=A whim and a prayer: Pickles advice on council meetings raises legal difficulties |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However there was doubt as to whether Pickles' move had actually made council prayers legal as the section he had brought forward only said that councils could do anything an individual could do, but did not specifically mention prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17082136 |title=Councils win prayer 'rights' as Localism Act powers fast tracked, ministers say |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Localism Act also only applied to English councils which meant that Welsh councils were still bound by the High Court judgment.&lt;ref name=card /&gt;

A number of councils in response to the judgment and uncertainty of the wording in the Localism Act either continued as before, removed prayers from the agenda&lt;ref name=g /&gt; or moved the prayers prior to meetings so that they were not a part of the formal proceedings.&lt;ref name=card&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-17141870 |title=Council prayers: Cardiff moves worship before meetings |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Act ==
Despite Pickles claiming his act restored the rights of councils to hold prayers as part of official agendas, it did not apply to all councils such as some town and [[parish councils in England|parish council]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22720%3Apray-continue&amp;catid=59%3Agovernance-a-risk-articles&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Pray continue |publisher=Local Government Lawyer |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Jake Berry]] introduced the Local Government (Religious etc. Observances) Bill as a [[Private Members Bill]], in order to affirm the rights of all councils and authorities to hold prayers before meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30777749 |title=Week ahead |publisher=BBC News |date=12 January 2015 |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During introduction, he called the 2011 court judgment “an aggressive and unwelcome secular attack on our British values”.&lt;ref name=lg /&gt; The bill was supported by the Government and passed both the [[House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.lgiu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/New-Legislation-Review-of-decisions-and-religious-observances.pdf |title=New Legislation: Review of decisions and religious observances |publisher=LGIU |date= |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received [[Royal Assent]] from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 26 March 2015.&lt;ref name=lg /&gt; The legislation would be permissive and made no obligation for councillors to attend prayers if the council decided to hold them. Observers noted that the act had the effect of returning the law to the perceived ''[[Status quo|status quo ante]]'' before 2011 but afforded protection against similar legal challenges.&lt;ref name=lg /&gt;

'''Danielle Caruana''', known professionally as '''Mama Kin''', is an Australian singer-songwriter. She has released two albums, ''Beat and Holler'' and ''The Magician's Daughter''. She lives with her family in [[Fremantle]].

==Early life==
Caruana grew up in the Melbourne suburb of [[Newport, Victoria|Newport]], the youngest, by some years, of six siblings by parents of Maltese extraction. The family was musical and she studied classical piano from the age of five to 16.&lt;ref name=twa/&gt;&lt;ref name=tns&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bible|first1=Georgina|title=Mama Kin: motherhood led me back|url=http://www.northernstar.com.au/news/after-giving-up-an-early-musical-career-due-to-sta/465376/|website=The Northern Star|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christie|first1=Alexandra|title=Mama Kin Speaks|url=http://www.yenmag.net/artery/artery-interviews/mama-kin-speaks/|website=Yen|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=df/&gt; Every child in the family was expected to play an instrument and to play in the family band in church and for members of the Maltese community who visited their house.&lt;ref name=themusic&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barron|first1=Zoe|title=Mothering Music|url=http://themusic.com.au/interviews/all/2013/04/18/mama-kin-danielle-caruana/14997/|website=Themusic.com|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; Her strongest musical influence was her sister Carmen, 14 years older, with whom she sang and who taught her to harmonise, and who introduced her to lasting musical influences: [[blues]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Nina Simone]], the [[The Pretenders|Pretenders]] and [[Joan Armatrading]].&lt;ref name=twa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Simon|title=Mama Kin born into music|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/6892207/mama-kin-born-into-music/|website=The West Australian|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yen/&gt; Other family influences were [[Country music|country]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[crooner]]s, [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Dr John]], [[The Cure]], [[The Police]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Sharon|title=Mama Kin on music and motherhood|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/02/12/2818448.htm|website=ABC South West|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caruana says, "I loved all of it, because my brothers and sisters were into it. I couldn't imagine a life without music",&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; but also that the musicality of her family inhibited her own career: "I was completely petrified. After having grown up under two really incredibly, incredibly diverse musical brothers and a really musical family, I think I just made a decision really early on that I wasn't good enough, that I wasn't as good as them."&lt;ref name=twa/&gt;

==Career==
Caruana first started writing songs in 2006.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; Prior to her solo career, she provided vocals on albums by her husband, [[John Butler (musician)|John Butler]].&lt;ref name=am&gt;{{cite web|title=Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/danielle-caruana-mn0002025498/credits|website=AllMusic|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=discogs&gt;{{cite web|title=Danielle Caruana|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/1798915-Danielle-Caruana|website=Discogs|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mama Kin band came about through playing with her brothers [[Nicky Bomba]] and [[The Truth (Australian band)|Michael Caruana]].&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; The name Mama Kin was given her by Bomba, a former member of the [[John Butler Trio]].&lt;ref name=twa/&gt; Caruana says, "we were toying with the idea of doing a creative project together called Kin.

[[File:María Auxiliadora Entera.jpg|thumb|The venerated image whom [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted a [[Canonical coronation]] on 17 May 1903. The [[Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin]]. ]]

'''Mary Help of Christians''' ({{lang-la|Sancta Maria Auxilium Christianorum}}; {{lang-es|Nuestra Señora María Auxiliadora de los Cristianos}}; [[Filipino Language|Filipino]]: ''Maria, Mapag-ampon sa mga Kristiyano''), is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Marian devotions|Marian devotion]] with a feast day celebrated on May 24. 

[[Saint John Chrysostom]] was the first person to use this Marian title in year 345 as a devotion to the [[BVM(RC)|Virgin Mary]]. [[Don Bosco]] also propagated Marian devotion under this title. The title of ''Mary Help of Christians'' is associated with the defense of [[Christian Europe]] (Latin and Greek), the north of [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] from non-Christian peoples during the [[Middle Age]]. 

In 1572, during the expansion of the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire]] intended to invade Christian Europe, [[Pope Pius V]] invoked  Christian armies and its victory achieved was consequently attributed to the intercession of Mary under this title. Ultimately, [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted a [[Canonical coronation]] towards the Marian image bearing the same title on 17 May 1903, now permanently enshrined within the [[Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin|Basilica of Mary Help of Christians]].

== History ==

=== Patristic origins===
{{RC-Mariology}}
There are two inscriptions of the first centuries of Christianity in [[Greek language|Greek]] related to the Virgin Mary: : θεοτοκος (Teotokos, Theotokos, Mother of God) and βοηθεια (Boetheia, the Helper). The [[Fathers of the Church]] referred to Mary as "βοηθεια". [[John Chrysostom]] used the title in a homily of 345, [[Proclus]] in 476 and Sebas of [[Caesarea]] in 532. After the Patristic period (5th century), other persons used it like Romanos the Melodist in 518, the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] in 560, [[John of Damascus]] in 749 and German of [[Constantinople]] in 733.

In the view of Fr. Johann G. Roten, SM, the invocation of Mary as Help of Christians is part of the oldest prayer addressed directly to Mary, the ''[[Sub tuum praesidium]]'', which was found on a papyrus dating, at the latest, from the end of the 3rd century. ''Praesidium'' is translated as "an assistance given in time of war by fresh troops in a strong manner."&lt;ref name=rotan&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/HelpOfChristians.html Rotan SM, Johann G., "Help of Christians", University of Dayton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307111456/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/HelpOfChristians.html |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litany of Loreto===
Around 1576, [[Bernardino Cirillo]], [[archpriest]] of [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]], published at [[Macerata]] two [[litany|litanies]] of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Blessed Virgin]], which, he contended, were used at Loreto. One is in a form which is entirely different from our present text. Another form ("Aliae litaniae B.M.V.") is identical to the litany of Loreto approved by [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1601 and now used throughout the entire Church. This second form contains the invocation ''Auxilium Christianorum''. Possibly warriors returning from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] (October 7, 1571) visited the sanctuary of Loreto, and saluted the Holy Virgin there for the first time with this new title. It is more probable, however, that it is only a variation of the older invocation ''Advocata Christianorum'', found in a litany of 1524.&lt;ref name=holweck&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11360c.htm Holweck, Frederick. "Feast of Our Lady, Help of Christians." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 9 Mar. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Torsellini (1597) and the [[Roman Breviary]] (May 24, Appendix) say that [[Pope Pius V]] inserted the invocation in the litany of Loreto after the battle of Lepanto. But the form of the litany in which it is first found was unknown at [[Rome]] at the time of Pius V.&lt;ref&gt;See LITANY OF LORETO; Schuetz, "Gesch. des Rosenkranzgebets", Paderborn, 1909, 243 sq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feast of Our Lady Help of Christians===

The feast of ''Our Lady, Help of Christians'', was instituted by [[Pope Pius VII]]. By order of [[Napoleon I of France]], Pius VII was arrested on June 5, 1808, and detained a prisoner first at Grenoble, and then at [[Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/mary/popular-marian-devotions/mary-help-of-christians/ "Mary Help of Christians", Catholic News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1814, after the [[battle of Leipzig]], he was brought back to Savona and set free on March 17, on the eve of the feast of [[Our Lady of Mercy]], the Patroness of Savona. The journey to Rome was a veritable triumphal march. The pontiff, attributing the victory of the Church after so much agony and distress to the Blessed Virgin, visited many of her sanctuaries on the way and crowned her images (e.g., the "Madonna del Monte" at [[Cesena]], "della Misericordia" at Treja, "della Colonne" and "della Tempestà" at [[Tolentino]]). The people crowded the streets to catch a glimpse of the venerable pontiff who had so bravely withstood the threats of Napoleon. He entered Rome on May 24, 1814, and was enthusiastically welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, "History of the Catholic Church in the Nineteenth Cent.", 1909, I, 52&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate his own sufferings and those of the Church during his exile [[Pope Pius VII]] extended the feast of the [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Seven Dolours of Mary]] to the universal Church on September 18, 1814.

When Napoleon left Elba and returned to Paris, Murat was about to march through the Papal States from Naples; Pius VII fled to Savona 22 March 1815.&lt;ref name=holweck/&gt; After the [[Congress of Vienna]] and the [[battle of Waterloo]], the Pope returned to Rome on July 7, 1815. To give thanks to God and Our Lady, on 15 September 1815 he declared 24 May, the anniversary of his first return, to be henceforth the feast of ''Our Lady, Help of Christians''; the 1913 Catholic Encyclopaedia article commented that ''it has spread nearly over the entire Latin Church, but is not contained in the [[General Roman Calendar|universal calendar]].''
[[File:Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice Torino.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin]], founded by Saint [[John Bosco]]]] 

The Marian feast was celebrated by the order of [[Servites]] since the 17th century. The veneration to Mary became popular under this title in [[Rome]] especially, where the feast was especially promoted by Saint [[John Bosco]] and Saint Vincent Pallotti&lt;ref&gt;Remigius Bäumer et al. Marienlexikon 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;533&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[John Bosco]] was an ardent promoter of devotion to "Mary, Help of Christians". He even built a huge Basilica in her honour in 1868 and founded a religious Congregation for women, under the title of, "The Daughters of Mary, Help of Christians". Interpreting the painting he had commissioned inside the Basilica, St. John Bosco referred to it as depicting Mary Mother of the Church. This suggests an identical connection to how popes have addressed Mary as both Mother and Help of the Church. Recall the two Marian Greek attribution of θεοτοκος (Teotokos, Theotokos, Mother of God) and βοηθεια (Boetheia, the Helper) at the start of this article?
St. John Bosco infact, chose this devotion because of its affinity to his devotion to the Church the bearer of Christ. 

Vatican II, in the Constitution on the Church (sections 61, 62), cites this title of Mary, placing it in the context of Mary's maternal role. "In an utterly singular way she co-operated by her obedience, faith, hope and burning charity in the Saviour's work of restoring supernatural life to souls. For this reason she is a mother to us in the order of grace…By her maternal charity, Mary cares for the brethren of her Son who still wander through this world in the midst of dangers and difficulties until they are led to the happiness of their heavenly home".&lt;ref name=daniel&gt;[http://kwl.com.au/httpdocs/Articals/Our%20Lady%20Help%20of%20Christians.htm Daniel, Michael. "Our Lady Help of Christians"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observance=== 
[[File:Crkva Marije pomoćnice, Strahoninec - sjeverozapad.jpg|thumb|220px|Church of Mary Help of Christians in [[Strahoninec]], [[Croatia]]]]
The Church has traditionally focused on two aspects of Our Lady's help on this feast day. Firstly, the Church focuses in this feast upon the role of Our Lady's intercession in the fight against sin in the life of a believer. Secondly, the Church has focused upon Our Lady as one who assists Christians as a community, through her intercession, in fighting against anti-Christian forces.

Michael Daniel observes that while this approach may be regarded as outdated, in light of Vatican II, where the world and non Christians elements therein were seen in a positive rather than a hostile or threatening light, it would seem that it would be naïve on the part of Christians to regard all movements and all social trends as either good or harmless.&lt;ref name=daniel/&gt;

The [[dioceses]] of [[Tuscany]] adopted it on February 12, 1816. The hymns of the Office were composed by Brandimarte.&lt;ref&gt;Chevalier, "Repert. Hymnolog.", II, 495&lt;/ref&gt;

It became the patronal feast of [[Australasia]], a double of the first class with an octave;&lt;ref&gt;Ordo Australasiae, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; after the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]], it was designated a [[Solemnity]], to be kept on the first available Sunday on or after 24 May.

The Fathers of the Foreign Missions of Paris, in accordance with a vow (1891), celebrated this feast with great splendor in their churches.

It has attained special renown since [[Don Bosco]], founder of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian Congregation]], dedicated his foundation to ''Our Lady, Help of Christians'', the mother church of his congregation at [[Turin]] on June 9, 1868. The Salesians have carried the devotion to their numerous establishments.

It was established due to the great appreciation of Saint [[Don Bosco]] for this Marian title and the development of the [[Salesian]] works in many countries since the second half of the 19th century. Although it is commonly associated with the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Orthodox Church]] has also known the devotion since 1030 in [[Ukraine]], when the country was defended from a barbarian invasion.

The Salesian National Shrine of Our Lady Help of Christians is located in Stony Point, New York. There is also the National Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in [[ Parañaque City, Philippines ]], and is also in the care of the [[ Salesians of Don Bosco ]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianshrine.org/index.php?section=1 National Shrine of Our Lady Help of Christians]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbey of Mary Help of Christians, better known as Belmont Abbey, is a small American monastery of Benedictine monks in the town of Belmont, Gaston County, North Carolina, outside of Charlotte, North Carolina. The minor basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/about/belmont-abbey-monastery/basilica-mary-help-of-christians/ Basilica of Mary, Help of Christians]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a chapel of Our Lady Help of Christians at the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalshrine.com/site/c.osJRKVPBJnH/b.4953557/k.7180/Upper_Church_Floor_Plan.htm Chapel of Our Lady Help of Christians, Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, Washington D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this title, the Virgin Mary is venerated by many [[Chinese Catholic]]s, particularly at the Shrine of our Lady of Sheshan. In May 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] designated her May 24 feast for the [[Roman Catholicism in China|Roman Catholics in China]], who face persecution and restriction from the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]].

==Pontifical approbations==
* On 17 May 1903, [[Pope Leo XIII]]   granted a Canonical coronation to the famed image through his Papal legate, Cardinal [[Agostino Richelmy]], and is now permanently enshrined within the Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians in [[Turin, Italy]]. In 1844, the same Pontiff instructed the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] to assign Mary, under this devotional title as the official patroness of [[Australia]].  She is also the patron saint of New Zealand; and since 1924, of China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salesiansisters.org/index.php/about-us/history-and-heritage/founders-and-patrons/mary-help-of-Christians "Mary Help of Christians", Salesian Sisters of St. John Bosco]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
* On 24 May 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] during his  [[Regina Caeli]] papal address invoked this Marian patronage, under the venerated title of [[Our Mother of Sheshan]], calling for [[Chinese Catholic]]s to renew their fidelity to the [[Pope]] as the sole successor of [[Saint Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|WLzUkdVUfV0|Benedict XVI. Church in China, renew your fidelity to Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 23 March 2018, [[Pope Francis]] granted a [[Papal bull]] for the [[Canonical Coronation]] towards a namesake statue  venerated in the ''Mary Help of Christians Theological Seminary'' in [[San Fabian, Pangasinan]], Philippines. The image is notable for having been gifted to the [[Philippine islands]] by the Apostolic Delegate, [[Monsignor]] Guillermo Piani S.D.B.

'''Maznah Ismail''' (1 January 1956–2 November 2001), better known as '''Mona Fandey''', was a pop singer and a murderer from [[Malaysia]]. She was executed on 2 November 2001 at the age of 45, after being convicted of the [[murder]] of a politician, Mazlan Idris, in 1993.

==The murder==
After leaving the music business, she became involved in black magic activities and was known to be a ''[[bomoh]]'', a local [[shamanism|shaman]]. She began offering her services to clients, mostly from the upper-class society. She also claimed to have provided politician clients in the ruling party with a variety of charms and talismans.

It was reported that Mazlan Idris, a state assemblyman for the [[Parliamentary constituencies and state assemblies of Malaysia|constituency]] of [[Batu Talam]] in the state of [[Pahang]], wanted to boost his political career and sought the services of Mona for assistance. Mazlan was educated in the [[United States]] and was an ambitious politician from the ruling [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party. At that time, Mona worked with her husband Mohamad Nor Affandi Abdul Rahman, 44, and their assistant Juraimi Hassan, 31. Mona and her husband promised to help Mazlan by giving him a talisman consisting of a cane and ''[[sbatmi]]'' headgear which was supposedly owned by former [[Indonesia]]n President [[Sukarno]]. Mona convinced Mazlan that he would be "invincible" if he held the talisman.&lt;ref name=star&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/25/lifeliving/20070725170304&amp;sec=lifeliving "Black magic mayhem"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503202229/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F7%2F25%2Flifeliving%2F20070725170304&amp;sec=lifeliving |date=3 May 2008 }}, ''The Star'', 25 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Mona demanded [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 2.5 million.&lt;ref name="kyodo" /&gt; Mazlan paid the couple RM 500,000 as deposit, and gave them 10 land titles as surety for the remaining RM 2 million.&lt;ref name="star" /&gt;

An appointment was made for cleansing rituals to be performed at Mona's house. Mazlan was told to lie on the floor face up while Mona placed flowers on him. She then told Mazlan to close his eyes and wait for the money to "fall from the sky".&lt;ref name="mona" /&gt; Juraimi then, using an axe, chopped Mazlan's head off. They also dismembered and partially skinned Mazlan's body. His body was found in 18 parts buried in a storeroom near Mona's house in Kampung Peruas, Ulu Dong, Raub [[Pahang]].&lt;ref name="nst" /&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Mazlan was reported missing on 2nd July 1993 after withdrawing RM 300,000 from a bank. After the murder, Mona was reported to have been on a shopping spree where she bought a Mercedes-Benz and had a [[Rhytidectomy|facelift]].&lt;ref name="kyodo" /&gt; It was alleged that the murder occurred between 10:00 PM and 12 midnight on 18 July 1993. On 22 July 1993, police found Mazlan's body; Mona, her husband, and Juraimi were arrested and a highly publicised trial began. They were tried in [[Temerloh]] High Court by a 7-person jury (trial by jury was abolished from 1 January 1995). The High Court found all three of them guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced them to death]] by [[hanging]]. Mona and the others filed appeals to the Federal Court and in 1999 the court dismissed their appeals and upheld the death sentence. Finally, the three convicts sought to obtain a [[pardon]] or clemency from the Pardons Board of Pahang, their final chance redemption. However, the board refused to give clemency. The three were given a [[last meal]] of [[KFC]] on the night before their execution. Mona, Affandy, and Juraimi were finally hanged on 2 November 2001 at [[Kajang Prison]]. A prison official said the trio expressed no remorse at the pre-dawn execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1634584.stm "Malaysia hangs three for witchcraft murder."], ''BBC News'', 2 November 2001. Accessed 12 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the trial, Mona exhibited strange behaviour including appearing cheerful, constantly smiling and posing for press photographers. She dressed extravagantly with bright and colourful designs on her dress.&lt;ref name=kyodo&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_2001_Nov_5/ai_80631363 "Malaysian trio hanged for ritual murder"], ''Kyodo News International'', 5 November 2001.

==Legacy==
Mona Fandey gained more notoriety than she had been when she was still a pop singer. There was wide local and even international media coverage and plenty of public interest. Anti-death penalty movements including [[Amnesty International]] voiced their opposition to the execution of the trio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA280042001?open&amp;of=ENG-376 "Malaysia: Imminent execution"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Amnesty International''. Accessed 14 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Malaysian film director [[Amir Muhammad (director)|Amir Muhammad]] made a short film entitled ''Mona'' in his ''6horts'' series. 

In 2006, a film by [[Dain Iskandar Said]] entitled ''[[Dukun (film)|Dukun]]'' was widely assumed to be based on Mona Fandey. The public screening of this highly anticipated film was constantly pushed back, most likely due to concerns relating to the contents of the film, the relationship with Mona Fandey, and the implications for her family.&lt;ref&gt;Koay, Allan, [http://thestaronline.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/3/nation/17899129&amp;sec=nation "Will Dukun ever charm viewers?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020104/http://thestaronline.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F6%2F3%2Fnation%2F17899129&amp;sec=nation |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''The Star'', 3 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the movie was leaked online through Facebook early February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://says.com/my/entertainment/dukun-movie-inspired-by-mona-fandey-finally-released-after-being-shelved-for-12-years|title=The Horror Movie Inspired By Mona Fandey Is Finally In Cinemas After An 11-Year Ban|last=Khor|first=Samantha|date=2018-04-02|work=SAYS.com|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie has now been set for release in cinemas from 5 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.star2.com/entertainment/2018/04/02/dain-saids-long-awaited-dukun-finally-out-in-cinemas-on-april-5/|title=Dain Said's Controversial Horror Film 'Dukun' Finally Out After 10 Years {{!}} Star2.com|date=2018-04-02|work=Star2.com|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mona Fandey affair was one of the last [[jury trial]]s to be conducted in Malaysia. The sensational nature of the case contributed toward the government's decision to discontinue the jury system. All trials by jury were abolished on 1 January 1995.

==Uses==
''Nicotiana rustica'' is often used for [[entheogen]]ic purposes by [[South America]]n [[Shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date = 1992 | title = Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge - A Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution | publisher = Bantam | isbn = 978-0-553-37130-7 | page = 196 | chapter = Shamanic Tobaccos}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains up to nine times more nicotine than common species of ''[[Nicotiana]]'' such as ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' (common tobacco).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2015.04.016| pmid = 25934468| pmc = 5704902| title = Comprehensive chemical characterization of Rapé tobacco products: Nicotine, un-ionized nicotine, tobacco-specific N′-nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and flavor constituents| journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology| volume = 82| pages = 50–58| year = 2015| last1 = Stanfill| first1 = Stephen B.| last2 = Oliveira Da Silva| first2 = André Luiz| last3 = Lisko| first3 = Joseph G.| last4 = Lawler| first4 = Tameka S.| last5 = Kuklenyik| first5 = Peter| last6 = Tyx| first6 = Robert E.| last7 = Peuchen| first7 = Elizabeth H.| last8 = Richter| first8 = Patricia| last9 = Watson| first9 = Clifford H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons for its shamanic use are the comparatively high levels of [[beta-carboline]]s, including the [[harmala alkaloid]]s [[harmane]] and [[norharmane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Economic Botany | date = 1976 | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 295–297 | title = Nicotiana an hallucinogen? | author = Oscar Janiger and Marlene Dobkin de Rios}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most commonly, in South American ethnobotanical preparations, it is allowed to soak or be infused in water, and the water is then [[insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] into the stomach in a preparation known as ''singado'' or ''singa''; it is also smoked in [[cigar]]s, used as an [[enema]], made into a lickable product known as ''ambil'', and made into a snuff with the bark of a species of ''[[Theobroma]]'', creating ''[[nu-nu]]''. In the southeast part of Turkey, people use this herb and ashes of some tree bodies to make a moist snuff called ''maraş otu''. They use this by putting the mixture under their lips like Swedish [[snus]] or Afghan [[naswar]]. It is also a common admixture of [[Ayahuasca]] in some parts of the Amazon.

''N. rustica'' is no longer cultivated in its native North America, as ''N. tabacum'' has replaced it.&lt;ref name="ley196512"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, ''N. rustica'' is called "makhorka" (махорка). Historically, makhorka was smoked mainly by the lower classes. ''N. rustica'' is a hardy plant and can be grown in most of Russia (as opposed to ''N. virginiana'' which requires a warm climate), it was more readily and cheaply available, and did not depend on transport in a country with an underdeveloped road network and climatic portage problems. This remained the case until ordinary tobacco became widely available in the 20th Century. During Soviet times, rustic tobacco was an important industrial crop of agriculture. In those times, dozens of varieties were bred, some of them considered equal in quality to ''N. virginiana''. In modern times, makhorka is still sometimes smoked by peasants and farmers due to its high availability and being almost for free for them.

''N. rustica'' leaves have a nicotine content as high as 9%, whereas ''N. tabacum'' leaves contain about 1 to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsci.wustl.edu/~gjfritz/Nicotiana_sp.html |title=Nicotiana sp. |author= Katherine M.

==Thuốc lào (in Vietnam)==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
[[file:Hút thuốc lào.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A man smoking thuốc lào with a bamboo pipe]]
In Vietnam, it is most commonly smoked after a meal on a full stomach to "aid in digestion", or along with [[green tea]] or local beer (most commonly the cheap "bia hơi"). A "hít" of thuốc lào is followed by a flood of [[nicotine]] to the bloodstream inducing strong dizziness that lasts several seconds. It should be said, however, that even heavy cigarette smokers have had trouble with the intense volume of smoke and the high nicotine content, and that side effects include nausea and vomiting.

The main difference between smoking thuốc lào and the use of other tobaccos is in the method of consumption, in that thuốc lào is consumed with a water pipe. The smoker is presented with either a [[bamboo]] [[bong|pipe]] called a ''điếu cày'' (English: "farmer's pipe") or a ceramic [[hookah]] called a ''điếu bát''. It may also occasionally be smoked in a more uncommon pipe known as a ''điếu ống''. The pipe is filled with an appropriate amount of water and a small amount of thuốc lào is pressed into the bowl.

[[File:SacredTobacco.jpg|thumb|right|Flowering ''Nicotiana rustica'']]
[[File:Cánh đồng thuốc lào - Nicotiana rustica field.JPG|thumb|''Nicotiana rustica'' field in [[Quảng Xương]] district, [[Thanh Hóa province]], [[Vietnam]] ]]
One then ignites the tobacco and inhales to create a body of smoke inside the pipe, before exhaling the smoke, reversing the process of air in the pipe by blowing into it to pop out the tobacco. The smoker then sharply inhales, usually tilting the pipe upwards to an almost horizontal position (but not completely, as the water would drain out of the mouth).

==Maraş otu==
Maraş otu (English: Maraş weed) is a [[Chewing tobacco|chewing]] variant of ''Nicotiana rustica''. Commonly used by people who live in [[Kahramanmaraş|Maraş]], Turkey. Maraş Otu is a mix of [[Oak tree]] ash and ''Nicotiana rustica'' that resembles [[henna]].  It is recognized as a drug by anti-drug activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uyusturucu.info.tr/maras_otu.asp | title=Uyuşturucu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can contribute to mouth cancers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suluyayla.net/?Syf=26&amp;Syz=11481  {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Serer religion}}
The '''Njuup''' tradition is a conservative [[Serer people|Serer]] style of [[Music genre|music]] rooted in the [[Ndut initiation rite]] (a [[rite of passage]] that young Serers must go through once in their lifetime as commanded by the [[Serer religion]]).&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{en icon}} The Culture trip : [http://explore.theculturetrip.com/africa/africa-discussions/youssou-n-dour-an-unlikely-politician/  "Youssou N'Dour: An Unlikely Politician"] (Retrieved : 28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|Ndut initiation rite}}
The history of Njuup derives from the [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut classical teachings]].&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; Young Serer boys in the ''Ndut'' ([[nest]]) were required to compose religious songs during their [[circumcision]] rite of passage in order to take their minds off the pending circumcision operation, develop their artistic skills and spirituality. These songs are [[Serer religion|Serer religious]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Gav"/&gt; The Njuup tradition is the [[progenitor]] of [[Mbalax]] and for a long part of its history has remained within the confines of the ''Ndut''.  Unlike the ''Mbalax'' which is a [[Dance music|party music]], the Njuup tradition is religious, and it was not until some prominent [[Senegal]]ese artists such [[Youssou N'Dour]] (himself of [[Serer people|Serer heritage]]) began to incorporate it in their early works thereby giving birth to the ''Mbalax'' music.&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; All Mbalax artists are strongly influenced by the Njuup tradition. There are also other [[Senegambia]]n artists who sing the purest form of Njuup in the [[Serer language]], some of these include [[Rémi Jegaan Dioh]],&lt;ref name="Ferloo"&gt;{{fr icon}} Ferloo [http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html "Rémi Jegaan Dioh : Sur un air culturel et cultuel "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513074200/http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html |date=2012-05-13 }} (Retrieved : 28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} All Africa [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201002251041.html "Sénégal: Rémi Diégane Dioh présente samedi son CD dédié à Senghor"]&lt;/ref&gt; the late Serer diva - [[Yandé Codou Sène]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} All Africa [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201112220375.html "Sénégal: Commémoration du dixième anniversaire du décès de Senghor - Les héritiers de Yandé Codou Sène et de Julien Jouga assurent les partitions"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
{{main article|Serer religion|Pangool|Mbalax}}
The [[Serer religion]] especially the veneration of certain Serer [[Pangool]] influenced the religious songs sang in the [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut]]&lt;ref name="Gav"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]]  [http://www.refer.sn/ethiopiques/article.php3?id_article=895&amp;artsuite=6 Le Ndut dans « L'héritage spirituel sereer : valuer traditionnelle d'hier, d'aujourd'hui et de demain »] [in] ''Éthiopiques'' n° 31&lt;/ref&gt;  such as the Njuup, which in turn influenced the [[Mbalax]] and [[:Category:Senegalese singers|Senegalese artists]] who specializes in Mbalax i.e. [[Mbaye Dieye Faye]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Thione Seck]], etc.&lt;ref name="Ferloo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6676">{{Creationism}}
The discovery of [[nylon-eating bacteria]] has been used by critics of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]], in both print articles and on websites, to challenge creationist claims. These bacteria can produce novel [[enzyme]]s that allow them to feed on by-products of nylon manufacture which did not exist prior to the invention of [[nylon]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Kinoshita, S., Kageyama, S., Iba, K., Yamada, Y. and Okada, H. Utilization of a cyclic dimer and linear oligomers of ε-aminocapronoic acid by Achromobacter guttatus K172, Agric. Biol. Chem. 116, 547-551 (1981), FEBS 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of creationism have argued that this contradicts creationist claims that no new information can be added to a genome by [[mutation]], and that proteins are too complex to evolve through a process of mutation and [[natural selection]]. Creationists have posted responses to these challenges on their own websites, which have in turn generated more responses from their critics.

==Critics of creationism ==
The issue was first raised by critics of creationism such as the [[National Center for Science Education]], and New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) who stated that research refutes claims made by creationists and [[intelligent design]] proponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/4661_issue_16_volume_5_number_2__4_10_2003.asp#New%20Proteins%20Without%20God's%20Help New Proteins Without God's Help] &amp;ndash; William M. Thwaites&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug]&lt;/ref&gt; The claims were that random [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] can never add new information to a [[genome]] and that the odds against a useful new [[protein]], such as an enzyme, arising through a process of random mutation would be prohibitively high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB101_2.html Claim CB101_2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB102.html (CB102)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Dave Thomas (physicist)|Dave Thomas]], the President of NMSR, has stated that [[gene duplication]] and [[frame-shift mutation]]s were powerful sources of random mutation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Dave Thomas's ''New Mexicans for Science and Reason'' article about nylon eating bacteria]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, in response to comments by creationists such as Don Batten, NMSR has stated that it was these mutations that gave rise to nylonase, even if the genes were part of a [[plasmid]] as suggested by Batten.&lt;ref name="nmsr"&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm#update update] to ''New Mexicans for Science and Reason'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationists==
Proponents of [[creationism]], such as [[Answers in Genesis]] and [[Creation Ministries International]], have cited analyses posted by Don Batten that cited scientific research that showed the genes involved were on a [[plasmid]], and stated that the phenomenon is evidence that plasmids in bacteria are a designed feature intended to allow bacteria to adapt easily to new food sources or cope with toxic chemicals. Batten stated
&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems clear that plasmids are designed features of bacteria that enable adaptation to new food sources or the degradation of toxins. The details of just how they do this remains to be elucidated. The results so far clearly suggest that these adaptations did not come about by chance mutations, but by some designed mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Don Batten "[http://creation.com/the-adaptation-of-bacteria-to-feeding-on-nylon-waste The adaptation of bacteria to feeding on nylon waste]" ''Creation Ministries International''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Opponents of creationism have dismissed Batten's analysis. NMSR has stated that the gene duplication and frame-shift mutations that gave rise to nylonase were powerful sources of random mutation, whether or not the genes were part of a [[plasmid]] as suggested by Batten.&lt;ref name="nmsr" /&gt; A posting at [[TalkOrigins Archive]] by Ian Musgrave states that bacteria carry many genes in plasmids, particularly those involved in xenobiotic handling or metabolic functions. He states that in ''Pseudomonas'', most of the xenobiotic degradation genes are on plasmids. Therefore it is entirely likely that a xenobiotic handling enzyme will arise from mutations of xenobiotic handling genes. The fact that these genes are on plasmids does not invalidate the fact that they exist, and exist only in two strains of bacteria. Musgrave also criticized Batten for mis-stating the conclusions of some of the authors of the scientific literature on nylon eating bacteria.&lt;ref&gt; Musgrave, Ian [http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/apr04.html ''Nylonase Enzymes''], TalkOrigins Archive Post of the Month, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===
[[MSNBC]] published an editorial from science writer Ker Than that stated that the [[evolution]] of the enzymes, known as [[nylonase]], produced by nylon-eating bacteria was a compelling argument against the claim made by intelligent design proponents that [[specified complexity]] required an intelligent designer, since nylonase function was both specified and complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9452500/page/2/ Why scientists dismiss 'intelligent design'], Ker Than, [[MSNBC]], Sept. 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligent design proponent [[William Dembski]] posted a response that questioned whether the genetic changes that produced nylonase were complex enough to be considered specified complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/why-scientists-should-not-dismiss-intelligent-design/ Why Scientists Should NOT Dismiss Intelligent Design by William Dembski]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth R. Miller|Ken Miller]] said that intelligent design proponents claim that we can't see either design or evolution taking place and that therefore, according to the design proponents, intelligent design and evolution are both just matters of faith or world view. However, Miller said, the evolution of the enzyme nylonase, which scientists were able to repeat in the lab with another strain of bacteria, is one of a number of cases that show that evolution can be observed as it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Kenneth R.

'''Our Lady of Salambáo''' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]: ''Nuestra Señora Inmaculada Concepción de Salambáo''; [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Mahal Na Birhen Ng Salambáo'' or Birheng Na Salambaw is a [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Titles of Mary|title]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated in [[Obando, Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. The Virgin Mary under this title is venerated as the local [[patron saint|patroness]] of fishing, owing to the image's discovery in a ''[[Salambáw]]'' a type of big fishing net supported by a Bamboo Crosspieces mounted on a Bamboo Raft:

The image is enshrined with [[Saint Clare of Assisi]] and [[Saint Paschal Baylon]] inside [[Obando  Church]]. The three saints form a triad that is the focus of the annual [[Obando Fertility Rites]] held from 17th to 19th of May

==Legend==
The date of the image's finding is traditionally held to be 19 June 1763. Three fishermen, named Juan, Julián, and Diego dela Cruz, were fishing at a place known as Hulingduong, Tambobong; Now Malabon City There, they caught the statue with their ''Salambáw'', which is a type of Big fishing lift net  made from bamboo crosspieces and mounted on a raft. When the fishermen intended to bring the Virgin's image to neighbouring [[Navotas]], their boat suddenly grew heavy and immobile. They decided to head for Obando, and their craft suddenly lightened and became easy to paddle. This they took to be a sign that the Virgin wanted to be enshrined in Obando.

The image&amp;mdash;complete with a replica ''salambáw''&amp;mdash;is now housed in a wooden ''retablo'' ([[reredos]]) above the high altar of San Pascual Baylon Parish, together with statues of Saint Clare and Saint Paschal. A replica of the statue, in its own ''salambáw'', is used for the annual procession on the third day of the Rites.

==Feast==
The feast of Our Lady of Salambáo is on 19 May, which is the last day of a [[triduum]] honouring the triad of saints. Spread across the triduum are the Rites, which constitute [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] and [[procession]]s where devotees of both sexes joyfully dance the ''[[fandango]]'' in supplication for a spouse or child. The celebrations are centred on the San Pascual Baylon Parish Church, also known as the Diocesan Shrine of Nuestra Señora de la Inmaculada Concepción de Salambáo in Barangay Pag-asa, Obando, Bulacan.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

The '''Pharisees''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ær|ə|ˌ|s|iː|z}}) were at various times a [[political party]], a [[social movement]], and a [[school of thought]] in the [[Holy Land]] during the time of [[Second Temple Judaism]]. After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundational, liturgical and ritualistic basis for [[Rabbinic Judaism]].

Conflicts between Pharisees and [[Sadducees]] took place in the context of much broader and longstanding social and religious conflicts among Jews, made worse by the Roman conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-the-dead-sea-scrolls#Essenes |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls: History &amp; Overview |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org |first1=Ayala |last1=Sussman |first2=Ruth |last2=Peled |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another conflict was cultural, between those who favored [[Hellenization]] (the Sadducees) and those who resisted it (the Pharisees). A third was juridico-religious, between those who emphasized the importance of the [[Second Temple]] with its [[Cult (religious practice)|rites and services]], and those who emphasized the importance of other [[Mosaic Law]]s. A fourth point of conflict, specifically religious, involved different interpretations of the [[Torah]] and how to apply it to current Jewish life, with Sadducees recognizing only the [[Written Torah]] (with Greek philosophy) and rejecting doctrines such as the [[Oral Torah]], the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], and the [[resurrection of the dead]].

[[Josephus]] (37 – c. 100&amp;nbsp;CE), believed by many historians to be a Pharisee, estimated the total Pharisee population before the fall of the [[Second Temple]] to be around 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', 17.42&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus claimed that Pharisees received the full support and goodwill of the common people, apparently in contrast to the more elite Sadducees, who were the upper class. Pharisees claimed [[Moses|Mosaic]] authority for their interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Ber. 48b; Shab. 14b; Yoma 80a; Yeb. 16a; Nazir 53a; Ḥul. 137b; et al.)&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Halakha|Jewish Laws]], while Sadducees represented the authority of the [[Kohanim|priestly privileges]] and prerogatives established since the days of [[Solomon]], when [[Zadok]], their ancestor, officiated as [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]]. The phrase "common people" in Josephus' writings suggests that most Jews were "just Jewish people", distinguishing them from the main liturgical groups.

Outside [[Jewish history]] and literature, Pharisees have been made notable by references in the [[New Testament]] to conflicts with [[John the Baptist]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|3:1–7|9}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|7:28–30|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Jesus]]. There are also several references in the New Testament to the [[Apostle Paul]] being a Pharisee.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Apostle Paul as a Pharisee {{bibleverse|Acts|26:5|9}} See also {{bibleverse|Acts|23:6|9}}, {{bibleverse|Philippians|3:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between [[Early Christianity]] and Pharisees was not always hostile however: e.g. [[Gamaliel#As a Christian|Gamaliel]] is often cited as a Pharisaic leader who was sympathetic to [[Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|5:34-39|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Pharisee" is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ''Pharisaios'' ({{lang|grc|Φαρισαῖος}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongGreek|5330}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Aramaic]] ''Pərīšā'' ({{script|Hebr|פְּרִישָׁא}}), plural ''Pərīšayyā'' ({{script|Hebr|פְּרִישַׁיָּא}}), meaning "set apart, separated", related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''pārûš'' ({{script|Hebr|פָּרוּשׁ}}), plural ''pĕrûšîm'' ({{script|Hebr|פְּרוּשִׁים}}), the [[Qal (linguistics)|Qal]] [[Participle#Perfect passive|passive participle]] of the verb ''pāraš'' ({{script|Hebr|פָּרַשׁ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Ernest |title=A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language for Readers of English |publisher=University of Haifa | year=1987 |isbn=965-220-093-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongHebrew|6567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources ==
The first historical mention of the Pharisees and their beliefs comes in the four gospels and the Book of Acts, in which both their meticulous adherence to their interpretation of the Torah as well as their eschatological views are described. A later historical mention of the Pharisees comes from the Jewish-Roman historian [[Josephus]] (37–100&amp;nbsp;CE) in a description of the "four schools of thought", or "four sects", into which he divided the Jews in the 1st century CE. (The other schools were the [[Essenes]], who were generally apolitical and who may have emerged as a sect of dissident priests who rejected either the [[Seleucid]]-appointed or the [[Hasmonean]] high priests as illegitimate; the [[Sadducees]], the main antagonists of the Pharisees; and the "fourth philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Ant. 18.9&lt;/ref&gt;) Other sects emerged at this time, such as the [[Early Christians]] in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] and the [[Therapeutae]] in [[Egypt]].

[[2 Maccabees]], a [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Books of the Bible#Intertestamental books|book of the Bible]], focuses on the [[Jew]]s' revolt against the Seleucid king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and concludes with the defeat of his general, [[Nicanor (Seleucid general)|Nicanor]], in 161&amp;nbsp;BCE by [[Judas Maccabeus]], the [[hero]] of the work. It was likely written by a Pharisee or someone sympathetic toward Pharisees, as it includes several theological innovations: propitiatory [[prayer for the dead]], [[Last judgment|judgment day]], [[intercession of saints]] and [[Martyrology (Judaism)|merits of the martyrs]].

[[Judah haNasi]] redacted the [[Mishnah]], an authoritative codification of Pharisaic interpretations, around 200&amp;nbsp;CE. Most of the authorities quoted in the Mishnah lived after the destruction of the Temple in 70&amp;nbsp;CE; it thus marks the beginning of the transition from Pharisaic to [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. The Mishnah was supremely important because it compiled the oral interpretations and traditions of the Pharisees and later on the Rabbis into a single authoritative text, thus allowing oral tradition within Judaism to survive the destruction of the Second Temple.

However, none of the Rabbinic sources include identifiable eyewitness accounts of the Pharisees and their teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://louisjacobs.org/reviews-written-by-louis-jacobs/jacob-neusner-rabbinic-traditions-pharisees-70/ |title=Jacob Neusner, 'The Rabbinic traditions about the Pharisees before 70' |date=12 May 2016 |first=Jacob |last=Neusner |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History (c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC – c.&amp;nbsp;160&amp;nbsp;BC)==
The deportation and [[Babylonian captivity|exile]] of an unknown number of Jews of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]] to [[Babylon]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], starting with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BCE)|first deportation in 597&amp;nbsp;BCE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford History of the Biblical World |editor-first=Michael D. |editor-last=Coogan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE)|fall of Jerusalem]] and destruction of [[Solomon's Temple|the Temple]] in 587&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bible verse||Jeremiah|52:28–30|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in dramatic changes to Jewish culture and religion.  During the 70-year exile in Babylon, Jewish houses of assembly (known in Hebrew as a ''beit knesset'' or in Greek as a ''[[synagogue]]'') and houses of prayer (Hebrew ''Beit Tefilah''; Greek προσευχαί, ''proseuchai'') were the primary meeting places for prayer, and the house of study (''[[Beth midrash|beit midrash]]'') was the counterpart for the synagogue.

In 539&amp;nbsp;BCE the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] conquered [[Babylon]], and in 537&amp;nbsp;BCE [[Cyrus the Great]] allowed Jews to return to [[Judea]] and rebuild the Temple. He did not, however, allow the restoration of [[Kings of Judah|the Judean monarchy]], which left the [[Kohanim|Judean priests]] as the dominant authority. Without the constraining power of the monarchy, the authority of the Temple in civic life was amplified. It was around this time that the Sadducee party emerged as the party of priests and allied elites. However, the [[Second Temple]], which was completed in 515&amp;nbsp;BCE, had been constructed under the auspices of a foreign power, and there were lingering questions about its legitimacy. This provided the condition for the development of various sects or "schools of thought," each of which claimed exclusive authority to represent "Judaism," and which typically shunned social intercourse, especially marriage, with members of other sects. In the same period, the council of sages known as the [[Sanhedrin]] may have codified and [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|canonized the Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]), from which, following the return from Babylon, the [[Torah reading|Torah was read publicly]] on market-days.

The Temple was no longer the only institution for Jewish religious life. After the building of the Second Temple in the time of [[Ezra the Scribe]], the houses of study and worship remained important secondary institutions in Jewish life. Outside Judea, the synagogue was often called a house of prayer. While most Jews could not regularly attend the Temple service, they could meet at the synagogue for morning, afternoon and evening prayers. On Mondays, Thursdays and [[Shabbat]]s, a weekly Torah portion was read publicly in the synagogues, following the tradition of public Torah readings instituted by Ezra.&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleverse||Nehemiah|8:1–18|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although priests controlled the rituals of the Temple, the [[scribes]] and sages, later called ''[[rabbi]]s'' (''Heb.'': "Teacher/master"), dominated the study of the Torah.  These men maintained an [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]] that they believed had originated at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] alongside the Torah of Moses; a God-given interpretation of the [[Torah]].

The [[Hellenistic]] period of Jewish history began when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Persia in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. The rift between the priests and the sages developed during this time, when Jews faced new political and cultural struggles. After Alexander's death in 323&amp;nbsp;BCE, Judea was ruled by the Egyptian-Hellenic [[Ptolemies]] until 198&amp;nbsp;BCE, when the Syrian-Hellenic [[Seleucid Empire]], under [[Antiochus III]], seized control. Then, in 167&amp;nbsp;BCE, the Seleucid king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] invaded Judea, entered the Temple, and stripped it of money and ceremonial objects. He imposed a program of forced [[Hellenization]], requiring Jews to abandon their own laws and customs, thus precipitating the [[Maccabean Revolt]]. Jerusalem was liberated in 165&amp;nbsp;BCE and the Temple was restored. In 141&amp;nbsp;BCE an assembly of priests and others affirmed [[Simon Maccabeus]] as high priest and leader, in effect establishing the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty.

==Emergence of the Pharisees==
After defeating the Seleucid forces, [[Judas Maccabaeus]]'s nephew [[John Hyrcanus]] established a new monarchy in the form of the priestly Hasmonean dynasty in 152&amp;nbsp;BCE, thus establishing priests as political as well as religious authorities. Although the Hasmoneans were considered heroes for resisting the Seleucids, their reign lacked the legitimacy conferred by descent from the [[Davidic line|Davidic dynasty]] of the [[First Temple]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Catherwood |first=Christopher |title=A Brief History of the Middle East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krKeBAAAQBAJ |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |year=2011 |isbn=9781849018074 |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pharisee ("separatist") party emerged largely out of the group of scribes and sages. Their name comes from the Hebrew and Aramaic ''parush'' or ''parushi'', which means "one who is separated." It may refer to their separation from Gentiles, sources of ritual impurity or from irreligious Jews.&lt;ref name="Shaye"&gt;{{cite book |title=From the Maccabees to the Mishnah |last=Cohen |first=Shaye J.D. |publisher=The Westminster Press |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}} The Pharisees, among other Jewish sects, were active from the middle of the second century BCE until the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE.&lt;ref name="Shaye" /&gt;{{rp|143}} Josephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus ("Ant." xiii. 5, § 9). One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) ''outside'' the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.

Josephus indicates that the Pharisees received the backing and good-will of the common people, apparently in contrast to the more elite Sadducees associated with the ruling classes. In general, whereas the Sadducees were aristocratic monarchists, the Pharisees were eclectic, popular, and more democratic. (Roth 1970: 84) The Pharisaic position is exemplified by the assertion that "A learned ''[[mamzer]]'' takes precedence over an ignorant High Priest." (A ''mamzer'', according to the Pharisaic definition, is an outcast child born of a forbidden relationship, such as adultery or incest, in which marriage of the parents could not lawfully occur. The word is often, but incorrectly, translated as "illegitimate".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People |editor-first=Leo Walden |editor-last=Schwartz |first=Salo Wittmayer |last=Baron |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Great_ages_and_ideas_of_the_Jewish_peopl.html?id=D5BtAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Random House |year=1956 |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadducees rejected the Pharisaic tenet of an [[Oral Torah]]. In their personal lives this often meant an excessively stringent lifestyle from a Jewish perspective, as they did away with the oral tradition, and in turn the Pharisaic understanding of the Torah, creating two Jewish understandings of the Torah. An example of this differing approach is the interpretation of, "an eye in place of an eye". The Pharisaic understanding was that the value of an eye was to be paid by the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud tractate Bava Kamma Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sadducees' view the words were given a more literal interpretation, in which the offender's eye would be removed.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' s.v. "Sadducees"&lt;/ref&gt; From the point of view of the Pharisees, the Sadducees wished to change the Jewish understanding of the Torah, to a Greek understanding of the Torah. The Pharisees preserved the Pharisaical oral law in the form of the Talmud. They would become the foundation of Rabbinic Judaism.

The sages of the [[Talmud]] see a direct link between themselves and the Pharisees, and historians generally consider Pharisaic Judaism to be the progenitor of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], that is normative, mainstream Judaism after the destruction of the Second Temple.  All ''mainstream'' forms of Judaism today consider themselves heirs of Rabbinic Judaism and, ultimately, the Pharisees.

==The Hasmonean period==
{{main|Hasmoneans|Maccabees}}
Although the Pharisees did not support the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the [[Idumeans]], the political rift between them became wider when a Pharisee named Eleazar insulted the Hasmonean ethnarch [[John Hyrcanus]] at his own table, suggesting that he should abandon his role as High Priest due to a rumour, probably untrue, that he had been conceived while his mother was a prisoner of war. In response, he distanced himself from the Pharisees.&lt;ref&gt;Ant. 13.288–296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nickelsburg, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of John Hyrcanus his younger son [[Alexander Jannaeus]] made himself king and openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees. However, on his deathbed Jannaeus advised his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]], to seek reconciliation with the Pharisees. Her brother was Shimon ben Shetach, a leading Pharisee. Josephus attests that Salome was favorably inclined toward the Pharisees, and their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the [[Sanhedrin]] or Jewish Council, which they came to dominate.

After her death her elder son [[Hyrcanus II]] was generally supported by the Pharisees. Her younger son, [[Aristobulus II]], was in conflict with Hyrcanus, and tried to seize power. The Pharisees seemed to be in a vulnerable position at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=mRUdnEVqersC |first=Junghwa |last=Choi |title=Jewish Leadership in Roman Palestine from 70 C.E. to 135 C.E. |publisher=BRILL |year=2013 |page=90 |isbn=9004245146 |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict between the two sons culminated in a civil war that ended when the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Pompey]] intervened, and captured [[Jerusalem]] in 63&amp;nbsp;BCE.

Josephus' account may overstate the role of the Pharisees. He reports elsewhere that the Pharisees did not grow to power until the reign of Queen [[Salome Alexandra]] (JW.1.110). As Josephus was himself a Pharisee, his account might represent a historical creation meant to elevate the status of the Pharisees during the height of the Hasmonean Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Sievers, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts like the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] record a host of rulings by rabbis, some of whom are believed to be from among the Pharisees, concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance.  In their day, the influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people was strong and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many.

==The Roman period==
{{main|Judaea (Roman province)}}
[[File:Pompée dans le Temple de Jérusalem.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Pompey in the Temple of Jerusalem'', by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]

According to Josephus, the Pharisees appeared before [[Pompey]] asking him to interfere and restore the old priesthood while abolishing the royalty of the Hasmoneans altogether ("Ant." xiv. 3, § 2). Pharisees also opened Jerusalem's gates to the Romans, and actively supported them against the Sadducean faction.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the Second Temple Period'', Paolo Sacchi, ch. 8 p. 269: "At this point, the majority of the city's inhabitants, pro-Pharisee and pro-Hyrcanus, decided to open the city's gates to the Romans. Only a small minority of Sadducees took refuge in the Temple and decided to hold out until the very end. This was Autumn 63 BCE. On this occasion Pompey broke into the Temple."&lt;/ref&gt; When the Romans finally broke the entrance to the Jerusalem's Temple, the Pharisees killed the priests who were officiating the Temple services on Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wars of the Jews'', Flavius Josephus, Translated by William Whiston, A.M. Auburn and Buffalo John E. Beardsley, 1895, sections 142–150: "And now did many of the priests, even when they saw their enemies assailing them with swords in their hands, without any disturbance, go on with their Divine worship, and were slain while they were offering their drink-offerings, ... The greatest part of them were slain by their own countrymen, of the adverse faction, and an innumerable multitude threw themselves down precipices"&lt;/ref&gt; They regarded [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|Pompey's defilement of the Temple in Jerusalem]] as a divine punishment of Sadducean misrule. Pompey ended the monarchy in 63 BCE and named [[Hyrcanus II]] high priest and [[ethnarch]] (a lesser title than "king").&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Jewish People'', H.H. Ben-Sasson, page 223: "Thus the independence of Hasmonean Judea came to an end;"&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later Hyrcanus was deprived of the remainder of political authority and ultimate jurisdiction was given to the [[Roman Syria|Proconsul of Syria]], who ruled through Hyrcanus's Idumaean associate [[Antipater the Idumaean|Antipater]], and later Antipater's two sons [[Phasael]] (military governor of Judea) and [[Herod the Great|Herod]] (military governor of Galilee). In 40&amp;nbsp;BCE Aristobulus's son Antigonus overthrew Hyrcanus and named himself king and high priest, and Herod fled to Rome.

In Rome, Herod sought the support of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]], and secured recognition by the [[Roman Senate]] as king, confirming the termination of the Hasmonean dynasty.  According to Josephus, Sadducean opposition to Herod led him to treat the Pharisees favorably ("Ant." xiv. 9, § 4; xv. 1, § 1; 10, § 4; 11, §§ 5–6). Herod was an unpopular ruler, perceived as a Roman puppet. Despite his [[Herod's Temple|restoration and expansion of the Second Temple]], Herod’s notorious treatment of his own family and of the last Hasmonaeans further eroded his popularity.  According to Josephus, the Pharisees ultimately opposed him and thus fell victims (4&amp;nbsp;BCE) to his bloodthirstiness ("Ant." xvii. 2, § 4; 6, §§ 2–4).  The family of [[Boethusians|Boethus]], whom Herod had raised to the high-priesthood, revived the spirit of the Sadducees, and thenceforth the Pharisees again had them as antagonists ("Ant." xviii. 1, § 4).

While it stood, the Second Temple remained the center of Jewish ritual life. According to the Torah, Jews were required to travel to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices at the Temple [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals|three times a year]]: Pesach ([[Passover]]), [[Shavuot]] (the Feast of Weeks), and [[Sukkot]] (the Feast of Tabernacles).  The Pharisees, like the Sadducees, were politically quiescent, and studied, taught, and worshiped in their own way.  At this time serious theological differences emerged between the Sadducees and Pharisees.  The notion that the sacred could exist outside the Temple, a view central to the Essenes, was shared and elevated by the Pharisees.

==The Pharisaic legacy==
At first the values of the Pharisees developed through their sectarian debates with the Sadducees; then they developed through internal, non-sectarian debates over the law as an adaptation to life without the Temple, and life in exile, and eventually, to a more limited degree, life in conflict with Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} These shifts mark the transformation of Pharisaic to Rabbinic Judaism. 

===Beliefs===
No single tractate of the key Rabbinic texts, the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]], is devoted to theological issues; these texts are concerned primarily with interpretations of Jewish law, and anecdotes about the sages and their values. Only one chapter of the Mishnah deals with theological issues; it asserts that three kinds of people will have no share in "the [[world to come]]:" those who deny the [[resurrection of the dead]], those who deny the [[Torah#Divine significance of letters, Jewish mysticism|divinity of the Torah]], and [[Epicurean]]s (who deny divine supervision of human affairs). Another passage suggests a different set of core principles: normally, a Jew may violate ''any'' law to save a life, but in Sanhedrin 74a, a ruling orders Jews to accept [[martyr]]dom rather than violate the laws against [[idolatry]], [[murder]], or [[adultery]]. ([[Judah haNasi]], however, said that Jews must "be meticulous in small religious duties as well as large ones, because you do not know what sort of reward is coming for any of the religious duties," suggesting that all laws are of equal importance). In comparison with [[Christianity]], the Rabbis were not especially concerned with the [[messiah]] or claims about the messiah or [[Greatest Commandment|ranking the laws in importance]].

====Monotheism====
One belief central to the Pharisees was shared by all Jews of the time is [[monotheism]]. This is evident in the practice of reciting the ''[[Shema]]'', a prayer composed of select verses from the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 6:4), at the Temple and in synagogues; the ''Shema'' begins with the verses, "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God; the Lord is one."  According to the [[Mishna]], these passages were recited in the Temple along with the twice-daily ''Tamid'' offering; Jews in the [[diaspora]], who did not have access to the Temple, recited these passages in their houses of assembly. According to the Mishnah and Talmud, the men of the [[Great Assembly]] instituted the requirement that Jews both in Judea and in the diaspora pray three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening), and include in their prayers a recitation of these passages in the morning ("[[Shacharit]]") and evening ("[[Jewish services|Ma'ariv]]") prayers.

====Wisdom====
Pharisaic wisdom was compiled in one book of the Mishna, ''[[Pirkei Avot]]''. The Pharisaic attitude is perhaps best exemplified by a story about the sages [[Hillel the Elder]] and [[Shammai]], who both lived in the latter half of the 1st century BCE. A [[gentile]] once challenged Shammai to teach him the wisdom of the Torah while he stood on one foot. Shammai drove him away. The same gentile approached Hillel and asked of him the same thing. Hillel chastised him gently by saying, "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation – now go and study."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3gyo7hs4RcsC&amp;pg=PA129 The Oxford Handbook of the History of Ethics]'', edited by Roger Crisp, 2013, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PYCaWrFGy6YC&amp;pg=PA267 Saving the Bill of Rights: Exposing the Left's Campaign to Destroy American Exceptionalism]'', Frank Miniter, 2011, p.268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nq1MTA0Hjz4C&amp;pg=PA265 Kissing Fish]'', Roger Wolsey, 2011, p.265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4jnTpqGUWDsC&amp;pg=PA142 The Moral Foundation of Economic Behavior]'', David C.

====Free will and predestination====
According to Josephus, whereas the Sadducees believed that people have total [[free will]] and the Essenes believed that all of a person's life is [[Predestination|predestined]], the Pharisees believed that people have free will but that God also has foreknowledge of human [[destiny]]. This also accords with the statement in ''Pirkei Avot'' 3:19, "Rabbi Akiva said: All is foreseen, but freedom of choice is given". According to Josephus, Pharisees were further distinguished from the Sadducees in that Pharisees believed in the [[resurrection of the dead]].

====The afterlife====
{{see also|Afterlife}}
Unlike the Sadducees, who are generally held to have rejected any existence after death, the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees on the afterlife. According to the New Testament the Pharisees believed in the [[resurrection of the dead]], but it does not specify whether this resurrection included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people would be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and "pass into other bodies," while "the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle|The Apostle Paul]], declared himself to be a Pharisee before his conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.6, 26.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schnelle2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Udo Schnelle|title=Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-6wBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT51|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Baker Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4412-4200-6|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practices===

====A kingdom of priests====
Fundamentally, the Pharisees continued a form of Judaism that extended beyond the Temple, applying Jewish law to mundane activities in order to sanctify the every-day world. This was a more participatory (or "democratic") form of Judaism, in which rituals were not monopolized by an inherited priesthood but rather could be performed by all adult Jews individually or collectively; whose leaders were not determined by birth but by scholarly achievement.

Many, including some scholars, have characterized the Sadducees as a sect that interpreted the Torah literally, and the Pharisees as interpreting the Torah liberally. R' [[Yitzhak Isaac Halevy Rabinowitz|Yitzhak Isaac Halevi]] suggests that this was not, in fact, a matter of religion. He claims that the complete rejection of Judaism would not have been tolerated under the Hasmonean rule and therefore Hellenists maintained that they were rejecting not Judaism but Rabbinic law.  Thus, the Sadducees were in fact a political party not a religious sect.&lt;ref&gt;''Dorot Ha'Rishonim''&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Jacob Neusner]], this view is a distortion.  He suggests that two things fundamentally distinguished the Pharisaic from the Sadducean approach to the Torah. First, Pharisees believed in a broad and literal interpretation of Exodus (19:3–6), "you shall be my own possession among all peoples; for all the earth is mine, and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,"&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob ''Invitation to the Talmud: a Teaching Book'' (1998):40&lt;/ref&gt; and the words of [[2 Maccabees]] (2:17): "God gave all the people the heritage, the kingdom, the priesthood, and the holiness."

The Pharisees believed that the idea that all of the children of Israel were to be like priests was expressed elsewhere in the [[Torah]], for example, when the Law itself was transferred from the sphere of the priesthood to every man in Israel ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19: 29–24; [[Deuteronomy]] 6: 7, 11: 19; comp. 31: 9; [[Jeremiah]] 2: 8, 18:18). Moreover, the Torah already provided ways for all Jews to lead a priestly life: the [[Kosher|precepts concerning unclean meat]] were perhaps intended originally for the priests, but were extended to the whole people ([[Leviticus]] 11; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:3–21); the prohibition of cutting the flesh in mourning for the dead ([[Deuteronomy]] 14: 1–2, [[Leviticus]] 19: 28; comp. Lev. 21: 5).  The Pharisees believed that all Jews in their ordinary life, and not just the Temple priesthood or Jews visiting the Temple, should observe rules and rituals concerning purification.

====The Oral Torah====
{{Main|Oral Torah}}
The standard view is that the Pharisees differed from Sadducees in the sense that they accepted the Oral Torah in addition to the Scripture. Saldarini argues that this assumption has neither implicit nor explicit evidence. A critique of the ancient interpretations of the Bible are distant from what modern scholars consider literal. Saldarini states that the Oral Torah did not come about until the third century AD, although there was an unstated idea about it in existence. Every Jewish community in a way possessed their own version of the Oral Torah which governed their religious practices. [[Josephus]] stated that the Sadducees only followed literal interpretations of the Torah. To Saldarini, this only means that the Sadducees followed their own way of Judaism and rejected the Pharisaic version of Judaism.&lt;ref name="Saldarini2001"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bre6P-OPfEEC&amp;pg=PA303|title=Pharisees, Scribes and Sadducees in Palestinian Society: A Sociological Approach|author=Anthony J. Saldarini|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8028-4358-6|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Ruether the Pharisaic proclamation of the Oral Torah was their way of freeing Judaism from the clutches of Aaronite priesthood, represented by the Sadducees. The Oral Torah was to remain oral but was later given a written form. It did not refer to the Torah in a status as a commentary, rather had its own separate existence which allowed Pharisaic innovations.&lt;ref name="Ruether1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNJJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|title=Faith and Fratricide: The Theological Roots of Anti-Semitism|author=Rosemary Ruether|date=8 September 1996|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-0-9653517-5-1|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sages of the Talmud believed that the Oral law was simultaneously revealed to Moses at Sinai, ''and'' the product of debates among rabbis. Thus, one may conceive of the "Oral Torah" not as a fixed text but as an ongoing process of analysis and argument in which God is actively involved; it was this ongoing process that was revealed at Sinai, and by participating in this ongoing process rabbis and their students are actively participating in God's ongoing act of [[revelation]].

As Jacob Neusner has explained, the schools of the Pharisees and rabbis were and are holy
&lt;blockquote&gt;"because there men achieve sainthood through study of Torah and imitation of the conduct of the masters. In doing so, they conform to the heavenly paradigm, the Torah believed to have been created by God "in his image," revealed at Sinai, and handed down to their own teachers ... If the masters and disciples obey the divine teaching of Moses, "our rabbi," then their society, the school, replicates on earth the heavenly academy, just as the disciple incarnates the heavenly model of Moses, "our rabbi." The rabbis believe that Moses was (and the Messiah will be) a rabbi, God dons phylacteries, and the heavenly court studies Torah precisely as does the earthly one, even arguing about the same questions. These beliefs today may seem as projections of rabbinical values onto heaven, but the rabbis believe that they themselves are projections of heavenly values onto earth. The rabbis thus conceive that on earth they study Torah just as God, the angels, and Moses, "our rabbi," do in heaven. The heavenly schoolmen are even aware of Babylonian scholastic discussions, so they require a rabbi's information about an aspect of purity taboos.&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob ''Invitation to the Talmud: a Teaching Book'' (1998): 8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The commitment to relate religion to daily life through the law has led some (notably, [[Saint Paul]] and [[Martin Luther]]) to infer that the Pharisees were more legalistic than other sects in the Second Temple Era. The authors of the Gospels present Jesus as speaking harshly against some Pharisees (Josephus does claim that the Pharisees were the "strictest" observers of the law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josepheus|title=The Antiquities of the Jews|pages=13.5.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more accurate to say they were legalistic in a different way.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In some cases Pharisaic values led to an extension of the law — for example, the Torah requires priests to bathe themselves before entering the Temple. The Pharisees washed themselves before Sabbath and festival meals (in effect, making these holidays "temples in time"), and, eventually, before all meals. Although this seems burdensome compared to the practices of the Sadducees, in other cases, Pharisaic law was less strict.  For example, Jewish law [[eruv|prohibits Jews from carrying objects]] from a private domain ("reshut ha-yachid") to a public domain ("reshut ha-rabim") on Sabbath. This law could have prevented Jews from carrying cooked dishes to the homes of friends for Sabbath meals.  The Pharisees ruled that adjacent houses connected by lintels or fences could become connected by a legal procedure creating a partnership among homeowners; thereby, clarifying the status of those common areas as a private domain relative to the members of the partnership. In that manner people could carry objects from building to building.

====Innovators or preservers====
The Mishna in the beginning of Avot and (in more detail) [[Maimonides]] in his Introduction to ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' records a chain of tradition (mesorah) from Moses at Mount Sinai down to R' Ashi, redactor of the Talmud and last of the [[Amoraim]]. This chain of tradition includes the interpretation of unclear statements in the Bible (e.g. that the "fruit of a beautiful tree" refers to a [[citron]] as opposed to any other fruit), the methods of textual [[exegesis]] (the disagreements recorded in the Mishna and Talmud generally focus on methods of exegesis), and Laws with Mosaic authority that cannot be derived from the Biblical text (these include measurements (''e.g.'' what amount of a non-kosher food must one eat to be liable), the amount and order of the scrolls to be placed in the phylacteries, etc.).

The Pharisees were also innovators in that they enacted specific laws as they saw necessary according to the needs of the time. These included prohibitions to prevent an infringement of a biblical prohibition (e.g. one does not take a Lulav on Shabbat "Lest one carry it in the public domain") called gezeirot, among others. The commandment to read the Megillah ([[Book of Esther]]) on [[Purim]] and to light the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Menorah]] on [[Hanukkah]] are Rabbinic innovations. Much of the legal system is based on "what the sages constructed via logical reasoning and from established practice".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] ''The Students Guide through the Talmud'' Ch. 15 (English edition by Jacob Schacter&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the blessings before meals and the wording of the Amidah. These are known as [[Takanot]]. The Pharisees based their authority to innovate on the verses: "....according to the word they tell you... according to all they instruct you. According to the law they instruct you and according to the judgment they say to you, you shall do; you shall not divert from the word they tell you, either right or left" (Deuteronomy 17:10–11) (see ''Encyclopedia Talmudit'' entry "Divrei Soferim").

In an interesting twist, [[Abraham Geiger]] posits that the Sadducees were the more hidebound adherents to an ancient Halacha whereas the Pharisees were more willing to develop Halacha as the times required. See however, [[Bernard Revel]]'s "Karaite Halacha" which rejects many of Geiger's proofs.

====Significance of debate and study of the law====
Just as important as (if not more important than) any particular law was the value the rabbis placed on legal study and debate. The sages of the Talmud believed that when they taught the Oral Torah to their students, they were imitating Moses, who taught the law to the children of Israel. Moreover, the rabbis believed that "the heavenly court studies Torah precisely as does the earthly one, even arguing about the same questions."&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob ''Invitation to the Talmud: a Teaching Book'' (1998): 8&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in debating and disagreeing over the meaning of the Torah or how best to put it into practice, no rabbi felt that he (or his opponent) was rejecting God or threatening Judaism; on the contrary, it was precisely through such arguments that the rabbis imitated and honored God.

One sign of the Pharisaic emphasis on debate and differences of opinion is that the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] mark different generations of scholars in terms of different pairs of contending schools. In the first century, for example, the two major Pharisaic schools were those of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]].  After Hillel died in 20&amp;nbsp;CE, Shammai assumed the office of president of the [[Sanhedrin]] until he died in 30&amp;nbsp;CE. Followers of these two sages dominated scholarly debate over the following decades. Although the Talmud records the arguments and positions of the school of Shammai, the teachings of the school of Hillel were ultimately taken as authoritative.

==From Pharisees to rabbis==
{{Main article|Origins of Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic Judaism}}

Following the [[Jewish–Roman wars]], revolutionaries like the [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealots]] had been crushed by the Romans, and had little credibility (the last Zealots died at [[Masada]] in 73 CE). Similarly, the Sadducees, whose teachings were closely connected to the Temple, disappeared with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70&amp;nbsp;CE.  The Essenes too disappeared, perhaps because their teachings so diverged from the concerns of the times, perhaps because they were sacked by the Romans at [[Qumran]].{{Citation needed|reason=Not supported by Essene article|date=September 2018}}

Of all the major Second Temple sects, [[Origins of Rabbinic Judaism#The Emergence of Rabbinic Judaism|only the Pharisees remained]]. Their vision of Jewish law as a means by which ordinary people could engage with the sacred in their daily lives was a position meaningful to the majority of Jews.  Such teachings extended beyond ritual practices.  According to the classic [[midrash]] in ''Avot D'Rabbi Nathan'' (4:5):
:The Temple is destroyed. We never witnessed its glory. But Rabbi Joshua did. And when he looked at the Temple ruins one day, he burst into tears. "Alas for us! The place which atoned for the sins of all the people Israel lies in ruins!" Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort: "Be not grieved, my son. There is another way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We must now gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness."

Following the destruction of the Temple, Rome governed Judea through a [[Roman administration of Judaea (AD 6–135)|Procurator]] at [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] and a Jewish [[Patriarch]] and levied the [[Fiscus Judaicus]]. [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]], a leading Pharisee, was appointed the first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means [[prince]], or [[president]]), and he reestablished the [[Sanhedrin]] at [[Yavneh]] (see the related [[Council of Jamnia]]) under Pharisee control. Instead of giving [[tithe]]s to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the (now-destroyed) Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews to give charity. Moreover, they argued that all Jews should study in local [[synagogue]]s, because [[Torah]] is "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" (Deut. 33: 4).

After the destruction of the First Temple, Jews believed that God would forgive them and enable them to rebuild the Temple{{spaced ndash}} an event that actually occurred within three generations. After the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews wondered whether this would happen again.  When the Emperor [[Hadrian]] threatened to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], in 132, [[Aelia Capitolina]], some of the leading sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion led by [[Simon bar Kokhba|Simon Bar Kosiba]] (later known as Bar Kokhba), who established a short-lived independent state that was conquered by the Romans in 135.  With this defeat, Jews' hopes that the Temple would be rebuilt were crushed. Nonetheless, belief in a [[Third Temple]] remains a cornerstone of Jewish belief.

Romans forbade Jews to enter Jerusalem (except for the day of [[Tisha B'Av]]), and forbade any plan to rebuild the Temple. Instead, it took over the Province of Judea directly, renaming it [[Syria Palaestina]], and renaming Jerusalem [[Aelia Capitolina]]. Romans did eventually reconstitute the Sanhedrin under the leadership of Judah haNasi (who claimed to be a descendant of King David). They conferred the title of "Nasi" as hereditary, and Judah's sons served both as Patriarch and as heads of the Sanhedrin.

===Post-Temple developments===
According to historian Shaye Cohen, by the time three generations had passed after the destruction of the Second Temple, most Jews concluded that the Temple would not be rebuilt during their lives, nor in the foreseeable future. Jews were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions:
* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?
* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?
* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?
* How to connect present and past traditions?
Regardless of the importance they gave to the Temple, and despite their support of Bar Koseba's revolt, the Pharisees' vision of Jewish law as a means by which ordinary people could engage with the sacred in their daily lives provided them with a position from which to respond to all four challenges in a way meaningful to the vast majority of Jews. Their responses would constitute Rabbinic Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Shaye J.D. 1988 ''From the Maccabees to the Mishnah''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second Temple era, when Jews were divided into sects, the Pharisees were one sect among many, and partisan. Each sect claimed a monopoly on the truth, and discouraged marriage between members of different sects. Members of different sects did, however, argue with one another over the correctness of their respective interpretations, although there is no significant, reliable record of such debates between sects. After the destruction of the Second Temple, these sectarian divisions ended. The Rabbis avoided the term "Pharisee," perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian.  The Rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews, and added to the [[Amidah]] the ''[[Birkat haMinim|birkat]] [[Minuth|haMinim]]'', a prayer which in part exclaims, "Praised are You O Lord, who breaks enemies and defeats the wicked," and which is understood as a rejection of sectarians and sectarianism. This shift by no means resolved conflicts over the interpretation of the Torah; rather, it relocated debates between sects to debates within Rabbinic Judaism. The Pharisaic commitment to scholarly debate as a value in and of itself, rather than merely a byproduct of sectarianism, emerged as a defining feature of Rabbinic Judaism.

Thus, as the Pharisees argued that all Israel should act as priests, the Rabbis argued that all Israel should act as rabbis: "The rabbis furthermore want to transform the entire Jewish community into an academy where the whole Torah is studied and kept .... redemption depends on the "rabbinization" of all Israel, that is, upon the attainment of all Jewry of a full and complete embodiment of revelation or Torah, thus achieving a perfect replica of heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob ''Invitation to the Talmud: a Teaching Book'' (1998): 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rabbinic era itself is divided into two periods. The first period was that of the [[Tannaim]] (from the Aramaic word for "repeat;" the Aramaic root TNY is equivalent to the Hebrew root SNY, which is the basis for "Mishnah."  Thus, Tannaim are "Mishnah teachers"), the sages who repeated and thus passed down the Oral Torah. During this period rabbis finalized the [[Biblical canon|canonization]] of the [[Tanakh]], and in 200 [[Judah haNasi]] edited together Tannaitic judgements and traditions into the [[Mishnah]], considered by the rabbis to be the definitive expression of the Oral Torah (although some of the sages mentioned in the Mishnah are Pharisees who lived prior to the destruction of the Second Temple, or prior to the Bar Kozeba Revolt, most of the sages mentioned lived after the revolt).

The second period is that of the ''Amoraim'' (from the Aramaic word for "speaker") rabbis and their students who continued to debate legal matters and discuss the meaning of the books of the [[Tanakh|Bible]]. In Palestine, these discussions occurred at important academies at Tiberias, Caesarea, and Sepphoris. In Babylonia, these discussions largely occurred at important academies that had been established at Nehardea, Pumpeditha and Sura. This tradition of study and debate reached its fullest expression in the development of the [[Talmud]]im, elaborations of the Mishnah and records of Rabbinic debates, stories, and judgements, compiled around 400 in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and around 500 in [[Babylon]].

Rabbinic Judaism eventually emerged as normative Judaism and in fact many today refer to Rabbinic Judaism simply as "Judaism." Jacob Neusner, however, states that the Amoraim had no ultimate power in their communities. They lived at a time when Jews were subjects of either the Roman or Iranian (Parthian and Persian) empires. These empires left the day-to-day governance in the hands of the Jewish authorities: in Roman Palestine, through the hereditary office of Patriarch (simultaneously the head of the Sanhedrin); in Babylonia, through the hereditary office of the ''[[Reish Galuta]]'', the "Head of the Exile" or "Exilarch" (who ratified the appointment of the heads of Rabbinical academies.) According to Professor Neusner:
:The "Judaism" of the rabbis at this time is in no degree either normal or normative, and speaking descriptively, the schools cannot be called "elite." Whatever their aspirations for the future and pretensions in the present, the rabbis, though powerful and influential, constitute a minority group seeking to exercise authority without much governmental support, to dominate without substantial means of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob ''Invitation to the Talmud: a Teaching Book'' (1998): 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In Neusner's view, the rabbinic project, as acted out in the Talmud, reflected not the world as it was but the world as rabbis dreamed it should be.

According to S. Baron however, there existed "a general willingness of the people to follow its self imposed Rabbinic rulership". Although the Rabbis lacked authority to impose capital punishment "Flagellation and heavy fines, combined with an extensive system of excommunication were more than enough to uphold the authority of the courts." In fact, the Rabbis took over more and more power from the Reish Galuta until eventually [[Rav Ashi|R' Ashi]] assumed the title Rabbana, heretofore assumed by the exilarch, and appeared together with two other Rabbis as an official delegation "at the gate of King [[Yazdegerd III|Yazdegard]]'s court." The Amorah (and Tanna) Rav was a personal friend of the last Parthian king Artabenus and Shmuel was close to [[Shapur I]], King of Persia. Thus, the Rabbis had significant means of "coercion" and the people seem to have  followed the Rabbinic rulership.

==Pharisees and Christianity==

{{See also|Early Christianity and Judaism|Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Christianity and Judaism|Law and Gospel}}

The Pharisees appear in the [[New Testament]], engaging in conflicts between themselves and [[John the Baptist]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and with [[Jesus]], and because [[Nicodemus|Nicodemus the Pharisee]] ({{bibleverse||John|3:1}}) with [[Joseph of Arimathea]] entombed Jesus' body at great personal risk. [[Gamaliel]], the highly respected rabbi and defender of the apostles, was also a Pharisee, and according to some Christian traditions [[Gamaliel#As a Christian|secretly converted to Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Acts 5 merely reads: "33 When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them. 34 Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. 35 And he said to them: “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. 36 For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. 37 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. 38 And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; 39 but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it—lest you even be found to fight against God.”" ([[New King James Version]])&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several references in the New Testament to [[Paul the Apostle]] being a Pharisee before converting to Christianity,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and other members of the Pharisee sect are known from {{bibleverse||Acts|15:5|NKJV}} to have become Christian believers. It was some members of his group who argued that [[gentile]] converts must be [[Circumcision|circumcised]] and obliged to follow the [[Mosaic law]], leading to a [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|dispute]] within the early Church addressed at the [[Council of Jerusalem|Apostolic Council in Jerusalem]],&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15&lt;/ref&gt; in 50 CE.

The New Testament, particularly the [[Synoptic Gospels]], presents especially the leadership of the Pharisees as obsessed with man-made rules (especially concerning purity) whereas Jesus is more concerned with God’s love; the Pharisees scorn [[sin]]ners whereas Jesus seeks them out. (The [[Gospel of John]], which is the only gospel where Nicodemus is mentioned, particularly portrays the sect as divided and willing to debate.) Because of the [[New Testament]]'s frequent depictions of Pharisees as self-righteous rule-followers (see also [[Woes of the Pharisees]] and [[Legalism (theology)]]), the word "pharisee" (and its derivatives: "pharisaical", etc.) has come into semi-common usage in English to describe a hypocritical and arrogant person who places the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law above its spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pharisee ''"pharisee"''] The Free Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Jews today typically find this insulting and some consider the use of the word to be [[anti-Semitic]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cook 2008 ''Modern Jews Engage the New Testament'' 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have speculated that Jesus was himself a Pharisee and that his arguments with Pharisees is a sign of inclusion rather than fundamental conflict (disputation being the dominant narrative mode employed in the Talmud as a search for truth, and not necessarily a sign of opposition).&lt;ref&gt;H. Maccoby, 1986 ''The Mythmaker. Paul and the Invention of Christianity''&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' emphasis on loving one's neighbor (see [[Great Commandment]]), for example, echoes the teaching of the [[House of Hillel|School of Hillel]]. [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce|Jesus' views of divorce]], however, are closer to those of the [[House of Shammai|School of Shammai]], another Pharisee.

Others have argued that the portrait of the Pharisees in the New Testament is an anachronistic caricature. Although a minority of scholars follow the [[Augustinian hypothesis]], most scholars [[Dating the Bible|date the composition of the Christian gospels]] to between 70 and 100&amp;nbsp;CE, a time after [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christianity had separated from Judaism]] (and after Pharisaism emerged as the dominant form of Judaism). Rather than an accurate account of Jesus' relationship to Pharisees and other Jewish leaders, this view holds that the Gospels instead reflect the competition and conflict between [[early Christians]] and Pharisees for leadership of the Jews, or reflects Christian attempts to distance themselves from Jews in order to present themselves in a more sympathetic (and benign) light to Romans and other Gentiles.

Examples of disputed passages include the [[Mark 2#Healing of a paralytic|story of Jesus declaring the sins of a paralytic man forgiven]] and the Pharisees calling the action [[blasphemy]]. In the story, Jesus counters the accusation that he does not have the power to forgive sins and forgives them, and also heals the man. Christians interpret the account of the Paralytic Man as showing that the "man-made" teachings of the Pharisees had so "blinded their eyes" and "hardened their hearts"{{Cite quote | reason = to whom are you attributing these claims, in particular that the Pharisee's teachings were "man-made"? |date=February 2014}}, that they were persisting (unlike the crowds) in [[Rejection of Jesus|refusing to credit his authority]]. Hence, the New Testament describes Jesus as tackling what he saw as the Pharisees' non-scriptural judgmentalism concerning sin, disability and sickness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some historians, however, have noted that Jesus' actions are actually similar to and consistent with Jewish beliefs and practices of the time, as recorded by the Rabbis, that commonly associate illness with sin and healing with forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;E.P. Sanders 1993 ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'' 213&lt;/ref&gt; Jews (according to E.P. Sanders) reject the New Testament suggestion that the healing would have been critical of, or criticized by, the Pharisees as no surviving Rabbinic source questions or criticizes this practice.&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt; Another argument is that according to the New Testament, Pharisees wanted to punish Jesus for [[Mark 3#Healings|healing a man's withered hand]] on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]. No Rabbinic rule has been found according to which Jesus would have violated Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Sanders 1993 ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'' 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that those passages of the New Testament that are seemingly most hostile to the Pharisees were written sometime after the destruction of [[Herod's Temple]] in 70&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Frederiksen, 1988 ''From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the New Testament Images of Jesus''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Cook, 2008 ''Modern Jews Engage the New Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;  Only Christianity and Pharisaism survived the destruction of the Temple, and the two competed for a short time until the Pharisees emerged as the dominant form of Judaism. When many Jews did not convert, Christians sought new converts from among the Gentiles.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Romans 11:25&lt;/ref&gt; Christians had to explain why converts should listen to them rather than the Non-Messianic Jews, concerning the [[Hebrew Bible]], and also had to dissociate themselves with the rebellious Jews who so often [[Render unto Caesar...|rejected Roman authority]] and authority in general. They thus were perceived to have had presented a story of Jesus that was more sympathetic to Romans than to Jews.

Some scholars have found evidence of continuous interactions between Jewish-Christian and rabbinic movements from the mid- to late second century c.e. to the fourth century c.e.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: Lily C. Vuong, ''Gender and Purity in the Protevangelium of James'', WissenschaftlicheUntersuchungen zum Neuen Testament 2.358 (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck,2013), 210-13; Jonathan Bourgel, "The Holders of the “Word of Truth”: The Pharisees in  Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions 1.27–71," ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' 25.2 (2017) 171-200. https://www.academia.edu/34049435/Bourgel_The_Holders_of_the_Word_of_Truth_The_Pharisees_in_Pseudo-Clementine_Recognitions_1.27_71_JECS_25.2_2017_.pdf?auto=bookmark&amp;campaign=weekly_digest&lt;/ref&gt;

There are related [[mythology|mythological]] figures named '''Porus''' or '''Poros''' ({{lang-grc|Πόρος}} "resource" or "plenty") in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[classical literature]]. 

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', Porus was the personification of resourcefulness or expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Robert|last=Flacelière|date=2008|title=A Literary History of Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTiaFeEaCgEC&amp;dq|pages=275-276|isbn=0202362957}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seduced by [[Penia]] (poverty) while drunk on more than his fill of nectar at [[Aphrodite]]'s birthday.  Penia gave birth to [[Eros (god)|Eros]] (love) from their union. Porus was the son of [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]. According to the character Diotima, Eros is forever in need because of his mother, but forever pursuing because of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julius|last=Evola|date=1991|title=Eros and the Mysteries of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlAX8pSUHSkC&amp;pg|pages=57-59|isbn=0892813156}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Morford||date=1999|title=Classical Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecGXcMRAPXcC&amp;dq|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=133-134|isbn=0195143388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This figure exists in [[Roman mythology]] as well and is known as [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]],{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} in which Porus is the [[personification]] of [[:wikt:abundance|abundance]]. He is the brother of Athena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">'''Scientology and marriage''', within the [[Church of Scientology]], are discussed in the book ''The Background, Ministry, Ceremonies &amp; Sermons of the Scientology Religion''.

Scientology weddings do not require that both parties of the wedding be adherents of Scientology. Nor does the Church necessarily exclude material from weddings of other faiths in its own ceremonies. One source, [[J. Gordon Melton]], has ascribed this to Scientology trying to mollify members of the wedding partners' families.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news

==Wedding ceremony==

Scientology wedding ceremonies are similar to wedding ceremonies used by many other religions. They typically include a bridal procession, best man, maid of honor, and the traditional seating of friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scientologynews.org/faq/what-is-scientology-wedding-ceremony.html |title=What is the Scientology wedding ceremony? |website=scientologynews.org |access-date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony may include wedding customs used by other faiths.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; There are five versions of the ceremony: traditional, informal, single ring, double ring, and concise double ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=L. Ron |date=1999 |title=The Background, Ministry, Ceremonies &amp; Sermons of the Scientology Religion |url= |publisher=Bridge Publications |isbn=1573181749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Traditional ceremony includes:
::''Now, ''(groom's name)'', girls need clothes and food and tender happiness and frills, a pan, a comb, perhaps a cat. All caprice if you will, but still they need them. Hear well, sweet ''(bride's name)'', for promise binds. Young men are free and may forget. Remind him then that you may have necessities and follies, too.''&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Same-sex marriage==
{{Main|Homosexuality and Scientology}}
The Church of Scientology has had a  controversial history regarding [[LGBT]] issues and [[same-sex marriage]]. In recent years, the Church has publicly embraced the subject more so than in the past.&lt;ref name=fab&gt;"Church of Scientology wants Gays", ''Fab!'' magazine, February 14, 2003. [http://www.liveandgrow.org/images/fab_feb142003.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, a spokesperson for the Church told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' that the Church had "not taken an official position on gay marriage, and that members prefer not to talk about it." In 2008 the Church supported Prop 8 in California which banned same-sex marriages, even in counties where they had been performed before. In 2009, award-winning writer Paul Haggis quit the church due to its apparent stance on homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/26/paul-haggis-scientology-prop-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes==
Probably the most famous Scientology wedding was the one between [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Katie Holmes]] on Saturday, November 18, 2006. Cruise and Holmes announced their engagement in June 2005. Scientologist spokesperson Karen Pouw stated that as part of their nuptial vows, "they won't go to sleep at night without having repaired any upset they may have had during the day,".&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;''Washington Post'', "Scientologist Cruise to pledge loyalty, maybe a Cat", by Jill Serjeant, Wednesday, November 15, 2006. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111500257.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom decision==
In 2008, Louisa Hodkin and then fiancé Alessandro Calcioli were denied the right to marry in a Church of Scientology chapel in London due to a 1970 High Court ruling that said that “Scientology services were not ‘acts of worship.’" Hodkin initiated legal action, and after a five-year battle, in December 2013, five Supreme Court judges ruled that the church was “a place of meeting for religious worship.” In early 2014, Hodkin and Calcioli wed in the Scientology chapel in Blackfriars, London, and Hodkin expressed pride in the victory, which she felt put an end to inequality for people of all faiths.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26311316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/couple-get-married-in-britains-first-scientology-wedding-9147501.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/judges-stumped-over-couple-s-bid-to-marry-in-church-of-scientology-8718060.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and Biography==
''Shenlha Ökar'' means "wisdom ''gshen'' of white light;" the variant ''Shiwa Okar'' means "peaceful white light." The Bon term ''gShen'' can mean "priest or shaman" or possibly in this case "deity who is a priest."&lt;ref&gt;The Bon Religion of Tibet: The Iconography of a Living Tradition by Per Kvaerne. Shambhala Publications, 2001. {{ISBN|1-57062-186-1}} pg. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts he is considered the [[sambhogakāya]] form of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche, the founder of Bon (the nirmāṇakāya aspect).&lt;ref&gt;''The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep'' by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. Snow Lion Publications, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55939-101-4}} pg. 216&lt;/ref&gt; In other accounts, he is visited by Shenrab Miwoche when Miwoche is in a prior incarnation known as ''Salwa''.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonders of the Natural Mind'' by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. Snow Lion Publications&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N50_11.php]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some categorize him as "corresponding exactly to the Buddhist category of [[dharmakāya]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Bon Religion of Tibet: The Iconography of a Living Tradition by Per Kvaerne. Shambhala Publications, 2001. {{ISBN|1-57062-186-1}} pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shenlha Okar is said to have created the world with the help of nine brother gods or nine cosmic gods ({{bo|w=srid pa'i lha}}) who appear as war gods or ''drala'' ({{bo|w=dgra bla}}).&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar of Ling on Chogyam Trungpa" by Robin Kornman. in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', ed. Midal. Shambhala Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|1-59030-207-9}} pg. 363&lt;/ref&gt; He is also considered a god of compassion with many parallels to [[Avalokiteśvara]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bon in the Himalaya'' by B. C. Gurung. Uma Gurung Publications, India: 2003. {{ISBN|99933-59-70-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also with [[Amitābha]].&lt;ref&gt;The Bon Religion of Tibet: The Iconography of a Living Tradition by Per Kvaerne.

==Depiction==
Shenlha Okar is depicted with a white body "like the essence of crystal," holding a hook in his right hand (and sometimes a lasso in his left), and seated in a throne supported by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;The Bon Religion of Tibet: The Iconography of a Living Tradition by Per Kvaerne. Shambhala Publications, 2001. {{ISBN|1-57062-186-1}} pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shiwa Okar in the terma of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche==
[[File:Shiwa Okar.jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|Shiwa Okar on white horse, holding mirror &amp; spear with a white flag; painting by [[thangka]] painter Greg Smith]]
Shiwa Okar featured in a work composed by the influential [[Tibetan Buddhist]] lama [[Chögyam Trungpa]], particularly a long verse epic composed in Tibet called ''The Golden Dot: The Epic of the Lha, the Annals of the Kingdom of Shambhala,'' and in [[Terma (religion)|terma]] he revealed beginning in 1976. The Golden Dot was lost in Trungpa Rinpoche's flight from Tibet in 1959.{{cquote|Trungpa Rinpoche began to reconstruct the original text after escaping Tibet, and it is this later work to which we refer. The first chapter describes the creation of the world by nine cosmic gods (''shrid[sic] pa 'i lha'') who appear in the form of native Tibetan deities known as ''drala'' (''dgra bla''), or war gods. These gods represent primal or originary aspects of the phenomenal world. For example, one of these lha stood for all kinds of light. Glancing in many directions, this deity created all of the lights existing in the world, including the sun, the moon, the light of the planets and stars, and the inward luminosity of consciousness itself. Another represented space and the sense of direction ... In Trungpa Rinpoche's epic these were directed by a ninth lha called Shiwa Okar ... a sort of absolute principle behind creation and the nature of reality. After these nine cosmic deities have created the world, [Shiwa Okar] goes to the things they have created and invests each one with an animistic spirit, a ''drala.''&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar of Ling on Chogyam Trungpa" by Robin Kornman. in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', ed. Midal. Shambhala Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|1-59030-207-9}} pg. 363-364&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kornman notes that one of the "striking things" about the text is that it refers not to Indic sources but to the "creation myths found in the royal chronicles and in the ''[[Epic of King Gesar|Epic of Gesar of Ling]]''" and "evoke the cosmology of native Tibetan religion, not Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar of Ling on Chogyam Trungpa" by Robin Kornman. in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', ed. Midal. Shambhala Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|1-59030-207-9}} pg. 364&lt;/ref&gt; His Shambhala terma feature Shiwa Okar as an [[Iṣṭha-devatā (Buddhism)|iṣṭhadevatā]] ({{bo|w=yi dam}}) "meditational deity", with a tantric retinue of drala and ''werma'' ({{bo|w=wer ma}})&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar of Ling on Chogyam Trungpa" by Robin Kornman. in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', ed. Midal. Shambhala Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|1-59030-207-9}} pg. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa Rinpoche's work has antecedents in the edition of the Gesar epic prepared by  [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] and ritual practices he composed in conjunction with that work. Kornman notes "Mipham made his edition of the Gesar Epic a hybrid of Buddhist and local ideas. He made sure it would be read in this manner by writing a parallel set of Gesar chants that mix religions in the same way. These ritual practices may be found in the Na chapter of his collected works.&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar of Ling on Chogyam Trungpa" by Robin Kornman. in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', ed. Midal. Shambhala Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|1-59030-207-9}} pg. 365&lt;/ref&gt; In Bon tradition, King Gesar of Ling is sent to Tibet by Shenlha Okar, and Trungpa Rinpoche's blending of native traditions and Indian Buddhism appears to echo Mipham's.

In a "History of Shambhala" composed by Chogyam Trungpa, Shiwa Okar is described as follows:

{{cquote|[T]he very best lha of warriors, Peaceful White Light. ... He wore great silver armor, Shielding from a Thousand Thunderbolts, fastened together with lacing of divine white silk.   On his head he wore a white helmet, Divine Fierce White Forehead, adorned with many inlaid jewels and with flourishes. On the top of that was an inconceivable white pennant with gold designs. It fluttered showing the radiance of the warrior drala and the shining light dots of the werma. It moved with the wind in the space of the sky. On his feet he wore Shangshug boots, Array of Nine Braveries, embroidered with beautiful rainbow designs, drawn designs of impressive armor, and bound by hard, solid meteoric iron nails. His face was like a full moon and his two eyes twinkled like inlaid great stars. His eyebrows were beautiful like the outstretched wings of a grey vulture. The shape of his nose was beautiful and well-defined, expressing the white lineage of the father lha. His lips were in the style of a lotus and, like the outstretched wings of a wild raven, he had a beautiful black moustache. His glorious warrior-sote was impressive like the quality of phapong longbu. His smiling face was enjoyable to see; his bright radiant face transformed one's perception. His torso had a great pose, projecting masculinity. His shoulders were great and broad. The lower part of his body was steady and agile.}}

'''Siraj-ji-Takri''' or '''Seeraj-ji-Takri''' is a [[Buddhist]] archaeological site located in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. The Buddhist city of Siraj-ji-Takri is located along the western limestone terraces of the [[Rohri Hills]] in the [[Khairpur District]] of Upper Sindh, along the road that leads to [[Sorah]]. Its ruins are still visible on the top of three different mesas, in the form of stone and mud-brick walls and small mounds, whilst other architectural remains were observed along the slopes of the hills in the 1980s. This city is not mentioned from any text dealing with the history of the Buddhist period of Sindh.

The '''Sufi Ruhaniat International''' (SRI) is a stream of [[Universal Sufism]] and draws inspiration from traditions of Sufism within and beyond historic Islam. SRI is an initiatic order within the lineage of [[Inayat Khan]] (''Inayati-Chishtiyya''). Murshid Sufi Ahmed Murad Chishti ([[Samuel L. Lewis]]), a disciple of [[Inayat Khan]], formally founded the order in 1970. There are centers throughout the United States, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Sufi Ruhaniat International has five primary activities.&lt;ref&gt;Sufi Ruhaniat International – http://www.ruhaniat.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
=== Esoteric School ===

Initiation and progress on the path of discipleship is the central theme of the Sufi Ruhaniat International. The relationship between teacher and student exists for the purpose of providing training that leads to realization of the Divine essence in each human being, and to leading a life of service to God and humanity. Through various centers, classes are offered both to the general public (in accordance with the brother/sisterhood work) and to those interested in the path of initiation. Initiates are expected to maintain a relationship with a spiritual guide. Students are referred to as ''mureeds''.

=== Dervish Healing Order ===

The Dervish Healing Order serves as that aspect of the Sufi Ruhaniat International which maintains and promotes the vision of health and Divine Healing as presented by [[Inayat Khan]]. The Dervish Healing Order is an initiatory order. All members have demonstrated their deep involvement in some aspect of healing, either toward self or others. A primary activity is the conduction of the Healing Service of [[Inayat Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Dervish Healing Order – http://www.dervish-healing-order.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ziraat ===

[[Ziraat]] is a heart-based approach to gardening and food production outwardly, and to spiritual growth inwardly. The heart, like the earth, is regarded as sacred soil to be prepared for planting. Rocks and roots are removed; last year's stubble is plowed under. New seed is placed in the furrow. Sunshine and rain attend the turning of the seasons, and the ancient cycles of sowing, growth, fruition and harvest are realized in ourselves and in our gardens and farms.&lt;ref&gt;Ziraat – {{cite web |url=http://www.olympus.net/personal/ziraat/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615083219/http://www.olympus.net/personal/ziraat/ |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal Worship Service ===

The [[Universal Worship Service]] was created by [[Inayat Khan]] to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the diverse religious traditions of the world: both in the beauty of their distinctions and differences, externally, and in the transformative and healing power of their inner Unity...all coming from the same Source. Conducted by ministers called Cherags (Lamps of the Message), the Service honors nine of world's major religious traditions – the Goddess Tradition, Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, the Native Traditions of the world, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. For each tradition, a candle is lit, a selection from the sacred scriptures is read, and a spiritual practice or Dance of Universal Peace is led. Leaders of the Universal Worship Service are referred to as ''cherags'' and ''cheragas''.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Worship Service – http://cheraglibrary.org/archive/cyt-001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dances of Universal Peace ===

The [[Dances of Universal Peace]] are simple, meditative, joyous, multi-cultural, circle dances that use sacred phrases, chants, music, and movements from the many traditions of the earth to touch the spiritual essence within ourselves and others. Based on the work begun in the late 1960s by Murshid [[Samuel L. Lewis]], they promote peace and integration within individuals and groups worldwide. There are no performers nor audience – new arrivals and old hands form the circle together. The International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace &lt;ref&gt;Dances of Universal Peace – http://www.dancesofuniversalpeace.org&lt;/ref&gt; was formed under the auspices of SRI to serve as a network for the many Dance meetings and leaders throughout the world, to publish recordings and instructions for the Dances, and as a resource for the ongoing development of new Dances and for the training of dance leaders. Dance leader certification is available through the affiliated Mentor Teachers Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Mentor Teachers Guild – {{cite web |url=http://www.dancesofuniversalpeace.org/mtg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415200644/http://www.dancesofuniversalpeace.org/mtg.htm |archivedate=2009-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Sufi Ruhaniat International was incorporated as the Sufi Islamia Ruhaniat Society by Murshid [[Samuel L. Lewis]] in November 1970, shortly before his death in 1971. In 2002 the name was changed to Sufi Ruhaniat International.&lt;ref&gt;Murshid SAM Biography – {{cite web |url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage/SAMBio.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031001224700/http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage/SAMBio.php |archivedate=2003-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Shabda khan.jpg|thumb|Pir Shabda Khan]] --&gt;

== Leadership ==

Leadership of SRI is provided by a ''pir'' (spiritual leader) and a council of ''murshids'' and ''murshidas'' (senior teachers). Teachers are referred to as ''sheiks'' and ''sheikhas''. SRI is not "guru-centered" and maintains a minimal hierarchy required for any effective organization to function. All members are respected for the unique perspectives and abilities they offer.&lt;ref&gt;Lineage – http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Influences ==

Other teachers have informed the Sufi Ruhaniat International's spiritual tradition. Among these are:

Sensei [[Nyogen Senzaki]] (1876–1958) was a Rinzai Zen monk and student of [[Soyen Shaku]]. He was the Zen teacher of [[Samuel L. Lewis]]. His last words were said to be "Remember the Dharma! Remember the Dharma! Remember the Dharma!" &lt;ref&gt;Nyogen Senzaki – {{cite web |url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage/SenzakiBio.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811013019/http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage/SenzakiBio.php |archivedate=2003-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth St. Denis]] (1879–1968) was a modern dance pioneer and a major influence on [[Samuel L. Lewis]], who called her "Mata-Ji" (Honored Mother) and referred to her as "my fairy godmother". She was a source of inspiration in Samuel L. Lewis' creation of the Dances of Universal Peace and of the Spiritual Walks.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth St Denis – {{cite web |url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage/RSDBio.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123225300/http://ruhaniat.org/lineage/RSDBio.php |archivedate=2009-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Miller (1904–1992) was an American mystic best known for his Thursday Morning Walks in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park with his wife Guin during the 1970s and 1980s. Joe was widely respected for his spiritual clarity and Dr. Evans-Wentz, the original translator of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and other sacred Mahayana texts, considered Joe Miller "the only man he had met in the West who understood the Doctrine of the Clear Light." Joe was a close friend of [[Samuel L. Lewis]] who upon his deathbed asked Joe to "Take care of my disciples." Joe provided spiritual guidance to Sam's disciples, and many others, until his death in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Miller – {{cite web |url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage/JoeBio.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908092342/http://www.ruhaniat.org/lineage/JoeBio.php |archivedate=2006-09-08 |df= }}, ''Great Song: the Life and Teaching of Joe Miller'', Richard Power, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Talom Rukbo'''  was the father of [[Donyi-Polo]], a revivalist religious movement based in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] which attempts to reconstruct [[Tani languages|Tani]] ([[Adi people|Adi]]) animist spirituality.

He has criticized Christian missionaries for [[fraudulent]] [[Religious conversion|conversion]] practices in the Northeast of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-knapp.com/preaching_in_indias_northeast_for_cultural_preservation.htm Preaching in India's Northeast for Cultural Preservation] - Stephen Knapp. 
{{cquote|The church?Christian missionaries ? quickly capitalized on the innocence of our forefathers. They fraudulently convinced our people that we were barbarians and converted some into Christianity. ? They declared that the converted persons must discard (1) the `animist` practices, (2) our festivals and that our Gods and Goddesses were Saitan (evil spirits? Satan).}} [http://www.indicstudies.org/comments_reply.php?discussion_id=1&amp;topic_id=12 Subject: Re-imagining Religious Freedom] Indic Studies Project&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because of his contribution to the [[Adivasi]] way of life, Rukbo has been named one of the inspirations for the [[Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram]] project run by the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/872507.cms RSS-backed Vanvasi NGO comes out of woods] The Economic Times - September 04, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Tell Me Why'''" is a rock song by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. It first appeared as the seventh track on their 1991 album ''[[We Can't Dance]]'', and was later issued as a single in Europe (in November 1992) and Britain (in February 1993). It was the last Genesis single featuring [[Phil Collins]] on vocals.

==Background==
A royalty from the single was donated to the Bosnian [[Save the Children]] and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] charities. This was in keeping with the lyric of the song, which expressed disdain for hypocrisy about food and shelter (''"You say there's nothing you can do / Is there one rule for them and one for you?"'').

Reflecting the emerging trend for CD singles, "Tell Me Why" was issued as two separate discs in the UK. Both editions came in [[digipak]]s with identical artwork, and were backed by a live version of "Dreaming While You Sleep." The first CD featured a 1992 version of "[[Turn It On Again]]" as an exclusive track, while the second included a full performance of "[[Tonight, Tonight, Tonight]]" from the video, ''[[Genesis Live at Wembley Stadium|Live at Wembley Stadium]]'' (this song segued into "[[Invisible Touch (song)|Invisible Touch]]" on the ''We Can't Dance'' tour).

In Europe the live [[B-side]]s were "[[Mama (Genesis song)|Mama]]", "[[The Brazilian]]" (both from the [[Invisible Touch]] tour) and the single version of "Invisible Touch."

Unlike its four predecessors, the single was not a commercial success, barely breaching the UK Top 40.

The working title of "Tell Me Why" was originally "Rickenbacker" after the 12-string [[Rickenbacker]] guitar used by Mike Rutherford on the song. Rickenbackers are known for their distinct "ringing" sound.

The '''Temple of Montu''' (also Temple of Monthu, Montju, or Menthu) is an [[Egyptian temple]] dedicated to the worship of [[Monthu]]. The site is located {{convert|5|km}} northeast of [[Karnak]], which is located within [[Luxor]]. Medamud was excavated by French archaeologist [[Fernand Bisson de la Roque]] from 1925 to the post-war, and revealed many buildings including a temple dedicated to Montu. This temple replaced an ancient sanctuary and consists of an open forum with a tower and enclosing two mounds that housed the chapels of worship. It is thought that original sanctuary dates to the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. The ruins of the last structure date to the [[Ptolemy VIII]] period of the 2nd century BC, although decorations and additions continued to be added centuries later by the Romans. Because of Montu's strong association with raging bulls, the temple was a major centre of worship for bulls, containing many statues of bulls for worship and reliefs. Most of these statues are now located in various museums around the world.

[[File:Fernandbissondelaroque.jpg|thumb|left|The temple's excavator, [[Fernand Bisson de la Roque]].]]
In addition to the temple at Medamud, temples dedicated to Montu were built in Karnak, Armant, and Tod.&lt;ref name="Remler2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Remler|first=Pat|title=Egyptian Mythology A to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLUjtPDyu-IC&amp;pg=PT140|accessdate=25 November 2011|date=1 April 2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-60413-926-6|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1925-1932, the Medamud Temple of Montu was excavated by French archaeologist, Fernand Bisson de la Roque, of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale]],&lt;ref name="Redford2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Redford|first=Donald B.|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7VGAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 November 2011|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510234-5|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref name="Bard1999" /&gt;

==Geography==
Medamud (or Madu) was an outpost of Thebes, located {{convert|3|mi}} away.&lt;ref name="Fletcher2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Joann|title=Cleopatra the Great: The Woman Behind the Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2QrGr6OJa8C&amp;pg=PT114|accessdate=25 November 2011|date=17 May 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-210605-6|pages=114–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the town of Medamud or its other structures. Prior to construction of the Middle Kingdom temple, the site had been burned and earlier mounds were razed. The [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] temple is situated on a circular mound.  Its orientation bears east-west.&lt;ref name="Bard1999" /&gt;

Nearby are the [[Egyptian temple]] complexes at [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] and Karnak.  The Karnak Temple Complex contains three precincts, including the [[Precinct of Montu]], which contains another Temple of Montu.&lt;ref name="Gray2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Leon|title=The New Cultural Atlas of Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqYSQYXkai0C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=25 November 2011|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7877-5|pages=82, 83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanjan2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thanjan|first=Davis K.|title=Pebbles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9BLBh7XqnkC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=25 November 2011|date=12 January 2011|publisher=Bookstand Publishing|isbn=978-1-58909-817-6|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Kingdom site==
The Old Kingdom temple site, dedicated to Montu, was walled and had a sacred grove. It had a tunnel system, mounds and chambers.&lt;ref name="Bunson2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunson|first=Margaret|title=Encyclopedia of ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6EJ0G-4jyoC&amp;pg=PA229|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4563-1|pages=229–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Kingdom temple==
The Middle Kingdom [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]] building is a rare example of the foundation of religion in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] era.  Others of this period are the temple of [[Sesostris III]] in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], the Temple of [[Medinet Madi]] and [[Qasr el-Sagha]] in [[Fayoum]] dating from approximately the same time, and the [[Mortuary temple|funerary temple]] of [[Mentuhotep II]] of the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|11th dynasty]] in [[Deir el-Bahari]]. The sanctuary was remodeled in later periods..

The temple's features included a tribune platform, a canal, a [[Glossary of architecture#D|d]]romos, main gate, portico, hall, and sanctuary.  There was also a courtyard for the living sacred bull.&lt;ref name="Bard1999" /&gt; It consisted of a first chamber, 200 by 180 meters. The main access was by the east and north. A sacred lake was probably on the west side of the temple. The temple consisted of two distinct, contiguous sections that have been interpreted as a temple to the north and one to the south where the priests would have had their quarters. Typical of the period, the temple was built of brick; it included raw elements for the doors and frames, and column or carved stone, the bases of which were decorated. Carved stone would have been present in the most intimate parts of the sanctuary, but no trace of it has been discovered. No doubt these parts were considered sacred and reused in later buildings. The plan of the sanctuary of the Middle Kingdom is still subject to discussion. But it was to have at least one [[hypostyle]] antechamber, giving access to chapels of worship or shrine. A large courtyard surrounded by portico columns where a sacred bull would have lived would have been revered as the [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the living Montu.

This temple has provided many examples of royal statuary and [[Lithic technology|lithic]] elements of [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]].

== Graeco-Roman temple ==
[[File:Montu-medamud.png|250px|thumb|Plan of the Temple of Montu at Medamud]]
The site is currently closed to the public as a team of archaeologists and restorers work to protect against the modern city encroachment on the ancient remains of the former city.
[[File:Montu Ptolemaic Period Louvre.JPG|thumb|left|Montu depicted with a bull's head, from the Ptolemaic period (332 — 30 BC). On display in the Louvre, the statue was found in Medamud in the cell of the goddess Rattaui.]]
Composed of twelve columns, the structure was built under [[Ptolemy VIII]], who was then one of the great rebuilders of Medamud. Four of the six columns of the facade are still connected by walls. The elements of the inner temple are dated them from the beginning of the Ptolemaic period. The enclosure of the temple included a sacred lake and a deep well but was blocked off because it represented a danger to children playing in the area. The temple continued to be enlarged and decorated for centuries under the Roman emperors, including [[Tiberius]] (14-37),&lt;ref name="SEG"&gt;{{cite book|title=SEG|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI4aAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff.|isbn=978-90-5063-237-9|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; up until the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref name="(France)1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Centre national de la recherche scientifique (France)|title=Revue historique de droit français et étranger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCY4AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1984|publisher=Librarie de la Société du Recueil Sirey|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wharf, which was reached by a canal, connected the temple with a line of sphinxes; it is in a state of ruin. Although grass grows throughout the site, there is still find evidence of ancient pilgrims in the form of graffiti or engraved footprints. Following the processional aisle, it was possible to access a large door whose decoration dates from the reign of Tiberius. This monumental gateway was a large opening within the walls of the temple axis. It was [[Ptolemy VIII]], however who built the towered portico around the door, its decoration not completed until the reign of [[Ptolemy XII]]. Another door dates to [[Ptolemy II]].

Some of the artifacts found in the temple date to [[Ptolemy III]] and [[Ptolemy IV]]. Many of these artifacts are  statues of bulls which were used for worship and reliefs.  The interior of this monument is interesting because it and its doors describes the traditional scenes of the [[Sed festival]] when the king in traditional costume receives offerings or during an important step in the inauguration ceremony of royal power.&lt;ref name="SchoorsWillems1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoors|first1=Antoon|last2=Willems|first2=Harco|title=Egyptian religion: the last thousand years : studies dedicated to the memory of Jan Quaegebeur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMsr_-6RslwC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1998|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0669-3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d'Égyptologie1946"&gt;{{cite book|author=Société française d'Égyptologie|title=Revue d'égyptologie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUgHAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1946|publisher=Ernest Leroux|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Montu is also an important insight into how very popular bull cults were  in ancient Egypt, Montu being strongly associated with raging bulls. A long corridor retained the scenes of the cult of the bull [[Bukhis]] which date mostly from the emperor [[Domitian]] (81-96). There is also a wall relief of a procession of musicians who came to visit [[Trajan]].

Nothing remains of the earlier or later temples, and the remains are dated mainly from the Greco-Roman period. The temple at Medamud was probably founded as the place of worship for the living god Montu while the temple Bouchéum (or Bucheum) at [[Hermonthis|Ermant]] included a necropolis of sacred bulls, and was probably dedicated to his death.&lt;ref name="Hari1964"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hari|first=Robert|title=Horemheb et la reine Moutnedjemet: ou, La fin d'une dynastie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDETAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1964|publisher=Impr.

==Museum exhibits==
What could be removed from the original structure, parts of the building and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], were taken to museums including the [[Karnak Open Air Museum]]. Most of the temples statues are now located in various museums, such as the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] and the Louvre.

'''''Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith''''' is a [[nonfiction]] book by best-selling author [[Jon Krakauer]], first published in July 2003. He investigated and juxtaposed two histories: the origin and evolution of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), and a modern [[double murder]] committed in the name of God by brothers Ron &lt;!-- redirected to this title --&gt;and Dan Lafferty&lt;!-- redirect to this article --&gt;, who subscribed to a fundamentalist version of [[Mormonism]].

The Laffertys were formerly members of a very small splinter group called the School of Prophets, led by [[Robert C. Crossfield]] (also known by his prophet name Onias). The group accepts many beliefs of the original LDS church at the time when it ceased the practice of [[plural marriage|polygamy]] in the 1890s, but it does not identify with those who call themselves [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]]. The book examines the ideologies of both the LDS Church and the [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]] polygamous groups, such as the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS Church).

In 2011 [[Warner Brothers]] purchased the film rights for an adaptation. As of 2016, it was still in development.

== Synopsis ==

===Murders===

The book opens with news accounts of the 1984 murder of Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter Erica. Brenda was married to Allen Lafferty, the youngest of the Lafferty brothers. His older brothers Dan and Ron disapproved of their sister-in-law Brenda because they believed she was the reason Ron's wife left him (after refusing to allow him to marry a plural/second wife). Both men's extremism reached new heights when they became members of the School of the Prophets, founded and led by [[Robert Crossfield]]. After joining this group, Ron claimed that God had sent him revelations about Brenda. [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|Communication with God]] is a core belief of fundamentalist Mormonism, as well as the mainstream LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Revelation "Revelation"], Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt; Ron showed the members of the School of Prophets a written "removal revelation" that allegedly called for the killing of Brenda and her baby. After other members of the School failed to honor Ron's removal revelation, the brothers quit the School.

Dan claimed that he slit both of the victims' throats. But, at the 2001 trial, Chip Carnes, who was riding in the getaway car, testified that Ron said that he had killed Brenda,&lt;ref&gt;''Utah v. Lafferty,'' 20 P.3d 342 (2001) UT 19, para. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Ron had thanked his brother for "doing the baby."

After the murders, the police found the written "revelation" concerning Brenda and Erica. The press widely reported that Ron had received a revelation to kill the mother and child. Afterward, the Lafferty brothers conducted a recorded press conference at which Ron said that the "revelation" was not addressed to him, but to "Todd" [a drifter whom Ron had befriended while working in Wichita, Kansas] and that the revelation called only for "removal" of Brenda and her baby, and did not use the word "kill." The jury at Ron's trial was shown these remarks of Ron denying he had received a revelation to kill Brenda and Erica.&lt;ref&gt;''Utah v. Lafferty,'' 20 P.3d 342 (2001) UT 19, para. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mormon history===

After opening with the Lafferty case, Krakauer explores the history of Mormonism, starting with the early life of [[Joseph Smith]], founder and first prophet of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. He follows his life from a criminal fraud trial to leading the first followers to [[Jackson County, Missouri]], and [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]. While violence seemed to accompany the Mormons, Krakauer notes that they did not necessarily initiate it. Early Mormons faced severe religious persecution from mainstream Protestant Christians, due to their unorthodox beliefs, including [[polygamy]]. In addition they tended to conduct business and personal relations only with  other Mormons. There were violent clashes between Mormons and non-Mormons, culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] on June 27, 1844. A mob shot him, pulling him from jail in [[Carthage, Illinois]], where he was awaiting trial for destroying the printing press of a [[Nauvoo Expositor|local publication]] that had portrayed him negatively.

From Nauvoo, the Mormons trekked westward to modern-day [[Utah]], led by Smith's successor [[Brigham Young]] (after some [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|controversy]]). Arriving in what they called [[State of Deseret|Deseret]], many Mormons believed they would be left alone by the United States government, as the territory was then part of Mexico. Soon after their arrival, the [[Mexican–American War]] occurred, with Mexico's eventual defeat. Under the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] signed on February 2, 1848, this land, California and the Southwest were ceded to the United States.

Smith's highly controversial revelation of plural marriage threatened to split apart followers of the faith.  The [[Utah Territory]] was a [[theocracy]] ruled by Brigham Young, and Utah was denied statehood for 50 years due to the Mormons' practice of polygamy. Finally, on September 23, 1890, [[Wilford Woodruff]], the fourth [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of LDS Church, [[1890 Manifesto|officially banned]] the practice of polygamy after having received a revelation from God. Six years later, Utah was granted statehood.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Bradford and Williams Kenneth ed. "Utah's Road to Statehood." Salt Lake City: Utah State Division of Archives and Record Service, 1995. http://archives.utah.gov/research/exhibits/Statehood/setroad.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Woodruff Manifesto, some members broke away from the mainstream church to form what eventually became the FLDS Church, the most popular group of fundamentalist Mormonism. The FLDS Church encourages polygamy, as do some other breakaway groups.

===Comparisons===
Krakauer examines events in Latter Day Saint history and compares them to modern-day FLDS doctrine (and other minority versions of Mormonism, such as the Crossfield School of the Prophets). He examines the 1857 [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] during the Utah War, in which Mormons and some local [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] Indians rounded up and murdered approximately 120 members of the [[Baker–Fancher party]] of emigrants passing through their territory. The Mormons went to great lengths to conceal their part in the massacre (including dressing as the Paiute and painting their faces in similar fashion). The Civil War interrupted investigations of the events, and no one was indicted until 1874, when nine men were charged. For nearly two decades the falsehood held that the massacre was due solely to the Paiute. The only person ever convicted in the affair was [[John D. Lee]], a member of the LDS Church. He was convicted and executed by the state in 1877 for his role in the crime.

Krakauer cites information gleaned from several interviews with Dan Lafferty and former and current members of the Crossfield School of the Prophets, as well as other fundamentalist Mormons. He refers to several histories about the formation of Mormonism to tie the origins of the religion to the modern iterations of both the church and the fundamentalists.&lt;ref name= ubh&gt;{{cite book |last= Krakauer |first= Jon |title= Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith |year= 2004 |publisher= Anchor Books |isbn= 1-4000-3280-6 |chapter= Author's Remarks |quote= I availed myself of this rich history by draining my bank account in bookstores near and far. |page= 337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation of the title==

The title of the book is drawn from an 1880 address by [[John Taylor (Latter Day Saints)|John Taylor]], the third president of the LDS Church, defending the practice of plural marriage: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;God is greater than the United States, and when the Government conflicts with heaven, we will be ranged under the banner of heaven against the Government. The United States says we cannot marry more than one wife. God says different.&lt;ref&gt;Krakauer, Chapter 20, p. 250 (quoting John Taylor, address, Jan. 4, 1880, Great Salt Lake City).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==

Charles Graeber of ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed the book in his top 10 true crime books, and described Krakauer as 'a master journalist and storyteller who is unfettered and unafraid of the true crime mantle. (He) pries open the golden doors to one of the newest and fastest-growing religions in America to set the stage for the non-fiction drama.'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/charles-graeber-top-10-true-crime-books&lt;/ref&gt;

In advance of the book's release in 2003, [[Richard E. Turley]], managing director of the [[Church History Department]] of the LDS Church, argued that the book contained mistakes and incorrect assertions. He accused Krakauer of "condemn[ing] religion generally."&lt;ref name=MormonNewsroom_2003-06-27&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-response-to-jon-krakauers-under-the-banner-of-heaven |contribution= Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven |date= 27 June 2003 |title= Commentary |work= Newsroom [MormonNewsroom.org] |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2004 paperback edition of the book, Krakauer responded to these allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/features/krakauer/response.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Otterson]], managing director of public affairs for the LDS Church, condemned Krakauer's example of religious "zealots" to draw conclusions about all Mormons and any propensity for violence. Otterson said that, after reading the book, "One could be forgiven for concluding that every Latter-day Saint, including your friendly Mormon neighbor, has a tendency to violence. And so Krakauer unwittingly puts himself in the same camp as those who believe every German is a Nazi, every Japanese a fanatic, and every Arab a terrorist."&lt;ref name=MormonNewsroom_2003-06-27/&gt;

==Film adaptation in development==

In July 2011, [[Warner Bros.]] purchased the film rights to the book, with [[Ron Howard]] directing and [[Dustin Lance Black]] writing the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Fleming, Mike | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/07/warner-bros-acquiring-jon-krakauers-under-the-banner-of-heaven-for-ron-howard-and-dustin-lance-black/ | title = Warner Bros Acquiring Jon Krakauer's 'Under The Banner Of Heaven' For Ron Howard And Dustin Lance Black | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | date = 2011-07-19 | accessdate = 2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in development. Black had written for the HBO series, ''[[Big Love]]'' (2006 to 2011), about a polygamous family in the modern world.&lt;ref name="doc"/&gt;

==Related documentary==

In 2015, Amy Berg released her independent documentary, ''Prophet's Prey,'' about fundamentalist Mormons practicing polygamy, based on the case of [[Warren Jeffs]], sentenced to life for polygamy and abuse of minors. Krakauer participated in this film and appears on camera, as he continued his own investigation of sects that practiced polygamy. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, both working on the above project as producers, were executive producers of this documentary.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/movies/review-prophets-prey-a-documentary-about-mormon-fundamentalists.html?_r=0 Manohal Dargis, "Review: ‘Prophet’s Prey,’ a Documentary About Mormon Fundamentalists"], ''New York Times,'' 17 September 2015; accessed 7 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yedioth Ahronoth''''' ({{lang-he-n|ידיעות אחרונות}}, {{IPA-he|jedi'ot aχaˈronot|pron|Yediot aharonot.ogg}}; lit. ''Latest News'') is a national daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. Founded in 1939 in [[Mandatory Palestine]],  ''Yedioth Ahronoth'' has been the largest newspaper in Israel by sales and circulation.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4969714.stm|title=The press in Israel|date=8 May 2006 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/press.html The Israeli Press] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=8032790|title=Yedioth Aharonot Group: Private Company Information - Businessweek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Yedioth Ahronoth'' was established in 1939 by an investor named Gershom Komarov. It was the first evening paper in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], and attempted to emulate the format of the ''[[London Evening Standard]]''. Running into financial difficulties, Komarov sold the paper to Yehuda Mozes, a wealthy land dealer who regarded the paper as an interesting hobby and a long-term financial investment. His sons, Reuben and [[Noah Mozes|Noah]] ran the paper with Noah as the first managing editor.&lt;ref name="jvl"/&gt;

In 1948, a large group of journalists and staff members led by chief editor [[Ezriel Carlebach]] left to form ''Yedioth Maariv,'' later known as ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]''. Carlebach was replaced by [[Herzl Rosenblum]]. This began an ongoing battle for circulation and prestige between the rival newspapers, which peaked during the 1990s when both papers were discovered to have bugged one another's phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/1999/11/14/isrlnewswar991114.html Israel's newspaper war gets nasty] CBC, 10 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editor of Israeli paper Ma’ariv is charged in wiretapping case |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/1477/editor-of-israeli-paper-ma-ariv-is-charged-in-wiretapping-case/|newspaper=j.|date=25 August 1995|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Yediot.jpg|thumb|left|Yedioth Ahronoth former headquarters in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel&lt;ref&gt;the building has been demolished in order to make roome for another building as part of the adjacent [[Azrieli Center]] {{he icon}}[http://nadlan.walla.co.il/item/2945873] &lt;/ref&gt;]]
As of 2017, the paper is headed by Noah Mozes's son, Arnon Mozes. For many years it was edited by Herzl Rosenblum's son, Moshe Vardi, who was replaced in 2005 by Rafi Ginat. It is published in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, and according to one author, its marketing strategy emphasizes "drama and human interest over sophisticated analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfsfeld, G. (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ccvg1Ln6_VQC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Yediot+Ahronot+tabloid+or+not&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5iJYPqBYKI&amp;sig=Q0lzX04Zzz7w_NZR4Se2nH74kfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result ''Media and Political Conflict''], p. 96 {{ISBN|0-521-58967-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "undoubtedly the country's number-one paper."&lt;ref name="jvl"/&gt; The paper is open to a wide range of political views.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

It is owned by the Yedioth Ahronoth Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yedioth Ahronoth group pays dividend of NIS 200 million |first=Yoram |last=Gavison |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/yedioth-ahronoth-group-pays-dividend-of-nis-200-million-1.68625 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=1 September 2001 |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also owns stocks in several Israeli companies, such as "[[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]]", a commercial television channel; "[[Xtra HOT|Hot]]", the Cable TV company; "Yedioth Tikshoret", a group of weekly local newspapers; ''[[Vesti (Israel)|Vesti]]'', a [[Russian language]] newspaper; magazines, such as the weekly TV guide magazine ''[[Pnai Plus]]'' and weekly women's magazine ''[[La'Isha]]''; and other non-media companies.

In January 2017, secret recordings were released of conversations between Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and Mozes discussing a potential deal in which the newspaper would provide better coverage of Netanyahu in exchange for the government limiting the circulation of competitor [[Israel Hayom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.763649|title=In Secret Tape, Netanyahu Negotiated Favorable Coverage With Israeli Media Mogul|last=Haaretz|date=2017-01-08|last2=Tucker|first2=Nati|newspaper=Haaretz|language=en|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.764931|title=Netanyahu Promised to Media Mogul to Stifle Adelson's Daily: 'We Can Legislate It, We'll Set Up a Committee'|last=Haaretz|date=2017-01-13|newspaper=Haaretz|language=en|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circulation==
In a TGI survey of the media comparing the last half of 2009 with the same period in 2008, ''Yedioth Ahronoth'' retained the title of most widely read newspaper in Israel but saw its market share fall slightly from 35.9 to 33.9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000534102&amp;fid=942|title=TGI survey shows "Globes" only paper to grow|author=Li-Or Averbuch|date=27 January 2010|publisher=Globes|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, a TGI survey reported that ''[[Israel HaYom]]'' had overtaken ''Yedioth Ahronoth'' as the most read newspaper in terms of exposure with a rate of 35.2% compared to ''Yedioth''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 34.9%. After only a few months of publication of a weekend edition, it scored it 25.7% of exposure compared with ''Yedioth'''s 43.7% rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000577741&amp;fid=1725|title= After decades, "Yedioth" no longer top newspaper|author=Li-Or Averbuch|date= 28 July 2010|publisher=Globes|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political leaning==
''Yedioth Ahronoth'' is generally critical of [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/world/netanyahu-throws-a-punch-in-israels-newspaper-war.html?_r=0 |title=Netanyahu Throws a Punch in Israel’s Newspaper War |author=Jodi Rudoren |newspaper=''The New York Times'' |date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Moran Rada with the [[Israeli Democracy Institute]] showed that ''Yedioth'''s coverage of the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Israeli legislative election]] was biased in favor of [[Kadima]] and its leader [[Tzipi Livni]] in most editorial decisions and that the paper chooses to play down events that don't help to promote a positive image for her, while on the other hand, touting and inflating events that help promote Livni and her party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/articles/Pages/090708_The_newspaper_Israel_Today_as_a_political_apparatus.aspx|script-title=he:נתניהו שילם, מה אתם רוצים ממנו?|author=Moran Rada|publisher=[[Israeli Democracy Institute]]|work=HaAyin HaShevi'it|date=9 July 2008|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oren Frisco reached a similar conclusion after the 2009 [[Knesset]] elections, writing that throughout the campaign, ''Yediot Ahronoth'' was biased against Netanyahu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/articles/Pages/100209_Biased_media_outlets_and_the_2009_election.aspx?RetUrl=/articles/Pages/katavot_lobby.aspx|script-title=he:אצל אביגדור בחצר|author=Oren Frisco|publisher=Israeli Democracy Institute|work=HaAyin HaShevi'it|date=10 February 2009|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Netanyahu was taped trying to strike a deal with Arnon Mozes to have more favorable coverage of him in the paper in return for legislation harming the paper's main competitor, Israel Hayom. This led to the opening of "Case 2000", a [[2017 Corruption cases involving prominent Israeli political figures|corruption case ]] with Netanyahu as its main suspect.

'''Zemirot''' or '''Z'mirot''' ({{lang-he|זמירות}}) (Yiddish: Zmiros; Biblical Hebrew: Z'miroth; singular: '''zemer/z'mer''') are [[Jew]]ish hymns, usually sung in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]] languages, but sometimes also in [[Yiddish]] or [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]].  The best known ''zemirot'' are those sung around the table during [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s.  Some of the Sabbath ''zemirot'' are specific to certain times of the day, such as those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon.  In some editions of the Jewish prayerbook ([[siddur]]), the words to these hymns are printed after the opening prayer ([[kiddush]]) for each meal.  Other ''zemirot'' are more generic and can be sung at any meal or other sacred occasion.

The words to many ''zemirot'' are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the [[Middle Ages]].  Others are anonymous [[folk songs]] that have been passed down from generation to generation.  The words generally focus on the themes of the Sabbath or the specific holiday being celebrated.

The melodies vary greatly from one Jewish community to another, as local tunes and styles of music are adapted to the same liturgical poems. One famous hymn, ''[[Adon Olam]],'' (Ruler of the Universe) has been set to countless tunes.  Jews of different backgrounds enjoy sharing the various versions when they meet around the Sabbath table.   New tunes continue to be written today for the same ancient lyrics. It is now rare, however, for new zemer-type lyrics to be written.

The term ''zemirot'' is used by [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] to refer to the sequence of psalms in the [[Jewish services#Shacharit (morning prayers)|morning service]], known to other communities as ''pesuke de-zimrah''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">'''Émile Baumann''' (24 November 1868 – 24 November 1941) was a French writer.

==Biography==
Baumann was born in [[Lyons]] in 1868. He was descended from a [[Lutheran]] family converted to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoehn, Matthew (1948). "Émile Baumann." In: ''Catholic Authors: Contemporary Biographical Sketches.'' Newark, N.J.: St. Mary's Abbey, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Algiers]] he met [[Saint-Saëns]], and devoted his first work to him. He was directly involved in the ''Catholic Literary Renaissance'' movement, alongside such people as [[François Mauriac]], [[Paul Claudel]] and [[Pierre Reverdy]].&lt;ref&gt;Balmer, Yves (2010). "Religious Literature in Messiaens Personal Library." In: Andrew Shenton, ed., ''Messiaen the Theologian.'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Sister Mary Keeler, in her ''Catholic Literary France'' says that of all French novelists of the time Baumann was perhaps the most completely Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, Mary Jerome (1935). ''Catholic Literary France from Verlaine to the Present Time.'' Milwaukee: Bruce Pub. Co., p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the ''Prix Balzac'' in 1922 for his novel ''Job le Prédestiné''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheen, Fulton J. (2009). ''Treasure in Clay: The Autobiography of Fulton J. Sheen.''
