The so-called '''Apocalypse of Samuel of Qalamun''' is a [[Coptic language|Coptic text]] of uncertain date and [[authorship]] now preserved only in its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation. It contains the strongest [[denunciation]] of the [[language shift]] in the [[Middle Ages]] of [[Egypt]], by which Coptic was replaced by Arabic. It records that the Christians in Egypt were becoming increasingly Arabized in [[Arabic culture|culture]] and customs, although actual conversion to [[Islam]] does not seem to be a concern.

The date of the text depends on the interpretation of the list of "predicted" Arab kings which it contains. These seem to be the [[Fatimid]] [[caliphs]], and the work should therefore be dated to the [[Crusades|crusader]] period. However it has been dated as early as the 8th century. The work of the author is supposedly the 7th century [[monk]] [[Samuel of Kalamoun]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Graf, ''Geschichte der christliche arabische Literatur'' vol. I, p. 280-282. See also Paul VAN CAUWENBERG, ''Études sur les moines d'Égypte depuis le Concile de Chalcédoine (451) jusqu'à l'invasion arabe'', Paris, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is edited with a French translation in an unsatisfactory edition by J. Ziadeh.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ziadeh, ''Revue de l'Orient chrétien'', 20 (1915–17), pp. 374–404&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Armenians}}
'''Swiss-Armenians''' are citizens of [[Switzerland]] of [[Armenians|Armenian]] ancestry. The exact number of Armenians in the country is unknown, but it is unofficially estimated that about 3,000-5,000 Armenians live in Switzerland.

The majority of Swiss Armenians are members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] under the jurisdiction of the Mother See of Holy [[Echmiadzin]]. There are four church regions (''tems''): Geneva, Zurich, Neuchatel and Lugano. The ''Saint Hagop Church'' in Troinex / [[Geneva]] serves mainly the west of the country, whereas Armenians living in the east parts conduct their religious services in a number of sister Swiss churches. There are also a smaller number of Armenian Catholics belonging to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] and even a smaller number of Armenian Evangelicals.

==Armenian associations==
A number of Armenian associations operate in Switzerland:
* ''{{lang|fr|Union Arménienne de Suisse}}'' (UAS) is certainly the biggest operating Armenian association. Based in [[Geneva]], it organizes an annual European Intercommunity Tournament in the city.
* ''{{lang|fr|Union Genérale Arménienne de Bienfaisance}}'' (UGAB)

{{Campaignbox Spanish Civil War}}
The '''Battle of Bielsa pocket''' took place between 14 April and 15 June 1938, during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. After the fall of the Aragon front a republican division, in April 1938, was surrounded by the Nationalists in the [[Cinca River (Aragon)|Cinca River]] Valley. The division heavily outnumbered managed to hold until 6 July and then crossed the French frontier.

==Background==
After the [[battle of Teruel]], the Nationalists led by the general [[Fidel Dávila]], launched an [[Aragon Offensive|offensive in the Aragon front]] on March 1938. The Nationalists broke the Republican lines, pursued them and by April the Nationalist reached the Mediterranean sea at [[Vinaròs]] and the [[river Segre]], occupying Aragon. One republican division was isolated by the Nationalist advance in the valley of the Alto Cinca river, near the French Frontier. By the end of March, the 43rd division of the Republican Army, led by Antonio Beltran, nicknamed ''El Esquinazado'' (The Dodger), was surrounded by the Nationalist troops in the Cinca river Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.796&lt;/ref&gt;

==The bielsa pocket==
The 43rd division had around 7,000 men with four guns and no air cover. In this front the Nationalists concentrated a force of 14,000 men with 30 guns and overwhelming air power. Virtually isolated, without ammunition reserves, and outnumbered the Republican troops managed to halt the Nationalist attacks due the difficult terrain, the bad weather and the dogged resistance of the troops, but by the end of May became clear that a further resistance was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Bolsa de Bielsa]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican troops evacuated to France 4,000 civilians and then, retreated slowly across the French frontier. On 6 June the town of [[Bielsa, Spain|Bielsa]] fell&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.808&lt;/ref&gt; and on the night of 15-16 June all the Republican troops crossed into France.

==Aftermath==
This battle had no military importance, but the resistance of the Esquinazau division, after the disaster of the Aragon retreat, was a morale boost for the Republicans. Furthermore, the French government allowed the republican soldiers to choose between returning to the Republican held territory or the Nationalist held territory. 411 soldiers and five nurses chose the Nationalist held territory, more than 6,000 the Republican held territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Bolsa de Bielsa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Macta''' was fought on 28 June 1835 between French forces under General [[Camille Alphonse Trézel]] and a coalition of Algerian [[Berber people|Berber]] tribal warriors under Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] during the [[French conquest of Algeria]].  The French column, which had fought an inconclusive but somewhat bloody battle with Abdul-Qadir a few days earlier, was retreating toward [[Arzew]] to resupply when Abdul-Qadir attacked in the marshes on the banks of the [[Macta River]] in what is now western [[Algeria]].  The French panicked and fled to Arzew in a disorganized rout. The Algerians piled the heads of their defeated French enemies in a pyramid, allegedly hundreds in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofabdelkader00churuoft|title=The life of Abdel Kader, ex-sultan of the Arabs of Algeria; written from his own dictation, and comp. from other authentic sources.

The disaster led to the recall to France of Trézel and the [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|comte d'Erlon]], the first military governor-general of the French possessions in Africa, and helped Abdul-Qadir gain influence over tribes throughout Algeria.

[[File:Reivers raid on Gilnockie Tower.jpg|thumb|Reivers at [[Gilnockie Tower]], from a 19th-century print]]

'''Border reivers''' were [[Cattle raiding|raiders]] along the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] from the late 13th century to the beginning of the 17th century. Their ranks consisted of both [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[England|English]] people, and they raided the entire [[Border country]] without regard to their victims' nationality. Their heyday was in the last hundred years of their existence, during the time of the [[Stewart Kings|Stuart Kings]]&lt;!-- correct spelling for Scottish context --&gt; in Scotland and the [[Tudor dynasty]] in England.

==Background==
Scotland and England were frequently at war during the late [[Middle Ages]]. During these wars, the livelihood of the people on the Borders was devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not formally at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in either or both kingdoms was often weak, particularly in remote locations. The difficulty and uncertainties of basic human survival meant that communities and/or people kindred to each other would seek security through group strength and cunning. They would attempt to improve their livelihoods at their nominal enemies' expense, enemies who were frequently also just trying to survive. Loyalty to a feeble or distant monarch and reliance on the effectiveness of the law usually made people a target for [[Raid (military)|depredations]] rather than conferring any security.

There were other factors which promoted a [[Predation|predatory]] mode of living in the Borders. A system of inheritance called [[gavelkind]] meant that estates, and particularly land, were divided equally between all sons on a man's death; although this was considered more fair than [[primogeniture]], it also meant that many people owned insufficient land to survive.&lt;ref name=Durham5&gt;Durham &amp; McBride, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Also, much of the border region is mountainous or open moorland, unsuitable for arable farming but good for grazing. Livestock was easily rustled and driven back to raiders' territory by mounted reivers who knew the country well. The raiders also often removed easily portable household goods or valuables, and took prisoners for ransom.

The attitudes of the English and Scottish governments towards the border families alternated from indulgence and even encouragement, as these fierce families served as the first line of defence against invasion across the border, to draconian and indiscriminate punishment when their lawlessness became intolerable to the authorities.

''Reive'', a noun meaning raid, comes from the Middle English (Scots) ''reifen.'' The verb ''reave'' meaning "plunder, rob", a closely related word, comes from the Middle English ''reven''. There also exists a [[Northumbrian English|Northumbrian]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] verb ''reifen.''  All three derive from [[Old English]] ''rēafian'' which means "to rob, plunder, pillage"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Reiver merriam-webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
[[File:WatHarden.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Walter Scott of Harden|Auld Wat of Harden]]'' by [[Tom Scott (painter)|Tom Scott]]. A romanticised image of a notorious raider, Walter Scott of Harden.]]
The reivers were both English and Scottish and raided both sides of the border impartially, so long as the people they raided had no powerful protectors and no connection to their own kin. Their activities, although usually within a day's ride of the border, extended both north and south of their main haunts. English raiders were reported to have hit the outskirts of [[Edinburgh]], and Scottish raids were known as far south as [[Yorkshire]]. The largest of these was [[The Great Raid of 1322]], during the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], where it reached as far south as [[Chorley]]. The main raiding season ran through the early winter months, when the nights were longest and the cattle and horses fat from having spent the summer grazing. The numbers involved in a raid might range from a few dozen to organised campaigns involving up to three thousand riders.&lt;ref&gt;George MacDonald Fraser, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

When raiding, or riding, as it was termed, the reivers rode light on hardy nags or ponies renowned for the ability to pick their way over the boggy moss lands (see: [[Galloway pony]], [[Hobelar]]). The original dress of a [[Northumbrian tartan|shepherd's plaid]] was later replaced by light armour such as [[brigandine]]s or [[Jack of plate|jacks of plate]] (a type of sleeveless [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] into which small plates of steel were stitched), and metal helmets such as [[burgonet]]s or [[Morion (helmet)|morions]]; hence their nickname of the "steel bonnets". They were armed with lances and small shields, and sometimes also with [[longbow]]s, or light [[crossbow]]s, known as "latches", or later on in their history with one or more pistols. They invariably also carried [[sword]]s and [[dirk]]s.

==Borderers as soldiers==
Border reivers, owing to their recognized skills as light [[cavalry]], were sometimes in demand as [[mercenaries|mercenary soldiers]]. After meeting one reiver (the [[Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch|''Bold Buccleugh'']]), [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] is quoted as having said that "with ten thousand such men, [[James VI and I|James VI]] could shake any throne in Europe." Reivers sometimes served in English or Scottish armies in the [[Low Countries]] and in Ireland, often to avoid having harsher penalties enacted upon themselves and their families. Reivers fighting as levied soldiers played important roles in the battles at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] and [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]]. 

The borderers proved difficult to control, however, within larger national armies. They were already in the habit of claiming any nationality or none, depending on who was asking and where they perceived the individual advantage to be. (Fraser) Many had relatives on both sides of Scottish-English conflicts despite prevailing laws against international marriage. They could be badly-behaved in camp, seeing fellow soldiers as sources of plunder. As warriors more loyal to clans than to nations, their commitment to the work was always in doubt. At battles such as [[Battle of Ancrum Moor|Ancrum Moor]] in Scotland in 1545, borderers changed sides in mid-combat to curry favour with the likely victors. At the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in 1547, an observer ([[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]]) noticed Scottish and English borderers chatting with each other, then putting on a spirited show of combat once they knew they had been spotted.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dwellings and fortifications==
[[Image:Black Middens Bastle - geograph.org.uk - 1224658.jpg|left|thumb|[[Black Middens Bastle House]], a surviving bastle house]]

The inhabitants of the Borders had to live in a state of constant alert, and for self-protection, they built fortified [[Tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]]s.

In the very worst periods of warfare, people were unable to construct more than crude turf cabins, the destruction of which would be little loss. When times allowed however, they built houses designed as much for defence as shelter. The [[bastle house]] was a stout two-storeyed building. The lower floor was used to keep the most valuable livestock and horses. The upper storey housed the people, and often could be reached only by an external ladder which was pulled up at night or if danger threatened. The stone walls were up to {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick, and the roof was of slate or stone tiles. Only narrow arrow slits provided light and ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;Durham &amp; McBride, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Such dwellings could not be set on fire, and while they could be captured, for example by smoking out the defenders with fires of damp straw or using scaling ladders to reach the roof, they were usually not worth the time and effort.

[[Peel tower]]s (also spelled pele towers) were usually three-storeyed buildings, constructed specifically for defensive purposes by the authorities, or for prestigious individuals such as the heads of clans. [[Smailholm Tower]] is one of many surviving peel towers. Like bastle houses, they were very strongly constructed for defence. If necessary, they could be temporarily abandoned and stuffed full of smouldering turf to prevent an enemy (such as a government army) destroying them with gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;Durham &amp; McBride, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Peel towers and bastle houses were often surrounded by a stone wall known as a barmkin, inside which cattle and other livestock were kept overnight.

==Law and order==
[[File:Late-medieval jack, National Museum of Scotland collection.jpg|thumb|A leather jack of the kind worn by reivers in the 16th century]]
During periods of nominal peace, a special body of [[customary law]], known as [[March law (Anglo-Scottish border)|March law]] or Border law, grew up to deal with the situation. Under border law, a person who had been raided had the right to mount a counter-raid within six days, even across the border, to recover his goods. This "hot trod" had to proceed with "hound and horne, hew and cry",&lt;ref&gt;Durham &amp; McBride, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; making a racket and carrying a piece of burning turf on a spear point to openly announce their purpose, to distinguish themselves from unlawful raiders proceeding covertly. They might use a [[sleuth hound]] (also known as a "slew dogge") to follow raiders' tracks. These dogs were valuable, and part of the established forces (on the English side of the border, at least).&lt;ref&gt;George MacDonald Fraser, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Any person meeting this counter-raid was required to ride along and offer such help as he could, on pain of being considered complicit with the raiders. The "cold trod" mounted after six days required official sanction. Officers such as the Deputy Warden of the English West March had the specific duty of "following the trod".&lt;ref&gt;George MacDonald Fraser, p. 215 fn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides of the border were divided into [[Scottish Marches|Marches]], each under a [[Lord Warden of the Marches|march warden]]. The march wardens' various duties included the maintenance of patrols, watches and garrisons to deter raiding from the other kingdom. On occasion, march wardens could make ''warden roades'' to recover loot, and to make a point to raiders and officials.

The march wardens also had the duty of maintaining such justice and equity as was possible. The respective kingdoms' march wardens would meet at appointed times along the border itself to settle claims against people on their side of the border by people from the other kingdom. These occasions, known as "Days of Truce", were much like fairs, with entertainment and much socialising. For reivers it was an opportunity to meet (lawfully) with relatives or friends normally separated by the border. It was not unknown for violence to break out even at such truce days.

March wardens (and the lesser officers such as keepers of fortified places) were rarely effective at maintaining the law. The Scottish wardens were usually borderers themselves, and were complicit in raiding. They almost invariably showed favour to their own kindred, which caused jealousy and even hatred among other Scottish border families. Many English officers were from southern counties in England and often could not command the loyalty or respect of their locally recruited subordinates or the local population. Local officers such as [[Sir John Forster]], who was Warden of the Middle March for almost 35 years, became quite as well known for venality as his most notorious Scottish counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;George MacDonald Fraser, pp.139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

By the death of [[Elizabeth I of England]], things had come to such a pitch along the border that the English government considered re-fortifying and rebuilding [[Hadrian's Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;George MacDonald Fraser, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; When Elizabeth died, there was an especially violent outbreak of raiding known as "Ill Week", resulting from the convenient belief that the laws of a kingdom were suspended between the death of a sovereign and the proclamation of the successor.&lt;ref&gt;George MacDonald Fraser, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his accession to the English throne, [[James I of England|James VI]] of Scotland (who became James I of England) moved hard against the reivers, abolishing border law and the very term "Borders" in favour of "Middle [[Shire]]s," and dealing out stern justice to reivers.

===Legislation===
In 1606 an act (4 Jas. 1. c. 1) to assist the recent [[Union of the Crowns]] was enacted; it was [[long title]]d ''An act for the utter abolition of all memory of hostility, and the dependence thereof, between England and Scotland, and for repressing of occasions of disorders, and disorders in time to come''. The act repealed nine English laws enacted over the previous centuries and considered hostile to Scotland; the repeal became effective when 13 Scottish laws considered hostile to England had been repealed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n226/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.195&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later an act (7 Jas. 1 c. 1) dealing with criminal law in the border region was enacted; it was long titled ''An act for the better execution of justice, and suppressing of criminal offenders, in the north parts of the kingdom of England.'' To deal with cross-border flight, the act allowed the trial of an Englishman in Scotland if the felony was committed there, and he was later arrested in England; it became effective after a similar act had been passed in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge50britgoog#page/n248/mode/2up Statutes at Large - Volume 7 - 39 Elizabeth to 12 Charles II - 1597-8 to 1660], p.216]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and long-running lawlessness by [[Moss-trooper|Moss troopers]] nearly six decades later, parliament passed the Moss Troopers Act 1662 (13 &amp; 14 Cha. 2. c. 22) for the border area; it was [[long title]]d ''An Act for preventing of Theft and Rapine upon the Northern Borders of England.'' Section seven of the act revives both previous acts passed under James I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp417-418 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.417&lt;/ref&gt; With the 1662 act about to expire, the sixth session of [[Cavalier Parliament]] passed the Moss Troopers Act 1666 (18 Cha. 2 c. 3), long titled ''An Act to continue a former Act for preventing of Thefte and Rapine upon the Northerne Borders of England.'' Under section two of the act, the [[benefit of clergy]] was taken away from those convicted (generally meaning a death sentence), or otherwise, the notorious thieves and spoil-takers in Northumberland or Cumberland were to be [[penal transportation|transported]] to America, "there to remaine and not to returne".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.&amp;nbsp;581&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally associated with several historic events of the period, as well as continuing lawlessness, or the consideration of insufficient government control to prevent "theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England", these acts were repeatedly continued over the next 80 years. The initial acts include the Moss Trooper Acts of 1677 (29 &amp; 30 Cha. 2 c. 2),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge29britgoog#page/n447/mode/2up "An act for continuance of two former acts for preventing theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England"]&lt;/ref&gt; 1685 (1 Jas. 2 c.  14),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge29britgoog#page/n485/mode/2up "An act for the continuance of three former acts for preventing of theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England"]&lt;/ref&gt; 1695 (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3 c.  17),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge38britgoog#page/n441/mode/2up "An act for the continuing four former acts for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England"]&lt;/ref&gt; 1700 (12 &amp; 13 Will. 3 c. 6),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge31britgoog#page/n411/mode/2up "An act for continuing the acts therein mentioned for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England"]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1712 (12 Ann. c. 10).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge69britgoog#page/n58/mode/2up "An act for continuing the acts therein mentioned, for preventing theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England"]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1732, although the 'Moss trooper' [[short title]] was dropped, the enforcement acts were continued by other variously named acts, most of which continued the established descriptive phrase "for preventing theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England", as the first item included.  These later acts include the Perpetuation of Various Laws Act 1732 (6 Geo. 2 c.  37),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge03britgoog#page/n484/mode/2up “An act ... and for continuing an act made in the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the reign of King Charles the Second, for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England; and for reviving and continuing certain clauses in two other acts made for the same purpose"]&lt;/ref&gt; the Universities (Wine Licences) Act 1743 (17 Geo. 2 c. 40),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge01britgoog#page/n318/mode/2up "An act to continue the several laws therein mentioned for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England; ..."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Continuance of Acts, 1750 (24 Geo. 2 c. 57),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge67britgoog#page/n342/mode/2up "An act to continue the several laws therein mentioned; for preventing theft and rapine on the northern borders of England; ..."]&lt;/ref&gt; which continued previous acts until 1 September 1757 "and from thence to the end of the then next session of parliament".

==Border surnames and clan status==
[[File:Hermitage Castle 06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hermitage Castle]], the strength of [[Liddesdale]] and an important stronghold for the Scottish Marches. Its holder, the Keeper of Liddesdale, usually had equal status to the Scottish Wardens of the Marches.]]
The Border families can be referred to as clans, as the [[Scot]]s themselves appear to have used both terms interchangeably until the 19th century. In an Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]] of 1587 there is the description of the "Chiftanis and chieffis of all clannis ... duelland in the hielands or bordouris" – thus using the word clan and chief to describe both Highland and Lowland families. The act goes on to list the various Border clans. Later, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General) writing in 1680 said "By the term 'chief' we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the [[Irish language|Irish]] (Gaelic) with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan". Thus, the words chief or head, and clan or family, are interchangeable. It is therefore possible to talk of the [[MacDonald]] family or the Maxwell clan. The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders are listed as families originated as a 19th-century convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clans_families_septs.htm Clans, Families and Septs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms were also used to describe the Border families, such as the "Riding Surnames" and the "Graynes" thereof. This can be equated to the system of the Highland Clans and their [[Sept (social)|sept]]s. e.g. [[Clan Donald]] and [[Clan MacDonald of Sleat]], can be compared with the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Scotts of Buccleuch]] and the Scotts of Harden and elsewhere. Both Border Graynes and Highland septs however, had the essential feature of patriarchal leadership by the chief of the name, and had territories in which most of their kindred lived. Border families did practice customs similar to those of the [[Gaels]], such as tutorship when an heir who was a minor succeeded to the chiefship, and giving bonds of [[manrent]]. Although feudalism existed, loyalty to kin was much more important and this is what distinguished the Borderers from other lowland Scots.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In 1587 the [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a statute: "For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subjectis inhabitantis of the borders hielands and Ilis."&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain III Acts of the Parliament of Scotland pp.466–467 (1587)&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to the statute was a Roll of surnames from both the Borders and Highlands. The Borders portion listed 17 'clannis' with a Chief and their associated Marches:

* ''Middle March''
**[[Clan Elliot|Elliot]], [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrong]], Nixon, [[Clan Crozier|Crozier]]
* ''West March''
**Scott, Bates, Little, [[Thomson (surname)|Thomson]], Glendenning, Irvine, Bell, Carruthers, [[Graham (surname)|Graham]], [[Johnstone]], Jardine, Moffat and Latimer.

Of the Border Clans or Graynes listed on this roll, [[Clan Elliot|Elliot]], [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrong]], [[Clan Scott|Scott]], [[Clan Little|Little]], [[Clan Irvine|Irvine]], Bell, [[Clan Graham|Graham]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstone]], [[Clan Jardine|Jardine]] and [[Clan Moffat|Moffat]] are registered with the Court of Lord Lyon in Edinburgh as Scottish Clans, others such as [[Clan Carruthers|Carruthers]] are [[armigerous]] clans with no Chief, while such as [[Clan Blackadder]], also an [[armigerous]] clan in the Middle Ages, later died out or lost their lands, and are unregistered with the Lyon Court.

The historic riding surnames recorded by George MacDonald Fraser in ''The Steel Bonnets'' (1989)&lt;ref&gt;George McDonald Fraser, pp.&amp;nbsp;56–65&lt;/ref&gt; are:

*''East March''
** Scotland: [[Clan Home|Hume]], [[Clan Trotter|Trotter]], [[Dixon Baronets|Dixon]], [[Bromfield (surname)|Bromfield]], [[Craw (surname)|Craw]], [[Clan Cranstoun|Cranston]].
** England: [[Forster (surname)|Forster]], [[Selby family|Selby]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], [[Dunn (surname)|Dunn]].
*''Middle March''
** Scotland: Burns, [[Clan Kerr|Kerr]], [[Clan Young|Young]], [[Clan Pringle|Pringle]], Davison, Gilchrist, [[Tait (surname)|Tait]] of East Teviotdale. [[Clan Scott|Scott]], Oliver, [[Clan Turnbull|Turnbull]], Rutherford of West Teviotdale. [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrong]], [[Clan Crozier|Croser]], [[Clan Eliott|Elliot]], Nixon, [[Clan Douglas|Douglas]], Laidlaw, [[Routledge]], Turner, [[Clan Henderson|Henderson]] of Liddesdale.
** England: Anderson, Potts, [[Reed (name)|Reed]], Hall, Hedley of Redesdale. Charlton, Robson, Dodd, Dodds, Milburn, Yarrow, [[Stapleton (surname)|Stapleton]] of Tynedale. Also Fenwick, [[Ogle family|Ogle]], Heron, Witherington, Medford (later [[Mitford family|Mitford]]), Collingwood, Carnaby, Shaftoe, Ridley, Stokoe, Stamper, Wilkinson, Hunter, [[Thomson (surname)|Thomson]], Jamieson.
*''West March''
** Scotland: Bell, [[Clan Irvine|Irvine]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstone]], [[Clan Maxwell|Maxwell]], Carlisle, Beattie, [[Clan Little|Little]], [[Clan Carruthers|Carruthers]], Glendenning, Routledge, [[Clan Moffat|Moffat]].
** England: Graham, [[Hetherington]], Musgrave, Storey, Lowther, Curwen, [[Salkeld]], Dacre, Harden, [[Hodgson]], Routledge, Tailor, Noble.

Relationships between the Border clans varied from uneasy alliance to open, deadly [[feud]]. It took little to start a feud; a chance quarrel or misuse of office was sufficient. Feuds might continue for years until patched up in the face of invasion from the other kingdoms or when the outbreak of other feuds caused alliances to shift. The border was easily destabilised if Graynes from opposite sides of the border were at feud. Feuds also provided ready excuse for particularly murderous raids or pursuits.

Riders did not wear identifying [[tartan]]s. The tradition of family tartans dates from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era and was inspired by the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]]. The typical dress of reivers included [[trews]], [[Jack of plate]], steel bonnets ([[helmet]]s), and [[riding boot]]s.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Crossing the Tweed on Braw Lad's Day, Galashiels.jpg|thumb|310px|left|Skills of horsemanship are kept alive in the Borders: fording the Tweed on Braw Lad's Day, Galashiels 2011]]
[[File:Galashiels Reiver Statue 02.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Reiver statue at [[Galashiels]]]]
Long after they were gone, the reivers were romanticised by writers such as [[Sir Walter Scott]] (''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''), although he made mistakes; the term [[Moss-trooper]], which he used, refers to one of the robbers that existed after the real Reivers had been put down. Nevertheless, Scott was a native of the borders, writing down histories which had been passed on in folk tradition or ballad. The stories of legendary border reivers like [[Kinmont Willie Armstrong]] were often retold in folk-song as Border ballads. There are also local legends, such as the "Dish of Spurs" which would be served to a border chieftain of the Charltons to remind him that the larder was empty and it was time to acquire more plunder. Scottish author [[Nigel Tranter]] revisited these themes in his historical and contemporary novels.  Scottish Border poet, and Australian bush balladeer, [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H. Ogilvie]] (1869–1963) wrote several poems about the reivers, including ''The reiver's heart'' (1903), ''The raiders'' (1904), ''Whaup o' the rede: a ballad of the border raiders'' (1909), ''[[Kirkhope Tower]]'' (1913), and ''Ho! for the blades of Harden''.

The names of the [[Reiver]] families are still very much apparent amongst the inhabitants of the [[Scottish Borders]], Northumberland and [[Cumbria]] today. Reiving families (particularly those large or brutal enough to carry significant influence) have left the local population passionate about their territory on both sides of the Border. Newspapers have described the local cross-border rugby fixtures as 'annual re-runs of the bloody [[Battle of Otterburn]]'.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Despite this there has been much cross-border migration since the Pacification of the Borders, and families that were once Scots now identify themselves as English and vice versa.

[[Hawick]] in Scotland holds an annual Reivers' festival as do the Schomberg Society in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland (the two often co-operate). The summer festival in the Borders town of [[Duns]] is headed by the "Reiver" and "Reiver's Lass", a young man and young woman elected from the inhabitants of the town and surrounding area. The Ulster-Scots Agency's first two leaflets from the 'Scots Legacy' series feature the story of the historic Ulster tartan and the origins of the kilt and the Border Reivers.

Borderers (particularly those banished by [[James VI of Scotland]]) took part in the [[plantation of Ulster]] becoming the people known as [[Ulster-Scots]] ([[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] in America). Reiver descendants can be found throughout Ulster with names such as Elliot, Armstrong, Beattie, Bell, Hume and Heron, Rutledge, and Turnbulls amongst others.

Border surnames can also be found throughout the major areas of [[Scots-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] settlement in the United States, and particularly in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] region. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] (1989) has shown in detail how the Anglo-Scottish border culture became rooted in parts of the United States, especially the [[Upland South]]. Author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] wryly observed or imagined Border traits and names among controversial people in modern American history: Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], among others. It is also noted that, in 1969, a descendant of the Borderers, [[Neil Armstrong]], was the first person to set foot on the moon. In the following year, Armstrong visited the town of [[Langholm]], home of his ancestors.

The artist [[Gordon Young (artist)|Gordon Young]] created a public art work in Carlisle: ''Cursing Stone and Reiver Pavement'', a nod to [[Gavin Dunbar (archbishop of Glasgow)|Gavin Dunbar]], the Archbishop of Glasgow's 1525 ''Monition of Cursing''.  Names of Reiver families are set into the paving of a walkway which connects [[Tullie House Museum]] to [[Carlisle Castle]] under a main road, and part of the bishop's curse is displayed on a 14-ton granite boulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|title=Cursing Stone &amp; Reiver Pavement / Carlisle, 2001|publisher=Gordon Young|accessdate=23 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227133140/http://gordonyoung.net/carlise_cursingstone.html|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEAFL championships are an [[Australian rules football]] tournament held between European nations where the sport of Australian Rules football is in the early stages of development.

==History==
The first CEAFL Championships were held in [[Madrid]] in 2003.

The second CEAFL Championships were held in [[Düsseldorf]] in 2004. The 2004 competition was won by [[Australian rules football in Belgium|Belgium]] (represented by the [[Brussels Saints]]), defeating [[Australian rules football in Spain|Spain]] (represented by the [[Madrid Bears]]) in the final.  Other competing sides in that year included [[Australian rules football in France|France]] (although this side consisted of only one French player and two Australians from the [[Paris Cockerels]], combined with extra players from other countries), [[Australian rules football in Austria|Austria]], [[Australian rules football in Germany|Germany]] (represented by club players from Düsseldorf and elsewhere).

The 2005 CEAFL Championships were to be held in Paris, France - but involvement first with the [[International Australian Football Council]] and then with the new organisation [[Aussie Rules International]] saw the event renamed the [[EU Cup]].  This event was moved to London for organisational reasons and was held on October the 9th.

The 2006 EU Cup was to be held in Paris, but when organisers cancelled the event, the CEAFL championships were instead arranged to be hosted in [[Prague]] by the [[Australian rules football in the Czech Republic|Czech Lions]].

The 2007 CEAFL Championships was hosted by the [[Vienna Kangaroos]] in [[Vienna]]. [[Australian rules football in Finland|Finland]] won the championship second year in a row, defeating the host Austria in the final.

Due to financial difficulties, since 2008 the event is currently on indefinite hiatus.

==Cyprus Daily==

In 2013, The Cyprus Weekly launched a twin newspaper called ''The Cyprus Daily'' which was published from Monday and Friday, with the publication day of the weekly edition moved to Saturdays.

In [[investing]], a '''developed market''' is a country that is most developed in terms of its economy and capital markets. The country must be high income, but this also includes openness to foreign ownership, ease of capital movement, and efficiency of market institutions. This term is contrasted with [[developing market]] ([[Emerging markets]] and [[frontier markets]] are types of developing markets).

'''Hapoel''' ({{lang-he-n|הפועל}}, lit. ''the worker'') is an [[Israel]]i sport association established in 1926 by the [[Histadrut]] Labor Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R0pSCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=hapoel+1926&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-mobJ3bvQAhVKKiYKHYmkCkoQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=hapoel%201926&amp;f=false ''Playing as if the World Mattered: An Illustrated History of Activism in Sports'' - Gabriel Kuhn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oeF4KF9diy4C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=hapoel+1926&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-mobJ3bvQAhVKKiYKHYmkCkoQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=hapoel%201926&amp;f=false ''Europe, Sport, World: Shaping Global Societies'' - J. A. Mangan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
During the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] period Hapoel had a bitter rivalry with [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] and organized its own competitions, with the exception of [[Israel Football Association|football]], the only sport in which all the organizations played each other. At the time, Hapoel took no part in the ''Eretz Israel Olympic Committee'', which was controlled by Maccabi, and instead sought for international ties with similar workers sports organizations of socialist parties. Therefore, Hapoel became a member of [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|SASI]] in 1927 and later was a member of [[CSIT]].

After the State of Israel was established, the rival sport organizations reached a 1951 agreement that allowed joint sports associations and competitions open for all Israeli residents.

'''"Heel de wereld"''' ("The Whole World") was the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958]], performed in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] by [[Corry Brokken]]. This was Brokken's third consecutive appearance on the Eurovision stage and it would be her last as a performer.

The song is in the ''chanson'' style, popular at the early Contest. Brokken sings that she wants to tell the whole world "my secret", because she is happy. She wonders if perhaps the world is too busy to be happy, but this does not diminish her joy. Peculiarly, she never explains why she is happy. Brokken also recorded the song in French, as "Toi mon cœur, tu sais" (translated "You My Heart, You Know").

The song was performed second on the night, following [[Italy]]'s [[Domenico Modugno]] with "[[Volare (song)|Nel blu dipinto di blu]]" and preceding [[France]]'s [[André Claveau]] with "[[Dors, mon amour]]". At the close of voting, it had received 1 point, placing 9th (equal last) in a field of 10. Until Austria's zero points in 2015, it was the lowest score of a host country's entry in the history of the contest.

It was succeeded as [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Dutch representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959 Contest]] by [[Teddy Scholten]] with "[['n Beetje]]". Corry Brokken returned to Eurovision in 1976, but then as the host of [[Eurovision Song Contest|that year's Contest]], held in [[The Hague]].

"'''Hullu yö'''" ("A crazy night") was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991]], performed in [[Finnish Language|Finnish]] by [[Kaija Kärkinen|Kaija]].

The song was performed sixteenth on the night (following [[Israel]]'s [[Duo Datz]] with "[[Kan (song)|Kan]]" and preceding [[Germany]]'s [[Atlantis 2000]] with "[[Dieser Traum Darf Niemals Sterben]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 6 points, placing 20th in a field of 22.

The song is sung from the perspective of a woman who had a [[one-night stand]] with a man. Despite both of them claiming that this was all the relationship was, she sings that she wants to spend more time with him. Kaija also recorded the song in English and - very unusually - Italian, then under the titles "One More Lonely Night" and "Una notte folle" (translated: "A Crazy Night") respectively.

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992 Contest]] by [[Pave Maijanen]] with "[[Yamma, yamma]]".

This song can be found on Kaija Kärkinen's 1991 album ''Mustaa vettä''.

The '''Jino''' (also spelled '''Jinuo''') people ({{zh|s=基诺族|t=基諾族|p=Jīnuò zú}}, endonym: {{IPA-bodia|tɕyno|}} or {{IPA|[kyno]}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}) are a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] [[ethnic group]]. They form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]]. They live in [[Xishuangbanna]] in [[Yunnan]] province, [[China]].&lt;ref name="The Jino ethnic minority"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jino ethnic minority|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/ljzg_665465/3584_665493/t17892.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jino are one of the less numerous of the recognized minorities in China and the last one included as "national minority" because they were only recognized in 1979.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania"&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Barbara A.|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=1438119135|page=350|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22jino%22+%22ethnicity%22+%22china%22+%22uncle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IbqkVLLlMoW1ogTJloD4Cw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=jino&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former name used for the Jino, ''Youle'', means "following the maternal uncle," an indication of a [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] past.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania"/&gt;

The Jino have a population of 20,900 people according to the census of the year 2000.&lt;ref name="The Jino ethnic minority" /&gt; 
Most of the Jino concentrate in the Jinoshan Mountain, in a series of mild hills with wet climate near Mengyang Township in Jinghong Municipality, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province. They live in an area of about 70x50 km. They live in subtropical rainforest, home of elephants, wild oxen and monkeys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Among their cultural practices is [[tooth painting]], in which soot made from pear trees is used.&lt;ref name="Jino Nationality"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jino Nationality|url=http://www.chinatour360.com/culture/ethnicgroups/jino.htm|website=ChinaTour360.com|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">The '''Kilukeni''' were members of the '''Lukeni''' [[kanda (lineage)|kanda]] or '''House of Kilukeni''', the ruling dynasty of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] from its inception in the late 14th century until the 1567 with the rise of the [[House of Kwilu]].&lt;ref name="Thornton, John page 445"&gt;Thornton, John: "Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power", page 445. The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Kilukeni were springboard for most of the major factions that battled for control of Kongo during its [[Kongo Civil War|civil war]].

==Etymology==
In [[KiKongo]] the language of the kingdom of Kongo, the name of the kanda is ''Lukeni''. It is taken from the first name of the founder of the kingdom, [[Lukeni lua Nimi]].&lt;ref name="Thornton, John page 445"/&gt;  Lukeni lua Nimi ruled around the 1390s before the throne was handed down to his cousins.

==History==
Beginning with the reign of [[Nkuwu a Ntinu]], a son of Lukeni and the last non-Catholic [[mwenekongo]], the throne passed from father to son.  Occasionally there were usurpations, but the crown stayed within the lineage of the founder until 1567 when a king from the region of [[Nsi Kwilu]], [[Alvaro I of Kongo|Alvaro I]] ascended after the last of the Kilukeni died in battle against the [[Anziku Kingdom]].

'''OPS 5111''', also known as '''Navstar 1''', '''NDS-1''', '''GPS I-1''' and '''GPS SVN-1''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] launched in 1978 as part of the [[Global Positioning System]] development programme. It was the first GPS satellite to be launched, and one of eleven [[GPS Block I|Block I]] demonstration satellites.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

OPS 5111 was launched at 23:44 UTC on 22 February 1978, atop an [[Atlas E/F]] carrier rocket with an [[SGS-1]] upper stage. The Atlas used had the serial number 64F, and was originally built as an [[SM-65F Atlas|Atlas F]].&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3|Space Launch Complex 3E]] at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed OPS 5111 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-27]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar.htm|title=GPS (Navstar)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 11 April 1978, OPS 5111 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20075|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20291|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 718 minutes, and 63.3 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite had a design life of 5 years and a mass of {{convert|758|kg}}.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; It broadcast the PRN 04 signal in the GPS demonstration constellation, and was retired from service on 17 July 1985.

'''[[Country calling code|Country Code]]: +90

'''[[Trunk Prefix]]: 0

In [[Northern Cyprus|the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), the [[Telephone numbers in Turkey|Turkish numbering plan]] is in use. Hence the international country code for [[Northern Cyprus]] is also +90. 392 is the area code of all landlines. Mobile Operators, [[Kuzey Kibris Turkcell]] and [[KKTC Telsim]] use 533 and 542 area codes respectively. 

For calls from the [[Republic of Cyprus]] to [[Northern Cyprus]], the code 0139 followed by the 7-digit subscriber number is used, which are charged at local call rates. 0139 is still used for direct calls to [[Northern Cyprus]] even after the numbering plan change of December 2001.

For calls from Northern Cyprus to the Republic of Cyprus, area code 0123 is used but the call is charged at international rates. It is also possible to use the international prefix 00357.

These direct telephone connections between [[Cyprus]] and [[Northern Cyprus]] are operated by the United Nations exchange, which allows direct telephone calls between the two communities and it is in place since 4 May 1998.

After March 2, 2003 direct international calls from [[Northern Cyprus]] to [[Turkey]] are possible and now callers from [[Cyprus]] can call [[Northern Cyprus]] through Turkey by dialling 0090 392 xxxxxxx as well by using 0139 (although in these cases calls will be charged at international rates).

'''Televizija Sarajevo''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Телевизија Сарајево, "Television Sarajevo") is the direct predecessor to today's [[Radio Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a local television network broadcasting a TV channel in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The headquarters was in [[Sarajevo]]. ''Televizija Sarajevo'' was the first Bosnian-Herzegovinian television channel, when it debuted in 1961, although television service in Bosnia and Herzegovina had begun five years earlier.

Televizija Sarajevo merged with the [[M&amp;H Company]] and became [[Radio Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1992. Televizija Sarajevo continued to work as a separate channel in the coming years and is airing still to this date.

It meets once a year to discuss informally the role of [[philanthropy]] and management of Foundations. Founded in 1971, it claims to be independent of governments and to have no political aims.

Foundations with directors currently members of the Club include the [[:fi:Suomen Kulttuurirahasto|Finnish Cultural Foundation]], [[Nobel Foundation]], [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] and the [[Oranje Foundation]].

The [[Saint-Simon Foundation]] was a member of the Hague Club until shortly before it dissolved in 1999.
