'''43''' ('''forty-three''') is the [[natural number]] following [[42 (number)|42]] and preceding [[44 (number)|44]].

== In mathematics ==
Forty-three is the 14th smallest [[prime number]]. The previous is [[forty-one]], with which it comprises a [[twin prime]], and the next is [[47 (number)|forty-seven]]. 43 is the smallest prime that is not a [[Chen prime]]. It is also the third [[Wagstaff prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A000979|2=Wagstaff primes|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

43 is the fourth term of [[Sylvester's sequence]], one more than the product of the previous terms (2 × 3 × 7).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A000058|2=Sylvester's sequence|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

43 is a [[centered heptagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A069099|2=Centered heptagonal numbers|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''a''{{sub|0}} = ''a''{{sub|1}} = 1, and thenceforth ''a''{{sub|''n''}} = {{sfrac|''n'' − 1}}(''a''{{sub|0}}{{sup|2}} + ''a''{{sub|1}}{{sup|2}} + ... + ''a''{{sub|''n'' − 1}}{{sup|2}}). This sequence continues 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 28, 154... {{OEIS|id=A003504}}. ''a''{{sub|43}} is the first term of this sequence that is not an [[integer]].

43 is a [[Heegner number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A003173|2=Heegner numbers|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

43 is the largest prime which dives the order of the [[Janko group J4|Janko group J&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].

43 is a [[repdigit]] in base 6 (111).

43 is the largest natural number that is not a (original) [[McNugget number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A065003|2=Not McNugget numbers|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

43 is the smallest prime number expressible as the sum of 2, 3, 4, or 5 different primes:
*43 = 41 + 2
*43 = 11 + 13 + 19
*43 = 2 + 11 + 13 + 17
*43 = 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 17.

When taking the first six terms of the [[Taylor series]] for computing [[e]], one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{5}\frac{1}{i!}=\frac{163}{60}=2+\frac{43}{60},\ &lt;/math&gt;

which is also [[5 (number)|five]] minus the fifth [[harmonic number]].

Every solvable configuration of [[15 puzzle|the Fifteen puzzle]] can be solved in no more than 43 multi-tile moves (i.e. when moving two or three tiles at once is counted as one move).&lt;ref name="multi-tile"&gt;[http://cubezzz.duckdns.org/drupal/?q=node/view/223 "The Fifteen Puzzle can be solved in 43 "moves""].

'''48''' ('''forty-eight''')  is the [[natural number]] following [[47 (number)|47]] and preceding [[49 (number)|49]]. It is one third of a [[gross (unit)|gross]], or four [[dozen]]s.

== In mathematics ==

'''Forty-eight''' is the [[double factorial]] of [[6 (number)|6]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A006882|title=Sloane's A000165 : Double factorials|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[highly composite number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all other multiples of 6, it is a [[semiperfect number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005835|title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48 is the second 17-[[polygonal number|gonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A051869|title=Sloane's A051869 : 17-gonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

48 is the smallest number with exactly ten divisors.

There are 11 solutions to the equation [[Euler's totient function|&amp;phi;]](''x'') = 48, namely 65, 104, 105, 112, 130, 140, 144, 156, 168, 180 and 210. This is more than any integer below 48, making 48 a [[highly totient number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A097942|title=Sloane's A097942 : Highly totient numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the greatest prime factor of 48&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 2305 is 461, which is clearly more than twice 48, 48 is a [[Størmer number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005528|title=Sloane's A005528 : Størmer numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

48 is a [[Harshad number]] in base 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 24, 2, 12, and 4 as factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8252">In mathematics, the '''ATS theorem''' is the theorem on the '''a'''pproximation of a
[[trigonometric sum|'''t'''rigonometric '''s'''um]] by a shorter one. The application of the ATS theorem in certain problems of mathematical and theoretical physics can be very helpful.

== History of the problem ==

In  some fields of [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical physics]], sums of the form

: &lt;math&gt;
S = \sum_{a&lt;k\le b} \varphi(k)e^{2\pi i f(k)}  \   \   \   (1)
&lt;/math&gt;

are under study.

Here &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; are real valued functions of a real
argument, and &lt;math&gt;i^2= -1.&lt;/math&gt;
Such sums appear, for example, in [[number theory]] in the analysis of the
[[Riemann zeta function]], in the solution of problems connected with
integer points in the domains on plane and in space, in the study of the
[[Fourier series]], and in the solution of such differential equations as the [[wave equation]], the potential equation, the [[Heat equation|heat conductivity]] equation.

The problem of approximation of the series (1) by a suitable function was studied already by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and 
[[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]].

We shall define
'''the length of the sum &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'''
to be the number &lt;math&gt;b-a&lt;/math&gt;  
(for the integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b,&lt;/math&gt; this is the number of the summands in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).

Under certain conditions on &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
the sum &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be
substituted with good accuracy by another sum &lt;math&gt;S_1,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
S_1 = \sum_{\alpha&lt;k\le \beta} \Phi(k)e^{2\pi i F(k)} ,  \   \   \  (2)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the length &lt;math&gt;\beta-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is far less than &lt;math&gt;b-a.&lt;/math&gt;

First relations of the form

: &lt;math&gt;
S = S_1 + R , \  \  \  (3)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S ,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; are the sums (1) and (2) respectively, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is
a remainder term, with concrete functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x),&lt;/math&gt;

In every one of the above-mentioned works,
some restrictions on the functions
&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; were imposed. With
convenient (for applications) restrictions on
&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x),&lt;/math&gt; the theorem was proved by [[Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba|A. A. Karatsuba]] in &lt;ref&gt;A.~A. Karatsuba. Approximation of exponential sums by shorter

''where''

: &lt;math&gt;\{\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;
''is the fractional part of'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

== ATS theorem ==

''Let the real functions'' ''ƒ''(''x'') ''and'' &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfy on the segment'' [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] ''the following conditions:''

1) &lt;math&gt;f''''(x)&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;\varphi''(x)&lt;/math&gt; ''are continuous;''

2) ''there exist numbers''

&lt;/math&gt;

''Then, if we define the numbers'' &lt;math&gt;x_\mu&lt;/math&gt; ''from the equation''

: &lt;math&gt;
f'(x_\mu) = \mu,
&lt;/math&gt;

''we have''

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{a&lt; \mu\le b} \varphi(\mu)e^{2\pi i f(\mu)} = \sum_{f'(a)\le\mu\le

&lt;/math&gt;

''where''

: &lt;math&gt;
R = O
\left(\frac{HU}{b-a} + HT_a + HT_b +
H\log\left(f'(b)-f'(a)+2\right)\right);
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
T_j =
\begin{cases}
0, &amp; \text{if } f'(j) \text{ is an integer}; \\
\min\left(\frac{1}{||f'(j)||}, \sqrt{U}\right), &amp;
\text{if } ||f'(j)|| \ne 0; \\

2}\frac{\varphi(x_{\mu})}{\sqrt{f''(x_{\mu})}}
e^{2\pi i(f(x_{\mu})- \mu x_{\mu})} \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

The most simple variant of the formulated theorem is the statement, which is called in the literature the '''Van der Corput lemma'''.

== Van der Corput lemma ==

''Let'' &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; ''be a real differentiable function in the interval''
&lt;math&gt;a&lt; x \le b ,&lt;/math&gt; ''moreover, inside of this interval, its derivative''
&lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; ''is a monotonic and a sign-preserving function, and for the constant'' &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; ''such that'' &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfies the inequality''
&lt;math&gt;|f'(x)| \leq \delta .&lt;/math&gt; ''Then''

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{a&lt;k\le b} e^{2\pi i f(k)} = \int_a^be^{2\pi i f(x)}dx +
\theta\left(3 + \frac{2\delta}{1-\delta}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

''where'' &lt;math&gt;|\theta| \le 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Remark==

If  the parameters &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are integers, then it is possible to substitute the last relation by the following ones:

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{a&lt;k\le b} e^{2\pi i f(k)} = \int_a^be^{2\pi i f(x)}dx +
\frac12e^{2\pi i f(b)} - \frac12e^{2\pi i f(a)} +
\theta\frac{2\delta}{1-\delta},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|\theta| \le 1.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2775">The '''Boolean Pythagorean triples problem''' is a problem relating to [[Pythagorean triple]]s which was solved using a [[computer-assisted proof]] in May 2016.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Evelyn|date=26 May 2016|title=Two-hundred-terabyte maths proof is largest ever|url=http://www.nature.com/news/two-hundred-terabyte-maths-proof-is-largest-ever-1.19990|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19990|volume=534|pages=17–18|pmid=27251254|bibcode=2016Natur.534...17L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is from [[Ramsey theory]] and asks if it is possible to color each of the positive integers either red or blue, so that no Pythagorean triple of integers ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', satisfying &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt; are all the same color. For example, in the Pythagorean triple 3, 4 and 5 (&lt;math&gt;3^2+4^2=5^2&lt;/math&gt;), if 3 and 4 are colored red, then 5 must be colored blue.

Marijn Heule,  Oliver Kullmann and Victor  Marek investigated the problem, and showed that such a coloring is impossible. Up to the number 7824 it is possible to color the numbers such that all Pythagorean triples are admissible, but the proof shows that no such coloring can be extended to also color the number 7825. The actual statement of the theorem proved is
{{math theorem| The set {1, . . . , 7824} can be partitioned into two parts, such that no part contains a Pythagorean triple, while this is impossible for {1, . . . , 7825}.&lt;ref name="arXiv"/&gt;}}

There are 2&lt;sup&gt;7825&lt;/sup&gt; colorings for the numbers up to [[7825 (number)|7825]]. These possible colorings were logically and algorithmically narrowed down to around a trillion (still highly complex) cases, and those were examined using a [[Boolean satisfiability]] solver. Creating the proof took about 4 years of CPU time over two days on the Stampede supercomputer at the [[Texas Advanced Computing Center]] and generated a 200 terabyte propositional proof, which was compressed to 68 gigabytes.

The paper describing the proof was published on [[arXiv]] on 3 May 2016,&lt;ref  name="arXiv"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heule|first=Marijn J. H.|last2=Kullmann|first2=Oliver|last3=Marek|first3=Victor W.|date=2016-05-03|title=Solving and Verifying the Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem via Cube-and-Conquer |arxiv=1605.00723|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-40970-2_15|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=228–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been accepted for the SAT 2016 conference, where it won the best paper award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sat2016.labri.fr/ SAT 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[Ronald Graham]] offered a $100 prize for the solution of the problem, which has now been awarded to Marijn Heule.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3168">In [[computer science]] and [[quantum physics]], the '''Church–Turing–Deutsch principle''' ('''CTD principle''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|title=Interesting problems: The Church–Turing–Deutsch Principle|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/interesting-problems-the-church-turing-deutsch-principle|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a stronger, physical form of the [[Church&amp;ndash;Turing thesis]] formulated by [[David Deutsch]] in 1985.

==Statement==
The principle states that a [[Turing completeness|universal]] [[computer|computing device]] can [[simulation|simulate]] every [[physical process]].

==History==
The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to [[finitary]] machines and processes.&lt;!-- so who (re)interpreted it in the form stated here? --&gt; He observed that [[classical physics]], which makes use of the concept of [[real number]]s, cannot be simulated by a [[Turing machine]], which can only represent [[computable real]]s. Deutsch proposed that [[quantum computer]]s may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of [[quantum physics]] can completely describe every physical process.

An earlier version of this thesis for classical computers was stated by Alan Turing's friend and student [[Robin Gandy]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, R. (1980).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4138">'''Combinatorial commutative algebra''' is a relatively new, rapidly developing [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline. As the name implies, it lies at the intersection of two more established fields, [[commutative algebra]] and [[combinatorics]], and frequently uses methods of one to address problems arising in the other. Less obviously, [[convex polytope|polyhedral geometry]] plays a significant role.

One of the milestones in the development of the subject was [[Richard P. Stanley|Richard Stanley]]'s 1975 proof of the '''[[Upper Bound Conjecture]]''' for [[simplicial sphere]]s, which was based on earlier work of [[Melvin Hochster]] and Gerald Reisner. While the problem can be formulated purely in geometric terms, the methods of the proof drew on commutative algebra techniques.

A signature theorem in combinatorial commutative algebra is the characterization of [[h-vector|''h''-vectors]] of [[simplicial polytope]]s conjectured in 1970 by [[Peter McMullen]]. Known as the [[g-theorem|''g''-theorem]], it was proved in 1979 by Stanley ([[Necessity and sufficiency|necessity]] of the conditions, algebraic argument) and by [[Louis Billera]] and Carl W. Lee ([[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficiency]], combinatorial and geometric construction). A major open question is the extension of this characterization from simplicial polytopes to simplicial spheres, the [[g-conjecture|''g''-conjecture]].

== Important notions of combinatorial commutative algebra ==

* Square-free '''[[monomial ideal]]''' in a [[polynomial ring]] and [[Stanley–Reisner ring]] of a [[simplicial complex]].
* [[Cohen–Macaulay ring]].
* '''[[Monomial ring]]''', closely related to an '''affine semigroup ring''' and to the [[coordinate ring]] of an [[affine algebraic variety|affine]] [[toric variety]].
* '''Algebra with a straightening law'''. There are several version of those, including '''Hodge algebras''' of [[Corrado de Concini]],  [[David Eisenbud]], and [[Claudio Procesi]].

'''Compartmental modelling of dendrites''' deals with [[multi-compartment model]]ling of the [[dendrite]]s, to make the understanding of the electrical behavior of complex dendrites easier. Basically, compartmental modelling of dendrites is a very helpful tool to develop new [[biological neuron model]]s. Dendrites are very important because they occupy the most membrane area in many of the neurons and give the neuron an ability to connect to thousands of other cells. Originally the dendrites were thought to have constant [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] and [[Electric current|current]] but now it has been understood that they may have active [[Voltage-gated ion channel]]s, which influences the firing properties of the neuron and also the response of [[neuron]] to [[Synapse|synaptic]] inputs.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ermentrout|first=Bard|title=Mathematical Foundations of Neuroscience|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-87707-5|pages=29–45|author2=Terman H. David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematical models have been developed to understand the electric behavior of the dendrites. Dendrites tend to be very branchy and complex, so the compartmental approach to understand the electrical behavior of the dendrites makes it very useful.

==Introduction==
* Compartmental modelling is a very natural way of modelling dynamical systems that have certain inherent properties with conservation principles. The compartmental modelling is an elegant way, a state space formulation to elegantly capture the dynamical systems that are governed by the conservation laws. Whether it is the conservation of mass, energy, fluid flow or information flow. Basically, they are models whose [[state variables]] tend to be [[non-negative]] (such as mass, concentrations, energy). So the equations for mass balance, energy, concentration or fluid flow can be written. It ultimately goes down to networks in which the brain is the largest of them all, just like [[Avogadro number]], very large amount of molecules that are interconnected. The brain has very interesting interconnections. On a microscopic level [[thermodynamics]] is virtually impossible to understand but from a [[macroscopic]] view we see that these follow some universal laws. In the same way brain has numerous interconnections, which is almost impossible to write a [[differential equation]] for. (These words were said in an interview by [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/people/whaddad/ Dr. Wassim Haddad] )
* General observations about how the brain functions can be made by looking at the first and second [[thermodynamic laws]], which are universal laws. [[Brain]] is a very large-scale interconnected system; the [[neurons]] have to somehow behave like the chemical reaction system, so, it has to somehow obey the chemical thermodynamic laws. This approach may lead to more generalized model of brain. (These words were said in an interview by [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/people/whaddad/ Dr. Wassim Haddad] )

==Multiple compartments ==
[[File:Dendrites Modelling.jpg|thumb|a) Branched dendrites viewed as cylinders for modelling. b) Simple model with three compartments]]

* Complicated dendritic structures can be treated as multiple compartments interconnected. The dendrites are divided into small compartments and they are linked together as shown in the figure.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;
* It is assumed that the compartment is isopotential and spatially uniform in its properties. Membrane non-uniformity such as diameter changes, and voltage differences are occurred in between the compartments but not inside them.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;
* An example of a simple two-compartment model:
Consider a two-compartmental model with the compartments viewed as isopotential cylinders with radius &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt; L_i &lt;/math&gt;. 
:&lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane potential of ith compartment.
:&lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the specific membrane capacitance.
:&lt;math&gt;r_{Mi}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific membrane resistivity.
:The total electrode current, assuming that the compartment has it, is given by &lt;math&gt;I^i_{electrode}&lt;/math&gt;.
:The longitudinal resistance is given by &lt;math&gt;r_L&lt;/math&gt;.
:Now according to the balance that should exist for each compartment, we can say
:  &lt;math&gt;  i^i_{cap} + i^i_{ion} = i^i_{long} + i^i_{electrode}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(1)
: Where &lt;math&gt; i^i_{cap}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^i_{ion}&lt;/math&gt; are the capacitive and ionic currents per unit area of ith compartment membrane. i.e. they can be given by
: &lt;math&gt; i^i_{cap} = c_i \frac{dV_i}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^i_{ion} = \frac{V_i}{r_{Mi}}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(2)
: If we assume the resting potential is 0. Then to compute &lt;math&gt;i^i_{long}&lt;/math&gt;, we need total axial resistance. As the compartments are simply cylinders we can say
: &lt;math&gt;R_{long} = \frac{r_LL_1}{2 \pi a_1^2} + \frac{r_LL_2}{2 \pi a_2^2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(3)
: Using ohms law we can express current from ith to jth compartment as
: &lt;math&gt; i^1_{long} = g_{1,2}(V_2-V_1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^2_{long} = g_{2,1}(V_1-V_2) &lt;/math&gt; .....eq(4)
: The coupling terms &lt;math&gt; g_{1,2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g_{2,1} &lt;/math&gt; are obtained by inverting eq(3) and dividing by surface area of interest.
: So we get,
: &lt;math&gt;g_{1,2} = \frac{a_1a_2^2}{r_LL_1(a_2^2L_1+a_1^2L_2)} &lt;/math&gt;
: and
: &lt;math&gt;g_{2,1} = \frac{a_2a_1^2}{r_LL_1(a_1^2L_2+a_2^2L_1)} &lt;/math&gt;
: Finally, &lt;math&gt; i_{electrode}^I = \frac {I_{electrode}^i}{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; A_i = 2 \pi a_iL_i &lt;/math&gt; is the surface area of the compartment i.
: If we put all these together we get
: &lt;math&gt; c_1 \frac{dV_1}{dt} + \frac{V_1}{r_{M1}} = g_{1,2}(V_2 - V_1) + \frac {I_{electrode}^1}{A_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c_2 \frac{dV_2}{dt} + \frac{V_2}{r_{M2}} = g_{2,1}(V_1 - V_2) + \frac {I_{electrode}^2}{A_2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(5)
: If we use &lt;math&gt; r_1 = 1/g_{1,2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r_2 = 1/g_{2,1} &lt;/math&gt; then eq(5) will become
: &lt;math&gt; c_1 \frac{dV_1}{dt} + \frac{V_1}{r_{M1}} = \frac {V_2 - V_1}{r_1} + \frac {I_{electrode}^1}{A_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c_2 \frac{dV_2}{dt} + \frac{V_2}{r_{M2}} = \frac {V_1 - V_2}{r_2}  + \frac {I_{electrode}^2}{A_2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(6)

: Now if we inject current in cell 1 only and each cylinder is identical then &lt;math&gt; r_1 = r_2 \equiv r &lt;/math&gt;
: Without loss in generality we can define &lt;math&gt; r_M = r_{M1} = r_{M2} &lt;/math&gt;
:After some algebra we can show that
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{V_1}{i_1} = \frac {r_M(r+r_M)}{r+2r_M} &lt;/math&gt;
: also
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{R_{input,coupled}}{R_{input,uncoupled}} = 1- \frac{r_M}{r+2r_M} &lt;/math&gt;
: i.e. the input resistance decreases. For increment in the potential, coupled system current should be greater than that is required for uncoupled system. This is because the second compartment drains some current.
: Now, we can get a general compartmental model for a treelike structure and the equations are
: &lt;math&gt; C_j \frac{dV_j}{dt} = - \frac{V_j}{R_j} + \sum_{k connected j}{} \frac{V_k - V_j}{R_{jk}}+I_j &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;

===Increased computational accuracy in multi-compartmental cable models===

* Input at the center
Each dendridic section is subdivided into segments, which are typically seen as uniform circular cylinders or tapered circular cylinders. In the traditional compartmental model, point process location is determined only to an accuracy of half segment length. This will make the model solution particularly sensitive to segment boundaries. The accuracy of the traditional approach for this reason is [[Big O notation|O]](1/n) when a point current and synaptic input is present. Usually the trans-membrane current where the membrane potential is known is represented in the model at points, or nodes and is assumed to be at the center. The new approach partitions the effect of the input by distributing it to the boundaries of the segment. Hence any input is partitioned between the nodes at the proximal and distal boundaries of the segment. Therefore, this procedure makes sure that the solution obtained is not sensitive to small changes in location of these boundaries because it affects how the input is partitioned between the nodes. When these compartments are connected with continuous potentials and conservation of current at segment boundaries then a new compartmental model of a new mathematical form is obtained. This new approach also provides a model identical to the traditional model but an order more accurate. This model increases the accuracy and precision by an order of magnitude than that is achieved by point process input.&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt;

==Cable Theory==
{{Main|Cable theory}}
Dendrites and axons are considered to be continuous (cable-like), rather than series of compartments.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;

==Some applications==

=== Information processing ===

* A theoretical framework along with a technological platform are provided by [[computational model]]s to enhance the understanding of [[nervous system]] functions. There was a lot of advancement in the [[molecular]] and [[biophysical]] mechanisms underlying the neuronal activity. The same kind of advances have to be made in understanding the structure-functional relationship and rules followed by the information processing.&lt;ref name = "Information Processing"&gt;Poirazi, P. (2009). Information Processing in Single Cells and Small Networks: Insights from Compartmental Models. In G. Maroulis &amp; T. E. Simos (Eds.), Computational Methods in Science and Engineering, Vol 1 (Vol. 1108, pp. 158–167).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Previously a neuron used to be thought as a transistor. However, it is shown recently that morphology and ionic composition of different neurons provide the cell with enhanced computational capabilities. These abilities are far more advanced than those captured by a point neuron.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
* Some findings:
** Different outputs given by the individual apical [[oblique dendrite]]s of [http://www-lnc.usc.edu/CA1-pyramidal-cell-model/ CA1 pyramidal neurons] are linearly combined in the cell body. The outputs that come from these dendrites actually behave like individual computational units that use [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] activation function to combine inputs.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** The thin dendritic branches each act as a typical point neuron, which are capable of combining the incoming signals according to the [[Threshold potential|threshold]]ing [[non-linearity]].&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Considering the accuracy in prediction of different input patterns by a two-layer [[artificial neural network|neural network]], it is assumed that a simple mathematical equation can be used to describe the model. This allows the development of network models in which each neuron, instead of being modelled as a full blown compartmental cell, it is modelled as a simplified two layer neural network.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** The firing pattern of the cell might contain the temporal information about incoming signals. For example, the delay between the two simulated pathways.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Single CA1 has a capability of encoding and transmitting spatio-temporal information on the incoming signals to the recipient cell.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Calcium-activated nonspecific cationic ([[Calcium-activated nonspecific cationic|CAN]]) mechanism is needed for giving constant activity and the synaptic [[stimulation]] alone does not induce persistent activity using the increasing conductance of [[NMDA]] mechanism. NMDA/ [[AMPA]] positively expands the range of persistent activity and negatively regulates the amount of CAN needed for constant activity.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;

=== Midbrain dopaminergic neuron===

* [[:wikt:movement|Movement]], [[motivation]], [[attention]], neurological and [[psychiatric disorders]] and addictive behavior have a strong influence by [[Dopaminergic]] signalling.&lt;ref name = "Midbrain neuron"&gt;Kuznetsova, A. Y., Huertas, M. A., Kuznetsov, A. S., Paladini, C. A., &amp; Canavier, C. C. (2010). Regulation of firing frequency in a computational model of a midbrain dopaminergic neuron. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 28(3), 389–403.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The dopaminergic neurons have a low irregular basal firing frequency in 1–8&amp;nbsp;Hz range ''in vivo'' in the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and [[substantia nigra pars compacta]] (SNc). This frequencies can dramatically increase in response to a cue predicting reward or unpredicted reward. The actions that preceded the reward are reinforced by this burst or phasic signal.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;
* The low safety factor for action potential generation gives a result of low maximal steady frequencies. The transient initial frequency in response to depolarizing pulse is controlled by rate of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation in distal dendrites.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;
* Results obtained from a mulch-compartmental model realistic with reconstructed morphology were similar. So, the salient contributions of the dendritic architecture have been captures by simpler model.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;

===Mode locking ===

* There are many important applications in neuroscience for [[Mode-locking]] response of excitable systems to periodic forcing. For example, The theta rhythm drives the spatially extended place cells in the [[hippocampus]] to generate a code giving information about spatial location. The role of neuronal dentrites in generating the response to periodic current injection can be explored by using a compartmental model (with linear dynamics for each compartment) coupled to an active soma model that generates action potentials.&lt;ref name = "Mode Locking"&gt;Svensson, C. M., &amp; Coombes, S. (2009). MODE LOCKING IN A SPATIALLY EXTENDED NEURON MODEL: ACTIVE SOMA AND COMPARTMENTAL TREE. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 19(8), 2597–2607.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some findings:
** The response of whole neuron model i.e. soma and dendrites, can be written in closed form. The response of the spatially extended model to periodic forcing is described by [[Poincaré map|stroboscopic map]]. A [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArnoldTongue.html Arnol'd tongue] [[quasi-active]] model can be constructed with a [[linear stability]] [[analysis]] of the map with carefully treating the non-[[differentiability]] of [[soma (biology)|soma]] model.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The shape of the tongues is influenced by the presence of the quasi-active membrane.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The windows in parameter space for chaotic behavior can be enlarged with the resonant dendritic membrane.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The response of the spatially extended neuron model to global forcing is different from that of point forcing.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;

===Compartmental neural simulations with spatial adaptivity===

* The computational cost of the method scales not with the physical size of the system being simulated but with the amount of activity present in the simulation. Spatial adaptivity for certain problems reduces up to 80%.&lt;ref name = "Compartmental neural simulations"&gt;Rempe, M. J., Spruston, N., Kath, W. L., &amp; Chopp, D. L. (2008). Compartmental neural simulations with spatial adaptivity. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 25(3), 465–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action potential (AP) initiation site===
* Establishing a unique site for AP initiation at the axon initial segment is no longer accepted. The APs can be initiated and comdected by different sub-regions of the neuron morphology, which widened the capabilities of individual neurons in computation.&lt;ref name = "axosomatodendritic"&gt;Ibarz, J.

** The initiation site can also be determined by the average electrical distance from the dendritic input to the axon trigger zone, but it may be strongly modulated by the relative excitability of the two trigger zones and a number of factors.&lt;ref name=axosomatodendritic /&gt;

[[File:quadrilateral_congruence.png|thumb|300px|The orange and green quadrilaterals are congruent; the blue one is not congruent to them. Congruence between the orange and green ones is established by the facts that side BC corresponds to (in this case of congruence, equals in length) JK, CD corresponds to KL, DA corresponds to LI, and AB corresponds to IJ, while angle C corresponds to (equals) angle K, D corresponds to L, A corresponds to I, and B corresponds to J.]]

In [[geometry]], the tests for [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]] and [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] involve comparing '''corresponding sides''' and '''corresponding angles''' of [[polygon]]s. In these tests, each [[edge (geometry)|side]] and each [[angle]] in one polygon is paired with a side or angle in the second polygon, taking care to preserve the order of adjacency. 

For example, if one polygon has sequential sides ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', and ''e'' and the other has sequential sides   ''v'', ''w'', ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and if ''b'' and ''w'' are corresponding sides, then side ''a'' (adjacent to ''b'') must correspond to either ''v'' or ''x'' (both adjacent to ''w''). If ''a'' and ''v'' correspond to each other, then ''c'' corresponds to ''x'', ''d'' corresponds to ''y'', and ''e'' corresponds to ''z''; hence the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of the sequence ''abcde'' corresponds to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of the sequence ''vwxyz'' for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5. On the other hand, if in addition to ''b'' corresponding to ''w'' we have ''c'' corresponding to ''v'', then the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of ''abcde'' corresponds to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of the reverse sequence ''xwvzy''.

Congruence tests look for all pairs of corresponding sides to be equal in length, though except in the case of the [[triangle]] this is not sufficient to establish congruence (as exemplified by a [[square]] and a [[rhombus]] that have the same side length).  Similarity tests look at whether the [[ratio]]s of the lengths of each pair of corresponding sides are equal, though again this is not sufficient. In either case equality of corresponding angles is also necessary; equality (or proportionality) of corresponding sides combined with equality of corresponding angles is necessary and sufficient for congruence (or similarity). The corresponding angles as well as the corresponding sides are defined as appearing in the same sequence, so for example if in a polygon with the side sequence ''abcde'' and another with the corresponding side sequence ''vwxyz'' we have vertex angle ''A'' appearing between sides ''a'' and ''b'' then its corresponding vertex angle ''V'' must appear between sides ''v'' and  ''w''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">In [[crystallography]], a '''crystallographic point group''' is a set of [[symmetry operation]]s, like rotations or reflections, that leave a central point fixed while moving other directions and faces of the [[crystal]] to the positions of features of the same kind. For a periodic crystal (as opposed to a [[quasicrystal]]), the group must also be consistent with maintenance of the three-dimensional [[translational symmetry]] that defines crystallinity. The macroscopic properties of a crystal would look exactly the same before and after any of the operations in its point group. In the classification of crystals, each point group is also known as a '''crystal class'''.

There are infinitely many three-dimensional point groups. However, the [[crystallographic restriction theorem|crystallographic restriction]] of the infinite families of general [[point group]]s results in there being only 32 crystallographic point groups. These 32 point groups are one-and-the same as the 32 types of morphological (external) crystalline symmetries derived in 1830 by [[Johann F. C. Hessel|Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel]] from a consideration of observed crystal forms. 

The point group of a crystal, among other things, determines directional variation of the physical properties that arise from its structure, including [[crystal optics|optical properties]] such as whether it is [[birefringence|birefringent]], or whether it shows the [[Pockels effect]].

==Notation==

The point groups are denoted by their component symmetries. There are a few standard notations used by crystallographers, [[mineralogist]]s, and [[physicists]].

For the correspondence of the two systems below, see '''[[crystal system]]'''.

===Schoenflies notation===
{{main|Schoenflies notation}}
{{details|Point groups in three dimensions}}

In [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies|Schoenflies]] notation, point groups are denoted by a letter symbol with a subscript. The symbols used in crystallography mean the following:

*''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[cyclic group|cyclic]]) indicates that the group has an ''n''-fold rotation axis. ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the [[axis of rotation]]. ''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of n mirror planes parallel to the axis of rotation.
*''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for ''Spiegel'', German for [[mirror]]) denotes a group that contains only a ''2n''-fold [[Improper rotation|rotation-reflection axis]].
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[dihedral group|dihedral]], or two-sided) indicates that the group has an ''n''-fold rotation axis plus ''n'' twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. ''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition, a mirror plane perpendicular to the ''n''-fold axis. ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition to the elements of ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', mirror planes parallel to the ''n''-fold axis.
*The letter ''T'' (for [[tetrahedron]]) indicates that the group has the symmetry of a tetrahedron. ''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes improper rotation operations, ''T'' excludes improper rotation operations, and ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''T'' with the addition of an inversion.
*The letter ''O'' (for [[octahedron]]) indicates that the group has the symmetry of an octahedron (or [[cube]]), with (''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') or without (''O'') improper operations (those that change handedness).

Due to the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 in 2- or 3-dimensional space.

''D&lt;sub&gt;4d&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''D&lt;sub&gt;6d&lt;/sub&gt;'' are actually forbidden because they contain [[improper rotation]]s with n=8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus ''T'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''O'' and ''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' constitute 32 crystallographic point groups.

In [[classical logic]], '''disjunctive syllogism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Copi |first=Irving M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |title=Introduction to Logic |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |page=362 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |last=Hurley |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=320–1 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (historically known as '''''modus tollendo ponens''''' ('''MTP'''),&lt;ref&gt;[[E. J. Lemmon|Lemmon, Edward John]]. 2001. ''Beginning Logic''. [[Taylor and Francis]]/CRC Press, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "mode that affirms by denying")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stone |first=Jon R. |year=1996 |title=Latin for the Illiterati: Exorcizing the Ghosts of a Dead Language |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-91775-1 |page=60 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6_KRzXsnKIC&amp;pg=PA60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[logical form|argument form]]  which is a [[syllogism]] having a [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive statement]] for one of its [[premise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;

An example in [[English language|English]]:
:The breach is a safety violation, or it is not subject to fines.
:The breach is not a safety violation.
:Therefore, it is not subject to fines.

==Propositional logic==
In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], '''disjunctive syllogism''' (also known as '''disjunction elimination''' and '''or elimination''', or abbreviated '''∨E'''),&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, David Hawley. 2003. ''If P, Then Q: Conditionals and the Foundations of Reasoning''. London, UK: Routledge: 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt; is a valid [[rule of inference]]. If we are told that at least one of two statements is true; and also told that it is not the former that is true; we can [[inference|infer]] that it has to be the latter that is true. If ''P'' is true or ''Q'' is true and ''P'' is false, then ''Q'' is true. The reason this is called "disjunctive syllogism" is that, first, it is a syllogism, a three-step [[argument]], and second, it contains a logical disjunction, which simply means an  "or" statement.  "P or Q" is a disjunction; P and Q are called the statement's ''disjuncts''.  The rule makes it possible to eliminate a [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] from a [[formal proof|logical proof]]. It is the rule that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \lor Q, \neg P}{\therefore Q}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that whenever instances of "&lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

Disjunctive syllogism is closely related and similar to [[hypothetical syllogism]], in that it is also type of syllogism, and also the name of a rule of inference. It is also related to the [[law of noncontradiction]], one of the [[Law of thought#Three traditional laws: identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle|three traditional laws of thought]].

== Formal notation ==
The ''disjunctive syllogism'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt; P \lor Q, \lnot P \vdash Q &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lnot P&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt; ((P \lor Q) \land \neg P) \to Q&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

== Natural language examples ==
Here is an example:
:I will choose soup or I will choose salad.
:I will not choose soup.
:Therefore, I will choose salad.

Here is another example:
:It is red or it is blue.
:It is not blue.
:Therefore, it is red.

== Inclusive and exclusive disjunction ==
Please observe that the disjunctive syllogism works whether 'or' is considered 'exclusive' or 'inclusive' disjunction. See below for the definitions of these terms.

There are two kinds of logical disjunction:

* ''[[logical disjunction|inclusive]]'' means "and/or"  - at least one of them is true, or maybe both.
* ''[[Exclusive or|exclusive]]'' ("xor") means exactly one must be true, but they cannot both be.

The widely used English language concept of ''or'' is often ambiguous between these two meanings, but the difference is pivotal in evaluating disjunctive arguments.

This argument:
:P or Q.
:Not P.
:Therefore, Q.

is valid and indifferent between both meanings. However, only in the ''exclusive'' meaning is the following form valid:

:Either (only) P or (only) Q.
:P.
:Therefore, not Q.

However, if the fact is true it does not commit the fallacy.

With the ''inclusive'' meaning you could draw no conclusion from the first two premises of that argument. See [[affirming a disjunct]].

==Related argument forms==
Unlike ''[[modus ponendo ponens]]'' and ''[[modus ponendo tollens]]'', with which it should not be confused, disjunctive syllogism is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of [[logical system]]s, as the above arguments can be proven with a (slightly devious) combination of [[reductio ad absurdum]] and [[disjunction elimination]].

Other forms of syllogism include:
*[[hypothetical syllogism]]
*[[categorical syllogism]]

Disjunctive syllogism holds in classical propositional logic and [[intuitionistic logic]], but not in some [[paraconsistent logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mortensen, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-inconsistent/ Inconsistent Mathematics], ''Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy'', First published Tue Jul 2, 1996; substantive revision Thu Jul 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1974">'''Duration calculus''' ('''DC''') is an [[interval logic]] for [[real-time computing|real-time systems]]. It was originally developed by [[Zhou Chaochen]] with the help of [[Anders P. Ravn]] and [[C. A. R. Hoare]] on the European [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology|ESPRIT]] [[Basic Research Action]] (BRA) ''ProCoS'' project on ''Provably Correct Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zhou Chaochen]], [[C. A. R. Hoare]] and [[Anders P. Ravn]], A Calculus of Durations, ''[[Information Processing Letters]]'', 40(5):269–276, December 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zhou Chaochen]] and [[Michael R. Hansen]], ''Duration Calculus: A Formal Approach to Real-Time Systems''. [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]], Monographs in Theoretical Computer Science, An [[EATCS]] Series, 2003. {{ISBN|3-540-40823-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DC is mainly useful at the [[requirements]] level of the [[software development]] process for real-time systems. Some tools are available (e.g., DCVALID,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~pandya/dcvalid.html DCVALID: A tool for model-checking Duration Calculus formulae], [[TIFR]], India.&lt;/ref&gt; IDLVALID,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~pandya/idlvalid.html IDLVALID: Model checking dense time Duration Calculus formulae], TIFR, India.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). Subsets of Duration Calculus have been studied (e.g., using discrete time rather than continuous time). DC is especially espoused by [[UNU-IIST]] in [[Macau]] and the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in [[Mumbai]], which are major centres of excellence for the approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3553">In mathematical [[representation theory]], the '''Eisenstein integral''' is an integral introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Harish-Chandra|authorlink=Harish-Chandra|year1=1970|year2=1972}} in the representation theory of semisimple [[Lie group]]s, analogous to [[Eisenstein series]] in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s.
{{harvs|txt|last=Harish-Chandra|year1=1975|year2=1976a|year3=1976b}} used Eisenstein integrals to decompose the regular representation of a semisimple Lie group into representations induced from parabolic subgroups. 
{{harvtxt|Trombi|1989}} gave a survey of Harish-Chandra's work on this.

==Definition==

{{harvtxt|Harish-Chandra|1970|loc=section 10}} defined the Eisenstein integral  by
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E(P:\psi:\nu:x) = \int_K\psi(xk)\tau(k^{-1})\exp((i\nu-\rho_P)H_P(xk)) \, dk&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*''x'' is an element of a semisimple group ''G''
*''P'' = ''MAN'' is a cuspidal parabolic subgroup of ''G''
*ν is an element of the complexification of ''a''
*''a'' is the Lie algebra of ''A'' in the [[Langlands decomposition]] ''P'' = ''MAN''.
*''K'' is a maximal compact subgroup of ''G'', with ''G'' = ''KP''.
*ψ is a cuspidal function on ''M'', satisfying some extra conditions
*τ is a finite-dimensional unitary double representation of ''K''
*''H''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = log ''a'' where ''x'' = ''kman'' is the decomposition of ''x'' in ''G'' = ''KMAN''.

EIDORS is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] software tool box written mainly in [[MATLAB]]/[[GNU Octave]] designed primarily for image reconstruction from [[electrical impedance tomography]](EIT) data, in a biomedical, [[Industrial process imaging|industrial]] or [[electrical resistivity tomography|geophysical]] setting. The name was originally an acronym for Electrical Impedance Tomography and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software. While the name reflects the original intention to cover image reconstruction of data from the mathematically similar near infra red [[diffuse optical imaging]], to date there has been little development in that area.

The project was launched in 1999 &lt;ref name="WCIPT1999"&gt;W R B Lionheart, S R Arridge, M Schweiger, M Vauhkonen and J P Kaipio, Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Tomography Reconstruction Software, Proceedings of the 1st World Congress on Industrial Process Tomography, pp&amp;nbsp;474–477, Buxton, Derbyshire, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; with a Matlab code for 2D EIT reconstruction which had its origin in the PhD thesis of Marko Vauhkonen and the work of his supervisor Jari Kaipio at the [[University of Kuopio]].  While Kuopio also developed a three dimensional EIT code &lt;ref&gt;Vauhkonen, P. J., Vauhkonen, M., Savolainen, T., &amp; Kaipio, J. P. (1999). Three-dimensional electrical impedance tomography based on the complete electrode model. Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 46(9), 1150–1160.&lt;/ref&gt; this was not released as open-source.  Instead the three dimensional version of EIDORS was developed from work done at [[UMIST]] (now [[University of Manchester]]) by Nick Polydorides and William Lionheart.&lt;ref&gt;

==Methods and models==
The forward models in EIDORS use the [[finite element method]] and this requires mesh generation for sometimes irregular objects (such as human bodies), and the meshing needs to reflect the electrodes used to drive and measure current in EIT.  For this purpose an interface was developed to the Netgen Mesh Generator.

==History==
As the project grew there was a desire to incorporate forward modelling and reconstruction code from a variety of groups and Andy Adler and Lionheart developed a more extensible software system.&lt;ref&gt;A Adler and W R B Lionheart, Uses and abuses of EIDORS: An extensible software base for EIT, Physiol Meas 27, S25–S42, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent version is 3.8, released in May, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Adler, Alistair Boyle, Michael G Crabb, Hervé Gagnon, Bartłomiej Grychtol, Nolwenn Lesparre, William R.B.

The EIDORS project also includes a repository of EIT data distributed under open-source licenses.

==Applications==
EIDORS has been extensively used in biomedical applications of EIT, including lung imaging,&lt;ref name="Biguri"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=A. Biguri |author2=B. Grychtol |author3=A. Adler |author4=M.

The rule allows [[material conditional|conditional statement]]s having [[Logical conjunction|conjunctive]] [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]s to be replaced by statements having conditional [[consequent]]s and vice versa in [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. It is the rule that:

&lt;math&gt;((P \land Q) \to R) \Leftrightarrow (P \to (Q \to R))&lt;/math&gt;

Where "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;" is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing "can be replaced in a proof with."

== Formal notation ==
The ''exportation'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt;((P \land Q) \to R) \dashv\vdash (P \to (Q \to R))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dashv\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a metalogical symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;(P \to (Q \to R))&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Logical equivalence|syntactic equivalent]] of &lt;math&gt;((P \land Q) \to R)&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

or in [[inference rule|rule form]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(P \land Q) \to R}{P \to (Q \to R)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to (Q \to R)}{(P \land Q) \to R}.&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \to R&lt;/math&gt;" appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "&lt;math&gt;P \to (Q \to R)&lt;/math&gt;" and vice versa;

or as the statement of a truth-functional [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;((P \land Q) \to R) \leftrightarrow (P \to (Q \to R))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[logical system]].

== Natural language ==

=== Truth values ===
At any time, if P→Q is true, it can be replaced by P→(P∧Q). &lt;br&gt;
One possible case for P→Q is for P to be true and Q to be true; thus P∧Q is also true, and P→(P∧Q) is true. &lt;br&gt; 
Another possible case sets P as false and Q as true. Thus, P∧Q is false and P→(P∧Q) is false; false→false is true. &lt;br&gt;
The last case occurs when both P and Q are false. Thus, P∧Q is false and P→(P∧Q) is true.

=== Example ===
It rains and the sun shines implies that there is a rainbow. &lt;br&gt;
Thus, if it rains, then the sun shines implies that there is a rainbow.

== Proof == 
The following proof uses [[Material_implication_(rule_of_inference)|Material Implication]], [[double negation]], [[De_Morgan's_laws|De Morgan's Laws]], the negation of the conditional statement, the [[Associative_property|Associative Property]] of conjunction, the negation of another conditional statement, and double negation again, in that order to derive the result.

In [[accounting]], a '''financial condition report''' (FCR) is a report on the [[solvency]] condition of an [[insurance company]] that takes into account both the current financial status, as reflected in the [[balance sheet]], and an assessment of the ability of the company to survive future risk scenarios.&lt;ref name=TheActuary020409&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial condition reporting where now?|url=http://www.theactuary.com/archive/old-articles/part-3/financial-condition-reporting-where-now-3F/|publisher=TheActuary.com|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Risk assessment]] in a FCR involves ''dynamic solvency testing'', a type of [[dynamic financial analysis]] that simulates management response to risk scenarios, to test whether a company could remain solvent in the face of deteriorating economic conditions or major disasters. Dynamic solvency testing may involve both ''deterministic projections'', based on known risks, and ''stochastic projections'' that include random risk events.

FCRs are a part of the statutory reporting requirements for life insurance companies in Pakistan, Australia, Ghana and non-life insurance companies in Canada.&lt;ref name=TheActuary020409/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finnis041201&gt;{{cite web|last=Finnis|first=Dave|title=Financial condition reporting|url=http://www.theactuary.com/archive/old-articles/part-3/financial-condition-reporting/|publisher=TheActuary.com|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FCRs are also required in the UK under the ''Financial Services and Markets Act'' of 2000&lt;ref name=GN2&gt;{{cite web|title=GN2: Financial Condition Reports|url=https://www.frc.org.uk/FRC-Documents/BAS/GN02-Financial-Condition-Reports-V1-1.pdf|publisher=The Financial Reporting Council|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ireland.&lt;ref name=IFSRA2009&gt;{{cite web|title=GUIDELINES ON ACTUARIAL  FINANCIAL CONDITION  REPORTS (FCR) FROM LIFE  ASSURANCE COMPANIES|url=http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/insurance-companies/documents/guidance%20on%20fcr's.pdf|publisher=Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many consider FCRs a type of [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] report, they can also be useful for corporate management to identify weaknesses in risk strategy, to test [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] of risk through, e.g., [[reinsurance]], and to set fair market pricing for [[option (finance)|option]]s.&lt;ref name=TheActuary020409/&gt;&lt;ref name=TF&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Condition Reports|url=http://www.taylorfry.com.au/services/actuarial/financial-condition-reports/|publisher=Taylor Fry|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10545">In [[mathematics]], a '''Fuchsian group''' is a [[Discrete group|discrete  subgroup]] of [[PSL(2,R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]]. The group PSL(2,'''R''') can be regarded as a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]], or [[conformal transformation]]s of the unit disc, or conformal transformations of the [[upper half plane]], so a Fuchsian group can be regarded as a group acting on any of these spaces. There are some variations of the definition: sometimes the Fuchsian group is assumed to be [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]], sometimes it is allowed to be a subgroup of PGL(2,'''R''') (so that it contains orientation-reversing elements), and sometimes it is allowed to be a [[Kleinian group]] (a discrete group of [[PSL2(C)|PSL(2,'''C''')]]) that is conjugate to a subgroup of PSL(2,'''R''').

Fuchsian groups are used to create [[Fuchsian model]]s of [[Riemann surface]]s. In this case, the group may be called the '''Fuchsian group of the surface'''. In some sense, Fuchsian groups do for [[non-Euclidean geometry]] what [[crystallographic group]]s do for [[Euclidean geometry]]. Some [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] graphics are based on them (for the ''disc model'' of hyperbolic geometry).

General Fuchsian groups were first studied by {{harvs|txt|last=Poincaré|first=Henri|authorlink=Henri Poincaré|year=1882}}, who was motivated by the paper {{Harvard citation|Fuchs|1880}}, and therefore named them after [[Lazarus Fuchs]].

== Fuchsian groups on the upper half-plane ==
Let '''H''' = {''z'' in '''C''' : Im(''z'') &gt; 0} be the [[upper half-plane]]. Then '''H''' is a model of the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] when endowed with the metric

:&lt;math&gt;ds=\frac{1}{y}\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The group [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]] [[group action|acts]] on '''H''' by [[linear fractional transformations]] (also known as [[Möbius transformation]]s):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}\cdot z = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}.&lt;/math&gt;

This action is faithful, and in fact PSL(2,'''R''') is isomorphic to the group of all [[orientable|orientation-preserving]] [[isometry|isometries]] of '''H'''.

A Fuchsian group Γ may be defined to be a subgroup of PSL(2,'''R'''), which acts '''discontinuously''' on '''H'''.  That is,

* For every ''z'' in '''H''', the [[group action|orbit]] Γ''z'' = {γ''z'' : γ in Γ} has no [[accumulation point]] in '''H'''.

An equivalent definition for Γ to be Fuchsian is that Γ be a '''[[discrete group]]''', which means that:

* Every sequence {γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} of elements of Γ converging to the identity in the usual topology of point-wise convergence is eventually constant, i.e. there exists an integer ''N'' such that for all ''n'' &gt; ''N'', γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = I, where I is the identity matrix.

Although discontinuity and discreteness are equivalent in this case, this is not generally true for the case of an arbitrary group of conformal homeomorphisms acting on the full Riemann sphere (as opposed to '''H''').  Indeed, the Fuchsian group PSL(2,'''Z''') is discrete but has accumulation points on the real number line Im&amp;nbsp;''z'' = 0: elements of PSL(2,'''Z''') will carry ''z'' = 0 to every rational number, and the rationals '''Q''' are [[dense set|dense]] in '''R'''.

== General definition ==
A linear fractional transformation defined by a matrix from PSL(2,'''C''') will preserve the [[Riemann sphere]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''C''') = '''C''' ∪ ∞, but will send the upper-half plane '''H''' to some open disk Δ. Conjugating by such a transformation will send a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,'''R''') to a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,'''C''') preserving Δ.

This motivates the following definition of a '''Fuchsian group'''. Let Γ ⊂ PSL(2,'''C''') act invariantly on a proper, [[open set|open]] disk Δ ⊂ '''C''' ∪ ∞, that is, Γ(Δ) = Δ. Then Γ is '''Fuchsian''' if and only if any of the following three equivalent properties hold:

# Γ is a [[discrete group]] (with respect to the standard topology on PSL(2,'''C''')).
# Γ acts [[properly discontinuously]] at each point ''z'' ∈ Δ.
# The set Δ is a subset of the [[region of discontinuity]] Ω(Γ) of Γ.

That is, any one of these three can serve as a definition of a Fuchsian group, the others following as theorems.  The notion of an invariant proper subset Δ is important; the so-called '''Picard group''' PSL(2,'''Z'''[''i'']) is discrete but does not preserve any disk in the Riemann sphere.  Indeed, even the [[modular group]] PSL(2,'''Z'''), which ''is'' a Fuchsian group, does not act discontinuously on the real number line; it has accumulation points at the [[rational number]]s. Similarly, the idea that Δ is a proper subset of the region of discontinuity is important; when it is not, the subgroup is called a [[Kleinian group]].

It is most usual to take the invariant domain Δ to be either the [[open unit disk]] or the [[upper half-plane]].

== Limit sets ==
Because of the discrete action, the orbit Γ''z'' of a point ''z'' in the upper half-plane under the action of Γ has no [[accumulation point]]s in the upper half-plane. There may, however, be limit points on the real axis. Let Λ(Γ) be the [[limit set]] of Γ, that is, the set of limit points of Γ''z'' for ''z'' ∈ '''H'''. Then Λ(Γ) ⊆ '''R''' ∪ ∞.  The limit set may be empty, or may contain one or two points, or may contain an infinite number. In the latter case, there are two types:

A '''Fuchsian group of the first type''' is a group for which the limit set is the closed real line '''R''' ∪ ∞. This happens if the quotient space '''H'''/Γ has finite volume, but there are Fuchsian groups of the first kind of infinite covolume.

Otherwise, a '''Fuchsian group''' is said to be of the '''second type'''. Equivalently, this is a group for which the limit set is a [[perfect set]] that is [[nowhere dense]] on '''R''' ∪ ∞. Since it is nowhere dense, this implies that any limit point is arbitrarily close to an open set that is not in the limit set. In other words, the limit set is a [[Cantor set]].

The type of a Fuchsian group need not be the same as its type when considered as a Kleinian group: in fact, all Fuchsian groups are Kleinian groups of type 2, as their limit sets (as Kleinian groups) are proper subsets of the Riemann sphere, contained in some circle.

== Examples ==
An example of a Fuchsian group is the [[modular group]], PSL(2,'''Z''').  This is the subgroup of PSL(2,'''R''') consisting of linear fractional transformations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}\cdot z = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are integers.  The quotient space '''H'''/PSL(2,'''Z''') is the [[moduli space]] of [[elliptic curve]]s.

Other  Fuchsian groups include the groups Γ(''n'') for each integer ''n'' &gt; 0.  Here Γ(''n'') consists of [[Möbius transformation|linear fractional transformations]] of the above form where the entries of the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

are congruent to those of the identity matrix modulo ''n''.

A co-compact example is the (ordinary, rotational) [[(2,3,7) triangle group]], containing the Fuchsian groups of the [[Klein quartic]] and of the [[Macbeath surface]], as well as other [[Hurwitz group]]s. More generally, any hyperbolic [[von Dyck group]] (the index 2 subgroup of a [[triangle group]], corresponding to orientation-preserving isometries) is a Fuchsian group.

All these are '''Fuchsian groups of the first kind'''.

* All [[Möbius transformation#Hyperbolic transforms|hyperbolic]] and [[Möbius transformation#Parabolic transforms|parabolic]] cyclic subgroups of PSL(2,'''R''') are Fuchsian.
* Any [[Möbius transformation#Elliptic transforms|elliptic]] cyclic subgroup is Fuchsian if and only if it is finite.
* Every [[Abelian Group|abelian]] Fuchsian group is cyclic.
* No Fuchsian group is isomorphic to '''Z''' × '''Z'''.
* Let Γ be a non-abelian Fuchsian group. Then the [[normalizer]] of Γ in PSL(2,'''R''') is Fuchsian.

== Metric properties ==
If ''h'' is a hyperbolic element, the translation length ''L'' of its action in the upper half-plane is related to the trace of ''h'' as a 2×2 matrix by the relation

:&lt;math&gt; |\mathrm{tr}\; h| = 2\cosh \frac{L}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar relation holds for the [[systolic geometry|systole]] of the corresponding Riemann surface, if the Fuchsian group is torsion-free and co-compact.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28644">In the [[calculus of variations]], a field of [[mathematical analysis]], the '''functional derivative''' (or '''variational derivative''')&lt;ref name="GiaquintaHildebrandtP18"&gt;{{harv|Giaquinta|Hildebrandt|1996|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates a change in a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] to a change in a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on which the functional depends.

In the calculus of variations, functionals are usually expressed in terms of an [[integral]] of  functions, their [[Argument of a function|arguments]],  and their [[derivative]]s. In an integral {{math|''L''}} of a functional, if a function {{math|''f''}}   is varied by adding to it another function {{math|''δf''}} that is arbitrarily small, and the resulting integrand is expanded in powers of {{math|''δf''}}, the coefficient of {{math|''δf''}} in the first order term is called the functional derivative.

For example, consider the functional
:&lt;math&gt; J[f] = \int_a^b L[ \, x, f(x), f \, '(x) \, ] \, dx \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''f'' &amp;prime;(''x'') &amp;equiv; ''df/dx''}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is varied by adding to it a function {{math|''δf''}}, and the resulting integrand {{math|''L''(''x, f +δf, f '+δf'' &amp;prime;)}} is expanded in powers of {{math|''δf''}}, then the change in the value of {{math|''J''}} to first order in {{math|''δf''}} can be expressed as follows:&lt;ref name="GiaquintaHildebrandtP18" /&gt;&lt;ref Group = 'Note'&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Giaquinta|Hildebrandt|1996|p=18}}, this notation is customary in [[Physics|physical]] literature.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \delta J = \int_a^b  \frac{\delta J}{\delta f(x)} {\delta f(x)} \, dx \, . &lt;/math&gt; 
The coefficient of {{math|''δf(x)''}}, denoted as {{math|''δJ''/''δf(x)''}}, is called the '''functional derivative''' of {{math|''J''}} with respect to {{math|''f''}} at the point {{math|''x''}}.&lt;ref name=ParrYangP246&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|p=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For this example functional, the functional derivative is the left hand side of the [[Calculus of variations#Euler.E2.80.93Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]],&lt;ref name=GelfandFominP28&gt;{{harv|Gelfand|Fomin|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta J}{\delta f(x)} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial f} -\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\partial L}{\partial f'} \, . &lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==
In this section, the functional derivative is defined. Then the functional differential is defined in terms of the functional derivative.

===Functional derivative===
Given a [[manifold]] {{math|''M''}} representing ([[continuous function (topology)|continuous]]/[[smooth function|smooth]]) functions {{math|''ρ''}}  (with certain [[boundary condition]]s etc.), and a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{math|''F''}} defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;F\colon M \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \quad \mbox{or} \quad F\colon M \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the '''functional derivative''' of {{math|''F''[}}''ρ''], denoted {{math|''δF/δρ''}}, is defined by&lt;ref name=ParrYangP246A.2&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|loc= p. 246, Eq. A.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \int \frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho}(x) \phi(x) \; dx 
&amp;= \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\frac{F[\rho+\varepsilon \phi]-F[\rho]}{\varepsilon} \\
&amp;= \left [ \frac{d}{d\epsilon}F[\rho+\epsilon \phi]\right ]_{\epsilon=0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary function. The quantity {{math|''εϕ''}} is called the variation of {{math|''ρ''}}. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\phi \mapsto \left [ \frac{d}{d\epsilon}F[\rho+\epsilon \phi]\right ]_{\epsilon=0}&lt;/math&gt;

is a linear functional, so by the [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]], this functional is given by integration against some [[measure (mathematics)|measure]].
Then {{math|''δF''/''δρ''}} is defined to be the [[Radon&amp;ndash;Nikodym derivative]] of this measure.

We think of the function {{math|''δF''/''δρ''}} as the gradient of {{math|''F''}} at the point {{math|''ρ''}} and 
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho}(x) \phi(x) \; dx&lt;/math&gt; 
as the directional derivative at point {{math|''ρ''}} in the direction of {{math|''ϕ''}}. Then analogous to vector calculus, the inner product with the gradient gives the directional derivative.

===Functional differential===
The differential (or variation or first variation) of the functional &lt;math&gt;F\left[\rho\right]&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;ref name=ParrYangP246A.1&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|loc= p. 246, Eq. A.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;Ref Group = 'Note' &gt; Called ''differential'' in {{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|p=246}}, ''variation'' or ''first variation'' in {{harv|Courant|Hilbert|1953|p=186}}, and ''variation'' or ''differential'' in {{harv|Gelfand|Fomin|2000|loc= p. 11, &amp;sect; 3.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta F (\rho, \phi) = \int   \frac {\delta F} {\delta \rho}(x) \ \phi(x)   \ dx \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Heuristically, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the change in &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, so we 'formally' have &lt;math&gt;\phi=\delta\rho&lt;/math&gt;, and then
this is similar in form to the [[total differential]] of a function &lt;math&gt;F(\rho_1,\rho_2,\dots,\rho_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; dF =   \sum_{i=1} ^n  \frac {\partial F} {\partial \rho_i} \ d\rho_i  \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho_1,\rho_2,\dots,\rho_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent variables. 
Comparing the last two equations, the functional derivative &lt;math&gt;\delta F/\delta\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a role similar to that of the partial derivative &lt;math&gt;\partial F/\partial\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, where the variable of integration &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is like a continuous version of the summation index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=ParrYangP246 /&gt;

===Formal description===
The definition of a functional derivative may be made more mathematically precise and formal by defining the [[topological vector space|space of functions]] more carefully. For example, when the space of functions is a [[Banach space]], the functional derivative becomes known as the [[Fréchet derivative]], while one uses the [[Gâteaux derivative]] on more general [[locally convex space]]s. Note that [[Hilbert space]]s are special cases of [[Banach space]]s. The more formal treatment allows many theorems from ordinary [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] to be generalized to corresponding theorems in [[functional analysis]], as well as numerous new theorems to be stated.

==Properties==
Like the derivative of a function, the functional derivative satisfies the following properties, where {{math|''F''}}[''ρ''] and {{math|''G''}}[''ρ''] are functionals:&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;
Here the notation
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\delta{F}}{\delta\rho}(x) \equiv \frac{\delta{F}}{\delta\rho(x)}
&lt;/math&gt;
is introduced.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Linearity:&lt;ref name=ParrYangP247A.3&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|loc= p. 247, Eq. A.3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta(\lambda F + \mu G)[\rho ]}{\delta \rho(x)} = \lambda \frac{\delta F[\rho]}{\delta \rho(x)} + \mu \frac{\delta G[\rho]}{\delta \rho(x)},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''λ'', ''μ''}} are constants.

* Product rule:&lt;ref name=ParrYangP247A.4&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|loc= p. 247,  Eq. A.4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta(FG)[\rho]}{\delta \rho(x)} = \frac{\delta F[\rho]}{\delta \rho(x)} G[\rho] + F[\rho] \frac{\delta G[\rho]}{\delta \rho(x)} \, , &lt;/math&gt;

* Chain rules: 
:If {{math|''F''}} is a functional and {{math|''G''}} another functional, then&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Greiner|Reinhardt|1996|loc=p. 38, Eq. 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\delta F[G[\rho]] }{\delta\rho(y)}  = \int dx \frac{\delta F[G]}{\delta G(x)}_{G = G[\rho]}\cdot\frac {\delta G[\rho](x)} {\delta\rho(y)} \ . &lt;/math&gt;
:If {{math|''G''}} is an ordinary differentiable function (local functional) {{math|''g''}}, then this reduces to&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Greiner|Reinhardt|1996|loc=p. 38, Eq. 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\delta F[g(\rho)] }{\delta\rho(y)}  = \frac{\delta F[g(\rho)]}{\delta g[\rho(y) ]} \ \frac {dg(\rho)} {d\rho(y)} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

==Determining functional derivatives==
We give a formula to determine functional derivatives for a common class of functionals that can be written as the integral of a function and its derivatives. This is a generalization of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]: indeed, the functional derivative was introduced in [[physics]] within the derivation of the [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] equation of the second kind from the [[principle of least action]] in [[Lagrangian mechanics]] (18th century). The first three examples below are taken from [[density functional theory]] (20th century), the fourth from [[statistical mechanics]] (19th century).

===Formula===
Given a functional 
:&lt;math&gt;F[\rho] = \int f( \boldsymbol{r}, \rho(\boldsymbol{r}), \nabla\rho(\boldsymbol{r}) )\, d\boldsymbol{r},&lt;/math&gt;
and a function {{math|''ϕ''}}('''{{math|''r''}}''') that vanishes on the boundary of the region of integration, from a previous section [[Functional derivative#Definition|Definition]],

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho(\boldsymbol{r})} \, \phi(\boldsymbol{r}) \, d\boldsymbol{r}  
&amp;  = \left [ \frac{d}{d\varepsilon} \int f( \boldsymbol{r}, \rho + \varepsilon \phi, \nabla\rho+\varepsilon\nabla\phi )\, d\boldsymbol{r} \right ]_{\varepsilon=0} \\
&amp;  = \int \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho} \, \phi + \frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla\rho} \cdot \nabla\phi \right) d\boldsymbol{r} \\
&amp;  = \int \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho} \, \phi + \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla\rho} \, \phi \right) - \left( \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla\rho} \right) \phi \right] d\boldsymbol{r} \\
&amp;  = \int \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho} \, \phi - \left( \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla\rho} \right) \phi \right] d\boldsymbol{r} \\
&amp;  = \int \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho} -  \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla\rho} \right) \phi(\boldsymbol{r}) \ d\boldsymbol{r} \, .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second line is obtained using the [[total derivative]], where {{math|''&amp;part;f'' /''&amp;part;&amp;nabla;''}}''ρ'' is a [[Matrix calculus#Scalar-by-vector|derivative of a scalar with respect to a vector]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For a three-dimensional cartesian coordinate system,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla\rho} =   \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho_x}  \mathbf{\hat{i}}   + \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho_y}  \mathbf{\hat{j}} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho_z}  \mathbf{\hat{k}}\, ,  \qquad 
&amp; \text{where} \ \rho_x = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x}\, ,  \ \rho_y = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}\, , \ \rho_z = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}\, \\
&amp; \text{and} \ \ \mathbf{\hat{i}}, \ \mathbf{\hat{j}}, \ \mathbf{\hat{k}} \ \ \text {are unit vectors along the x, y, z axes.}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The third line was obtained by use of a [[Divergence#Properties|product rule for divergence]]. The fourth line was obtained using the [[divergence theorem]] and the condition that {{math|''ϕ''{{=}}0}} on the boundary of the region of integration.  Since {{math|''ϕ''}} is also an arbitrary function, applying the [[fundamental lemma of calculus of variations]] to the last line, the functional derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho(\boldsymbol{r})} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho} - \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla\rho} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' = ''ρ''('''{{math|''r''}}''') and {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f'' ('''{{math|''r''}}'''}}, ''ρ'', &amp;nabla;''ρ''). This formula is for the case of the functional form given by {{math|''F''}}[''ρ''] at the beginning of this section. For other functional forms,  the definition of the functional derivative can be used as the starting point for its determination. (See the example [[Functional derivative#Coulomb potential energy functional|Coulomb potential energy functional]].)

The above equation for the functional derivative can be generalized to the case that includes higher dimensions and higher order derivatives. The functional would be,

:&lt;math&gt;
F[\rho(\boldsymbol{r})] = \int f( \boldsymbol{r}, \rho(\boldsymbol{r}), \nabla\rho(\boldsymbol{r}), \nabla^{(2)}\rho(\boldsymbol{r}), \dots, \nabla^{(N)}\rho(\boldsymbol{r}))\, d\boldsymbol{r},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the vector {{math|'''''r''''' &amp;isin; ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|&amp;nabla;&lt;sup&gt;(''i'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a tensor whose {{math|''n&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} components  are partial derivative operators of order {{math|''i''}},  
:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \nabla^{(i)} \right ]_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_i} = \frac {\partial^{\, i}} {\partial r_{\alpha_1}  \partial r_{\alpha_2} \cdots \partial r_{\alpha_i} } \qquad \qquad \text{where} \quad  \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_i = 1, 2, \cdots , n \ . &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group = 'Note'&gt;For example, for the case of three dimensions ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 3}}) and second order derivatives ({{math|''i'' {{=}} 2}}), the tensor {{math|&amp;nabla;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;}} has components,
:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \nabla^{(2)} \right ]_{\alpha \beta} = \frac {\partial^{\,2}} {\partial r_{\alpha} \, \partial r_{\beta}} \qquad \qquad \text{where} \quad \alpha, \beta = 1, 2, 3 \, . &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogous application of the definition of the functional derivative yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta F[\rho]}{\delta \rho} &amp;{} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho} - \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial(\nabla\rho)} + \nabla^{(2)} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\left(\nabla^{(2)}\rho\right)} + \dots + (-1)^N \nabla^{(N)} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\left(\nabla^{(N)}\rho\right)} \\
&amp;{} =   \frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho} + \sum_{i=1}^N (-1)^{i}\nabla^{(i)} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\left(\nabla^{(i)}\rho\right)} \ .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the last two equations, the {{math|''n&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} components of the tensor &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial f}{\partial\left(\nabla^{(i)}\rho\right)} &lt;/math&gt; are partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} with respect to partial derivatives of ''ρ'',

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \frac {\partial f} {\partial \left (\nabla^{(i)}\rho \right ) } \right ]_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_i} = \frac {\partial f} {\partial \rho_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_i} } \qquad \qquad \text{where} \quad \rho_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_i} \equiv \frac {\partial^{\, i}\rho} {\partial r_{\alpha_1} \, \partial r_{\alpha_2} \cdots \partial r_{\alpha_i} }   \ ,   &lt;/math&gt;

and the tensor scalar product is,
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^{(i)} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\left(\nabla^{(i)}\rho\right)} = \sum_{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_i = 1}^n \ \frac {\partial^{\, i} } {\partial r_{\alpha_1} \, \partial r_{\alpha_2} \cdots \partial r_{\alpha_i} }  \ \frac {\partial f} {\partial \rho_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_i} }   \  .  &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref group = 'Note'&gt;For example, for the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} 3}} and {{math|''i'' {{=}} 2}}, the tensor scalar product is,
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^{(2)} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial\left(\nabla^{(2)}\rho\right)} = \sum_{\alpha, \beta = 1}^3 \ \frac {\partial^{\, 2} } {\partial r_{\alpha} \, \partial r_{\beta} }  \ \frac {\partial f} {\partial \rho_{\alpha \beta} }    \qquad \text{where} \ \ \rho_{\alpha \beta} \equiv \frac {\partial^{\, 2}\rho} {\partial r_{\alpha} \, \partial r_{\beta} } \ . &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

====Thomas–Fermi kinetic energy functional====
The [[Thomas–Fermi model]] of 1927 used a kinetic energy functional for a noninteracting uniform [[free electron model|electron gas]] in a first attempt of [[density-functional theory]] of electronic structure:
:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{TF}[\rho] = C_\mathrm{F} \int \rho^{5/3}(\mathbf{r}) \, d\mathbf{r} \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Since the integrand of {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;TF&lt;/sub&gt;}}[''ρ''] does not involve derivatives of ''ρ''{{math|('''''r''''')}}, the functional derivative of {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;TF&lt;/sub&gt;}}[''ρ''] is,&lt;ref name=ParrYangP247A.6&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|loc=p. 247, Eq. A.6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta T_{\mathrm{TF}}}{\delta \rho (\boldsymbol{r}) } 
&amp; = C_\mathrm{F} \frac{\partial \rho^{5/3}(\mathbf{r})}{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r})}  \\
&amp; = \frac{5}{3} C_\mathrm{F}  \rho^{2/3}(\mathbf{r}) \, .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Coulomb potential energy functional====
For the '''electron-nucleus potential''', Thomas and Fermi employed the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] potential energy functional

:&lt;math&gt;V[\rho] =  \int \frac{\rho(\boldsymbol{r})}{|\boldsymbol{r}|} \ d\boldsymbol{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of functional derivative,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \frac{\delta V}{\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})} \ \phi(\boldsymbol{r}) \ d\boldsymbol{r} 
&amp; {} = \left [ \frac{d}{d\varepsilon}  \int \frac{\rho(\boldsymbol{r}) + \varepsilon \phi(\boldsymbol{r})}{|\boldsymbol{r}|} \ d\boldsymbol{r} \right ]_{\varepsilon=0} \\
&amp; {} =  \int  \frac {1} {|\boldsymbol{r}|} \, \phi(\boldsymbol{r}) \ d\boldsymbol{r} \, .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
So,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta V}{\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})} = \frac{1}{|\boldsymbol{r}|} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

For the classical part of the '''electron-electron interaction''', Thomas and Fermi employed the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] potential energy functional
:&lt;math&gt;J[\rho] = \frac{1}{2}\iint \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}) \rho(\mathbf{r}')}{\vert \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}' \vert}\, d\mathbf{r} d\mathbf{r}' \, .&lt;/math&gt;
From the [[Functional derivative#Functional derivative|definition of the functional derivative]], 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \frac{\delta J}{\delta\rho(\boldsymbol{r})} \phi(\boldsymbol{r})d\boldsymbol{r}  
&amp; {} = \left [ \frac {d \ }{d\epsilon} \, J[\rho + \epsilon\phi] \right ]_{\epsilon = 0} \\
&amp; {} = \left [ \frac {d \ }{d\epsilon} \, \left ( \frac{1}{2}\iint \frac {[\rho(\boldsymbol{r}) + \epsilon \phi(\boldsymbol{r})] \,  [\rho(\boldsymbol{r}') + \epsilon \phi(\boldsymbol{r}')]  }{\vert \boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}' \vert}\, d\boldsymbol{r} d\boldsymbol{r}'  \right ) \right ]_{\epsilon = 0} \\
&amp; {} =  \frac{1}{2}\iint \frac {\rho(\boldsymbol{r}') \phi(\boldsymbol{r})  }{\vert \boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}' \vert}\, d\boldsymbol{r} d\boldsymbol{r}' +
            \frac{1}{2}\iint \frac {\rho(\boldsymbol{r}) \phi(\boldsymbol{r}')  }{\vert \boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}' \vert}\, d\boldsymbol{r} d\boldsymbol{r}'   \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The first and second terms on the right hand side of the last equation are  equal, since {{math|'''''r'''''}} and {{math|'''''r&amp;prime;'''''}} in the second term can be interchanged without changing the value of the integral. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{\delta J}{\delta\rho(\boldsymbol{r})} \phi(\boldsymbol{r})d\boldsymbol{r} = \int \left ( \int \frac {\rho(\boldsymbol{r}') }{\vert \boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}' \vert} d\boldsymbol{r}' \right )  \phi(\boldsymbol{r}) d\boldsymbol{r}  &lt;/math&gt;
and the functional derivative of the electron-electron coulomb potential energy functional {{math|''J''}}[''ρ''] is,&lt;ref name=ParrYangP248A.11&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|loc=p. 248, Eq. A.11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta J}{\delta\rho(\boldsymbol{r})} = \int \frac {\rho(\boldsymbol{r}') }{\vert \boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}' \vert} d\boldsymbol{r}' \, . &lt;/math&gt;

The second functional derivative is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta^2 J[\rho]}{\delta \rho(\mathbf{r}')\delta\rho(\mathbf{r})}  = \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r}')} \left ( \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}')}{\vert \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}' \vert} \right ) = \frac{1}{\vert \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}' \vert}.
&lt;/math&gt;

====Weizsäcker kinetic energy functional====
In 1935 [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker|von Weizsäcker]] proposed to add a gradient correction to the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy functional to make it suit better a molecular electron cloud:
:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{W}[\rho] = \frac{1}{8} \int \frac{\nabla\rho(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \nabla\rho(\mathbf{r})}{ \rho(\mathbf{r}) } d\mathbf{r} =  \int t_\mathrm{W} \ d\mathbf{r} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; t_\mathrm{W} \equiv  \frac{1}{8}  \frac{\nabla\rho \cdot \nabla\rho}{ \rho } \qquad \text{and} \ \ \rho = \rho(\boldsymbol{r}) \ .  &lt;/math&gt;
Using a previously derived [[Functional derivative#Formula|formula]] for the functional derivative,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta T_\mathrm{W}}{\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})} 
&amp; = \frac{\partial t_\mathrm{W}}{\partial \rho} - \nabla\cdot\frac{\partial t_\mathrm{W}}{\partial \nabla \rho} \\
&amp; = -\frac{1}{8}\frac{\nabla\rho \cdot \nabla\rho}{\rho^2} - \left ( \frac {1}{4} \frac {\nabla^2\rho} {\rho} -  \frac {1}{4} \frac {\nabla\rho \cdot \nabla\rho} {\rho^2} \right ) \qquad \text{where} \ \ \nabla^2 = \nabla \cdot \nabla \ ,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and the result is,&lt;ref name=ParrYangP247A.9&gt;{{harv|Parr|Yang|1989|loc= p. 247, Eq. A.9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta T_\mathrm{W}}{\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})} =  \ \ \, \frac{1}{8}\frac{\nabla\rho \cdot \nabla\rho}{\rho^2} - \frac{1}{4}\frac{\nabla^2\rho}{\rho} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

====Entropy====
The [[information entropy|entropy]] of a discrete [[random variable]] is a functional of the [[probability mass function]].

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H[p(x)] = -\sum_x p(x) \log p(x)
\end{align}

&lt;/math&gt;
Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_x \frac{\delta H}{\delta p(x)} \, \phi(x) 
&amp; {} = \left[ \frac{d}{d\epsilon} H[p(x) + \epsilon\phi(x)] \right]_{\epsilon=0}\\
&amp; {} = \left [- \, \frac{d}{d\varepsilon}  \sum_x \, [p(x) + \varepsilon\phi(x)] \ \log [p(x) + \varepsilon\phi(x)] \right]_{\varepsilon=0} \\
&amp; {} = \displaystyle -\sum_x \, [1+\log p(x)] \ \phi(x) \, .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\delta H}{\delta p(x)} = -1-\log p(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Exponential ====

Let
:&lt;math&gt; F[\varphi(x)]= e^{\int \varphi(x) g(x)dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the delta function as a test function,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta F[\varphi(x)]}{\delta \varphi(y)} 
&amp; {} = \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\frac{F[\varphi(x)+\varepsilon\delta(x-y)]-F[\varphi(x)]}{\varepsilon}\\
&amp; {} = \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\frac{e^{\int (\varphi(x)+\varepsilon\delta(x-y)) g(x)dx}-e^{\int \varphi(x) g(x)dx}}{\varepsilon}\\
&amp; {} = e^{\int \varphi(x) g(x)dx}\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\frac{e^{\varepsilon \int \delta(x-y) g(x)dx}-1}{\varepsilon}\\
&amp; {} = e^{\int \varphi(x) g(x)dx}\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\frac{e^{\varepsilon g(y)}-1}{\varepsilon}\\
&amp; {} = e^{\int \varphi(x) g(x)dx}g(y).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta F[\varphi(x)]}{\delta \varphi(y)} = g(y) F[\varphi(x)]. &lt;/math&gt;

This is particularly useful in calculating the [[Correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]] from the [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] in [[quantum field theory]].

====Functional derivative of a function====
A function can be written in the form of  an integral like a functional. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(\boldsymbol{r}) = F[\rho] = \int \rho(\boldsymbol{r}') \delta(\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}')\, d\boldsymbol{r}'.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the integrand does not depend on derivatives of ''ρ'', the functional derivative of ''ρ''{{math|('''''r''''')}} is,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
\frac {\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})} {\delta\rho(\boldsymbol{r}')} \equiv \frac {\delta F} {\delta\rho(\boldsymbol{r}')} 
&amp; = \frac{\partial \ \ }{\partial \rho(\boldsymbol{r}')} \, [\rho(\boldsymbol{r}') \delta(\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}')] \\
&amp; = \delta(\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}').
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Functional derivative of iterated function====
The functional derivative of the iterated function &lt;math&gt;f(f(x))&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta f(f(x))}{\delta f(y) } = f'(f(x))\delta(x-y) + \delta(f(x)-y)&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta f(f(f(x)))}{\delta f(y) } = f'(f(f(x))(f'(f(x))\delta(x-y) + \delta(f(x)-y)) + \delta(f(f(x))-y)&lt;/math&gt;

In general:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta f^N(x)}{\delta f(y)} = f'( f^{N-1}(x) ) \frac{ \delta f^{N-1}(x)}{\delta f(y)} + \delta( f^{N-1}(x) - y ) &lt;/math&gt;

Putting in N=0 gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta f^{-1}(x)}{\delta f(y) }  =- \frac{ \delta(f^{-1}(x)-y ) }{ f'(f^{-1}(x))  }&lt;/math&gt;

==Using the delta function as a test function==
In physics, it's common to use the [[Dirac delta function]] &lt;math&gt;\delta(x-y)&lt;/math&gt; in place of a generic test function &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for yielding the functional derivative at the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (this is a point of the whole functional derivative as a [[partial derivative]] is a component of the gradient):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|Reinhardt|1996|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta F[\rho(x)]}{\delta \rho(y)}=\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\frac{F[\rho(x)+\varepsilon\delta(x-y)]-F[\rho(x)]}{\varepsilon}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This works in cases when &lt;math&gt;F[\rho(x)+\varepsilon f(x)]&lt;/math&gt; formally can be expanded as a series (or at least up to first order) in &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The formula is however not mathematically rigorous, since &lt;math&gt;F[\rho(x)+\varepsilon\delta(x-y)]&lt;/math&gt; is usually not even defined.

The definition given in a previous section is based on a relationship that holds for all test functions {{math|''ϕ''}}, so one might think that it should hold also when {{math|''ϕ''}} is chosen to be a specific function such as the [[Dirac delta function|delta function]].  However, the latter is not a valid test function (it is not even a proper function).

In the definition, the functional derivative describes how the functional &lt;math&gt;F[\varphi(x)]&lt;/math&gt; changes as a result of a small change in the entire function &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The particular form of the change in &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not specified, but it should stretch over the whole interval on which &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is defined. Employing the particular form of the perturbation given by the delta function has the meaning that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is varied only in the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Except for this point, there is no variation in &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Proposal==
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is credited with an 1820 proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J. Madeleine|last2=Nash |first3=Richard|last3=Woodbury |title=Space: Onward to Mars|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967915,00.html|date=July 18, 1988|page=50|subscription=yes|volume=132|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings in the form of drawing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth, intended as a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]. Details vary between sources, but typically the "drawing" was to be constructed on the [[Geography of Russia#Tundra|Siberian tundra]], and made up of vast strips of pine forest forming the right triangle's borders, with the interior of the drawing and exterior squares composed of fields of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kahn|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEH_rHkgaogC&amp;pg=PA958|date=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss is said to have been convinced that Mars harbored intelligent life and that this geometric figure, invoking the Pythagorean theorem through the squares on the outside borders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Universe Is Not Ours Alone; From the edge of the galaxy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/09/29/archives/the-universe-is-not-oues-alone-from-the-edge-of-the-galaxy.html|subscription=yes|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter S.

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

The '''homotopy analysis method''' ('''HAM''') is a semi-analytical technique to solve [[nonlinear]] [[ordinary differential equations|ordinary]]/[[partial differential equations|partial]] [[differential equations]].  The homotopy analysis method employs the concept of the [[homotopy]] from [[topology]] to generate a convergent series solution for nonlinear systems.  This is enabled by utilizing a homotopy-[[Taylor series|Maclaurin series]] to deal with the nonlinearities in the system.

The HAM was first devised in 1992 by [[Liao Shijun]] of [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]] in his PhD dissertation&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Liao | first=S.J. | title=The proposed homotopy analysis technique for the solution of nonlinear problems | publisher=PhD thesis, Shanghai Jiao Tong University | year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further modified&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Liao | first=S.J. | title=An explicit, totally analytic approximation of Blasius' viscous flow problems | journal=International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics | volume=34 | issue=4 | pages=759–778 | year=1999 | doi=10.1016/S0020-7462(98)00056-0|bibcode = 1999IJNLM..34..759L }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997 to introduce a non-zero auxiliary parameter, referred to as the '''convergence-control parameter''', '''''c'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''0'''&lt;/sub&gt;, to construct a homotopy on a differential system in general form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Liao | first=S.J. | title=Beyond Perturbation: Introduction to the Homotopy Analysis Method | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/ CRC Press | location=Boca Raton  | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-58488-407-1 }}[https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Perturbation-Introduction-Mechanics-Mathematics/dp/158488407X]&lt;/ref&gt;  The convergence-control parameter is a non-physical variable that provides a simple way to verify and enforce convergence of a solution series.  The capability of the HAM to naturally show convergence of the series solution is unusual in analytical and semi-analytic approaches to nonlinear partial differential equations.

== Characteristics==

The HAM distinguishes itself from various other [[Mathematical analysis|analytical methods]] in four important aspects.  First, it is a [[series (mathematics)|series]] expansion method that is not directly dependent on small or large physical parameters.  Thus, it is applicable for not only weakly but also strongly nonlinear problems, going beyond some of the inherent limitations of the standard [[Perturbation theory|perturbation methods]].  Second, the HAM is a unified method for the [[Aleksandr Lyapunov|Lyapunov]] artificial small parameter method, the delta expansion method, the [[Adomian decomposition method]],&lt;ref name="Adomian94"&gt;{{cite book |title=Solving Frontier problems of Physics: The decomposition method|first=G.|last=Adomian|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=1994|isbn=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[homotopy perturbation method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Liang | first1=Songxin |last2=Jeffrey |first2=David J. | title= Comparison of homotopy analysis method and homotopy perturbation method through an evolution equation | journal=Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation| volume=14| issue=12 | pages=4057–4064|year=2009 | doi=10.1016/j.cnsns.2009.02.016|bibcode = 2009CNSNS..14.4057L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Sajid | first1=M. |last2=Hayat |first2=T. | title= Comparison of HAM and HPM methods in nonlinear heat conduction and convection equations | journal=Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications| volume=9| issue=5 | pages=2296–2301|year=2008 | doi=10.1016/j.nonrwa.2007.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater generality of the method often allows for strong convergence of the solution over larger spatial and parameter domains.  Third, the HAM gives excellent flexibility in the expression of the solution and how the solution is explicitly obtained.  It provides great freedom to choose the [[basis functions]] of the desired solution and the corresponding auxiliary [[linear operator]] of the homotopy. Finally, unlike the other analytic approximation techniques, the HAM provides a simple way to ensure the [[limit of a sequence|convergence]] of the solution series.

The homotopy analysis method is also able to combine with other techniques employed in nonlinear differential equations such as [[spectral methods]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Motsa | first1=S.S. | last2=Sibanda|first2=P.| last3=Awad| first3=F.G.|  last4 = Shateyi| first4 = S.| title= A new spectral-homotopy analysis method for the MHD Jeffery–Hamel problem | journal=Computers &amp; Fluids| volume=39| issue=7 | pages=1219–1225|year=2010 | doi=10.1016/j.compfluid.2010.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Padé approximant]]s. It may further be combined with computational methods, such as the [[boundary element method]] to allow the linear method to solve nonlinear systems. Different from the numerical technique of [[Numerical continuation|homotopy continuation]], the homotopy analysis method is an analytic approximation method as opposed to a discrete computational method.  Further, the HAM uses the homotopy parameter only on a theoretical level to demonstrate that a nonlinear system may be split into an infinite set of linear systems which are solved analytically, while the continuation methods require solving a discrete linear system as the homotopy parameter is varied to solve the nonlinear system.

== Applications ==

In the last twenty years, the HAM has been applied to solve a growing number of nonlinear [[ordinary differential equations|ordinary]]/[[partial differential equation]]s in science, finance, and engineering.&lt;ref name="HAM in NDEs"&gt;{{citation | last=Liao | first=S.J. | title=Homotopy Analysis Method in Nonlinear Differential Equations| publisher=Springer &amp; Higher Education Press| location=Berlin &amp; Beijing | year=2012 | isbn=978-7-04-032298-9}} [https://www.amazon.com/Homotopy-Analysis-Nonlinear-Differential-Equations/dp/3642251315]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Vajravelu | first1=K.  | last2= Van Gorder| title= Nonlinear Flow Phenomena and Homotopy Analysis| publisher=Springer &amp; Higher Education Press| location=Berlin &amp; Beijing | year=2013 | isbn=978-3-642-32102-3}} [https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Flow-Phenomena-Homotopy-Analysis/dp/3642321011/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384402655&amp;sr=1-1]&lt;/ref&gt;  
For example, multiple steady-state resonant waves in deep and finite water depth&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Xu|first1=D.L.|last2=Lin|first2=Z.L.|last3=Liao|first3=S.J.|last4=Stiassnie|first4=M.|title=On the steady-state fully resonant progressive waves in water of finite depth|journal =Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume = 710|pages=379–418|year=2012|doi = 10.1017/jfm.2012.370|bibcode = 2012JFM...710..379X }}&lt;/ref&gt; were found with the [[wave resonance]] criterion of arbitrary number of traveling [[gravity waves]]; this agreed with Phillips' criterion for four waves with small amplitude.

== Brief mathematical description ==

[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|top|200px|An isotopy of a coffee cup into a doughnut ([[torus]]).]]

Consider a general nonlinear differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N}[u(x)] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; is a nonlinear operator.   Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; denote an auxiliary linear operator, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') an initial guess of ''u''(''x''), and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; a constant (called the convergence-control parameter), respectively.   Using the embedding parameter ''q'' ∈ [0,1] from homotopy theory, one may construct a family of equations,

:&lt;math&gt;
(1 - q) \mathcal{L}[U(x; q) - u_0(x)] = c_0 \, q \, \mathcal{N}[U(x;q)],
&lt;/math&gt;

called the zeroth-order deformation equation, whose solution varies continuously with respect to the embedding parameter ''q'' ∈ [0,1].  This is the linear equation
 
:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathcal{L}[U(x; q) - u_0(x)] = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

with known initial guess ''U''(''x''; 0) = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') when ''q'' = 0, but is equivalent to the original nonlinear equation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}[u(x)] = 0&lt;/math&gt;, when ''q'' = 1, i.e. ''U''(''x''; 1) = ''u''(''x'')).  Therefore, as ''q'' increases from 0 to 1, the solution ''U''(''x''; ''q'') of the zeroth-order deformation equation varies (or deforms) from the chosen initial guess ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')  to the solution ''u''(''x'') of the considered nonlinear equation.

Expanding ''U''(''x''; ''q'') in a Taylor series about ''q'' = 0, we have the homotopy-Maclaurin series

:&lt;math&gt;
U(x;q) = u_0(x) +\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} u_m(x) \, q^m. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that the so-called convergence-control parameter ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the zeroth-order deformation equation is properly chosen that the above series is convergent at ''q'' = 1, we have the homotopy-series solution

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x) = u_0(x) + \sum_{m=1}^\infty u_m(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

From the zeroth-order deformation equation,  one can directly derive the governing equation of ''u''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{L}[u_m(x) - \chi_m u_{m-1}(x) ] = c_0 \, R_m[u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}],
&lt;/math&gt;

called the ''m''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order deformation equation, where &lt;math&gt;\chi_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi_k = 1&lt;/math&gt; for ''k'' &gt; 1, and the right-hand side ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent only upon the known results ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; and can be obtained easily using computer algebra software.  In this way, the original nonlinear equation is transferred into an infinite number of linear ones, but without the assumption of any small/large physical parameters.

Since the HAM is based on a homotopy, one has great freedom to choose the initial guess ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), the auxiliary linear operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, and the convergence-control parameter ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the zeroth-order deformation equation.  Thus, the HAM provides the mathematician freedom to choose the equation-type of the high-order deformation equation and the base functions of its solution.  The optimal value of the convergence-control parameter ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is determined by the minimum of the squared residual error of governing equations and/or boundary conditions after the general form has been solved for the chosen initial guess and linear operator.  Thus, the convergence-control parameter ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a simple way to guarantee the convergence of the homotopy series solution and differentiates the HAM from other analytic approximation methods.  The method overall gives a useful generalization of the concept of homotopy.

== The HAM and computer algebra ==

The HAM is an analytic approximation method designed for the computer era with the goal of "computing with functions instead of numbers."   In conjunction with a computer algebra system such as [[Mathematica]] or [[Maple]], one can gain analytic approximations of a highly nonlinear problem to arbitrarily high order by means of the HAM in only a few seconds.  Inspired by the recent successful applications of the HAM in different fields, a Mathematica package based on the HAM, called BVPh, has been made available online for solving nonlinear boundary-value problems [http://numericaltank.sjtu.edu.cn/BVPh.htm].   BVPh is a solver package for highly nonlinear ODEs with singularities, multiple solutions, and multipoint boundary conditions in either a finite or an infinite interval, and includes support for certain types of nonlinear PDEs.&lt;ref name="HAM in NDEs"/&gt;  Another HAM-based Mathematica code, APOh, has been produced to solve for an explicit analytic approximation of the optimal exercise boundary of American put option, which is also available online [http://numericaltank.sjtu.edu.cn/APO.htm].

== Frequency response analysis for nonlinear oscillators ==
The HAM has recently been reported to be useful for obtaining analytical solutions for nonlinear frequency response equations. Such solutions are able to capture various nonlinear behaviors such as hardening-type, softening-type or mixed behaviors of the oscillator,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tajaddodianfar|first1=Farid|title=Nonlinear dynamics of MEMS/NEMS resonators: analytical solution by the homotopy analysis method|journal=Microsystem Technologies|volume=23|issue=6|pages=1913–1926|doi=10.1007/s00542-016-2947-7|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tajaddodianfar|first1=Farid|title=On the dynamics of bistable micro/nano resonators: Analytical solution and nonlinear behavior|journal=Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation|volume=20|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.cnsns.2014.06.048|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570414003116|pages=1078–1089|bibcode=2015CNSNS..20.1078T|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These analytical equations are also useful in prediction of chaos in nonlinear systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tajaddodianfar|first1=Farid|title=Prediction of chaos in electrostatically actuated arch micro-nano resonators: Analytical approach|journal=Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation|volume=30|issue=1–3|doi=10.1016/j.cnsns.2015.06.013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570415002142|pages=182–195|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}
The '''Indian numbering system''' is used in the [[Indian subcontinent]] ([[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Maldives]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]) and in [[Myanmar|Burma]]. The terms ''[[lakh]]'' (100,000 or 1,00,000 in the Indian system) and ''[[crore]]'' (10,000,000 or 1,00,00,000 in the Indian system)&lt;ref name="nroer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Knowing our Numbers|url=http://nroer.gov.in/nroer_team/file/readDoc/55b23f2881fccb054b6be25f/|website=Department Of School Education And Literacy|publisher=National Repository of Open Educational Resources|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used in [[Indian English]] to express large numbers. For example, in India 150,000 rupees becomes 1.5 lakh rupees, written as {{INR}}1,50,000 or INR&amp;nbsp;1,50,000, while 30,000,000 (thirty million) rupees becomes 3 crore rupees, written as {{INR}}3,00,00,000 with commas at the [[1000 (number)|thousand]], ''lakh'', and ''crore'' levels, and 1,000,000,000 (one [[1,000,000,000|billion]]) rupees (one hundred crore rupees or one arab अरब ) is written {{INR}}1,00,00,00,000. While there are specific terms for numbers larger than 1 crore, these are not commonly used, and most practitioners are not familiar with these. In common parlance, the thousand, lakh, crore terminology repeats for larger numbers. Thus 1,000,000,000,000 (one [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]) becomes 1 lakh crore, and is written as 10,00,00,00,00,000.

The Indian numbering is equal to the western numbering system from ones then tens then hundreds then thousand then ten thousand. After ten thousand, the Indian and the western numbering diverge. According to the Indian numbering system, after ten thousand, the next power of ten is one lakh, then ten lakh, then one crore, then ten crore, and so on. According to the Western numbering system, after ten thousand, the next power of ten is referred to as one hundred thousand, then one million, then ten million, then one hundred million, and so on. The two numbering systems are not functionally different — 10,000 (Indian system) = 10,000 (Western system) — but they assign different names to the same number.

==Use of separators==

The Indian numbering system uses [[decimal mark|separators]] differently from the international norm. Instead of grouping digits by threes as in the international system, the Indian numbering system groups the rightmost three digits together (until the hundreds place), and thereafter groups by sets of two digits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Special_Pattern_Characters|title=UNICODE LOCALE DATA MARKUP LANGUAGE (LDML) PART 3: NUMBERS|last=Emmons|first=John|date=2018-03-25|website=Unicode.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725183458/https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Special_Pattern_Characters|archive-date=2018-07-25|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One trillion would thus be written as 10,00,00,00,00,000 or one lakh crore (or 10 kharab). This makes the number convenient to read using thousand, lakh, crore terminology. Thus:

|}

This accords with the Indian numbering system, which has units for thousands, hundreds of thousands, tens of millions, etc.

==Names of numbers==
The table below follows the [[short scale]] usage of one billion being one thousand million. In [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]], following former British usage, the [[long scale]] was used, with one billion equivalent to one million million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3965">In [[computational complexity theory]], an '''integer circuit''' is a [[circuit (computer science)|circuit]] [[model of computation]] in which inputs to the circuit are [[set (mathematics)|set]]s of [[integer]]s and each gate of the circuit computes either a set operation or an arithmetic operation on its input sets.

As an [[algorithm]]ic problem, the possible questions are to find if a given integer is an element of the output node or if two circuits compute the same set. The decidability is still an open question, but there are results on restriction of thoses circuits. Finding answers to some questions about this model could serve as a proof to many important mathematical conjectures, like [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. 

It is a natural extension of the [[circuits over sets of natural numbers]] when the considered set contains also negative integers, the definitions, which does not change, will not be repeated on this page. Only the differences will be mentioned.

== Complexity of the membership problem ==

The membership problem is the problem of deciding, given an integer circuit ''C'', an input to the circuit ''X'', and a specific integer ''n'', whether the integer ''n'' is in the output of the circuit ''C'' when provided with input ''X''. The computational complexity of this problem depends on the type of gates allowed in the circuit ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''John William Colenso''' (24 January 1814 – 20 June 1883) was a British mathematician, theologian, [[Biblical scholar]] and social activist, who was the first [[Church of England]] [[Bishop of Natal]].

==Early life and education==
Colenso was born at [[St Austell]], Cornwall, on 24 January 1814. His father (John William Colenso) invested his capital into a mineral works in [[Pentewan]], Cornwall, but the speculation proved to be ruinous when the investment was lost following a sea flood. His cousin was [[William Colenso]], a missionary in New Zealand.

Family financial problems meant that Colenso had to take a job as an [[Usher (occupation)|usher]] in a private school before he could attend university.  These earnings and a loan of £30 raised by his relatives paid for his first year at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] where he was a [[sizar]] scholar. In 1836 he was [[Second Wrangler]] and [[Smith's Prize]]man at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and in 1837 he became fellow of St John's.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CLNS832JW|name=Colenso, John William}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he went to [[Harrow School]] as mathematical tutor, but the step proved an unfortunate one. The school was at its lowest ebb, and Colenso not only had few pupils, but lost most of his property in a fire. He returned to Cambridge burdened by an enormous debt of £5,000.  However, within a relatively short period of time he paid off this debt by diligent tutoring and the sale to [[Longmans]] of his copyright interest in the highly successful and widely read manuals he had written on algebra  (in 1841) and arithmetic (in 1843).

==Career==
Colenso's early theological thinking was heavily influenced by [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]] to whom he was introduced by his wife and by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].

In 1846 he became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Forncett St Mary]], Norfolk, and in 1853 he was recruited by the [[Archbishop of Cape Town|Bishop of Cape Town]], [[Robert Gray (bishop)|Robert Gray]], to be the first [[Bishop of Natal]].&lt;ref name="Guy2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josephine Guy|title=The Victorian Age: An Anthology of Sources and Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gYVtbXLvBQC&amp;pg=PA299|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=4 January 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-00904-8|pages=299–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in Africa===
Colenso was a significant figure in the history of the published word in nineteenth century South Africa. He first wrote a short but vivid account of his initial journeying in Natal, ''Ten Weeks in Natal: A Journal of a First Tour of Visitation Among the Colonists and Zulu Kaffirs of Natal'' (Cambridge, 1855). Using the printing press he brought to his missionary station at Ekukhanyeni in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], and with William Ngidi he published the first [[Zulu language|Zulu]] Grammar and English/Zulu dictionary.&lt;ref name="Colenso1861"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Colenso (bp. of Natal.)|title=Zulu-English dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpACAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP5|accessdate=18 September 2013|year=1861|publisher=Davis|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colenso1890"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Colenso|title=First Steps in Zulu: Being an Elementary Grammar of the Zulu Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exsOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=18 September 2013|year=1890|publisher=P. Davis &amp; Sons|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1859 journey across Zululand to visit [[Mpande]] (the then Zulu King) and meet with [[Cetshwayo]] (Mpande's son and the Zulu King at the time of the Zulu War) was recorded in his book ''First Steps of the Zulu Mission''.&lt;ref name="Colenso1860"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Colenso|title=First Steps of the Zulu Mission (October 1859)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2s5AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=1860|publisher=Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same journey was also described in the first book written by native South Africans in Zulu – ''Three Native Accounts'' by [[Magema Fuze]], Ndiyane and William Ngidi.&lt;ref name="Colenso1901"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Colenso|title=Three Native Accounts of the Visit of the Bishop of Natal in September and October, 1859, to Umpande, King of the Zulus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dr0OAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=1901|publisher=Vause, Slatter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also translated the [[New Testament]] and other portions of Scripture into Zulu.

===Religious debate===
Through the influence of his talented and well-educated wife, Colenso became one of only a handful of theologians to embrace [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]], who was raised a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] but joined the Church of England to help it "purify and elevate the mind of the nation".&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald R. Morris|title=The Washing of the Spears: A History of the Rise of the Zulu Nation Under Shaka and Its Fall in the Zulu War of 1879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=29n4ZHp17fIC&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=1998|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-80866-1|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his missionary career Colenso's volume of sermons dedicated to [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]] signalled the critical approach he would later apply to biblical interpretation and the baleful impact on native Africans of colonial expansion in southern Africa.

Colenso first courted controversy with the publication in 1855 of his ''Remarks on the Proper Treatment of Polygamy'';&lt;ref name="Colenso1855"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Colenso|title=Remarks on the Proper Treatment of Cases of Polygamy Converts from Heathensm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-npMgEACAAJ|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=1855|publisher=May &amp; Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most cogent Christian-based arguments for tolerance of polygamy.&lt;ref name="Kaplan1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Kaplan|title=Indigenous Responses to Western Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgzexEv4Y6YC|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=1995|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-4649-3|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colenso's experiences in Natal informed his development as a religious thinker. In his commentary upon St Paul's ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' (1861) &lt;ref name="Colenso2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John William Colenso|author2=Jonathan A. Draper,  (ed.)|title=Commentary on Romans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nmQRAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 September 2013|year=2003|publisher=Cluster Publications|isbn=978-1-875053-30-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he countered the doctrine of eternal punishment and the contention that Holy Communion was a precondition to salvation.  Colenso, as a missionary, would not preach that the ancestors of newly Christianised Africans were condemned to eternal damnation.  The thought provoking questions put to him by students at his missionary station encouraged him to re-examine the contents of the ''[[Pentateuch]]'' and the ''[[Book of Joshua]]'' and question whether certain sections of these books should be understood as literally or historically accurate. His conclusions, positive and negative, were published in a series of treatises on the ''[[Pentateuch]]'' and the ''[[Book of Joshua]]'', over a period of time from 1862 to 1879.&lt;ref name="Colenso1862"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Colenso|title=The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua Critically Examined|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWwXAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=1862|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts &amp; Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colenso1865"&gt;{{cite book|author=John William Colenso (bp. of Natal.)|title=The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua critically examined. (People's ed.). Empty Field|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJ0CAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP19|accessdate=18 September 2013|year=1865|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication of these volumes created a scandal in England and were the cause of a number of anguished and patronising counter-blasts from those (clergy and laity alike) who refused to countenance the possibility of biblical fallibility. Colenso's work attracted the notice of biblical scholars on the continent such as [[Abraham Kuenen]] and played an important contribution in the development of biblical scholarship&lt;ref name="Larsen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Larsen|title=Contested Christianity: The Political and Social Contexts of Victorian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjzepnomLz8C|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=2004|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=978-0-918954-93-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colenso's biblical criticism and his high-minded views about the treatment of African natives created a frenzy of alarm and opposition from the [[High Church]] party in South Africa and in England.  As controversy raged in England, the South African bishops headed by [[Robert Gray (bishop)|Bishop Gray]] pronounced Colenso's deposition in December 1863.{{sfn|Draper|2003|pp=306-325}} Colenso, who had refused to appear before this tribunal otherwise than by sending a proxy protest (delivered by his friend [[Wilhelm Bleek]]), appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London.  The Privy Council eventually decided that the Bishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Cape Town|Cape Town]] had no coercive jurisdiction and no authority to interfere with the [[Bishop of Natal]]. In view of this finding of ''[[ultra vires]]'' there was no opinion given upon the allegations of heresy made against Colenso.  The first [[Lambeth Conference]] was convened in 1867 to address concerns raised by the Privy Council's decision in favour of Colenso.

His adversaries, though unable to remove him from his episcopal office, succeeded in restricting his ability to preach both in Natal and in England.  Bishop Gray not only excommunicated him but consecrated a rival bishop ([[William Macrorie|W.K. Macrorie]]), who took the title of "Bishop of Maritzburg" (the latter a common name for [[Pietermaritzburg]]). The contributions of the missionary societies were withdrawn, but an attempt to deprive him of his episcopal income and the control of St Peter's Cathedral in Pietermaritzburg was frustrated by another court ruling. Colenso, encouraged by a handsome testimonial raised in England to which many clergymen subscribed, returned to his diocese. A rival cathedral was built but it has long been sold and moved. The new Cathedral of the Nativity, beside St Peter's, honours both Bishop Colenso and Bishop Macrorie in the names it has given to its halls.

===Advocacy of native African causes===

Colenso devoted the latter years of his life to further labours as a biblical commentator and as an advocate for native Africans in Natal and Zululand who had been unjustly treated by the colonial regime in Natal.  In 1874 he took up the cause of [[Langalibalele]] and the Hlubi and Ngwe tribes in representations to the Colonial Secretary, [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]].&lt;ref name="FrereColenso2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bartle Frere|author2=John William Colenso|title=The Zulu War: Correspondence Between His Excellency the High Commissioner and the Bishop of Natal Referring to the Present Invasion of Zululand, with Extracts from the Blue Books and Additional Information from Other Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zR79cQAACAAJ|accessdate=19 September 2013|year=2000|publisher=Archival Publ. Internat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Langalibalele had been falsely accused of rebellion in 1873 and, following a charade of a trial, was found guilty and imprisoned on [[Robben Island]].  In taking the side of Langalibalele against the Colonial regime in Natal and [[Theophilus Shepstone]], the Secretary for Native Affairs, Colenso found himself even further estranged from colonial society in Natal.

Colenso's concern about the misleading information that was being provided to the Colonial Secretary in London by Shepstone and the Governor of Natal prompted him to devote much of the final part of his life to championing the cause of the [[Zulu people|Zulus]] against [[Boer]] oppression and [[Anglo-Zulu War|official encroachments]].  He was a prominent critic of [[Sir Bartle Frere]]'s efforts to depict the Zulu kingdom as a threat to Natal.  Following the conclusion of the Anglo-Zulu War he interceded on behalf of [[Cetshwayo]] with the British government and succeeded in getting him released from Robben Island and returned to Zululand.

He was known as Sobantu (father of the people) to the native Africans in Natal and had a close relationship with members of the Zulu royal family; one of whom, Mkhungo (a son of Mpande), was taught at his school in Bishopstowe. After his death his wife and daughters continued his work supporting the Zulu cause and the organisation{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} that eventually became the [[African National Congress]].

===Polygenism===

Colenso was a [[polygenist]]; he believed in CoAdamism that races had been created separately. Colenso pointed to monuments and artifacts in Egypt to debunk monogenist beliefs that all races came from the same stock. Ancient Egyptian representations of races for example showed exactly how the races looked today. Egyptological evidence indicated the existence of remarkable permanent differences in the shape of the skull, bodily form, colour and physiognomy between different races which are difficult to reconcile with biblical monogenesis. Colenso believed that racial variation between races was so great, that there was no way all the races could have come from the same stock just a few thousand years ago, he was unconvinced that the climate could change racial variation, he also with other biblical polygenists believed that monogenists had interpreted the bible wrongly.&lt;ref name="Kidd2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNT3q1HjY_MC|accessdate=18 September 2013|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45753-8|pages=153–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Colenso said “It seems most probable that the human race, as it now exists, had really sprung from more than one pair”. Colenso denied that polygenism caused any kind of racist attitudes or practices, like many other polygenists he claimed that monogenesis was the cause of slavery and racism. Colenso claimed that each race had sprung from a different pair of parents, and that all races had been created equal by God.&lt;ref name="Kidd2006" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
Colenso died at [[Durban]] on 20 June 1883. His daughter [[Frances Ellen Colenso]] (1849–1887) published two books on the relations of the Zulus to the British (''History of the Zulu War and Its Origin''&lt;ref name="FColenso1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances Colenso|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7o_CAjp1qlUC|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=22 September 2011|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-1-108-03209-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1880 and ''The Ruin of Zululand''&lt;ref name="Colenso2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances Ellen Colenso|title=The Ruin of Zululand: An Account of British Doings in Zululand Since the Invasion of 1879, Volume 1...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8t7DuQAACAAJ|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=6 March 2012|publisher=[[Nabu Press]]|isbn=978-1-277-20515-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1885) that explained recent events in Zululand from a pro-Zulu perspective.  His oldest daughter, Harriette E Colenso (b. 1847), took up Colenso's mantle as advocate for the Zulus in opposition to their treatment by the authorities appointed by Natal, especially in the case of [[Dinizulu]] in 1888–1889 and in 1908–1909.

==Personal life==
Colenso married Sarah Frances Bunyon in 1846,&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; and they had five children, Harriet Emily, [[Frances Ellen Colenso|Frances Ellen]], Robert John, Francis "Frank" Ernest, and Agnes.  (In the marriage register, her name is spelt Bunyan. There had long been variations in the spelling of a surname that goes back at least to the 12th century in England and in Normandy.)

==In popular culture==
* In the 1979 film ''[[Zulu Dawn]]'', Colenso is sympathetically portrayed by [[Freddie Jones]], as a principled critic of the decision to declare war on [[Cetshwayo]] and the Zulus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4503">The '''knower paradox''' is a [[paradox]] belonging to the family of the paradoxes of [[self-reference]] (like the [[liar paradox]]). Informally, it consists in considering a sentence saying of itself that it is not known, and apparently deriving the contradiction that such sentence is both not known and known.   

==History==

A version of the paradox occurs already in chapter 9 of [[Thomas Bradwardine]]’s ''Insolubilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Bradwardine, T. (2010), ''Insolubilia'', Latin text and English translation by Stephen Read, Peeters, Leuven.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the modern discussion of the paradoxes of self-reference, the paradox has been rediscovered (and dubbed with its current name) by the US logicians and philosophers [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]] and [[Richard Montague]],&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, D. and Montague, R. (1960), 'A Paradox Regained', ''Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic'' '''1''', pp. 79–90.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered an important paradox in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Sainsbury, M. (2009), ''Paradoxes'', 3rd edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 115–120.&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox bears connections with other [[epistemology|epistemic]] paradoxes such as the [[hangman paradox]] and the [[Fitch's paradox of knowability|paradox of knowability]].

==Formulation==

The notion of [[knowledge]] seems to be governed by the principle that knowledge is [[presupposition#Factive verbs|factive]]:

:(KF): If the sentence ' ''P'' ' is known, then ''P''

(where we use single quotes to refer to the linguistic expression inside the quotes and where 'is known' is short for 'is known by someone at some time'). It also seems to be governed by the principle that [[mathematical proof|proof]] yields knowledge:

:(PK): If the sentence ' ''P'' ' has been proved, then ' ''P'' ' is known

Consider however the sentence:

:(K): (K) is not known

Assume for [[reductio ad absurdum]] that (K) is known. Then, by (KF), (K) is not known, and so, by ''reductio ad absurdum'', (K) is not known. Now, this conclusion, which is the sentence (K) itself, depends on no undischarged assumptions, and so has just been proved. Therefore, by (PK), we can further conclude that (K) is known. Putting the two conclusions together, we have the contradiction that (K) is both not known and known.

==Solutions==

Since, given the [[diagonal lemma]], every sufficiently strong theory will have to accept something like (K), absurdity can only be avoided either by rejecting one of the two principles of knowledge (KF) and (PK) or by rejecting [[classical logic]] (which validates the reasoning from (KF) and (PK) to absurdity). The first kind of strategy subdivides in several alternatives. One approach takes its inspiration from the hierarchy of [[truth predicate|truth predicates]] familiar from [[Alfred Tarski]]'s work on the Liar paradox and constructs a similar hierarchy of knowledge predicates.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, A. (1983), 'The Paradox of the Knower', ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''80''', pp. 338–355.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach upholds a single knowledge predicate but takes the paradox to call into doubt either the unrestricted validity of (PK)&lt;ref&gt;Maitzen, S. (1998), 'The Knower Paradox and Epistemic Closure', ''Synthese'' '''114''', pp. 337–354.&lt;/ref&gt; or at least knowledge of (KF).&lt;ref&gt;Cross, C. (2001), 'The Paradox of the Knower without Epistemic Closure', ''Mind'' '''110''', pp. 319–333.&lt;/ref&gt; The second kind of strategy also subdivides in several alternatives. One approach rejects the [[law of excluded middle]] and consequently ''reductio ad absurdum''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern, L. (1986), 'A First Order Theory of Planning, Knowledge and Action', in Halpern, J. (ed.), ''Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Knowledge: Proceedings of the 1986 Conference'', Morgan Kaufmann, Los Altos, pp. 99–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach upholds ''reductio ad absurdum'' and thus accepts the conclusion that (K) is both not known and known, thereby rejecting the [[law of noncontradiction|law of non-contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Priest, G. (1991), 'Intensional Paradoxes', ''Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic'' '''32''', pp. 193–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">In [[coding theory]], the '''Lee distance''' is a [[distance]] between two [[String (computer science)|string]]s &lt;math&gt;x_1 x_2 \dots x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_1 y_2 \dots y_n&lt;/math&gt; of equal length ''n'' over the ''q''-ary [[alphabet]] {0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1} of size ''q''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2.
It is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]], defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \min(|x_i-y_i|,q-|x_i-y_i|).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Deza" /&gt;

Considering the alphabet as the additive group [[modulo arithmetic|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;]], the Lee distance between two single letters &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the length of shortest path in the [[Cayley graph]] (which is circular since the group is cyclic) between them.&lt;ref name="Blahut2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard E. |last=Blahut |title=Algebraic Codes on Lines, Planes, and Curves: An Engineering Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-46946-3 |page=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;q = 2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;q = 3&lt;/math&gt;  the Lee distance coincides with the [[Hamming distance]], because both distances are 0 for two single equal symbols and 1 for two single non-equal symbols. For &lt;math&gt;q &gt; 3&lt;/math&gt; this is not the case anymore, the Lee distance can become bigger than 1.

The [[metric space]] induced by the Lee distance is a discrete analog of the [[Elliptic geometry|elliptic space]].&lt;ref name="Deza"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Deza |first1=Elena |first2=Michel |last2=Deza |author2-link=Michel Deza |title=Dictionary of Distances |year=2014 |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9783662443422 |page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
If ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6, then the Lee distance between 3140 and 2543 is 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6.

==History and application==
The Lee distance is named after [[C. Y. Lee (mathematician)|C. Y. Lee]]. It is applied for phase [[modulation]] while the Hamming distance is used in case of orthogonal modulation.

The [[Berlekamp code]] is an example of code in the Lee metric.&lt;ref name="Roth2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ron |last=Roth |title=Introduction to Coding Theory |date=2006 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-84504-5 |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant examples are the [[Preparata code]] and [[Kerdock code]]; these codes are non-linear when considered over a field, but are [[ring-linear code|linear over a ring]].&lt;ref name="Greferath2009"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Sala |editor-first1=Massimiliano |editor-last2=Mora |editor-first2=Teo |editor-last3=Perret |editor-first3=Ludovic |editor-last4=Sakata |editor-first4=Shojiro |editor-last5=Traverso |editor-first5=Carlo |title=Gröbner Bases, Coding, and Cryptography |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=978-3-540-93806-4 |chapter=An Introduction to Ring-Linear Coding Theory |author-first=Marcus |author-last=Greferath |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there exists a [[Gray isometry]] (bijection preserving weight) between &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Lee weight]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2^2&lt;/math&gt; with the [[Hamming weight]].&lt;ref name="Greferath2009"/&gt;

In [[computer science]], a '''logical shift''' is a [[bitwise operation]] that shifts all the bits of its operand. The two base variants are the '''logical left shift''' and the '''logical right shift'''. This is further modulated by the number of bit positions a given value shall be shifted, such as ''shift left by 1'' or ''shift right by n''. Unlike an [[arithmetic shift]], a logical shift does not preserve a number's sign bit or distinguish a number's [[exponent]] from its [[significand]] (mantissa); every bit in the operand is simply moved a given number of bit positions, and the vacant bit-positions are filled, usually with zeros, and possibly ones (contrast with a [[circular shift]]).

A logical shift is often used when its operand is being treated as a [[sequence]] of bits instead of as a number.

Logical shifts can be useful as efficient ways to perform multiplication or division of unsigned [[integer]]s by powers of two. Shifting left by ''n'' bits on a signed or unsigned binary number has the effect of multiplying it by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Shifting right by ''n'' bits on an ''unsigned'' binary number has the effect of dividing it by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (rounding towards 0).

Logical right shift differs from arithmetic right shift. Thus, many languages have different [[operator (programming)|operators]] for them. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaScript]], the logical right shift operator is &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, but the arithmetic right shift operator is &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. (Java has only one left shift operator (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;), because left shift via logic and arithmetic have the same effect.)

The [[programming language]]s [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]], however, have only one right shift operator, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Most C and C++ implementations, and Go, choose which right shift to perform depending on the type of integer being shifted: signed integers are shifted using the arithmetic shift, and unsigned integers are shifted using the logical shift.

All currently relevant C standards (ISO/IEC 9899:1999 to 2011) leave a definition gap for cases where the number of shifts is equal to or bigger than the number of bits in the operands in a way that the result is undefined. This helps allow C compilers to emit efficient code for various platforms by allowing direct use of the native shift instructions which have differing behavior. For example, shift-left-word in [[PowerPC]] chooses the more-intuitive behavior where shifting by the bit width or above gives zero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PowerPC Instruction Set: slw |url=http://pds.twi.tudelft.nl/vakken/in101/labcourse/instruction-set/slw.html |website=pds.twi.tudelft.nl |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas SHL in [[x86]] chooses to mask the shift amount to the lower bits ''to reduce the maximum execution time of the instructions'', and as such a shift by the bit width doesn't change the value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=x86 Instruction Set Reference|url=http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_285.html|website=x86.renejeschke.de|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages, such as the [[.NET Framework]] and [[LLVM]], also leave shifting by the bit width and above ''unspecified'' (.NET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opcodes.Shl Field|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.shl.aspx|website=msdn.microsoft.com|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''undefined'' (LLVM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLVM Language Reference Manual - shl Instruction|url=http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#shl-instruction|website=llvm.org|publisher=LLVM Project|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others choose to specify the behavior of their most common target platforms, such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] which specifies the x86 behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;&lt; Operator (C# Reference)|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a1sway8w.aspx|website=msdn.microsoft.com|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
If the bit sequence 0001 0111 (decimal 23) is logically shifted by one bit position, then:

{|
| Shift left yields: 0010 1110 (decimal 46)
[[File:Rotate left logically.svg|thumb|left|300px|Logical left shift one bit]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11250">In [[mathematics]], the '''Mahler measure''' &lt;math&gt;M(p)&lt;/math&gt; '''of a [[polynomial]]''' &lt;math&gt;p(z) &lt;/math&gt; with [[complex number|complex]] [[coefficient]]s is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;M(p) = |a|\prod_{|\alpha_i| \ge 1} |\alpha_i| = |a| \prod_{i=1}^n \max\{1,|\alpha_i|\},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p(z) &lt;/math&gt; factorizes over the complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;p(z) = a(z-\alpha_1)(z-\alpha_2)\cdots(z-\alpha_n).&lt;/math&gt;

The Mahler measure can be viewed as a kind of [[Height of a polynomial|height function]]. Using [[Jensen's formula]], it can be proved that this measure is also equal to the [[geometric mean]] of &lt;math&gt;|p(z)| &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; on the [[unit circle]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;|z| = 1&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;M(p) = \exp\left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \ln(|p(e^{i\theta})|)\, d\theta \right).&lt;/math&gt;

By extension, the '''Mahler measure of an [[algebraic number]]''' &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the Mahler measure of the [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Pisot number]] or a [[Salem number]], then its Mahler measure is simply &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The Mahler measure is named after the German-born Australian [[mathematician]] [[Kurt Mahler]].

* The '''Mahler measure''' is multiplicative: &lt;math&gt;\forall p, q, \,\, M(p \cdot q) = M(p) \cdot M(q).&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;M(p) = \lim_{\tau \rightarrow 0} \|p\|_{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\, \|p\|_\tau =\left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} |p(e^{i\theta})|^\tau \, d\theta \right)^{1/\tau}  \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lp norm|&lt;math&gt;L_\tau&lt;/math&gt; norm]] of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Although this is not a true norm for values of &lt;math&gt;\tau &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kronecker's Theorem''': If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible monic integer polynomial with &lt;math&gt;M(p) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then either &lt;math&gt;p(z) = z,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[cyclotomic polynomial]].
* ''([[Lehmer's conjecture]])'' There is a constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible integer polynomial, then either &lt;math&gt;M(p)=1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;M(p)&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
* The Mahler measure of a monic integer polynomial is a [[Perron number]].

== Higher-dimensional Mahler measure ==

The Mahler measure &lt;math&gt;M(p)&lt;/math&gt; of a multi-variable polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]&lt;/math&gt; is defined similarly by the formula&lt;ref name=Sch224&gt;{{harvnb|Schinzel|2000|page=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M(p) = \exp\left( \frac{1}{(2\pi)^n} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \cdots \int_0^{2\pi} \log \Bigl( \bigl |p(e^{i\theta_1}, e^{i\theta_2}, \ldots, e^{i\theta_n}) \bigr| \Bigr) \, d\theta_1\, d\theta_2\cdots d\theta_n \right).&lt;/math&gt;
It inherits the above three properties of the Mahler measure for a one-variable polynomial.

The multi-variable Mahler measure has been shown, in some cases, to be related to special values
of [[zeta function|zeta-functions]] and [[L function|&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-functions]]. For example, in 1981, Smyth&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; proved the formulas
:&lt;math&gt; m(1+x+y)=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4\pi}L(\chi_{-3},2)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L(\chi_{-3},s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirichlet L-function]], and
:&lt;math&gt; m(1+x+y+z)=\frac{7}{2\pi^2}\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt; ,
where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]]. Here &lt;math&gt; m(P)=\log{M(P)}&lt;/math&gt; is  called the ''logarithmic Mahler measure''.

===Some results by Lawton and Boyd===

From the definition, the Mahler measure is viewed as the integrated values of polynomials over the torus (also see [[Lehmer's conjecture]]). If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; vanishes on the torus &lt;math&gt;(S^1)^n&lt;/math&gt;, then the convergence of the integral defining &lt;math&gt;M(p)&lt;/math&gt; is not obvious, but it is known that &lt;math&gt;M(p)&lt;/math&gt; does converge and is equal to a limit of one-variable Mahler measures,&lt;ref name=Law83&gt;{{harvnb|Lawton|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been conjectured by [[David William Boyd|Boyd]].&lt;ref name=Boyd1981a&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|1981a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boyd1981b&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|1981b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is formulated as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; denote the integers and define &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^N_+=\{r=(r_1,\dots,r_N)\in\mathbb{Z}^N:r_j\ge0\ \text{for}\ 1\le j\le N\}&lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt;Q(z_1,\dots,z_N)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; variables and &lt;math&gt;r=(r_1,\dots,r_N)\in\mathbb{Z}^N_+&lt;/math&gt; define the polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q_r(z)&lt;/math&gt; of one variable by

:&lt;math&gt;Q_r(z):=Q(z^{r_1},\dots,z^{r_N})&lt;/math&gt;

and define &lt;math&gt;q(r)&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;q(r):=\text{min}\{H(s):s=(s_1,\dots,s_N)\in\mathbb{Z}^N,s\ne(0,\dots,0)\ \text{and}\ \sum^N_{j=1}s_jr_j=0\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H(s)=\text{max}\{|s_j|:1\le j\le N\}&lt;/math&gt; .

'''Theorem (Lawton)''' : Let &lt;math&gt;Q(z_1,\dots,z_N)&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial in ''N'' variables with complex coefficients. Then the following limit is valid (even if the condition that &lt;math&gt;r_i\ge0&lt;/math&gt; is relaxed):
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{q(r)\rightarrow\infty}M(Q_r)=M(Q)&lt;/math&gt;

===Boyd's proposal===

Boyd provided more general statements than the above theorem. He pointed out  that the classical [[Kronecker's theorem#A result in diophantine approximation|Kronecker's theorem]], which characterizes monic polynomials with integer coefficients all of whose roots are inside the unit disk, can be regarded as characterizing those polynomials of one variable whose measure is exactly 1, and that this result extends to polynomials in several variables.&lt;ref name=Boyd1981b /&gt;

Define an ''extended cyclotomic polynomial''  to be a polynomial of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(z)=z_1^{b_1} \dots z_n^{b_n}\Phi_m(z_1^{v_1}\dots z_n^{v_n}),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_m(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''m''-th [[cyclotomic polynomial]], the &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are integers, and the &lt;math&gt;b_i=\max(0,-v_i\deg\Phi_m)&lt;/math&gt; are chosen minimally so that &lt;math&gt;\Psi(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in the &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt;. Let  &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; be the set of polynomials that are products of monomials &lt;math&gt;\pm z_1^{c_1}\dots z_n^{c_n}&lt;/math&gt; and extended cyclotomic polynomials.

'''Theorem (Boyd)''' : Let &lt;math&gt; F(z_1,\dots,z_n)\in\mathbb{Z}[z_1,\ldots,z_n]&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Then &lt;math&gt;M(F)=1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;.

This led Boyd to consider the set of values
:&lt;math&gt;L_n:=\bigl\{m(P(z_1,\dots,z_n)):P\in\mathbb{Z}[z_1,\dots,z_n]\bigr\},&lt;/math&gt;
and the union &lt;math&gt;{L}_\infty=\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}L_n&lt;/math&gt;. He made the far-reaching conjecture&lt;ref name=Boyd1981a /&gt; that the set of &lt;math&gt;{L}_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. An immediate consequence of this conjecture would be the truth of Lehmer's conjecture, albeit without an explicit lower bound. As Smyth's result suggests that &lt;math&gt;L_1\subsetneqq L_2&lt;/math&gt; , Boyd further conjectures that
:&lt;math&gt;L_1\subsetneqq L_2\subsetneqq L_3\subsetneqq\ \cdots\,.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2617">In [[mathematics]], '''Maillet's determinant''' ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[determinant]] of the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] introduced by {{harvtxt|Maillet|1913}}  whose entries are ''R''(''s/r'') for ''s'',''r'' = 1, 2, ..., (''p''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1)/2 ∈ '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' for an odd prime ''p'', where  and ''R''(''a'') is the least positive residue of ''a''&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;''p'' {{harv|Muir|1930|loc=pages 340–342}}. {{harvtxt|Malo|1914}} calculated the determinant ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and found that in these cases it is given by (–''p'')&lt;sup&gt;(''p''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;3)/2&lt;/sup&gt;, and conjectured that it is given by this formula in general. {{harvtxt|Carlitz|Olson|1955}} showed that this conjecture is incorrect; the determinant in general is given by ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = (–''p'')&lt;sup&gt;(''p''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;3)/2&lt;/sup&gt;''h''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the first factor of the [[Ideal class group|class number]] of the [[cyclotomic field]] generated by ''p''th roots of 1, which happens to be 1 for ''p'' less than 23. In particular this verifies Maillet's conjecture that the determinant is always non-zero. Chowla and Weil had previously found the same formula but did not publish it.
Their results have been extended to all non-prime odd numbers by K. Wang(1982).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13393">The notion of '''non-malleable codes''' was introduced in 2010 by Dziembowski, Pietrzak, and Wichs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dziembowski|first=Stefan|last2=Pietrzak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Wichs|first3=Daniel|date=2009-01-01|title=Non-Malleable Codes|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/608}}&lt;/ref&gt; for relaxing the notion of [[Error correction and detection|error-correction and error-detection]]. Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message contained in a modified [[code-word]] is either the original message, or a completely unrelated value. Non-malleable codes provide a useful and meaningful security guarantee in situations where traditional [[Error correction and detection|error-correction and error-detection]] is impossible; for example, when the [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] can completely overwrite the encoded message. Although such codes do not exist if the family of "[[Tampering (crime)|tampering]] functions" F is completely unrestricted, they are known to exist for many broad tampering families F.

== Background Knowledge ==

=== Tampering Experiment ===
To know the operation schema of non-malleable code, we have to have a knowledge of the basic experiment it based on. The following is the three step method of [[Tampering with evidence|tampering]] experiment.
# A ''source message'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is [[Encode/Decode|encoded]] via a (possibly randomized) procedure &lt;math&gt;Enc&lt;/math&gt;, yielding a ''[[code-word]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;Enc(s)&lt;/math&gt;.
# The code-word is modified under some ''tampering-function'' &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt; to an erroneous-code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.
# The erroneous-code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt; is decoded using a procedure &lt;math&gt; Dec &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in a decoded-message  &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;Dec(c^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

The tampering experiment can be used to model several interesting real-world settings, such as data transmitted over a [[Noisy channel model|noisy channel]], or adversarial tampering of data stored in the memory of a physical device. Having this experimental base, we would like to build special encoding/decoding procedures &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt;, which give us some meaningful guarantees about the results of the above tampering experiment, for large and interesting families &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of tampering functions. The following are several possibilities for the type of guarantees that we may hope for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faust|first1=Sebastian|last2=Mukherjee|first2=Pratyay|last3=Venturi|first3=Daniele|last4=Wichs|first4=Daniel|title=Efficient Non-Malleable Codes and Key-Derivation for Poly-Size Tampering Circuits|journal=Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2014|volume= 8441|pages=111–128|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/198993/files/Efficient_Non-Malleable_Codes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error correction ===
One very natural guarantee, called [[Error detection and correction|error-correction]], would be to require that for any tampering function and any ''source-message s'', the tampering experiment always produces the correct decoded message  &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication theory of secrecy systems|last = E. Shannon|first = Claude|date = 1949|journal = Bell System Technical Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error detection ===
A weaker guarantee, called [[Error detection and correction|error-detection]], requires that the tampering-experiment always results in either the correct value &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt; or a special symbol &lt;math&gt;s^* = \perp &lt;/math&gt; indicating that tampering has been detected. This notion of error-detection is a weaker guarantee than error-correction, and achievable for larger F of tampering functions.

== Algorithm description==
A non-malleable code ensures that either the tampering experiment results in a correct decoded-message  &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt;, or the decoded-message &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt; is completely independent of and unrelated to the ''source-message'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. In other word, the notion of non-malleability for codes is similar, in spirit, to notions of non-malleability for cryptographic primitives (such as encryption2, commitments and zero-knowledge proofs), introduced by the seminal work of Dolev, Dwork and Naor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolev|first1=Danny|last2=Dwork|first2=Cynthia|last3=Moni|first3=Naor|title=Non-Malleable Cryptography|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|date=Mar 24, 2000|page=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=9A853A59C3A45DD1B67690F10232D635?doi=10.1.1.26.8267&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|doi=10.1137/s0097539795291562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[Error correction and detection|error correction or error detection]], the "right" formalization of non-malleable codes is somewhat harder to define. Let &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; be a random variable for the value of the decoded-message, which results when we run the tampering experiment with source-message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and tampering-function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, over the randomness of the encoding procedure. Intuitively, we wish to say that the distribution of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the encoded message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, we also want to allow for the case where the tampering experiment results in &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt; (for example, if the tampering function is identity), which clearly depends on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, we require that for every tampering-function &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; which outputs either concrete values &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt; or a special same &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol, and faithfully models the distribution of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the following sense: for every source message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the distributions of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; are statistically close when the &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; correctly simulates the "outcome" of the tampering-experiment with a function &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt; without knowing the source-messages &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, but it is allowed some ambiguity by outputting a same &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol to indicate that the decoded-message should be the same as the source-message, without specifying what the exact value is. The fact that &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; depends on only &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and not on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, shows that the outcome of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, exempting equality.

== Relation to error correction/detection ==
Notice that [[Ductility|non-malleability]] is a weaker guarantee than error correction/detection; the latter ensure that any change in the code-word can be corrected or at least detected by the decoding procedure, whereas the former does allow the message to be modified, but only to an unrelated value. However, when studying [[Error detection and correction|error correction/detection]] we usually restrict ourselves to limited forms of tampering which preserve some notion of distance (e.g., usually [[hamming distance]]) between the original and tampered code-word. 
For example, it is already impossible to achieve error correction/detection for the simple family of functions &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; which, for every constant &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;, includes a "[[Mathematical constant|constant]]" function &lt;math&gt;f_{c^*}&lt;/math&gt; that maps all inputs to &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;. There is always some function in &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; that maps everything to a valid code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, it is trivial to construct codes that are non-malleable w.r.t &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt;, as the output of a constant function is clearly independent of its input. The prior works on non-malleable codes show that one can construct non-malleable codes for highly complex tampering function families &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; for which error correction/detection can not be achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dziembowski|first1=Stefan|last2=Pietrzak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Wichs|first3=Daniel|title=Non-Malleable Codes|journal=ICS, 2010|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/608.pdf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application over tampering functions ==

=== Bit-wise independent tampering ===
As one very concrete example, we study [[Non-malleable codes|non-malleability]] with respect to the family of functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; which specify, for each bit of the [[Code word|code-word]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, whether to keep it as is, flip it, set it to 0, set it to 1. That is, each bit of the code-word is modified arbitrarily but independently of the value of the other bits of the code-word. We call this the “bit-wise independent tampering” family &lt;math&gt;F_{BIT}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this family contains constant functions &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; and constant-error functions &lt;math&gt;F_{err}&lt;/math&gt; as subsets. Therefore, as we have mentioned, error-correction and error-detection cannot be achieved w.r.t. this family. Nevertheless, the following can show an efficient non-malleable code for this powerful family.

With &lt;math&gt;F_{BIT}&lt;/math&gt; we denote the family which contains all tampering functions that tamper every bit independently. Formally, this family contains all functions &lt;math&gt;f_i: \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n&lt;/math&gt;  that are defined by n functions&lt;math&gt;f_i: \left\{{0},{1}\right\} \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; (for i=1...n) as &lt;math&gt;f(c_1..c_n)=f_1(c_1)..f_n(c_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that there are only 4 possible choices for each &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. how to modify a particular bit) and we name these “set to 0”, “set to 1”, “flip”, “keep” where the meanings should be intuitive. We call the above family the bit-wise independent tampering family.

=== All families of bounded size ===
* [[Probabilistic]] Method Approach 
For any "small enough" function family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a (possibly inefficient) coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t. F. Moreover, for a fixed "small enough" function family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, a random coding scheme is likely to be non-malleable w.r.t. F with overwhelming probability. Unfortunately, random coding schemes cannot be efficiently represented, nor is the encoding/decoding function likely to be efficient. Therefore, this result should merely be thought of as showing "possibility" and providing a target that we should then strive to match constructively. Moreover, this result also highlights the difference between "error-correction/detection" and "non-malleability" since a result of this form could not be true for the former notions.
 
* [[Random oracle|Random Oracle]] Model Approach
It is not clear what the bound from the theorem&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; of this type actually implies. For example, it does tell us that non-malleable codes exist with respect to all efficient functions, but this is misleading as we know that efficient non-malleable codes (and ultimately we are only interested in such) cannot be non-malleable w.r.t. this class. Nevertheless, the result by the probabilistic method does give us codes which are non-malleable w.r.t. very general classes of functions in the random oracle model.

=== Model of tamper-resilient security ===
In this model, we consider two ways of interacting with the system:

''Execute(''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;''):'' A user can provide the system with Execute(x) queries, for &lt;math&gt;x\in \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^u&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the system computes &lt;math&gt;(y,s^') \gets G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt;, updates the state of the system to &lt;math&gt;s :=s^'&lt;/math&gt; and outputs &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

''Tamper(''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'')'': We also consider tampering attacks against the system, modeled by Tamper(&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) commands, for functions &lt;math&gt;f: \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Upon receiving such command, the system state is set to &lt;math&gt;s := f(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

An attacker that can also interact with the system via Tamper queries can potentially learn significantly more about the secret state, even recover it entirely. Therefore, we would like to have a general method for securing systems against tampering attacks, so that the ability to issue Tamper queries (at least for functions f in some large family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) cannot provide the attacker with additional information. By using non-malleable code for this purpose we have the conclusion: Let &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt; be any coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt; can also be tamper-simulate w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

== Capacity of non-malleable codes ==
# For every family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|F|\leq 2^{2^{\alpha n}}&lt;/math&gt;, there exist non-malleable codes against &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with rate arbitrarily close to 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (this is achieved w.h.p. by a randomized construction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Capacity of Non-Malleable Codes|arxiv= 1309.0458|date = 2013-09-02|first = Mahdi|last = Cheraghchi|first2 = Venkatesan|last2 = Guruswami}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# For families of size &lt;math&gt;exp( n^{O(1)}2^{\alpha n})&lt;/math&gt; against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size).
# 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the best achievable rate for the family of functions which are only allowed to tamper the first &lt;math&gt;\alpha n&lt;/math&gt; bits of the code-word, which is of special interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2945">'''Online optimization''' is a field of [[optimization]] theory, more popular in [[computer science]] and [[operations research]], that deals with optimization problems having no or incomplete knowledge of the future (online). These kind of problems are denoted as online problems and are seen as opposed to the classical optimization problems where complete information is assumed (offline). The research on online optimization can be distinguished into online problems where multiple decisions are made sequentially based on a piece-by-piece input and those where a decision is made only once. A famous online problem where a decision is made only once is the [[Ski rental problem]]. In general, the output of an [[online algorithm]] is compared to the solution of a corresponding offline algorithm which is necessarily always optimal and knows the entire input in advance (competitive analysis).

In many situations, present decisions (for example, resources allocation) must be made with incomplete knowledge of the future or distributional assumptions on the future are not reliable. In such cases, online optimization&lt;ref&gt;Jaillet, Patrick, and Michael R. Wagner. Online Optimization. Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  can be used, which is different from other approaches such as [[robust optimization]], [[stochastic optimization]] and Markov decision processes.

== Online problems ==
A problem exemplifying the concepts of online algorithms is the [[Canadian traveller problem]]. The goal of this problem is to minimize the cost of reaching a target in a weighted graph where some of the edges are unreliable and may have been removed from the graph. However, that an edge has been removed (''failed'') is only revealed to ''the traveller'' when she/he reaches one of the edge's endpoints. The worst case for this problem is simply that all of the unreliable edges fail and the problem reduces to the usual [[shortest path problem]]. An alternative analysis of the problem can be made with the help of competitive analysis. For this method of analysis, the offline algorithm knows in advance which edges will fail and the goal is to minimize the ratio between the online and offline algorithms' performance. This problem is [[PSPACE-complete]].

There are many formal problems that offer more than one ''online algorithm'' as solution:
* [[K-server problem]]
* [[Job shop scheduling|Job shop scheduling problem]]
* [[List update problem]]
* [[Bandit problem]]
* [[Secretary problem]]
* [[Search games]]
* [[Ski rental problem]]
* [[Linear search problem]]
* Portfolio selection problem&lt;ref name=doc16&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dochow|first1=Robert|title=Online Algorithms for the Portfolio Selection Problem|date=2016|publisher=Springer Gabler|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783658135270|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''POODLE''' attack (which stands for "[[Padding oracle attack|Padding Oracle]] On Downgraded Legacy Encryption") is a [[man in the middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] exploit which takes advantage of Internet and security software clients' fallback to [[SSL 3.0]].&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Möller |first1=Bodo |last2=Duong |first2=Thai |last3=Kotowicz |first3=Krzysztof |title=This POODLE Bites: Exploiting The SSL 3.0 Fallback |url=https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf |date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bright |first=Peter |title=SSL broken, again in POODLE attack |publisher=Ars Technica |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2014/10/ssl-broken-again-in-poodle-attack/ |date=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Verge"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandom |first=Russell |title=Google researchers reveal new Poodle bug, putting the web on alert |url= https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/14/6979169/google-researchers-reveal-new-poodle-bug-putting-the-web-on-alert |date=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If attackers successfully exploit this vulnerability, on average, they only need to make 256 SSL 3.0 requests to reveal one byte of encrypted messages. Bodo Möller, Thai Duong and Krzysztof Kotowicz from the [[Google]] Security Team discovered this vulnerability; they disclosed the vulnerability publicly on October 14, 2014 (despite the paper being dated "September 2014" &lt;ref name="paper" /&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html|title=Google Online Security Blog: This POODLE bites: exploiting the SSL 3.0 fallback|work=Google Online Security Blog|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2014 a variation of the POODLE vulnerability that affected [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] was announced.&lt;ref name="poodleagain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html|title=The POODLE bites again|date=December 8, 2014|author=Langley, Adam|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures|CVE-ID]] associated with the original POODLE attack is {{CVE|2014-3566}}.
F5 Networks filed for {{CVE|2014-8730}} as well, see [[#POODLE attack against TLS|POODLE attack against TLS]] section below.

== Exploitation of graceful degradation ==

POODLE exemplifies a vulnerability that succeeds because of a mechanism designed for reducing security for the sake of interoperability. When designing systems in domains with high levels of fragmentation, then, extra care is appropriate. In such domains, graceful security degradation may become common.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
To mitigate the POODLE attack, one approach is to completely disable SSL 3.0 on the client side and the server side. However, some old clients and servers do not support TLS 1.0 and above. Thus, the authors of the paper on POODLE attacks also encourage browser and server implementation of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV,&lt;ref name="rfc7507"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7507 |title=RFC 7507: TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) for Preventing Protocol Downgrade Attacks|author=B. Moeller, A. Langley|date=April 2015|publisher=IETF}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will make downgrade attacks impossible.&lt;ref name="paper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="poddle2" /&gt;

Another mitigation is to implement "anti-POODLE record splitting". It splits the records into several parts and ensures none of them can be attacked. However the problem of the splitting is that, though valid according to the specification, it may also cause compatibility issues due to problems in server-side implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Langley |first=Adam |title=POODLE attacks on SSLv3 |publisher=imperialviolet.org |date=October 14, 2014 |url=https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full list of browser versions and levels of vulnerability to different attacks (including POODLE) can be found in the article [[Transport Layer Security]]. 

[[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 25 implemented this mitigation in addition to TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV.&lt;ref name="opera25"&gt;{{cite web |last=Molland |first=Håvard |title=Security changes in Opera 25; the poodle attacks |work=Opera security blog |publisher=[[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] |date=October 15, 2014 |url=http://blogs.opera.com/security/2014/10/security-changes-opera-25-poodle-attacks/ |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] browser and their servers had already supported TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. Google stated in October 2014 it was planning to remove SSL 3.0 support from their products completely within a few months.&lt;ref name="poddle2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Möller |first=Bodo |title=This POODLE bites: exploiting the SSL 3.0 fallback |work=Google Online Security blog |publisher=Google (via Blogspot) |date=October 14, 2014 |url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html |accessdate=October 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallback to SSL 3.0 has been disabled in Chrome 39, released in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Chrome-39-Disables-SSLv3-Fallback-Awards-41-500-33-000-In-Bounties-465363.shtml | title=Chrome 39 Disables SSLv3 Fallback, Awards $41,500 / €33,000 in Bounties | publisher=Softpedia | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=Ilascu, Ionut}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSL 3.0 has been disabled by default in Chrome 40, released in January 2015.&lt;ref name=chromium693963003&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codereview.chromium.org/693963003|title=Issue 693963003: Add minimum TLS version control to about:flags and Finch gate it. - Code Review|accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mozilla]] disabled SSL 3.0 in [[Firefox]] 34 and ESR 31.3, which were released in December 2014, and added support of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV in Firefox 35.&lt;ref name="mozilla-poodle"&gt;{{cite web |title=The POODLE Attack and the End of SSL 3.0 |work=Mozilla blog |publisher=Mozilla |date=October 14, 2014 |url=https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/10/14/the-poodle-attack-and-the-end-of-ssl-3-0/ |accessdate=October 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microsoft]] published a security advisory to explain how to disable SSL 3.0 in [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] OS,&lt;ref name="microsoft-poodle"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vulnerability in SSL 3.0 Could Allow Information Disclosure |work=Microsoft TechNet |publisher=Microsoft |date=October 14, 2014 |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/security/3009008 |accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 29, 2014, Microsoft released a fix which disables SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer on Windows Vista / Server 2003 and above and announced a plan to disable SSL 3.0 by default in their products and services within a few months.&lt;ref name="microsoft-Oct29"&gt;{{cite web |title=Security Advisory 3009008 revised |work=Microsoft TechNet |publisher=Microsoft |date=October 29, 2014 |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2014/10/29/security-advisory-3009008-released.aspx |accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft disabled fallback to SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer 11 for Protect Mode sites on February 10, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/12/09/december-2014-internet-explorer-security-updates-amp-disabling-ssl-3-0-fallback.aspx | title=December 2014 Internet Explorer security updates &amp; disabling SSL 3.0 fallback | publisher=Microsoft | date=December 9, 2014 | accessdate=9 December 2014 | author=Oot, Alec}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for other sites on April 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/04/14/april-2015-security-updates-for-internet-explorer.aspx | title=February 2015 security updates for Internet Explorer | publisher=IEBlog | date=April 14, 2015 | accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (on OS X 10.8, iOS 8.1 and later) mitigated against POODLE by removing support for all CBC protocols in SSL 3.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6531|title=About Security Update 2014-005|work=apple.com|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6541|title=About the security content of iOS 8.1|work=apple.com|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this left RC4 which is also completely broken by the RC4 attacks in SSL 3.0.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. POODLE was completely mitigated in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan 2015) and iOS 9 (2015).

== POODLE attack against TLS ==
A new variant of the original POODLE attack was announced on December 8, 2014. This attack exploits implementation flaws of [[CBC mode of operation|CBC encryption mode]] in the TLS 1.0 - 1.2 protocols. Even though TLS specifications require servers to check the padding, some implementations fail to validate it properly, which makes some servers vulnerable to POODLE even if they disable SSL 3.0.&lt;ref name="poodleagain" /&gt; SSL Pulse showed "about 10% of the servers are vulnerable to the POODLE attack against TLS" before this vulnerability is announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2014/12/08/poodle-bites-tls | title=Poodle Bites TLS | date=December 8, 2014 | accessdate=December 8, 2014 | author=Ristic, Ivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CVE-ID for F5 Networks' implementation bug is {{CVE|2014-8730}}. The entry in NIST's NVD states that this CVE-ID is to be used only for F5 Networks' implementation of TLS, and that other vendors whose products have the same failure to validate the padding mistake in their implementations like [[A10 Networks]] and [[Cisco Systems]] need to issue their own CVE-IDs for their implementation errors because this is not a flaw in the protocol itself and is a flaw in the protocol's implementation.

The POODLE attack against TLS was found to be easier to initiate than the initial POODLE attack against SSL. There is no need to downgrade clients to SSL 3.0, meaning fewer steps are needed to execute a successful attack. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://freedomhacker.net/nasty-poodle-variant-bypasses-tls-crypto-hitting-major-sites-3506/ | title=Nasty POODLE Variant Bypasses TLS Crypto Affecting Over 10 Percent of the Web | date=December 8, 2014 | accessdate=December 8, 2014 | author=Stosh, Brandon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">Algorithms said to employ a '''Ping-Pong''' scheme exist in different fields of [[Software Engineering]]. They are characterized by an alternation between two entities. In the examples described below, these entities are communication partners, network paths or file blocks.

==Databases==
In most [[DBMS|database management systems]] [[Durability (database systems)|durable]] [[database transaction]]s are supported through a [[Transaction log|log file]]. However, multiple writes to the same page of that file can produce a slim chance of data loss. Assuming for simplicity that the log file is organized in pages whose size matches the [[Block (data storage)|block]] size of its underlying medium, the following problem can occur:

If the very last page of the log file is only partially filled with data and has to be written to permanent storage in this state, the very same page will have to be overwritten during the next write operation. If a [[Crash (computing)|crash]] happens during that later write operation, previously stored log data may be lost.

The Ping-Pong scheme described in ''Transaction Processing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jim|last2=Reuter|first2=Andreas|title=Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques|date=1992|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-190-1|pages=508-509|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; eliminates this problem by alternately writing the contents of said (logical) last page to two different physical pages inside the log file (the actual last page ''i'' and its empty successor ''i+1''). Once said logical log page is no longer the last page (i.e. it is completely filled with log data), it is written one last time to the regular physical position (''i'') inside the log file.

This scheme requires the usage of time stamps for each page in order to distinguish the most recent version of the logical last page one from its predecessor.

==Networking==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

===Internet===
A functionality which lets a computer A find out whether a computer B is reachable and responding is built into the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP). Through an "echo request" Computer A asks B to send back an "Echo response". These two messages are also sometimes called "[[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]" and "pong".

===Routing===
In [[Routing]], a Ping-Pong scheme is a simple algorithm for distributing data packets across
two paths.

If you had two paths &lt;CODE&gt;A&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;B&lt;/CODE&gt;, then the algorithm
would randomly start with one of the paths and then switch back and forth 
between the two.

If you were to get the next path from a function call, it would look like
this in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:

 &lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;
 
 &lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''def'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#9966ff;"&gt;get_next_path&lt;/span&gt;():
     &lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''while'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#cc6600;"&gt;'''True'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:
        &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''yield'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''yield'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

In [[type theory]], a '''polynomial functor''' (or '''container functor''') is a kind of [[endofunctor]] of a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of types that is intimately related to the concept of [[Inductive type|inductive]] and [[Coinduction|coinductive]] types. Specifically, all [[W type|W-types]] (resp. M-types) are (isomorphic to) [[initial algebra]]s (resp. [[final coalgebra]]s) of such functors.

Polynomial functors have been studied in the more general setting of a [[Topos|pretopos]] with Σ-types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moerdijk|first=Ieke|last2=Palmgren|first2=Erik|title=Wellfounded trees in categories|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-0072(00)00012-9|journal=Annals of Pure and Applied Logic|volume=104|issue=1–3|pages=189–218|doi=10.1016/s0168-0072(00)00012-9|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; this article deals only with the applications of this concept inside the category of types of a [[Intuitionistic type theory|Martin-Löf style type theory]].

== Definition ==

Let {{var|U}} be a [[Universe (mathematics)|universe]] of types, let {{var|A}} : {{var|U}}, and let {{var|B}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|U}} be a family of types indexed by {{var|A}}. The pair ({{var|A}}, {{var|B}}) is sometimes called a '''signature'''{{sfn|Ahrens|loc=Definition 1}} or a '''container'''.{{sfn|Abbot|p=4}} The '''polynomial functor''' associated to the container ({{var|A}}, {{var|B}}) is defined as follows:{{sfn|Univalent Foundations Program|2013|loc=Equation 5.4.6}}{{sfn|Ahrens|loc=Definition 2}}{{sfn|Awodey|2012|p=8}}
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P : U &amp;\longrightarrow U \\
  X &amp;\longmapsto \sum_{a:A} (B(a) \to X)
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Any functor naturally isomorphic to {{var|P}} is called a  '''container functor'''.{{sfn|Abbot|p=10}} The action of {{var|P}} on functions is defined by 
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P^* : (X\to Y) &amp;\longrightarrow (P^*X\to P^*Y) \\
  (f, (a,g)) &amp;\longmapsto (a,g\circ f)
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this assignment is not only truly functorial in extensional type theories (see [[#Properties]]).

== Properties ==

In intensional type theories, such functions are not truly functors, because the universe type is not strictly a category (the field of [[homotopy type theory]] is dedicated to exploring how the universe type behaves more like a [[Higher category theory|higher category]]). However, it is functorial up to propositional equalities, that is, the following identity types are inhabited:
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  P^*(f\circ g) &amp;= P^*f\circ P^*g \\
  P^*(\mathsf{id}_X) &amp;= \mathsf{id}_{PX}
\end{align}.
&lt;/math&gt;
for any functions {{var|f}} and {{var|g}} and any type {{var|X}}, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity function]] on the type {{var|X}}.{{sfn|Awodey|2015}}

The following '''proofs of elementary ring properties''' use only the [[axiom]]s that define a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]:

==Basics==

===Multiplication by zero===

'''Theorem:''' &lt;math&gt;0a=a0=0&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2= 

&lt;math&gt;0a=(0+0)a=(0a)+(0a)&lt;/math&gt;

By subtracting (i.e. adding the additive inverse of) &lt;math&gt;0a&lt;/math&gt; on both sides of the equation, we get the desired result. The proof that &lt;math&gt;a0=0&lt;/math&gt; is similar.}}

===Zero ring===
'''Theorem:''' A ring &lt;math&gt;(R, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[zero ring]] (that is, consists of precisely one element) if and only if &lt;math&gt;0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2=

Suppose that &lt;math&gt; 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; be any element in &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;; then &lt;math&gt;a = a \cdot 1 = a \cdot 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;(R, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the zero ring. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;(R, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the zero ring, it must contain precisely one element. Therefore, &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; is the same element, i.e. &lt;math&gt; 0=1 &lt;/math&gt;.}}

===Multiplication by negative one===

'''Theorem:''' &lt;math&gt;(-1)a=-a&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2=

&lt;math&gt;(-1)\cdot a+a=(-1)\cdot a+1\cdot a=((-1)+1)\cdot a=0\cdot a=0&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;(-1)\cdot a = (-1)\cdot a + 0 = (-1) \cdot a + (a + (-a))= ((-1) \cdot a + a) + (-a) = 0 + (-a) = (-a)&lt;/math&gt;.}}

===Multiplication by additive inverse===
'''Theorem:''' &lt;math&gt;(-a) \cdot b= a \cdot (-b) = -(ab)&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2=

To prove that the first expression equals the second one,
&lt;math&gt;(-a)\cdot b = ((-1) \cdot a) \cdot b =  (a \cdot (-1)) \cdot b = a\cdot ((-1) \cdot b) = a(-b).&lt;/math&gt;

To prove that the first expression equals the third one,
&lt;math&gt;(-a) \cdot b = ((-1) \cdot a) \cdot b = (-1) \cdot (a \cdot b).&lt;/math&gt;

A [[pseudo-ring]] does not necessarily have a multiplicative identity element. 
To prove that the first expression equals the third one without assuming the 
existence of a multiplicative identity, we show that &lt;math&gt;(-a) \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; is
indeed the inverse of &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b)&lt;/math&gt; by showing that adding them up results in
the additive identity element,
&lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) + (-a) \cdot b = (a - a) \cdot b = 0 \cdot b = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[quantum information theory]], a '''quantum circuit''' is a [[model (abstract)|model]] for [[quantum computation]] in which a computation is a sequence of [[quantum gate]]s, which are reversible transformations on a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Quantum register|analog]] of an ''n''-[[bit]] [[Processor register|register]]. This analogous structure is referred to as an ''n''-[[qubit]] register.

== Reversible classical logic gates ==

The elementary [[logic gate]]s of a classical computer, other than the [[NOT gate]], are not [[Reversible computing|reversible]]. Thus, for instance, for an [[AND gate]] one cannot recover the two input bits from the output bit; for example, if the output bit is 0, we cannot tell from this whether the input bits are 0,1 or 1,0  or 0,0.

However, reversible gates in classical computers are easily constructed for bit strings of any length; moreover, these are actually of practical interest, since irreversible gates must always increase physical [[entropy]]. A reversible gate is a reversible function on  ''n''-bit data that returns  ''n''-bit data,  where an ''n''-bit data is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of bits ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;  of length  ''n''.   The set of ''n''-bit data is the space {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which consists of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; strings of 0's and 1's.

More precisely: an ''n''-bit reversible gate is a [[bijective]] mapping ''f'' from the set {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''n''-bit data onto itself.
An example of such a reversible gate ''f'' is a mapping that applies a fixed permutation to its inputs.
For reasons of practical engineering, one typically studies gates only for small values of ''n'', e.g. ''n''=1, ''n''=2 or ''n''=3.  These gates can be easily described by tables.

== Quantum logic gates ==

To define quantum gates, we first need to specify the quantum replacement of an ''n''-bit datum. The ''quantized version'' of classical ''n''-bit space {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Hilbert space]]

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\operatorname{QB}(n)}= \ell^2(\{0,1\}^n).&lt;/math&gt;

This is by definition the space of complex-valued functions on {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and is naturally an [[inner product space]].   This space can also be regarded as consisting of linear superpositions of classical bit strings. Note that  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;QB(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector space over the complex numbers of [[dimension]] 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The elements of this space are called ''n''-qubits.

Using Dirac [[bra-ket|ket]] notation, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a classical bit string, then 
:&lt;math&gt; | x_1, x_2, \cdots,x_n \rangle \quad &lt;/math&gt;
is a special  ''n''-qubit corresponding to the function which maps this classical bit string to 1 and maps all other bit strings to 0; these 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; special ''n''-qubits are called ''computational basis states''. All ''n''-qubits are complex linear combinations of these computational basis states.

Quantum logic gates, in contrast to classical logic gates, are always reversible. One requires a special kind of reversible function, namely a [[unitarity (physics)|unitary]] mapping, that is, a linear transformation of a complex [[inner product space]] that preserves the [[Hermitian inner product]].  An ''n''-qubit (reversible) quantum gate is a [[unitary operators|unitary mapping]] ''U'' from the space  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;QB(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt; of ''n''-qubits onto itself.

Typically, we are only interested in gates for small values of ''n''.

A reversible ''n''-bit classical logic gate gives rise to a reversible ''n''-bit quantum gate as follows:  to each reversible ''n''-bit logic gate ''f''  corresponds a quantum gate ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; W_f( | x_1, x_2, \cdots,x_n \rangle) = |f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;
Note that ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; permutes the computational basis states.

Of particular importance is the controlled NOT gate (also called [[Controlled NOT gate|CNOT]] gate) ''W''&lt;sub&gt;CNOT&lt;/sub&gt; defined on a quantized 2 qubit.  Other examples of quantum logic gates derived from classical ones are the [[Toffoli gate]] and the [[Fredkin gate]].

However, the Hilbert-space structure of the qubits permits many quantum gates that are not induced by classical ones. For example, a relative phase shift is a 1 qubit gate given by multiplication by the unitary matrix:
:&lt;math&gt; U_\theta =\begin{bmatrix} e^{i \theta} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;
so 
:&lt;math&gt; U_\theta | 0 \rangle = e^{i \theta}  | 0 \rangle \quad U_\theta | 1 \rangle = | 1 \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

== Reversible logic circuits ==
{{main|reversible computing}}

Again, we consider first ''reversible'' classical computation.  Conceptually, there is no difference between a reversible ''n''-bit  circuit and a reversible ''n''-bit logic gate: either one is just an invertible function on the space of ''n'' bit data. However, as mentioned in the previous section, for engineering reasons we would like to have a small number of simple reversible gates, that can be put together to assemble any reversible circuit.

To explain this assembly process, suppose we have a reversible ''n''-bit gate ''f'' and  a reversible  ''m''-bit gate ''g''.  Putting them together means producing a new circuit by connecting some set of ''k'' outputs of ''f'' to some set of ''k'' inputs of ''g'' as in the figure below.  In that figure ''n''=5, ''k'' =3 and ''m'' = 7. The resulting circuit is also reversible and operates on ''n''+''m''&amp;minus;''k'' bits.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Reversible circuit composition.svg|175px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

We will refer to this scheme as a ''classical assemblage'' (This concept corresponds to a technical definition in Kitaev's pioneering paper cited below). In composing these reversible machines, it is important to ensure that the intermediate machines are also reversible.  This condition assures that  ''intermediate'' "garbage" is not created (the net physical effect would be to increase entropy, which is one of the motivations for going through  this exercise).

Now it is possible to show that the [[Toffoli gate]] is a [[quantum gate|universal gate]]. This means that given any reversible classical ''n''-bit circuit ''h'', we can construct a classical assemblage of Toffoli gates in the above manner to produce an  (''n''+''m'')-bit circuit ''f'' such that
:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1, \ldots, x_n, \underbrace{0, \dots, 0}) = (y_1, \ldots, y_n, \underbrace{0, \ldots , 0})&lt;/math&gt;
where there are ''m'' underbraced zeroed inputs and 
:&lt;math&gt;(y_1, \ldots, y_n) = h(x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Notice that the end result always has a string of ''m'' zeros as the [[ancilla (quantum computing)|ancilla]] bits. No "rubbish" is ever produced, and so this computation is indeed one that, in a physical sense, generates no entropy.  This issue is carefully discussed in Kitaev's article.

More generally, any function ''f'' (bijective or not) can be simulated by a circuit of Toffoli gates. Obviously, if the mapping fails to be [[injective]], at some point in the simulation (for example as the last step) some "garbage" has to be produced.

For quantum circuits a similar composition of qubit gates can be defined.  That is, associated to any ''classical assemblage'' as above, we can produce a reversible quantum circuit when in place of ''f'' we have an ''n''-qubit gate ''U'' and in place of ''g'' we have an ''m''-qubit gate ''W''. See illustration below:
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Quantum circuit composition.svg|300px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

The fact that connecting gates this way gives rise to a unitary mapping on ''n''+''m''&amp;minus;''k'' qubit space is easy to check. It should also be noted that in a real quantum computer the physical connection between the gates is a major engineering challenge, since it is one of the places where [[decoherence]] may occur.

There are also [[Quantum gate#Universal quantum gates|universality theorem]]s for certain sets of well-known gates; such a universality theorem exists, for instance, for the pair consisting of the single qubit phase gate ''U''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; mentioned above (for a suitable value of θ), together with the 2-qubit [[controlled NOT gate|CNOT gate]] ''W''&lt;sub&gt;CNOT&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the universality theorem for the quantum case is somewhat weaker than the one for the classical case; it asserts only that any reversible ''n''-qubit circuit can be ''approximated'' arbitrarily well by circuits assembled from these two elementary gates. Note that there are [[uncountable|uncountably]] many possible single qubit phase gates, one for every possible angle θ, so they cannot all be represented by a finite circuit constructed from {''U''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;CNOT&lt;/sub&gt;)}.

== Quantum computations ==

So far we have not shown how quantum circuits are used to perform computations.  Since many important numerical problems reduce to computing a unitary transformation ''U'' on a finite-dimensional space (the celebrated [[discrete Fourier transform]] 
being a prime example), one might expect that some quantum circuit could be designed to carry out the transformation ''U''. In principle, one needs only to prepare an ''n'' qubit state ψ as an appropriate superposition of computational basis states for the input and measure the output ''U''ψ.  Unfortunately, there are two problems with this:

* One cannot measure the phase of ψ at any computational basis state so there is no way of reading out the complete answer. This is in the nature of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]].
* There is no way to efficiently prepare the input state ψ.

This does not prevent quantum circuits for the discrete Fourier transform from being used as intermediate steps in other quantum circuits, but the use is more subtle.  In fact quantum computations are ''probabilistic''.

We now provide a mathematical model for how quantum circuits can simulate
''probabilistic'' but classical computations.  Consider an ''r''-qubit circuit ''U'' with
register space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;QB(''r'')&lt;/sub&gt;. ''U'' is thus a unitary map
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\operatorname{QB}(r)} \rightarrow
H_{\operatorname{QB}(r)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to associate this circuit to a classical mapping on bitstrings, we specify

* An ''input register'' ''X'' = {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''m'' (classical) bits.
* An ''output register'' ''Y'' = {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''n'' (classical) bits.

The contents ''x'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; of
the classical input register are used to initialize the qubit
register in some way.  Ideally, this would be done with the computational basis
state 
:&lt;math&gt; |\vec{x},0\rangle= | x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_{m}, \underbrace{0, \dots, 0} \rangle, &lt;/math&gt;
where there are ''r''-''m'' underbraced zeroed inputs.  Nevertheless,
this perfect initialization is completely unrealistic.  Let us assume
therefore that the initialization is a mixed state given by some density operator ''S'' which is near the idealized input in some appropriate metric, e.g.
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr}\left(\big||\vec{x},0\rangle \langle \vec{x},0 | - S\big|\right) \leq \delta. &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the output register space is related to the qubit register, by a ''Y''
valued observable ''A''. Note that observables in quantum mechanics are usually defined in
terms of ''projection valued measures'' on '''R'''; if the variable
happens to be discrete, the projection valued measure reduces to a
family {E&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;} indexed on some parameter λ
ranging over a countable set.  Similarly, a ''Y'' valued observable,
can be associated with a family of pairwise orthogonal projections
{E&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;} indexed by elements of ''Y''.  such that
:&lt;math&gt; I = \sum_{y \in Y} \operatorname{E}_y. &lt;/math&gt;

Given a mixed state ''S'', there corresponds a probability measure on ''Y''
given by 
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Pr}\{y\} = \operatorname{Tr}(S \operatorname{E}_y ). &lt;/math&gt;

The function ''F'':''X'' → ''Y'' is computed by a circuit
''U'':''H''&lt;sub&gt;QB(''r'')&lt;/sub&gt; → ''H''&lt;sub&gt;QB(''r'')&lt;/sub&gt; to within ε if and only if
for all bitstrings ''x'' of length ''m''
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \vec{x},0 \big| U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U
\big|\vec{x},0 \right\rangle = \left\langle \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U( |\vec{x},0\rangle) \big|  U( |\vec{x},0\rangle) \right\rangle \geq 1 - \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Now 
:&lt;math&gt; \left| \operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U) - \left\langle \vec{x},0 \big| U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U
\big|\vec{x},0 \right\rangle\right|\leq \operatorname{Tr} (\big||\vec{x},0\rangle \langle \vec{x},0 | - S\big|) \| U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U \| \leq \delta &lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U) \geq 1 - \epsilon - \delta.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem'''.  If  ε+ δ &lt;1/2, then  the probability distribution 
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Pr}\{y\} = \operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \operatorname{E}_{y} U)&lt;/math&gt;
on ''Y'' can be used to determine ''F''(''x'') with an arbitrarily  small probability of error by majority sampling, for a sufficiently large sample size.  Specifically, take ''k'' independent samples from the probability distribution Pr on ''Y'' and choose a value on which more than half of the samples agree. The probability that the value ''F''(''x'') is sampled more than ''k''/2 times is at least
:&lt;math&gt; 1 - e^{- 2 \gamma^2 k}, &lt;/math&gt;
where γ = 1/2 -ε - δ.

This follows by applying the [[Chernoff bound]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">'''Set theory of the real line''' is an area of [[mathematics]] concerned with the application of [[set theory]] to aspects of the [[real numbers]].

For example, one knows that all countable sets of reals are [[Null set|null]], i.e. have [[Lebesgue measure]] 0; one might therefore ask the least possible size of a set
which is not Lebesgue null. This invariant is called the uniformity of the [[Ideal (set theory)|ideal]] of null sets, denoted &lt;math&gt;non(\mathcal{N})&lt;/math&gt;. There are many such [[cardinal invariant|invariants]] associated with this and other ideals, e.g. the ideal of [[Meagre set|meagre]] sets, plus more which do not have a characterisation in terms of ideals. If the [[continuum hypothesis]] (CH) holds, then all such invariants are equal to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, the least uncountable [[Cardinal number|cardinal]]. For example, we know &lt;math&gt;non(\mathcal{N})&lt;/math&gt; is uncountable, but being the size of some set of reals under CH it can be at most &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, if one assumes [[Martin's Axiom]] (MA) all common invariants are "big", that is equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Martin's Axiom is consistent with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. In fact one should view Martin's Axiom as a  [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] axiom that negates the need to do specific forcings of a certain class (those satisfying the [[countable chain condition|ccc]], since the consistency of MA with large continuum is proved by doing all such forcings (up to a certain size shown to be sufficient). Each invariant can be made large by some ccc forcing, thus each is big given MA.

If one restricts to specific forcings, some invariants will become big while others remain small. Analysing these effects is the major work of the area, seeking to determine which inequalities between invariants are provable and which are inconsistent with ZFC.  The inequalities among the ideals of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] (null sets) and [[Category (mathematics)|category]] (meagre sets) are captured in [[Cichon's diagram]]. Seventeen models (forcing constructions) were produced during the 1980s, starting with work of Arnold Miller, to demonstrate that no other inequalities are provable. These are analysed in detail in the book by Tomek Bartoszynski and Haim Judah, two of the eminent workers in the field.

One curious result is that if you can cover the real line with &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; meagre sets (where &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 \leq \kappa \leq \mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;) then &lt;math&gt;non(\mathcal{N}) \geq \kappa&lt;/math&gt;; conversely if you can cover the real line with &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; null sets then the least non-meagre set has size at least &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;; both of these results follow from the existence of a decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as the union of a meagre set and a null set.

One of the last great unsolved problems of the area was the consistency of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{d} &lt; \mathfrak{a},&lt;/math&gt;

proved in 1998 by [[Saharon Shelah]].

[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|frame|right|Map of Königsberg in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the seven bridges, highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges]]
The '''Seven Bridges of Königsberg''' is a historically notable problem in mathematics. Its negative resolution by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1736&lt;ref&gt;Euler, Leonhard (1736). "Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis". ''Comment. Acad. Sci. U. Petrop'' 8, 128–40.&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundations of [[graph theory]] and prefigured the idea of [[topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shields |first=Rob |date=December 2012 |title=Cultural Topology: The Seven Bridges of Königsburg 1736 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0263276412451161 |work=Theory Culture and Society |volume=29 |issue=4-5 |pages=43–57 |doi=10.1177/0263276412451161}} Shields provides a discussion of the social significance of Euler's engagement with this popular problem and its significance as an example of (proto-)topological understanding applied to everyday life. &lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Königsberg]] in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]) was set on both sides of the [[Pregolya|Pregel River]], and included two large islands - [[Kneiphof]] and [[Oktyabrsky Island|Lomse]] - which were connected to each other, or to the two mainland portions of the city, by seven bridges. The problem was to devise a walk through the city that would cross each of those bridges once and only once. 

By way of specifying the logical task unambiguously, solutions involving either
# reaching an island or mainland bank other than via one of the bridges, or
# accessing any bridge without crossing to its other end 
are explicitly unacceptable.

Euler proved that the problem has no solution. The difficulty he faced was the development of a suitable technique of analysis, and of subsequent tests that established this assertion with mathematical rigor.

==Euler's analysis==
First, Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass is irrelevant. The only important feature of a route is the sequence of bridges crossed. This allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms (laying the foundations of [[graph theory]]), eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them. In modern terms, one replaces each land mass with an abstract "[[:vertex (graph theory)|vertex]]" or node, and each bridge with an abstract connection, an "[[:edge (graph theory)|edge]]", which only serves to record which pair of vertices (land masses) is connected by that bridge. The resulting mathematical structure is called a [[:graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].

&lt;span style="font-size: 300%;"&gt;
[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|180px]] →
[[File:7 bridges.svg|179px]] →
[[File:Königsberg graph.svg|180px]]
&lt;/span&gt;

Since only the connection information is relevant, the shape of pictorial representations of a graph may be distorted in any way, without changing the graph itself. Only the existence (or absence) of an edge between each pair of nodes is significant. For example, it does not matter whether the edges drawn are straight or curved, or whether one node is to the left or right of another.

Next, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In other words, during any walk in the graph, the number of times one enters a non-terminal vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. Now, if every bridge has been traversed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be ''[[Parity (mathematics)|even]]'' (half of them, in the particular traversal, will be traversed "toward" the landmass; the other half, "away" from it). However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an ''[[Parity (mathematics)|odd]]'' number of bridges (one is touched by 5 bridges, and each of the other three is touched by 3). Since, at most, two land masses can serve as the endpoints of a walk, the proposition of a walk traversing each bridge once leads to a contradiction.

In modern language, Euler shows that the possibility of a walk through a graph, traversing each edge exactly once, depends on the [[:degree (graph theory)|degree]]s of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This condition turns out also to be sufficient—a result stated by Euler and later proved by [[Carl Hierholzer]]. Such a walk is now called an ''[[Eulerian path]]'' or ''Euler walk'' in his honor. Further, if there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph corresponding to historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path.

An alternative form of the problem asks for a path that traverses all bridges and also has the same starting and ending point. Such a walk is called an ''[[Eulerian path#Definition|Eulerian circuit]]'' or an ''Euler tour''. Such a circuit exists if, and only if, the graph is connected, and there are no nodes of odd degree at all. All Eulerian circuits are also Eulerian paths, but not all Eulerian paths are Eulerian circuits.

Euler's work was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on 26 August 1735, and published as ''Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis'' (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal ''Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae'' in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E053.html The Euler Archive], commentary on publication, and original text, in Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in English in [[The World of Mathematics]].

==Significance in the history and philosophy of mathematics==
In the [[history of mathematics]], Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]] and the first true proof in the theory of networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=M. E. J.|title=The structure and function of complex networks|publisher=Department of Physics, University of Michigan|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/courses/2004/cscs535/review.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subject now generally regarded as a branch of [[combinatorics]]. Combinatorial problems of other types had been considered since antiquity.

In addition, Euler's recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of [[topology]]. The difference between the actual layout and the graph schematic is a good example of the idea that topology is not concerned with the rigid shape of objects.

Hence, as Euler recognized, the "geometry of position" is not about "measurements and calculations" but about something more general. That called in question the traditional [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] view that mathematics is the "science of [[quantity]]". Though that view fits arithmetic and Euclidean geometry, it did not fit topology and the more abstract structural features studied in modern mathematics.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Philosophers have noted that Euler's proof is not about an abstraction or a model of reality, but directly about the real arrangement of bridges. Hence the certainty of mathematical proof can apply directly to reality.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics'', Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–9, 96, 215, 225; J. Franklin, [http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/philosophersstone.pdf The formal sciences discover the philosophers' stone], ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' 25 (4) (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;513–533.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
The classic statement of the problem, given above, uses '''unidentified''' nodes—that is, they are all alike except for the way in which they are connected. There is a variation in which the nodes are '''identified'''—each node is given a unique name or color.

[[File:7 bridgesID.png|300px|thumb|left|A variant with red and blue castles, a church and an inn.]]
The northern bank of the river is occupied by the ''Schloß'', or castle, of the ''Blue Prince''; the southern by that of the Red Prince. The east [[bank]] is home to the Bridge's ''Ritcher'', or church; and on the small island in the center is a ''[[Gasthaus]]'', or inn.

It is understood that the problems to follow should be taken in order, and begin with a statement of the original problem:

It being customary among the townsmen, after some hours in the ''Gasthaus'', to attempt to '''walk the bridges''', many have returned for more refreshment claiming success. However, none have been able to repeat the feat by the light of day.

'''Bridge 8:''' ''The Blue Prince'', having analyzed the town's bridge system by means of graph theory, concludes that the bridges cannot be walked. He contrives a stealthy plan to build an eighth bridge so that he can begin in the evening at his ''Schloß'', walk the bridges, and end at the ''Gasthaus'' to brag of his victory. Of course, he wants the ''Red Prince'' to be unable to recur the triumph from the ''Red Castle''. ''Where does the Blue Prince build the eighth bridge?''

'''Bridge 9:''' ''The Red Prince'', infuriated by his brother's [[Gordian Knot|Gordian]] solution to the problem, wants to build a ninth bridge, enabling ''him'' to begin at his ''Schloß'', walk the bridges, and end at the ''Gasthaus'' to rub dirt in his brother's face. As an extra bit of revenge, his brother should then no longer be able to walk the bridges starting at his ''Schloß'' and ending at the ''Gasthaus'' as before. ''Where does the Red Prince build the ninth bridge?''

'''Bridge 10:''' ''The Bishop'' has watched this furious bridge-building with dismay. It upsets the town's ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]'' and, worse, contributes to excessive drunkenness. He wants to build a tenth bridge that allows ''all'' the inhabitants to walk the bridges and return to their own beds. ''Where does the Bishop build the tenth bridge?''

=== Solutions ===
[[File:Koenigsberg Bridges Variations Graph7.png|thumb|150px|left|The colored graph.]]
[[File:Koenigsberg Bridges Variations Graph8.png|thumb|150px|right|The 8th edge.]]
Reduce the city, as before, to a graph. Color each node. As in the classic problem, no Euler walk is possible; coloring does not affect this. All four nodes have an odd number of edges.

'''Bridge 8:''' Euler walks are possible if exactly zero or two nodes have an odd number of edges. If we have 2 nodes with an odd number of edges, the walk must begin at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple. The walk desired must begin at the blue node and end at the orange node. Thus, a new edge is drawn between the other two nodes. Since they each formerly had an odd number of edges, they must now have an even number of edges, fulfilling all conditions. This is a change in [[Even and odd numbers|parity]] from an odd to even degree.

[[File:7b-graph09.png|thumb|150px|left|The 9th edge]]
[[File:Koenigsberg Bridges Variations Graph10.png|thumb|150px|right|The 10th edge]]

'''Bridge 9:''' The 9th bridge is easy once the 8th is solved. The desire is to enable the red castle and forbid the blue castle as a starting point; the orange node remains the end of the walk and the white node is unaffected. To change the parity of both red and blue nodes, draw a new edge between them.

'''Bridge 10:''' The 10th bridge takes us in a slightly different direction. The Bishop wishes every citizen to return to his starting point. This is an [[Euler circuit]] and requires that all nodes be of even degree. After the solution of the 9th bridge, the red and the orange nodes have odd degree, so their parity must be changed by adding a new edge between them.

==Present state of the bridges==
[[File:Present state of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg.png|thumb|Modern map of Kaliningrad. Locations of the remaining bridges are highlighted in green, while those destroyed are highlighted in red.]]

Two of the seven original bridges did not survive the [[bombing of Königsberg in World War II]]. Two others were later demolished and replaced by a modern highway. The three other bridges remain, although only two of them are from Euler's time (one was rebuilt in 1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amt.canberra.edu.au/koenigs.html |title=What ''Ever'' Happened to Those Bridges? |accessdate=11 November 2006 |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=December 2000 |publisher=Australian Mathematics Trust |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319074335/http://www.amt.canberra.edu.au/koenigs.html |archivedate=19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, {{as of|2000|lc=y}}, there are five bridges remaining that were involved in Euler's problem.

In terms of graph theory, two of the nodes now have degree 2, and the other two have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but it must begin on one island and end on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/stallmann/SevenBridges/ |title=The 7/5 Bridges of Koenigsberg/Kaliningrad |accessdate=11 November 2006 |last=Stallmann |first=Matthias |date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Canterbury]] in [[Christchurch]] has incorporated a model of the bridges into a grass area between the old Physical Sciences Library and the Erskine Building, housing the Departments of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/php/about/|title=About – Mathematics and Statistics – University of Canterbury|work=math.canterbury.ac.nz|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers are replaced with short bushes and the central island sports a stone [[tōrō]]. [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] has incorporated the puzzle into the pavement in front of the [[Gene Polisseni Center]], an ice hockey arena that opened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=RITWHKY|author=RIT Womens Hockey|number=501529429185945600|date=19 August 2014|title=@OnlyAtRIT do we put the 7 bridge math problem in the cement out front of the new hockey arena @PolisseniCenter #ROC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shooting ratio''' in [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]] is the [[ratio]] between the total duration of its [[footage]] created for possible use in a project and that which appears in its final cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nofilmschool.com/2016/03/shooting-ratios-mad-max-fury-road-primer-hitchcock|author=Morrow, Justin, date=March 4, 2016|title=Shooting Ratios, From Hitchcock to 'Fury Road' to 'Primer' (and What They Mean to You)|publsher=nofilmschool.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A film with a shooting ratio of 2:1 would have shot twice the amount of footage that was used in the film. In real terms this means that 120 minutes of footage would have been shot to produce a film of 60 minutes in length.  

Shooting ratios can vary greatly between productions but a typical shooting ratio for a production using [[film stock]] will be between 6:1 and 10:1, whereas a similar production using video is likely to be much higher. This is a direct result of the significant difference in price between [[video tape]] stock and film stock and the necessary processing. Although the decisions, styles and preferences of the filmmakers can affect the shooting ratio of a project greatly, the nature of the production (genre, form, single camera, multi-camera, etc.) greatly affects the typical range of the ratios seen – documentary films typically have the highest (often exceeding 100:1 following the rise of video and digital media) and animated films have the lowest (typically as close to 1:1 as possible, since the creation of footage frame by frame makes the time costs of animation extremely high compared to live action). Animated productions will often shoot acting reference (by animators of themselves and or others), location reference, and performance reference  (taken of voice actors), but these pieces of reference footage are not regarded as counting towards the shooting ratio, as they were never intended to appear in the projects they were created for. Audition footage, screen tests, and location reference are similarly not counted towards a narrative film's shooting ratio, live action or animated, for the same reason. Since a documentary may potentially use any footage that is shot at any point for any reason, documentary productions do not have similar exceptions. Head slates, tail slates, and outtakes are counted live action shooting ratios because, although the footage is not intended for use in the final picture,  it is contained on the same reels and masters as the footage that is intended for final picture. Animated and visual effects projects typically do not include slates as part of the shooting ratio, since they virtually are instantaneous and zero-cost to create in digital formats.

In modern productions, due to the rise of [[digital cinema]], shooting ratios are less limited by price of stock and storage, since the vast majority of productions are now entirely or partially digital. Shooting ratios instead defined  and limited by the expense (in time, labor, and money, and memory) of actually shooting and editing the film, rather than cost of raw media.

'''Spec#''' is a [[programming language]] with [[specification language]] features that extends the capabilities of the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language with [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]]-like [[Design by Contract|contracts]], including [[object invariant]]s, preconditions and postconditions. Like [[ESC/Java]], it includes a static checking tool based on a theorem prover that is able to statically verify many of these invariants. It also includes a variety of other minor extensions to the language, such as non-null reference types.

The ''code contracts'' API in the [[.NET Framework|.NET Framework 4.0]] has evolved with Spec#.

[[Microsoft Research]] developed both Spec# and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]; in turn, Spec# serves as the foundation of the [[Sing sharp|Sing#]] programming language, which Microsoft Research also developed.

==Features==
:''See also: [[C Sharp syntax#Spec.23|Spec#]] in [[C Sharp syntax]].''
Spec# extends the core C# programming language with features such as:
* Non-nullable types
* Structures for code contract like ''preconditions'' and ''postconditions''.
* [[Checked exceptions]] similar to those in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
* Convenient syntax

== Example ==
This example shows two of the basic structures that are used when adding contracts to your code ([http://rise4fun.com/specsharp/ try Spec# in your browser]).

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
    static int Main(string![] args)
        requires args.Length &gt; 0;
        ensures return == 0;
    {
        foreach(string arg in args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(arg);
        }
        return 0;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''!''' is used to make a reference type non-nullable, e.g. you cannot set the value to null. This in contrast of nullable types which allows value types to be set as ''null''.
* '''requires''' indicates a precondition that must be followed in the code. In this case the length of args is not allowed to be zero or less.
* '''ensures''' indicates a postcondition that must be followed in the code.

==Sing Sharp==
{{hatnote|The correct title of this heading is '''Sing#'''. The submission or omission of the [[Number sign|#]] is due to [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (technical restrictions)|technical restrictions]].}}
Sing# is a [[subset|superset]] of Spec#. [[Microsoft Research]] developed Spec#, and later extended it into Sing# in order to develop the [[Singularity (operating system)|Singularity]] [[operating system]]. Sing# augments the capabilities of Spec# with support for channels and [[low-level programming language]] constructs, which are necessary for implementing [[system software]]. Sing# is type-safe. The semantics of message-passing primitives in Sing# are defined by formal and written contracts.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''Steven George Krantz''' (born February 3, 1951) is an American scholar, mathematician, and writer. He has authored more than 235 research papers and more than 125 books.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/03/27/sequoia-high-school-alumni-inducted-into-hall-of-fame/|title=Sequoia High School alumni inducted into Hall of Fame|last=Bishop|first=Shaun|date=2009-03-27|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Krantz has edited journals such as the ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' and ''[[The Journal of Geometric Analysis]]''.

==Early life and education==
Steven Krantz grew up in [[Redwood City, California]] and graduated from [[Sequoia High School (Redwood City, California)|Sequoia High School]] in class of 1967.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Krantz was an undergraduate at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UCSC), graduating with ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1971. In the math department at UCSC his teachers included Nick Burgoyne, [[Marvin Greenberg]], Ed Landesman, and Stan Philipp. Krantz obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Princeton University]] in 1974 under the direction of [[Elias M. Stein]] and [[Joseph J. Kohn]]. Other influencers included Fred Almgren, Robert Gunning, and Ed Nelson.&lt;ref name="N"&gt;[http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/7255.aspx Washington University Newsroom]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Among Krantz's research interests include: [[several complex variables]], [[harmonic analysis]], partial differential equations, differential geometry, interpolation of operators, Lie theory, smoothness of functions, convexity theory, the corona problem, the inner functions problem, Fourier analysis, singular integrals, Lusin area integrals, Lipschitz spaces, finite difference operators, Hardy spaces, functions of bounded mean oscillation, geometric measure theory, sets of positive reach, the implicit function theorem, approximation theory, real analytic functions, analysis on the Heisenberg group, complex function theory, and real analysis.&lt;ref name="NI"&gt;[http://news-info.wustl.edu/sb/page/normal/515.html, Washington University News and Information]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He applied [[wavelet]] analysis to plastic surgery, creating software for facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Researchers collaborate to make plastic surgery more precise |author= Tony Fitzpatrick |date= September 20, 2002 |work= Record |url= http://wupa.wustl.edu/record_archive/2002/09-20-02/krantz.html |publisher= Washington University |accessdate= June 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Krantz has also written software for the pharmaceutical industry.

Krantz has worked on the [[inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations]] (he obtained the first sharp estimates in a variety of nonisotropic norms), on separate smoothness of functions (most notably with hypotheses about smoothness along integral curves of vector fields), on analysis on the Heisenberg group and other nilpotent Lie groups, on harmonic analysis in several complex variables, on the function theory of several complex variables, on the harmonic analysis of several real variables, on partial differential equations, on complex geometry, on the automorphism groups of domains in complex space, and on the geometry of complex domains. He has worked with Siqi Fu, [[Robert Everist Greene|Robert E. Greene]], Alexander Isaev and [[Kang-Tae Kim]] on the Bergman kernel, the Bergman metric, and automorphism groups of domains; with Song-Ying Li on the harmonic analysis of several complex variables; and with Marco Peloso on harmonic analysis, the inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations, Hodge theory, and the analysis of the worm domain. Krantz's book on the geometry of complex domains, written jointly with Robert E. Greene and Kang-Tae Kim, appeared in 2011.

Krantz's monographs include ''Function Theory of Several Complex Variables'', ''Complex Analysis:  The Geometric Viewpoint'', ''A Primer of Real Analytic Functions'' (joint with [[Harold R. Parks]]), ''The Implicit Function Theorem'' (joint with Harold Parks), ''Geometric Integration Theory'' (joint with Harold Parks), and ''The Geometry of Complex Domains'' (joint with Kang-Tae Kim and Robert E. Greene). His book ''The Proof is in the Pudding:  A Look at the Changing Nature of Mathematical Proof'' looks at the history and evolving nature of the proof concept. Krantz's latest book, ''A Mathematician Comes of Age'', published by the Mathematical Association of America, is an exploration of the concept of mathematical maturity.

Krantz is author of textbooks and popular books.&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;[http://www.math.wustl.edu/~sk/ Steven G. Krantz home page]&lt;/ref&gt; His books ''Mathematical Apocrypha'' and ''Mathematical Apocrypha Redux'' are collections of anecdotes about famous mathematicians.&lt;ref name=N /&gt; Krantz's book ''An Episodic History of Mathematics: Mathematical Culture through Problem Solving'' is a blend of history and problem solving. ''A Mathematician's Survival Guide'' and ''The Survival of a Mathematician'' are about how to get into the mathematics profession and how to survive in the mathematics profession. Krantz's new book with Harold R. Parks titled ''A Mathematical Odyssey:  Journey from the Real to the Complex'' is an entree to mathematics for the layman. His book ''I, Mathematician'' (joint with Peter Casazza and Randi D. Ruden) is a study, with contributions from many mathematicians, of how mathematicians think of themselves and how others think of mathematicians. The book ''The Theory and Practice of Conformal Geometry'' is a study of

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1602">In mathematics, '''topological degree theory''' is a generalization of the [[winding number]] of a curve in the [[complex plane]]. It can be used to estimate the number of solutions of an equation, and is closely connected to [[Fixed point theorem|fixed-point theory]]. When one solution of an equation is easily found, degree theory can often be used to prove existence of a second, nontrivial, solution. There are different types of degree for different types of maps: e.g.  for maps between [[Banach spaces]] there is the [[Brouwer degree]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[Leray-Schauder]] degree for [[Compact space|compact mappings]] in [[normed spaces]], the [[coincidence degree]] and various other types. There is also a degree for [[Degree of a continuous mapping|continuous maps between manifolds]]. 

Topological degree theory has applications in [[complementarity problem]]s, [[differential equations]], [[differential inclusion]]s and [[dynamical system]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11283">In [[logic]], [[finite model theory]], and [[computability theory]], '''Trakhtenbrot's theorem''' (due to [[Boris Trakhtenbrot]]) states that the problem of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] in [[first-order logic]]  on the class of all finite models is [[Recursive set|undecidable]].  In fact, the class of valid sentences over finite models is not [[recursively enumerable]] (though it is [[co-recursively enumerable]]).

Trakhtenbrot's theorem implies that [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] (that is fundamental to first-order logic) does not hold in the finite case.  Also it seems counter-intuitive that being valid over all structures is 'easier' than over just the finite ones.

The theorem was first published in 1950: "The Impossibility of an Algorithm for the Decidability Problem on Finite Classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Boris|last=Trakhtenbrot | authorlink1=Boris Trakhtenbrot|title=The Impossibility of an Algorithm for the Decidability Problem on Finite Classes|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|language=Russian|volume=70|issue=4|pages= 569–572|year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==
We follow the formulations as in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ebbinghaus | first1=Heinz-Dieter | authorlink1=Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus | last2=Flum | first2=Jörg | title=Finite Model Theory | publisher=Springer Science+Business Media | isbn=978-3-540-60149-4 | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorem===
:Finite [[satisfiability]] is not decidable in [[first-order logic]].
:That is, the set { φ | φ is a sentence of first-order logic satisfiable in the finite } is undecidable.

===Corollary===
Let σ be a relational vocabulary  with one at least binary relation symbol. 
:The set of [[&amp;sigma;-sentence]]s valid in all finite structures is not [[recursively enumerable]].

'''Remarks'''

# This implies that [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] fails in the finite since completeness implies recursive enumerability.
# It follows that there is no recursive function f such that: if φ has a finite model, then it has a model of size at most f(φ).  In other words, there is no effective analogue to the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] in the finite.

==Intuitive proof==
This proof taken from Chapter 10, section 4, 5 of Mathematical Logic by H.-D. Ebbinghaus.

As in the most common proof of [[Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] through using the undecidability of the [[halting problem]], for each [[Turing machine]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; there is a corresponding arithmetical sentence &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt;, effectively derivable from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, such that it is true if and only if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; halts on the empty tape. Intuitively, &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; asserts "there exists a natural number that is the Gödel code for the computation record of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on the empty tape that ends with halting".

If the machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does halt in finite steps, then the complete computation record is also finite, then there is a finite initial segment of the natural numbers such that the arithmetical sentence &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is also true on this initial segment. Intuitively, this is because in this case, proving &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; requires the arithmetic properties of only finitely many numbers.

If the machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does not halt in finite steps, then &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is false in any finite model, since there's no finite computation record of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that ends with halting. 

Thus, if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; halts, &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is true in some finite models. If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does not halt, &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is false in all finite models. So, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does not halt if and only if &lt;math&gt;\neg\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is true over all finite models.

The set of machines that does not halt is not recursively enumerable, so the set of valid sentences over finite models is not recursively enumerable.

==Alternative proof==
In this section we exhibit a more rigorous proof from Libkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Libkin | first1=Leonid | authorlink1=Leonid Libkin | title=Elements of Finite Model Theory | publisher=[[Texts in Theoretical Computer Science]] | isbn=978-3-642-05948-3 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note in the above statement that the corollary also entails the theorem, and this is the direction we prove here.

'''Theorem'''

:For every relational vocabulary τ with at least one binary relation symbol, it is undecidable whether a sentence φ of vocabulary τ is finitely satisfiable.

'''Proof'''

According to the previous lemma, we can in fact use finitely many binary relation symbols. The idea of the proof is similar to the proof of Fagin's theorem, and we encode Turing machines in first-order logic. What we want to prove is that for every Turing machine M we construct a sentence φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; of vocabulary τ such that φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is finitely satisfiable if and only if M halts on the empty input, which is equivalent to the halting problem and therefore undecidable.

Let M= ⟨Q, Σ, δ, q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;⟩ be a deterministic Turing machine with a single infinite tape.

* Q is the set of states,
* Σ is the input alphabet,
* Δ is the tape alphabet,
* δ is the transition function,
* q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial state,
* Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are the sets of accepting and rejecting states.

Since we are dealing with the problem of halting on an empty input we may assume w.l.o.g. that Δ={0,1} and that 0 represents a blank, while 1 represents some tape symbol. We define τ so that we can represent computations:

: τ := {&lt;, &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (⋅,⋅), T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (⋅,⋅), (H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;(⋅,⋅))&lt;sub&gt;(q ∈ Q)&lt;/sub&gt;}

Where:

* &lt; is a linear order and &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt; is a constant symbol for the minimal element with respect to &lt; (our finite domain will be associated with an initial segment of the natural numbers).
* T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are tape predicates. T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(s,t) indicates that position s at time t contains i, where i ∈ {0,1}.
* H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s are head predicates. H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;(s,t) indicates that at time t the machine is in state q, and its head is in position s.

The sentence φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; states that (i) &lt;, &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s and H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s are interpreted as above and (ii) that the machine eventually halts. The halting condition is equivalent to saying that H&lt;sub&gt;q∗&lt;/sub&gt;(s, t) holds for some s, t and q∗ ∈ Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and after that state, the configuration of the machine does not change. Configurations of a halting machine (the nonhalting is not finite) can be represented as a τ (finite) sentence (more precisely, a finite τ-structure which satisfies the sentence). The sentence φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is: φ ≡ α ∧ β ∧ γ ∧ η ∧ ζ ∧ θ.

We break it down by components:

* α states that &lt; is a linear order and that &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt; is its minimal element
* γ defines the initial configuration of M: it is in state q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the head is in the first position and the tape contains only zeros: γ ≡ H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;,&lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;) ∧ ∀s T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (s, &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;)
* η states that in every configuration of M, each tape cell contains exactly one element of Δ: ∀s∀t(T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(s, t) → ¬ T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(s, t))
* β imposes a basic consistency condition on the predicates H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s: at any time the machine is in exactly one state:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall t \exists ! s (\bigvee_{q\in Q} H_q (s,t))\land \neg\exists s \exists t (\bigvee_{q,q'\in Q, q\neq q} H_q(s,t)\land H_{q'} (s,t))&lt;/math&gt;

* ζ states that at some point M is in a halting state:

: &lt;math&gt;\exists s \exists t \bigvee_{q\in Q_a\cup Q_r} H_q (s,t)&lt;/math&gt;

* θ consists of a conjunction of sentences stating that T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s and H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s are well behaved with respect to the transitions of M. As an example, let δ(q,0)=(q',1, left) meanining that if M is in state q reading 0, then it writes 1, moves the head one position to the left and goes into the state q'. We represent this condition by the disjunction of θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 \equiv \forall s \forall t (s\neq \underline{min} \land T_0(s,t) \land H_q (s, t)) \to \theta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Where θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;T_1 (s, t+1)\land H_{q'} (s-1, t+1)\land \forall s' (s\neq s' \to (\bigwedge_{i=0,1} T_i (s', t+1)\leftrightarrow T_i(s',t)))&lt;/math&gt;

And:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 \equiv \forall s \forall t (s = \underline{min} \land T_0(s,t) \land H_q (s, t)) \to \theta_3&lt;/math&gt;

Where θ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;T_1 (s, t+1)\land H_{q'} (s, t+1)\land \forall s' (s\neq s' \to (\bigwedge_{i=0,1} T_i (s', t+1)\leftrightarrow T_i(s',t)))&lt;/math&gt;

s-1 and t+1 are first-order definable abbreviations for the predecessor and successor according to the ordering &lt;. The sentence θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; assures that the tape content in position s changes from 0 to 1, the state changes from q to q', the rest of the tape remains the same and that the head moves to s-1 (i. e. one position to the left), assuming s is not the first position in the tape. If it is, then all is handled by θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: everything is the same, except the head does not move to the left but stays put.

If φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite model, then such a model that represents a computation of M (that starts with the empty tape (i.e. tape containing all zeros) and ends in a halting state). If M halts on the empty input, then the set of all configurations of the halting computations of M (coded with &lt;, T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s and H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s) is a model of φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, which is finite, since the set of all configurations of halting computations is finite. It follows that M halts on the empty input iff φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite model. Since halting on the empty input is undecidable, so is the question of whether φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; (equivalently, whether φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is finitely satisfiable) is also undecidable (recursively enumerable, but not recursive). This concludes the proof.

'''Corollary'''

: The set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursively enumerable.

'''Proof'''

Enumerate all pairs &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{A}, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is finite and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}\models \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Corollary'''

: For any vocabulary containing at least one binary relation symbol, the set of all finitely valid sentences is not recursively enumerable.

'''Proof'''

From the previous lemma, the set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursively enumerable. Assume that the set of all finitely valid sentences is recursively enumerable. Since ¬φ is finitely valid iff φ is not finitely satisfiable, we conclude that the set of sentences which are not finitely satisfiable is recursively enumerable. If both a set A and its complement are recursively enumerable, then A is recursive. It follows that the set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursive, which contradicts Trakhtenbrot's theorem.

A '''triptych''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|p|t|ɪ|k}} {{respell|TRIP|tik}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''τρίπτυχον'' "''triptukhon''" ("three-fold"), from ''tri'', i.e., "three" and ''ptysso'', i.e., "to fold" or ''ptyx'', i.e., "fold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=triptych|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=triptych&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|tri/ptuxos|τρίπτυχον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a work of [[art]] (usually a [[panel painting]]) that is divided into three sections, or three [[Wood carving|carved]] panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of [[polyptych]], the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for [[pendant]] jewelry.

Despite its connection to an art format, the term is sometimes used more generally to connote anything with three parts, particularly if they are integrated into a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/triptych |title=Triptych |quote=Although triptych originally described a specific type of Roman writing tablet that had three hinged sections, it is not surprising that the idea was generalized first to a type of painting, and then to anything composed of three parts. |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
[[File:Verdun Altar.JPG|thumb|The Verdun Altar in [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]]]]
The triptych form arises from early Christian art, and was a popular standard format for altar paintings from the Middle Ages onwards. Its geographical range was from the eastern [[Byzantine]] churches to the Celtic churches in the west. During the Byzantine period, tryptichs were often used for private devotional use, along with other relics such as icons.&lt;ref&gt;2014. ''History of the World in 1,000 Objects.''London, New York. [[Dorling Kindersley|D.K. Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;Renaissance painters such as [[Hans Memling]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] used the form. Sculptors also used it. Triptych forms also allow ease of transport.

From the [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] period onward, both in Europe and elsewhere, altarpieces in churches and cathedrals were often in triptych form. One such cathedral with an altarpiece triptych is [[Llandaff Cathedral]]. The [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], Belgium, contains two examples by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Notre Dame de Paris]] is another example of the use of triptych in architecture. One can also see the form echoed by the structure of many ecclesiastical [[stained glass window]]s. Although strongly identified as an [[altarpiece]] form, triptychs outside that context have been created, some of the best-known examples being works by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Max Beckmann]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].

The then highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction was $142.4 million for a 1969 triptych, ''[[Three Studies of Lucian Freud]]'', by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Bacon's Study of Freud Sells for $142.4 Million|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 12, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/arts/design/bacons-study-of-freud-sells-for-more-than-142-million.html|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken in May 2015 by $179.4 million for [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1955 painting ''[[Les Femmes d’Alger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digg.com/2015/modigliani-nu-couche-140-million A History Of Insane Art Prices] Digg.com Retrieved 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The format has migrated and been used in other religions, including [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]]. For example: the triptych ''Hilje-j-Sherif'' displayed at the [[National Museum of Oriental Art]], Rome, Italy, and a page of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum|Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts]] in Istanbul, Turkey, exemplify [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] religious art adapting the motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Museum With No Frontiers]] |publisher=Museum With No Frontiers, Arab Institute for Research and Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA3dSlLBG38C&amp;pg=PA258&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;dq=islamic+triptych&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCWXu3Zrse&amp;sig=Hm07LC4FwEbcecVNBxv6KRSBkvQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD0ufi2eTRAhVB7YMKHSkICIgQ6AEIODAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20triptych&amp;f=false |location=Brussels, Belgium, Beirut, Lebanon |year=2007 |title=Discover Islamic Art in the Mediterranean |page=258 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Tibetan Buddhists have used it in traditional altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Tibetan-Buddhist-Altars-Gallery-Traditional/dp/1577314670/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1577314670&amp;pd_rd_r=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK&amp;pd_rd_w=jTPLw&amp;pd_rd_wg=Y0eb9&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK |title=Tibetan Buddhist Altars: A Pop-Up Gallery of Traditional Art and Wisdom |type=Hardcover |first1=Tad |last1=Wise |first2=Robert |last2=Beers |first3=David A. |last3=Carter |publisher=[[New World Library]]  |date=August 25, 2004 |ISBN=978-1577314677 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3096">In [[continuum mechanics]], including [[fluid dynamics]], an '''upper-convected time derivative''' or '''Oldroyd derivative''', named after [[James G. Oldroyd]], is the [[derivative|rate of change]] of some [[tensor]] property of a small parcel of fluid that is written in the coordinate system rotating and stretching with the fluid. 

The operator is specified by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt; \stackrel{\triangledown}{\mathbf{A}} = \frac{D}{Dt} \mathbf{A} - (\nabla \mathbf{v})^T \cdot \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{A} \cdot (\nabla \mathbf{v}) &lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt; {\stackrel{\triangledown}{\mathbf A}}&lt;/math&gt; is the upper-convected time derivative of a tensor [[Field (physics)|field]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[substantive derivative]]
*&lt;math&gt;\nabla \mathbf{v}=\frac {\partial v_j}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt; is the tensor of [[velocity]] [[derivative]]s for the fluid.

The formula can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; {\stackrel{\triangledown}{A}}_{i,j} = \frac {\partial A_{i,j}} {\partial t} + v_k \frac {\partial A_{i,j}} {\partial x_k} - \frac {\partial v_i} {\partial x_k} A_{k,j} - \frac {\partial v_j} {\partial x_k} A_{i,k} &lt;/math&gt;

By definition the upper-convected time derivative of the [[Finger tensor]]  is always zero.

It can be shown that the upper-convected time derivative of a spacelike vector field is just its [[Lie derivative]] by the velocity field of the continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matolcsi|first1=Tamás|last2=Ván|first2=Péter|title=On the Objectivity of Time Derivatives|date=2008|doi=10.1478/C1S0801015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper-convected derivative is widely use in [[polymer]] [[rheology]] for the description of behavior of a [[viscoelastic]] fluid under large deformations.

==Examples for the [[symmetric tensor]] ''A''==
===[[Simple shear]]===
For the case of [[simple shear]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ {\dot \gamma} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; \stackrel{\triangledown}{\mathbf A} = \frac{D}{Dt} \mathbf{A}-\dot \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 2 A_{12} &amp; A_{22} &amp; A_{23} \\ A_{22} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ A_{23} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

===Uniaxial extension of incompressible fluid===
In this case a material is stretched in the direction X and compresses in the directions Y and Z, so to keep volume constant.
The gradients of velocity are:
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} \dot \epsilon &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -\frac {\dot \epsilon} {2} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{\dot \epsilon} 2 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; \stackrel{\triangledown}{\mathbf A} = \frac{D}{Dt} \mathbf{A}-\frac {\dot \epsilon} 2 \begin{pmatrix} 4A_{11} &amp; A_{12} &amp; A_{13} \\ A_{12} &amp; -2A_{22} &amp; -2A_{23} \\ A_{13} &amp; -2A_{23} &amp; -2A_{33} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Vertical electrical sounding''' ('''VES''') is a geophysical method for investigation of a geological medium. The method is based on the estimation of the [[electrical conductivity]] or resistivity of the medium. The estimation is performed based on the measurement of voltage of electrical field induced by the distant grounded [[electrode]]s (current electrodes).

==Measurements==
[[File:Wenner.png|300px|thumb|Figure 1. Electrical profiling using four-electrode probes in [[Wenner configuration]].]]
[[File:Schlumberger.png|300px|thumb|Figure 2. Electrical profiling using four-electrode probes in [[Schlumberger configuration]].]]
[[File:Poldipol.png|300px|thumb|Figure 3. Pole–dipole array profiling.]]
[[File:Dipoldipol.png|300px|thumb|Figure 4. Dipole–dipole electrode array profiling.]]
Figures 1–4 show the possible configuration of the measurement setup. The electrodes ''A'' and ''B'' are current electrodes which are connected to a current source; ''N'' and ''M'' are potential electrodes which are used for the voltage measurements. As source, the direct current or low frequency alternating current is used.

The interpretation of the measurements can be performed based on the apparent resistivity values. The depth of investigation depends on the distance between the current electrodes. In order to obtain the apparent resistivity as the function of depth, the measurements for each position are performed with several different distances between current electrodes. The apparent resistivity is calculated as

: &lt;math&gt; \rho_k=k\frac{U_{MN}}{I_{AB}}&lt;/math&gt;

here, ''k'' is a geometric factor, &lt;math&gt;{U_{MN}}&lt;/math&gt; — voltage between electrodes М and N, &lt;math&gt;{I_{AB}}&lt;/math&gt; — current in the line AB. The geometric factor is defined by

: &lt;math&gt; k= \frac{2\pi}{\frac{1}{r_{AM}}-\frac{1}{r_{BM}}-\frac{1}{r_{AN}}+\frac{1}{r_{BN}} }&lt;/math&gt;

here ''r'' is the distance between electrodes.

Interpretation of gathered data is performed based on the dependency ρ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(AB/2).

The application of large electrode arrays allows for reconstructing complex 3D structure of geological media (see [[Electrical resistivity tomography]]). However, the interpretation of such measurement is rather difficult.     
In this case, advanced interpretation techniques based on numerical methods can be applied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">In mathematics, there are at least two results known as '''''Weyl's inequality'''''.

==Weyl's inequality in number theory==
In [[number theory]], '''Weyl's inequality''', named for [[Hermann Weyl]], states that if ''M'', ''N'', ''a'' and ''q'' are integers, with ''a'' and ''q'' [[coprime]], ''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and ''f'' is a [[real number|real]] [[polynomial]] of degree ''k'' whose leading coefficient ''c'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;|c-a/q|\le tq^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''t'' greater than or equal to 1, then for any positive real number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; one has

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x=M}^{M+N}\exp(2\pi if(x))=O\left(N^{1+\varepsilon}\left({t\over q}+{1\over N}+{t\over N^{k-1}}+{q\over N^k}\right)^{2^{1-k}}\right)\text{ as }N\to\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

This inequality will only be useful when

:&lt;math&gt;q &lt; N^k,&lt;/math&gt;

for otherwise estimating the modulus of the [[exponential sum]] by means of the [[triangle inequality]] as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\le\, N&lt;/math&gt; provides a better bound.

==Weyl's inequality in matrix theory==

====Weyl's inequality about perturbation====

In linear algebra, '''Weyl's inequality''' is a theorem about the changes to [[eigenvalues]] of a [[Hermitian matrix]] that is perturbed.  It is useful if we wish to know the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix but there is an uncertainty about its entries.  We let ''H'' be the exact matrix and ''P'' be a perturbation matrix that represents the uncertainty.  The matrix we 'measure' is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M \,=\, H \,+\, P&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem says that if any two of ''M'', ''H'' and ''P'' are ''n'' by ''n'' Hermitian matrices, where ''M'' has eigenvalues

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_1 \ge \cdots \ge \mu_n&lt;/math&gt;

and ''H'' has eigenvalues

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \ge \cdots \ge \nu_n&lt;/math&gt;

and ''P'' has eigenvalues

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_1 \ge \cdots \ge \rho_n&lt;/math&gt;

then the following inequalities hold for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i \,=\, 1,\dots ,n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_i + \rho_n \le \mu_i \le \nu_i + \rho_1&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j+k-n \,\ge\, i \,\ge\, r+s-1&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_j + \rho_k \le \mu_i \le \nu_r + \rho_s&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P'' is positive definite (that is, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\rho_n \,&gt;\, 0&lt;/math&gt;) then this implies

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i &gt; \nu_i \quad   \forall i = 1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we can order the eigenvalues because the matrices are Hermitian and therefore the eigenvalues are real.

====Weyl's inequality between eigenvalues and singular values====
Let &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt; have singular values &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1(A) \geq \cdots \geq \sigma_n(A) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and eigenvalues ordered so that &lt;math&gt;|\lambda_1(A)| \geq \cdots \geq |\lambda_n(A)|&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; |\lambda_1(A) \cdots \lambda_k(A)| \leq \sigma_1(A) \cdots \sigma_k(A)&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;k = 1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;, with equality for &lt;math&gt;k=n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==

=== Estimating perturbations of the spectrum ===

Assume that we have a bound on ''P'' in the sense that we know that its spectral norm (or, indeed, any consistent matrix norm) satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|P\|_2 \le \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Then it follows that all its eigenvalues are bounded in absolute value by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Applying Weyl's inequality, it follows that the spectra of ''M'' and ''H'' are close in the sense that&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\mu_i - \nu_i| \le \epsilon \qquad \forall i=1,\ldots,n.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Weyl's inequality for singular values ===
The [[singular value]]s {''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} of a square matrix ''M'' are the square roots of eigenvalues of ''M*M'' (equivalently ''MM*''). Since Hermitian matrices follow Weyl's inequality, if we take any matrix ''A'' then its singular values will be the square root of the eigenvalues of ''B=A*A'' which is a Hermitian matrix. Now since Weyl's inequality hold for B, therefore for the singular values of ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tao|first1=Terence|title=254A, Notes 3a: Eigenvalues and sums of Hermitian matrices|url=https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/254a-notes-3a-eigenvalues-and-sums-of-hermitian-matrices/|website=Terence Tao's blog|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result gives the bound for the perturbation in the singular values of a matrix ''A''  due to perturbation in ''A''.
