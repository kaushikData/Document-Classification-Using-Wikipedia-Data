== Overview ==
[[File:Mesopotamian cylinder seal impression.jpg|thumb|Ancient astronauts proponents suggest that aliens came to Earth long ago, citing artifacts such as this ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n [[cylinder seal]].]]
Proponents of the ancient astronaut [[hypothesis]] often maintain that humans are either descendants or creations of [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] (ETI) who landed on Earth thousands of years ago.  An associated idea is that humans evolved independently, but that much of human knowledge, religion, and culture came from extraterrestrial visitors in ancient times, in that ancient astronauts acted as a "[[mother culture]]".  Some ancient astronaut proponents also believe that travelers from outer space, referred to as "astronauts" (or "spacemen") built many of the structures on Earth (such as [[Egyptian pyramids]] and the [[Moai]] stone heads of [[Easter Island]]) or aided humans in building them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olien |first=Michael D. |title=The Human Myth: An Introduction to Anthropology |date=1978| publisher=Harper &amp; Row| location=USA |isbn=0-06-044918-7 |pages=236–241, 245, 255| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvFKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA236 |chapter=Did Ancient Astronauts Bring Civilization?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |last=Linedecker |first=Cliff |title=Ancient Astronauts Colonized Earth 10,000 Years Ago |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT18 |date=3 April 2001 |newspaper=Weekly World News |pages=18-19, 35 |ISSN=0199574X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient astronauts hypothesis of creation ==
Proponents argue that the evidence for ancient astronauts comes from documentary gaps in historical and archaeological records, and they also maintain that absent or incomplete explanations of historical or archaeological data point to the existence of ancient astronauts.  The evidence is argued to include [[artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] that they deem [[anachronism|anachronistic]], or beyond the accepted technical capabilities of the historical cultures with which they are associated.  These are sometimes referred to as "[[out-of-place artifact]]s"; and include artwork and legends which are interpreted in a modern sense as depicting extraterrestrial contact or technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Archaeology from the dark side|first=Andrew|last=O'Hehir|work=Salon|date=31 August 2005|url=http://www.salon.com/2005/08/31/archaeology/|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have responded that gaps in contemporary knowledge are not evidence of the existence of ancient astronauts, and that advocates have not provided any convincing anecdotal or physical evidence of an artifact that might conceivably be the product of ETI contact. According to astrophysicist [[Carl Sagan]], "In the long litany of 'ancient astronaut' pop archaeology, the cases of apparent interest have perfectly reasonable alternative explanations, or have been misreported, or are simple prevarications, [[hoax]]es and distortions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|title=Broca's Brain|year=2011|origyear=1979|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=0-394-50169-1|pages=65–68, 79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYpP6zmD9G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22broca's%20brain%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20astronaut&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis origins and proponents ==
Paleocontact or "ancient astronaut" narratives first appeared in the [[history of science fiction|early science fiction]] of the late 19th to early 20th century.  The idea was proposed in earnest by [[Harold T. Wilkins]] in 1954; it received some consideration as a serious hypothesis during the 1960s. Critics of the theory emerged throughout the 1970s, discrediting Von Daniken's theory{{clarify|date=February 2017|reason=Mismatch. First mentions Wilkins proposal, but then says von Däniken's theory was discredited}}. Ufologists separated the idea from the UFO controversy. By the early 1980s little remaining support of the theory could be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy |edition=revised |first1=William F. |last1=Williams |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-135-95522-9 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vH1EAgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vH1EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT47 Extract of page 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P1150882 Louvre Relief Dudu AO2394 rwk.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Votive relief of the winged priest of Dudu on display at the Louvre Museum, France.]]
In ''Intelligent Life in the Universe'' (1966) astrophysicists [[Iosif Shklovsky|I. S. Shklovski]] and [[Carl Sagan]] devote a chapter to the argument that scientists and historians should seriously consider the possibility that extraterrestrial contact occurred during recorded history; however, Shklovski and Sagan stressed that these ideas were speculative and unproven.&lt;ref name="ShklovskySagan1966"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shklovsky |first1=Iosif S. |author-link=Iosif Shklovsky |last2=Sagan |first2=Carl |author-link2=Carl Sagan |translator-last1=Fern |translator-first1=Paula |title=Intelligent Life in the Universe |chapter=33: The Possible Consequences of Direct Contact |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrnoPwAACAAJ |year=1966 |publisher=Holden-Day |location=San Francisco, California |pages=448-464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shklovski and Sagan argued that sub-[[lightspeed]] [[interstellar travel]] by extraterrestrial life was a certainty when considering technologies that were established or feasible in the late 1960s;&lt;ref&gt;"...civilizations, aeons more advanced than ours, must be plying the spaces between stars..."; Shklovski and Sagan; p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; that repeated instances of extraterrestrial visitation to Earth were plausible;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Even allowing for millions of years between visits from a hypothetical "galactic survey ship", Sagan calculated ≈10ˆ4 such visits could have occurred "during [Earth's] geologic time"; Shklovski and Sagan; p. 461;&lt;/ref&gt; and that pre-scientific narratives can offer a potentially reliable means of describing contact with aliens.

Sagan illustrates this hypothesis by citing the 1786 expedition of French explorer [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse]], which made the earliest [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] between European and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] cultures. The contact story was preserved as an [[oral tradition]] by the preliterate Tlingit.  Over a century after its occurrence it was then recorded by anthropologist [[George T. Emmons]].  Although it is framed in a Tlingit cultural and spiritual paradigm, the story remained an accurate telling of the 1786 encounter.  According to Sagan, this proved how "under certain circumstances, a brief contact with an alien civilization will be recorded in a re-constructible manner.  He further states that the reconstruction will be greatly aided if 1) the account is committed to written record soon after the event; 2) a major change is effected in the contacted society; and 3) no attempt is made by the contacting civilization to disguise its exogenous nature."&lt;ref&gt;Shklovski and Sagan; p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Shklovski and Sagan cited tales of [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]], a fishlike being attributed with teaching agriculture, mathematics, and the arts to early Sumerians, as deserving closer scrutiny as a possible instance of paleocontact due to its consistency and detail.&lt;ref&gt;"stories like the Oannes legend, and representations especially of the earliest civilizations on Earth, deserve much more critical studies than have been performed heretofore, with the possibility of direct [[Close encounter|contact with an extraterrestrial]] civilization as one of many possible alternative explanations". Shklovski and Sagan, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1979 book ''[[Broca's Brain]]'', Sagan suggested that he and Shklovski might have inspired the wave of 1970s ancient astronaut books, expressing disapproval of "von Däniken and other uncritical writers" who seemingly built on these ideas not as guarded speculations but as "valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact."&lt;ref name="Sagan1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl |title=Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlXPqexwO28C&amp;pg=PA79  |year=1979 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=0-345-33689-5 |chapter=White Dwarfs and Little Green Men |page=77-94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan argued that while many legends, artifacts, and purported [[out-of-place artifact]]s were cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses, "very few require more than passing mention" and could be easily explained with more conventional hypotheses. Sagan also reiterated his earlier conclusion that extraterrestrial visits to Earth were possible but unproven, and improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shklovskiĭ | first = I.

=== Erich von Däniken ===
{{Main article|Erich von Däniken}}
[[File:Pacal the Great tomb lid.svg|thumb|According to [[Erich von Däniken]], the Sarcophagus lid of [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal|Pacal the Great]] represents an "ancient astronaut" ascending to the stars in his spaceship.]]

Erich von Däniken was a leading proponent of this hypothesis in the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining a large audience through the 1968 publication of his best-selling book ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' and its sequels.

According to von Däniken, certain artifacts require a more sophisticated technological ability in their construction than that which was available to the ancient cultures who constructed them. Von Däniken maintains that these artifacts were constructed either directly by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from said visitors. These include [[Stonehenge]], [[Pumapunku]], the [[Moai]] of [[Easter Island]], the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], and the [[Baghdad Battery|ancient Baghdad electric batteries]].

[[File:Hieroglif z Abydos.jpg|left|thumb|The so-called "[[Helicopter hieroglyphs]]", at [[Abydos, Egypt]], which are argued to depict flying craft ]]
Von Däniken writes that ancient art and [[iconography]] throughout the world illustrates air and space vehicles, non-human but intelligent creatures, ancient astronauts, and artifacts of an anachronistically advanced technology. Von Däniken also states that geographically separated historical cultures share artistic themes, which he argues imply a common origin. One such example is von Däniken's interpretation of the sarcophagus lid recovered from the tomb of the Classic-era [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruler of [[Palenque]], [[Pacal the Great]]. Von Däniken writes that the design represented a seated astronaut. The iconography and accompanying [[Maya script|Maya text]], however, identifies it as a portrait of the ruler himself with the [[Wacah Chan|World Tree]] of [[Maya mythology]].

The origins of many religions are interpreted by von Däniken as reactions to encounters with an alien race. According to his view, humans considered the technology of the aliens to be [[supernatural]] and the aliens themselves to be [[god]]s. Von Däniken states that the oral and written traditions of most religions contain references to alien visitors in the way of descriptions of stars and vehicular objects travelling through air and space. One such is [[Ezekiel]]'s revelation in the [[Old Testament]], which Däniken interprets as a detailed description of a landing spacecraft ([[The Spaceships of Ezekiel]]).

Von Däniken's hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. after the [[NBC-TV]] documentary ''In Search Of Ancient Astronauts'' hosted by [[Rod Serling]] and the film ''[[Chariots of the Gods (film)|Chariots of the Gods]]''.

Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, that many of his claims were unfounded, and that none of his core claims have been validated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debunker.com/texts/vondanik.html "Erich von Däniken's ''Chariots of the Gods?'': Science or Charlatanism?"]; Robert Sheaffer. Via Debunker.com; originally published in ''NICAP UFO Investigator'', October/November 1974&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the [[Christian]] [[creationist]] community is highly critical of many of von Däniken's work. [[Young earth creationist|Young Earth creationist]] author Clifford A. Wilson published ''Crash Go the Chariots'' in 1972 in which he attempted to discredit all the claims made in ''Chariots of the Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Wilson, Crash Go the Chariots, Lancer Books, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zecharia Sitchin ===
{{Main article|Zecharia Sitchin}}
Zecharia Sitchin's series The Earth Chronicles, beginning with ''The 12th Planet'', revolves around Sitchin's unique interpretation of ancient [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Middle East]]ern texts, [[megalithic]] sites, and artifacts from around the world.&lt;ref name="Skepdic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepdic.com/sitchin.html| title=The Skeptic's Dictionary| last=Carroll| first=Robert T| date=1994–2009| work=Zecharia Sitchin and The Earth Chronicles| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT, Kilgannon"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/nyregion/10alone.html| title=Origin of the Species, From an Alien View| last=Kilgannon| first=Corey| date=January 8, 2010| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=29 October 2010| quote=Mr. Sitchin was called silly before—by scientists, historians and archaeologists who dismiss his hypotheses as pseudoscience and fault their underpinnings—his translations of ancient texts and his understanding of physics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He hypothesizes that the gods of old [[Mesopotamia]] were astronauts from the planet "[[Nibiru (Sitchin)|Nibiru]]", which Sitchin states the Sumerians believed to be a remote "12th planet" (counting the Sun, Moon, and [[Pluto]] as planets) associated with the god [[Marduk]]. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit our sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit.  Modern [[astronomy]] has found no evidence to support Sitchin's ideas.&lt;ref name="Skepdic" /&gt;

Sitchin argues that there are Sumerian texts which tell the story that 50 [[Anunnaki]], inhabitants of a planet named Nibiru, came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago with the intent of mining raw materials, especially gold, for transport back to Nibiru. With their small numbers they soon grew tired of the task and set out to genetically engineer laborers to work the mines. After much trial and error they eventually created ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'': the "[[Adapa]]" (model man) or [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] of later mythology. Sitchin contended the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the abrupt end of the last [[ice age]] some 12,000 years ago. Seeing that humans survived and all they had built was destroyed, the Anunnaki left Earth after giving humans the opportunity and means to govern themselves. Sitchin's work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been roundly criticized by professionals that have reviewed his hypotheses. [[Semitic languages]] scholar [[Michael S. Heiser]] says that many of Sitchin's translations of Sumerian and Mesopotamian words are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries, produced by ancient [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] scribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://sitchiniswrong.com/letter/letter.htm |title= Open Letter to Zecharia Sitchin |work= stichiniswrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilkington"&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/199/zechariah_sitchin.html "Zechariah Sitchin"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403132246/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/199/zechariah_sitchin.html|date=April 3, 2013}}, [[Mark Pilkington (writer)|Mark Pilkington]], ''[[Fortean Times]]'', August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/anunnaki/anunnaki.htm |title=The Anunnaki |work= stichiniswrong.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan F. Alford]], author of ''Gods of the New Millennium'' (1996), was an adherent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis. Much of his work draws on Sitchin's hypotheses. However, he now finds fault with Sitchin's hypothesis after deeper analysis, stating that: "I am now firmly of the opinion that these gods personified the falling sky; in other words, the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth which stood at the heart of ancient Near Eastern religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.eridu.co.uk/Author/human_origins/ancient_astronauts.html| title= Ancient Astronauts| publisher= Eridu.co.uk| accessdate= 2011-06-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717033657/http://www.eridu.co.uk/Author/human_origins/ancient_astronauts.html| archivedate= 17 July 2011| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Temple ===
{{Main article|Robert K. G. Temple}}
Robert K. G. Temple's 1976 book, ''[[The Sirius Mystery]] ''argues that the [[Dogon people]] of northwestern [[Mali]] preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Sumer]]. His work draws heavily on the studies of [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Germaine Dieterlen]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Robert K. G., ''The Sirius Mystery'', 1976. {{ISBN|0-09-925744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies within Temple's account, and suggested that the Dogon may have received some of their astronomical information recently, probably from European sources, and may have misrepresented Dogon ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl, Broca's Brain, published by Random House, Inc. in 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |title=Investigating the Sirius 'Mystery' |accessdate=2007-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216222836/http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }} - ''Skeptical Inquirer'' (1978) Ian Ridpath&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van Beek | first1 = Walter E.

=== UFO religions ===
{{Main article|UFO religion}}
Various [[new religious movement]]s including some branches of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], [[Scientology]], [[Raëlism]], and [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these faiths see both ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens from other planetary systems. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities which suggest that members of these groups consciously or [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminally]] associate enchantment with the [[meme]]s of [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=UFO religions| author=Partridge, C.H.| isbn=978-0-415-26324-5| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHT8CeeiWlIC| date=2003| publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence cited by proponents ==
[[File:Rama welcomed.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Rama]] being welcomed upon his return to [[Ayodhya]] in king Ravana's flying chariot [[Pushpaka Vimana]].]]

Among scientists, the consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not  ''per se'' wrong, but unnecessary. The "mysteries" cited as evidence for the hypothesis can be explained without having to invoke ancient astronauts; proponents look for mysteries where none exist.&lt;ref name="Hines"&gt;Hines. T. ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books, 2003. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, [[Occam's razor]] should be applied and the hypothesis rejected according to the scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, R. T. ''The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions''. Wiley, 2003. pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient religious texts ===
Proponents cite ancient mythologies to support their viewpoints based on the idea that ancient creation myths of gods who descend from the heavens to Earth to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors, whose superior technology accounts for their perception as gods. Proponents draw an analogy to occurrences in modern times when isolated cultures are exposed to Western technology, such as when, in the early 20th century, "[[cargo cult]]s" were discovered in the South Pacific: cultures who believed various Western ships and their cargo to be sent from the gods as fulfillment of prophecies concerning their return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cargocult.htm "Cargo Cults"]; SJSU.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Sumerian myth of ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', inscribed on cuneiform tablets and part of the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]], says humankind was created to serve gods called the "''[[Annunaki]]''". Hypothesis proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to earth to mine gold for their own uses.  According to the Enuma Elish story, the Annunaki realized mining gold was taking a toll on their race, and then created the human race as slaves.&lt;ref group=Cited name=Enuma&gt;{{cite web | last=Mark| first=Joshua J.| title=Enuma Elish – The Babylonian Epic of Creation |url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/225/| work=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar of [[Christ myth theory|Christ mythicism]] [[Dorothy Murdock]] criticized ancient astronauts theories, asserting that they "may be prompted by the same type of motivation that produced the Bible, a chronicle largely consisting of the plagiarized myths of other cultures" refashioned as historical facts concerning purported historical characters, and may be driven by the attempt to validate Biblical mythology as historical under a new pseudo-scientific interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Murdock|first=Dorothy Milne|title=Who are the Anunnaki?|date=6 January 2014|website=Truth Be Known|url=http://www.truthbeknown.com/anunnaki.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Ramayana'' ====
{{See also|Vaimānika Shāstra}}
In [[Hindu mythology]], [[Hindu deities|the gods]] and their [[avatar]]s travel from place to place in flying vehicles (see [[Vimana]]). There are many mentions of these flying machines in the ''[[Ramayana]]'', which used by Tamil king Ravana from Sri Lanka dates to the 5th or 4th century BCE. Below are some examples:

From Book 6, Canto CXXIII: The Magic Car:&lt;ref name="ramayana"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/index.htm | title=''Rámáyan of Válmíki'', translated by Ralph T. H. Griffith |publisher=Sacred Texts |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Is not the wondrous chariot mine,&lt;br /&gt;
Named Pushpak, wrought by hands divine.&lt;br /&gt;
…&lt;br /&gt;
This chariot, kept with utmost care,&lt;br /&gt;
Will waft thee through the fields of air,&lt;br /&gt;
And thou shalt light unwearied down&lt;br /&gt;
In fair Ayodhyá's royal town.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From Book 6, Canto CXXIV: The Departure:&lt;ref name="ramayana" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Swift through the air, as [[Rama|Ráma]] chose,&lt;br /&gt;
The wondrous car from earth arose.&lt;br /&gt;
And decked with swans and silver wings&lt;br /&gt;
Bore through the clouds its freight of kings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Erich von Däniken discusses the ''Ramayana'' and the ''vimanas'' in Chapter 6 of ''Chariots of the Gods?'' suggesting that they were "space vehicles".  To support his hypothesis, he offers a quotation which he says is from an 1889 translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' by C. Roy: "[[Bhima]] flew with his Vimana on an enormous ray which was as brilliant as the sun and made a noise like the thunder of a storm".&lt;ref&gt;von Däniken, Erich; ''Chariots of the Gods?''; "Chapter 6: Ancient Imagination and Legends or Ancient Facts?"; 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.main.org/polycosmos/glxywest/vimanas.htm ''Vimanas'']; Main; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Book of Genesis and Book of Enoch ====
The [[Book of Genesis]], Chapter 6 verses 1-2 and 4, states:&lt;blockquote&gt;When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the [[sons of God]] saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;The [[Nephilim]] were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them.&lt;br /&gt;— Genesis 6:1–4 (New International Version)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Christians consider these groups to be the different families of Adam and Eve's children.  Another interpretation is that the Nephilim are the children of the "sons of God" and "daughters of humans", although scholars are uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr]] says "it is not easy to be certain of the interpretation of this strange passage." "Nephilim," The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, James Orr, ed., (Chicago: Howard-Severance, 1930), Vol. IV, p. 2133.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Version]] translates "Nephilim" as "giants" (or [[Gibborim (biblical)|Gibborim]]).  Ancient Astronaut theorists argue that Adam and Eve ate of the [[forbidden fruit]] in order "to be godlike", and this was the first step in [[human evolution]].

The first part of the apocryphal [[Book of Enoch]] expands and interprets Genesis 6:1: that the "sons of God" were a group of 200 "[[angel]]s" called "[[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]]", who descended to Earth to breed with humans. Their offspring are the Nephilim, "giants" who "consumed all the acquisitions of men". When humans could no longer sustain the Nephilim, they turned against humanity. The Watchers also instructed humans in [[metallurgy]] and [[metalworking]], [[cosmetics]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[astrology]], [[astronomy]], and [[meteorology]]. God then ordered the Watchers to be imprisoned in the ground, and created the Great Flood (or the numerous [[Deluge myth]]s) to rid Earth of the Nephilim and of the humans given knowledge by the Watchers. To ensure humanity's survival, [[Noah]] is forewarned of the oncoming destruction. Because they disobeyed God, the book describes the Watchers as "[[fallen angel]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enoksbok.se/cgi-bin/slaupp.cgi?%7C1%7C1%7C%7Cjmf |title=''Book of Enoch'' (English and Swedish translations) |publisher=Enoksbok.se |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient astronaut proponents argue that this story is a historical account of extraterrestrials visiting Earth, called Watchers because their mission was to observe humanity. Some of the extraterrestrials disobeyed orders; they made contact with humans, cross-bred with human females, and shared knowledge with them. The Nephilim were thus half-human-half-extraterrestrial [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ancient Aliens]]'', Series 2 Episode 7: Angels and Aliens&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman argue that modern UFOs carry the fallen angels, or offspring of fallen angels, and that "Noah's genealogy was not tarnished by the intrusion of fallen angels.  It seems that this adulteration of the human gene pool was a major problem on the planet earth".&lt;ref&gt;Missler, Chuck, and Mark Eastman, ''Alien Encounters: The Secret Behind the UFO Phenomenon'' (Coeur d'Alene, ID: Koinonia House, 1997), 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Däniken also suggests that the two angels who visited [[Lot (biblical figure)|Lot]] in Genesis 19 were ancient astronauts, who used atomic weapons to destroy the city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].&lt;ref&gt;von Däniken, 37. Le Poer Trench had previously speculated that a space vehicle had used nuclear weapons to destroy Sodom; Brinsley Le Poer Trench, ''The Sky People'' (New York: Award Books, 1970; copyright 1960, London) 64-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Dem reinterprets the Book of Genesis by writing that humanity started on another planet and that the God of the Bible is an extraterrestrial.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Stein, The encyclopedia of the paranormal, Prometheus Books, 1996 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Book of Ezekiel ====
[[File:Ezekiel's vision.jpg|thumb|An engraved illustration of Ezekiel's 'vision' (1670)]]
In the [[Old Testament]], Chapter 1 of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] recounts a vision in which Ezekiel sees "an immense cloud" that contains fire and emits lightning and "brilliant light". It continues: "The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures". These creatures are described as winged and humanoid, they "sped back and forth like flashes of lightning" and "fire moved back and forth among the creatures". The passage goes on to describe four shiny objects, each appearing "like a wheel intersecting a wheel". These objects could fly and they moved with the creatures: "When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose".&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 1, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chapter 4 of ''Chariots of the Gods?'', entitled "Was God an Astronaut?", von Däniken suggests that Ezekiel had seen a spaceship or spaceships; this hypothesis had been put forward by [[Morris Jessup]] in 1956&lt;ref&gt;von Daniken, 38-9.  [[Morris K. Jessup]], ''UFO and the Bible'' (New York: Citadel Press, 1956) 56-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Arthur W. Orton in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur W. |last=Orton|title=The Four-Faced Visitors of Ezekiel|publisher= Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction|date= March 1961|page= 99 |via=e-text at Project Gutenberg|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30252}}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed version of this hypothesis was described by Josef F. Blumrich in his book ''[[The Spaceships of Ezekiel]]'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;Josef F. Blumrich: ''[[The Spaceships of Ezekiel]]'', Corgi Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Elsewhere in the Bible ====
The characteristics of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the [[Urim and Thummim]] have been said to suggest high technology, perhaps from alien origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://farshores.org/a06ark.htm |title=AncientDimensions Mysteries: De-Coded: The Ark Of The Covenant |publisher=Farshores.org |accessdate=2011-06-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726050113/http://farshores.org/a06ark.htm| archivedate= 26 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Dione]] and [[Paul Misraki]] published books in the 1960s describing the events in the [[Bible]] as caused by [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Profile of Paul Misraki in UFOs in the 1980s by Jerome Clark, Apogee Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip H. Melling, Fundamentalism in America: millennialism, identity and militant religion, 1999, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Downing]], a [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], wrote a book in 1968 arguing that [[Jesus]] was an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], citing John 8:23 and other biblical verses as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The Bible and Flying Saucers First Edition 1968. Second edition published in 1997 {{ISBN|1-56924-745-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient astronaut proponents such as [[Von Däniken]] and [[Barry Downing]] believe that the concept of [[hell]] in the [[Bible]] could be a real description of the planet [[Venus]] brought to Earth by [[extraterrestrials]] showing photos of the hot surface on Venus to [[human]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QO0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=venus+hell&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=38L0TZ6NKdG38gO--ZCaBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=venus%20hell&amp;f=false |title="Hell is on the planet Venus" Weekly World News Aug 31, 1993 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1993-08-31 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of the hypothesis state that '[[God]]' and '[[Satan]]' were aliens that disagreed on whether or not human beings should be allowed the information that is offered by the tree of knowledge.  [[David Childress]], a leading proponent of ancient astronaut creation hypothesis, compares this story to the Greek tale of [[Prometheus]], who gave mankind the knowledge of fire.  Ancient Astronaut theorists believe the biblical concept of Satan is based on a misunderstood visit by extraterrestrials.  [[Erich von Däniken]] posited that the descendants of extraterrestrials had children with [[hominid]]s, and this was referred to in the Bible as the "[[Original sin]]." Von Däniken believes that the biblical [[flood myth|great flood]] was punishment after an extraterrestrial 'God' discovered that earthbound, [[fallen angel]]s were mating with ape-like early humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Ancient Aliens and the Creation of Man | url = http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/episodes/season-3 | series = Ancient Aliens | network = [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] | airdate = 2011-11-24 | minutes = 27:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish Book of Invasions====
[[David Childress|Childress]] and others have written that the passage in the [[Book of Invasions]] describing the arrival of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] in Ireland, records "the arrival of aliens in spacecraft with cloaking devices" at [[Slieve Anierin]]. The key text states “so that they were the Tuatha De Danand who came to Ireland. In this wise they came, in dark clouds. They landed on the mountains of Conmaicne Rein in Connacht and they brought a darkness over the sun for three days and three nights".{{sfn|Colavito|2015|pp=94-95}}

==== Worldwide petroglyphic evidence ====
Ancient astronaut theorists believe [[Hopi]] cave drawings of [[Kachinas]] found in the southwestern desert, link the origins of [[Hopi]] and Zuni tribes with "star people". They point to similar etchings elsewhere as evidence that extraterrestrials visited many different ancient civilizations.

Other artistic support for the ancient astronaut hypothesis has been sought in [[Palaeolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. [[Wondjina]] in Australia and in the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]], in Italy (seen above) are said to bear a resemblance to present day astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;Cave paintings and locations such as Wondinja and are discussed in the book UFO: the continuing enigma, Reader's Digest Association, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the ancient astronaut hypothesis sometimes argue that similarities such as dome shaped heads, interpreted as beings wearing space helmets, prove that early man was visited by an extraterrestrial race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etcontact.net/AncientAstronauts.htm |title=UFO Evidence |publisher=Etcontact.net |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nazca Lines ====
[[File:Nasca Astronaut 2007 08.JPG|thumb|A large [[geoglyph]] near the Nazca Lines, thought by some to represent an astronaut]]
The ancient [[Nazca Lines]] are hundreds of huge ground drawings etched into the high desert of southern [[Peru]]. Some are stylized animals and humanoid figures, while others are merely straight lines hundreds of meters long. As the figures were made to be seen from a great height, they have been linked with the ancient astronaut hypothesis. In the 1970s, the pseudohistorical writer [[Erich von Däniken]] popularized a notion that the Nazca lines and figures could have been made "according to instructions from aircraft" and that the longer and wider lines might be [[runway]]s for spacecraft. According to archaeologist [[Kenneth Feder]], Von Däniken's extraterrestrial interpretation is not supported by any evidence. Feder wrote that "the lines are interpreted by archaeologists as ceremonial pathways of the ancient Nazca people; they were used precisely in this way in the fairly recent past."&lt;ref&gt;Feder, K. L. "Ancient Astronauts". In Michael Shermer (Ed). ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Joe Nickell]] of the [[University of Kentucky]], was able to re-create one of the figures using only wooden stakes and string.&lt;ref name=nazca1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onagocag.com/nazca.html |title=The Mysterious Nazca Lines |publisher=Onagocag.com |date=1982-08-07 |accessdate=2011-06-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715000556/http://www.onagocag.com/nazca.html| archivedate= 15 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AhuTongariki.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ahu Tongariki]] near [[Rano Raraku]]; ancient astronaut proponents state that the stone structures were built by (or with the help of) extraterrestrials]]

Proposed evidence for ancient astronauts includes the existence of ancient monuments and [[megalithic]] ruins such as the [[Giza pyramids]] of Egypt, [[Machu Picchu]] in Peru, or [[Baalbek]] in [[Lebanon]], the [[Moai]] of [[Easter Island]] and [[Stonehenge]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Penczak, Ascension Magick: Ritual, Myth &amp; Healing for the New Aeon, 2007, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters say that these stone structures could not have been built with the technical abilities and tools of the people of the time and further argue that many could not be duplicated even today. They suggest that the large size of the building stones, the precision with which they were laid, and the distances many were transported leaves the question open as to who constructed these sites.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

These ideas are categorically rejected by mainstream archeology. Some mainstream archeologists have participated in [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|experiments to move large megaliths]]. These experiments have succeeded in moving megaliths up to at least 40 tons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2403stone.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Transcripts &amp;#124; Secrets of Lost Empires &amp;#124; Stonehenge |publisher=PBS |date=1997-02-11 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=1999-08-27 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have speculated that with a larger workforce larger megaliths could be towed with the use of known ancient technology.&lt;ref&gt;History Channel "Mega Movers: Ancient Mystery Moves"&lt;/ref&gt; Such allegations are not unique in history, however, as similar reasoning lay behind the wonder of the [[Cyclopean structures|Cyclopean masonry]] walling at [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cities in the eyes of Greeks of the following "[[Greek Dark Ages]]", who believed that the giant [[Cyclops]] had built the walls.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== In popular culture ==
{{Main article|Ancient astronauts in popular culture}}

Ancient astronauts have been addressed frequently in science fiction and horror fiction in many different media. In a 2004 article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine, [[Jason Colavito]] writes that von Däniken borrowed many of the book's concepts from ''[[The Morning of the Magicians|Le Matin des Magiciens]]'' (''Morning of the Magicians''), that this book in turn was heavily influenced by the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], and that the core of the ancient astronaut hypothesis originates in [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s works "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]" and ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colavito |first=Jason |year=2004 |title=Charioteer of the Gods |url=https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/04-04-26/ |magazine=Skeptic |volume=10 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Colavito later expanded on this idea in his book ''[[The Cult of Alien Gods|The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture]]''.

''[[Ancient Aliens]]'' is a television series that features the main proponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis, such as [[Giorgio A. Tsoukalos]], [[David Childress]], [[Erich von Däniken]], [[Steven M.

It is located in the [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in the United States. The {{Convert|15|ft|adj=on}} [[statue]] depicting the Assyrian [[Ashurbanipal|king of the same name]] was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts and presented to the City of San Francisco in 1988 as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]]. The sculpture reportedly cost $100,000 and was the first "sizable" bronze statue of Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; It is administered by the City and County of San Francisco and the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]].

Parhad's work was met with some criticism by local Assyrians, who argued it was inaccurate to portray Ashurbanipal holding a [[clay tablet]] and a lion, or wearing a [[skirt]]. The critics thought the statue looked more like the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]; Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", believed the sculpture depicted neither figure, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure". Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Hero lion Dur-Sharrukin Louvre AO19862.jpg|thumb|left|Possible representation of Enkidu as [[Master of Animals]] grasping a lion and snake, in an [[Assyrian palace relief]], from [[Dur-Sharrukin]], now Louvre]]
In [[Assyrian sculpture]], the famous colossal entrance way guardian figures of ''[[lamassu]]'' were often accompanied by a hero grasping a wriggling lion with one hand and typically a snake with the other, also colossal and in high relief; these are generally the only other types of high relief in Assyrian sculpture.  They continue the [[Master of Animals]] tradition in Mesopotamian art, and may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  In the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Khorsabad]], a group of at least seven ''lamassu'' and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the "throne room", "a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Frankfort|Frankfort, Henri]], ''The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient'', pp. 147-148, 148 quoted, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0140561072}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrangement was repeated in [[Sennacherib]]'s palace at [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, John M., Section 6.

==History==
''Ashurbanipal'' was designed by Fred Parhad, an [[Iraq]]i-born artist of [[Assyria]]n descent. Parhad rejected formal arts studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and relocated to New York, where the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] allowed him to study its Assyrian collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caroun.com/Sculpture/Artists/USA/FredParhad/FredParhad.html|title=Fred Parhad|accessdate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Caroun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts under the direction of its president, [[Narsai David]].&lt;ref name=Ishaya&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies|first=Arianne|last=Ishaya|title=Settling Into Diaspora: A History of Urmia Assyrians in the United States|accessdate=August 9, 2013|year=2006|volume=20|number=1|page=26|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v20n1/Arianne-diaspora.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation also claims to have commissioned the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auaf.us/Who%20is%20who/Art/Art.htm |title=Who Is Who |publisher=Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200831/http://www.auaf.us/Who%20is%20who/Art/Art.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were collected from [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac Americans|Assyrians throughout the United States]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19871228&amp;id=1v4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=efwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6964,9530701|title=Statue of Assyrian king in skirt stirs controversy|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]|location=Nashua, New Hampshire|volume=119|number=228|oclc=22532489|first=Elizabeth|last=Fernandez|date=December 31, 1987|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Convert|8|ft|adj=on}} [[patina]]ted [[bronze]] statue,&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; mounted on a base and a [[plinth]] to reach a total height of {{Convert|15|ft}}, weighs approximately {{Convert|1800|lb}}. It depicts Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian king known for building the eponymously named [[Library of Ashurbanipal]], the first and largest library in [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref name=Ishaya/&gt; The bearded king is shown wearing [[earring]]s and a [[tunic]]; he is holding a book (or [[clay tablet]]) in one arm and a lion cub in the other.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; According to the Historical Marker Database, the tablet reads in [[cuneiform]]: "Peace unto heaven and earth / Peace unto countries and cities / Peace unto the dwellers in all lands / This is the statue presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian people in the 210th year of America's sovereignty".&lt;ref name=HMD&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=32080|title=Ashurbanipal Monument|accessdate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Historical Marker Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "larger-than-life", full length statue stands above a plinth adorned with a lotus blossom design and a [[concrete]] base with an [[anti-graffiti coating]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; The base includes rosettes and a bronze plaque.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; One inscription below the statue reads the text of the tablet in English, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The text "Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria, 669–627 B.C." appears above and the text "Dedicated May 29, 1988" appears below, both in English.&lt;ref name=HMD/&gt; Another inscription below the statue reads, "Presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts through donations of American Assyrian Association of San Francisco / Assyrian American National Federation", followed by a list of names of donors.&lt;ref name=HMD/&gt; In December 2010, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that a large plaque from the sculpture was missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Passenger-climbs-aboard-needles-and-all-2453277.php|title=Passenger climbs aboard, needles and all|date=December 17, 2010|first= Leah|last=Garchik|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 9, 2013|issn=1932-8672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:San Francisco Civic Center Historic District 11.jpg|thumb|right|The statue, mounted on its base in front of the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]], in 2011]]

In December 1987, as news began to circulate about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included the depiction of the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed he would never have worn.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]. One critic said: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Narsai David responded: &lt;blockquote&gt;They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum-quality reproduction.... We have always said this is a characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", said the statue depicted neither Ashurbanipal or Gilgamesh, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure, like a guard."&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]] and attempted to incorporate the various aspects of Assyrian culture, from its hunting mastery to its admiration for writing. He said of the sculpture: &lt;blockquote&gt;The piece has authentic qualities to it, but it is also my statue.... With the earrings and the clothing and the hair and his daggers, it is Ashurbanipal. But in the choice of (stance), the fact that he is holding a tablet and a lion, that is mine. I wanted myself to be represented in the piece.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Bannai''' is a script form of the Islamic [[calligraphy]]. It was used primarily in [[Iran]] in the building [[inscription]]s. It is a kind of angular [[Kufic]] script, which has [[geometric]] forms like [[square]], [[rhombus]], [[rectangular]], [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] and [[cross]]ed [[Line (geometry)|line]]s. The foundation of Bannai script is the [[Horizontal and vertical|horizontal]] and [[Horizontal and vertical|vertical]] directions of the lines, which have always equal thickness and fill completely the geometrical form.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Book trade in the United Kingdom''' has its roots as far back as the 14th century, however the emergence of [[E-commerce|internet]] [[booksellers]] such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] partnered with the introduction of the [[e-Book]] has drastically altered the scope of the industry. Book retailers such as the [[Borders Group]] have failed to adjust to these changes, thus there has been a steep decline in the number of operating traditional and independent bookshops. However, still heavily influential on the trade globally, British publishers such as [[Penguin Books]] and  [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] remain dominant players within the industry and continue to publish titles gloablly.

[[File:Charles Dickens - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|Charles Dickens: [http://www.gutenberg.org Project Gutenberg]]]

==History==

By the 14th century a commercial book trade had been established in the UK, and before printing was introduced to Europe by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439 the trade consisted of scribes who wrote manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)P.9&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century the majority of those engaged in these activities were situated in London and belonged to a trade guild called the Company of [[Stationers]].&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)p.23&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 16th century publishers and printers controlled the book trade and introduced a commercial aspect, relying for much of their income on the sales of popular religious books, almanacs, prognostications and similar literature.&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 20th century, as literacy became increasingly universal within society and disposable income increased, publishers were faced with new opportunities. In 1900 the [[Net Book Agreement]] was introduced to ‘help to maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles’&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005) P150&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction and demise of the [[Net Book Agreement]] heavily impacted the [[publishing industry]]. First established in 1900, the Act involved an agreement between booksellers and publishers to fix the price of books in order to "help maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles"&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)p.150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
The structure of the industry within the UK has altered significantly over the last few decades, which now establishes itself as part of wider industry globally dominated by international giants such a [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] (UK), [[Muse Corporation]] (United States), and [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] (France). The gap between small independent booksellers and giant chain sellers has vastly increased, leading to the dissolution of many medium-sized companies; "Overall the number of significant companies has dropped by ten percent in the last decade".&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Paul; Taylor, Graham, ''A Guide to the UK Publishing Industry'', (London: The Publishers Association, 2008) p15&lt;/ref&gt; 
Technology has extensively affected developments within the publishing industry. Due to having one of the highest levels of internet connectivity in Europe, the industry in the UK experiences the prevalent threat and the vast opportunity of revolutionary technological advances such as the [[e-book]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]; almost all book publishers in the UK now utilize the standard book number.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Paul; Taylor, Graham, ''A Guide to the UK Publishing Industry'', (London: The Publishers Association, 2008)p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookshops have begun to decline over the years, with just over 73 closures in 2013 alone, the UK lost 7% of its remaining Independent book stores.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Alison, ''Decline in Independent Bookshops continues with 73 closures in 2012'', The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/22/independent-bookshops-73-closures-2012) [accessed 03/12/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of independent book shops has now fallen below 1,000 (2014) whilst even bigger booksellers such as [[Borders]] went into liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Mike,''Borders forced to liquidate, Close all stores'', The Wall Street Journal (http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303661904576454353768550280) [accessed 03/12/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the publishing contributed to the UK creative economy with 231,000 jobs that had an almost equal split between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/industries/publishing/publishing-facts-and-figures], The Creative Industries website, accessed 10 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014, brick and mortar shops have been performing better, seeing a light at the end of the Recession period and the boom of the Kindle. Looking at the data provided, Richard Mollet, chief executive of The Publishers Association, explains that "those who ever tried to maintain that this was a binary choice have been shown to have been posing the question in the wrong way. It is not a question of either physical or digital winning out, but rather of the sector coalescing around a balanced marketplace where all formats have place. While publishing has been efficient and effective in its adaptation, the underlying driver of the evolution is of course the reader. What the 21st-century consumer desires above all is choice. As long as publishers can give readers the option of paper or screen, the market will - and is - taking care of itself. The ebook is no more a challenge to the lifespan of paper than television is to the theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = PA statistics yearbook 2014|last = Clee|first = Nicholas|publisher = Publishers Association|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0853863694|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK publishers of online, publicly accessible [[open access]] books include [[Open Book Publishers]], [[Ubiquity Press]], and [[UCL Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/open-access-and-monographs/ |title=Open access and monographs |date=27 July 2018 |work= Re.ukri.org |publisher=[[Research England]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Asherah pole}}
An Asherah pole is a sacred [[tree]] or pole that stood near [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] religious locations to honor the [[Asherah|Ugaritic mother-goddess Asherah]], [[Spouse|consort]] of [[El (deity)|El]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ed. ''Religions of the Ancient World'', (Belnap Press, Harvard) 2004, p. 418; the book-length scholarly treatment is W.L. Reed, ''The Asherah in the Old Testament'' (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press) 1949; the connection of the pillar figurines with Asherah was made by [[Raphael Patai]] in ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of the literary references to an ''asherah'' and archaeological finds of Judaean pillar-figurines has engendered a literature of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized and sharply criticized in Raz Kletter's ''The Judean Pillar-Figurines and the Archaeology of Asherah'' (Oxford: Tempus Reparatum), 1996; Kletter gives a catalogue of material remains but his conclusions were not well received in the scholarly press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''asherim'' were also [[cult object]]s related to the worship of the [[fertility god]]dess Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud|Kuntillet ‘Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom attest, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]],&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Dever, "Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet ʿAjrûd" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'',1984; D.N. Freedman, "Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1987; [[Morton Smith]], "God Male and Female in the Old Testament: Yahweh and his Asherah" ''Theological Studies'', 1987; J.M. Hadley "The Khirbet el-Qom Inscription", ''Vetus Testamentum'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and thus objects of contention among competing cults. The insertion of "''pole''" [[begs the question]] by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: "we are never told exactly what it was", observes John Day.&lt;ref&gt;John Day, "Asherah in the Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic Literature" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''105'''.3 (September 1986:385-408) p 401; ''asherim'' are discussed pp 401-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was certainly a movement against goddess-worship at the Jerusalem Temple in the time of King Josiah, it did not long survive his reign, as the following four kings "did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh" (2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19). Further exhortations came from [[Jeremiah]]. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite [[folk religion]] was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic, and it was the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles who were the innovators;&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, ''Did God have a wife?: Archaeology and folk religion in ancient Israel'', 2005, esp. pp&lt;/ref&gt; such theories inspire ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Ahituv (2006), ''Did God have a wife?'', ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Book Review&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Adi Parva]] ([[Textual criticism|critical edition]]) of Indian epic [[Mahabharata]]  a [[Bamboo|Bamboo festival]] named ''Shakrotsava'' was Celebrated in [[Chedi Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adi Parva]] ([[Textual criticism|critical edition]]) of Indian epic [[Mahabharata]] 1.63&lt;/ref&gt; Uparichara Vasu was a king of Chedi belonging to the [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]] dynasty. He was known as the friend of [[Indra]]. During his reign, Chedi kingdom  introduced ''Shakrotsava'' festival in his kingdom in the honor of Indra. The festival involved planting of a bamboo pole every year, in honor of Indra. The king will then pray for the expansion of his cities and kingdom. After erecting the pole, people decked it with golden cloth and scents and garlands and various ornaments. (1,63).

==Europe==
{{Main|Maypole|Mære Church}}
[[File:Maypole Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|Dancing around the maypole, in [[Åmmeberg]], Sweden]]
A [[maypole]] is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on [[May Day]] or [[Pentecost]] ([[Whitsun]]), although in some countries it is instead erected at [[Midsummer]]. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown, although it has been speculated that it originally had some importance in the [[Germanic paganism]]&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russel|first1=Jefferry Burton|title=Medieval Civilisation|orig-year=1968 |date=22 February 2005 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |location=Eugene|isbn=1-59752-103-5|page=243|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=C05LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Iron Age]] and early Medieval cultures, and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the [[Medieval]] and [[Early Modern]] periods, although became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in North America.&lt;ref name="Kelly Cannon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cannon|first1=Kelly|title=Good Neighbor: Former teacher continues tradition of Maypole dance|url=http://news.hjnews.com/news/good-neighbor-former-teacher-continues-tradition-of-maypole-dance/article_43e9b2fb-2f30-54b6-aeb3-34398c645005.html|accessdate=28 September 2015|work=From the Good Neighbors series|agency=The Herald Journal's Staff writer|issue=May 21, 2015|publisher=The Herald Journal, 75 West 300 North Logan, UT|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they were found primarily in areas of Germanic Europe, where, prior to Christianisation, [[Germanic paganism]] was followed in various forms, has led to speculation that the maypoles were in some way a continuation of a Germanic pagan tradition.&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton" /&gt; One theory holds that they were a remnant of the Germanic reverence for sacred trees, as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of Germanic Europe, including [[Thor's Oak]] and the [[Irminsul]].&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Pagan Europe'' by Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick, Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-15804-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-15804-6}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Frazer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James George|title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|date=1922|page=Chapter 10:: Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that, in [[Norse paganism]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] views held that the universe was a [[world tree]], known as [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;'The London quarterly review, Volumes 113-114', Theodore Foster, 1863, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The History of Religions' By Hopkins Edward Washburn, The McMillan Company 1929, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''European paganism: the realities of cult from antiquity to the Middle Ages'' by [[Ken Dowden]], Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-12034-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-12034-0}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Nart sagas from the Caucasus: myths and legends from the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs' by [[John Colarusso]], Princeton University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-691-02647-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02647-3}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The early history and antiquities of Freemasonry: as connected with ancient Norse guilds, and the oriental and mediæval building fraternities' by George Franklin Fort, Bradley, 1881, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

The floor of the [[Mære Church]], [[Norway]], was excavated in 1969&lt;ref&gt;Lidén, Hans-Emil. 1969. From Pagan Sanctuary to Christian Church, the Excavation of Mære Church in Trøndelag. Norwegian Archaeological Review. (1969) 2, pp. 3–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and found to contain the remains of a pagan cult structure. The nature of that structure was not clear. Lidén felt this represented the remains of a building, but a critique by Olsen (1969:26) in the same work suggested this may have been a site for pole-related rituals. A recent review of the evidence by Walaker (Norddide 2011: 107-113)&lt;ref&gt;Walaker Nordeide, Sæbjorg. 2011. The Viking Age As a Period of Religious Transformation: The Christianization of Norway from AD 560 to 1150/1200. {{ISBN|2503534805}}, Brepols Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that this site was similar to the site in Hove (Åsen, also in Nord-Trøndelag) and was therefore likely the site of a ceremonial pole.

'''Daniel J. Crowley''' (November 27, 1921&amp;nbsp;– February 24, 1998) was an [[United States|American]] [[art history|art historian]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] who focused on the cultural expressions of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]], with particular focus on the interconnectedness of carnivals, festivals, the arts and folklore.  Crowley also became a strong advocate for disability studies in [[anthropology]].

== Early years ==
Crowley was born in the St. Francis Hospital in [[Peoria, Illinois]].  He was one of two children born to Michael Bartholomew Jeremiah Crowley and Elsie Magdalena Cecilia Schnebelin.&lt;ref name="crowleycx"/&gt; He remained in Peoria into early adulthood.  After receiving a B.A. in Theory and Practice of Art from [[Northwestern University]] in 1943, Crowley served time with the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]] (1942–1947) as a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant JG]] with the [[USS American Legion]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;  In April 1946, he contracted [[poliomyelitis]] and was left a partial [[Quadraplegia|quadriplegic]].&lt;ref name="crowleycx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wf-1999"/&gt;

== Academic career ==

=== General history ===
After spending 10 months recovering from his bout with polio, Crowley continued to pursue his education.  He received an M.A. In Art History from [[Bradley University]] in 1948, followed by a Ph. D. In Anthropology (African Studies)&lt;ref name="crowleycx"/&gt; from [[Northwestern University]] in 1956 under the supervision of [[Melville Herskovits]] and in the intellectual tradition of [[Franz Boas]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;  Much of Crowley's scholarship was perpetuated by his love of travel&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; as many of his university appointments took him all over the world.

Crowley was hired as a member of [[University of California, Davis|The University of California, Davis]] faculty as a double Professor of Anthropology and Art in 1961.  He continued to teach at the university after his retirement in 1992.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;  Between the years of 1968–1971, Crowley received the UC Centennial Citation and became  the founding director of the UC Education Abroad Program in partnership with the [[University of Ghana|University of Ghana-Legon]].&lt;ref name="crowley1998"/&gt;  Throughout his career, Crowley was a member of the National Commission for [[UNESCO]] (1974–1980), served on many journal editorial boards, published 4 books, a commercial recording, and approximately 350 articles and reviews.&lt;ref name="crowley1998"/&gt;  Many university and national archives benefited from the donation of art and cultural memorabilia which he accumulated from places such as [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Aboriginal Australia]].&lt;ref name="crowley1998"/&gt;

According to his curriculum vitae, he conducted [[field research]] in: [[The Bahamas|the Bahama Islands]]; [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad, Tobago]], [[St. Lucia]]; Western European Ethnographic Museums; [[Zaire]], [[Angola]], [[Zambia]], [[Tanzania]]; [[Southern Africa]]; [[Mexico]]; [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Dahomey]]; [[Senegambia]]; [[Brazil]]; [[India]]; [[Guinea-Bissau]]; [[the Canary Islands]]; [[Cape Verde]]; [[Australia]]; [[New Guinea]], [[Melanesia]], [[Polynesia]].  His research interests included: African and African-derived societies; graphic and plastic arts, [[folklore]], [[music]]; the role of [[artists]] in [[culture]]; multi-cultural societies; ethnoaesthetics, comparative aesthetic values; [[festivals]] and [[carnivals]].&lt;ref name="crowley2"/&gt;

Through his experiences, Crowley identified himself as a Boasian particularist Folklorist.  Crowley felt his contributions to the sub-discipline of folklore were one of his more successful academic achievements.&lt;ref name="wf-1999"/&gt;

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Crowley's fieldwork in Sub-Saharan Africa was about rehabilitating "the image of Africa denigrated to justify [[African slavery|slavery]]".&lt;ref name="crowley2"/&gt;

=== The Caribbean ===
The majority of Crowley's fieldwork in the Caribbean was mainly undertaken in [[Nassau, The Bahamas]].  "I Could Talk Old-Story Good: Creativity in Bahamian Folklore" was reprinted in 1987 and utilized by the performance-oriented school of [[Folkloristics]].&lt;ref name="wf-1999"/&gt;

Field work was also conducted in [[Trinidad]], and it is here that Crowley met his wife, Pearl.  Crowley's 1956 paper, "Plural and Differential Acculturation in Trinidad" is an essential work to review on the Caribbean and one of his more influential works."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wf-1999"/&gt;

=== Disability studies ===
The [[American Anthropological Association]], in conjunction with the Crowley family, stated that Daniel was, "a pioneer and advocate for the disabled and role model for all who sought to overcome any kind of handicap."  Although he published little on [[disability]], he was a tireless advocate for travelling to engage with his field work and sharing that information upon return that identified Crowley as a primary inspiration for disability studies.  Richard Curley of [[University of California|The University of California]] emphasized this in a statement on Crowley: "Dan became a splendid, and early, role model for the disabled. He spoke candidly of his disability and was a great friend and supporter of many disabled people. His wheelchair never deterred him from visiting the most remote mountain village or attending conferences in out-of-the-way spots.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;  Crowley traveled to the most remote locations, having been in every country of the world, with the exception of Iraq (but not from lack of trying).

As John Michael Vlach and Phillip M. Peek have said in the [[Journal of American Folklore]] (1999), "He cleverly and bravely negotiated innumerable physical barriers the likes of which would have caused the able bodied to turn back."

In 1978, the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] listed Crowley as "The Most Travelled Disabled Person,"&amp;nbsp;– a category that was eventually discontinued.

== Personal life ==
Crowley's maintenance of humour and the positive view he spun on the [[human condition]] has been unanimously praised among numerous organizations and publishers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crowley1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas-1998"/&gt;

He met Pearl Ramcharan on his first trip to Trinidad and married her soon after.  They had three children together&amp;nbsp;– Peter, Eve (Eyzaguirre), and Magdalene.&lt;ref name="crowley1998"/&gt;

== Death ==
Crowley and a research expedition team from the University of California travelled to [[Oruro, Bolivia]] to study the major carnival there.  Mardi Gras was celebrated in conjunction with Martes de Ch'alla, which commemorates the earth goddess, [[Pachamama]].&lt;ref name="wf-1998"/&gt;  All of the research had been conducted and the team was about to make the journey home when he died.  Crowley died of [[congestive heart failure]] in his sleep on February 24, 1998.  The date of his death fell on [[Shrove Tuesday|Fat (Shrove) Tuesday]], the last day of the celebrations.&lt;ref name="crowleycx"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16465">'''Dream world''' (also called '''dream realm''' or '''illusory realm''') is a commonly used [[plot device]] in [[fiction]]al works, most notably in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction]]. The use of a dream world creates a situation whereby a [[fictional character|character]] (or group of characters) is placed in a marvellous and unpredictable environment and must overcome several personal problems to leave it. The dream world also commonly serves to teach some [[moral]] or [[religious]] lessons to the character experiencing it – a lesson that the other characters will be unaware of, but one that will influence decisions made regarding them. When the character is reintroduced into the real world (usually when they wake up), the question arises as to what exactly constitutes [[reality]] due to the vivid recollection and experiences of the dream world.

According to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], dream worlds contrast with [[fantasy world]]s, in which the world has existence independent of the characters in it.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', [[Ballantine Books]], New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; However, other authors have used the dreaming process as a way of accessing a world which, within the context of the fiction, holds as much consistency and continuity as physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;"Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences...&lt;br&gt;
... Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon."
– H.P. Lovecraft, from "Beyond the Wall of Sleep", as reprinted in ''The Dream Cycle of H. P. Lovecraft: Dreams of Terror and Death'' (Del Rey, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "dream frames" to contain a fantasy world, and so explain away its marvels, has been criticized and has become much less prevalent.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Dreams", p. 297 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional dream worlds==
{{Pop culture|date=February 2018}}
===Literature===
A similar motif, [[Locus amoenus]], is popular in medieval literature (esp. allegory and romance). A dream world is sometimes invoked in [[dream vision]]s such as ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt;

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 24.png|right|225px|thumb|The Cheshire Cat vanishes in Wonderland.]]
One of the best-known dream worlds is [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', as well as [[Looking-Glass Land]] from its sequel, ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and causality flexible. [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[Smirt]]'' and its two sequels taken together form an extended dream and most of their action takes place in a dream world.

The action of ''[[The Bridge (novel)|The Bridge]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]] and ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever]]'' by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] take place in dream worlds. Other fictional dream worlds include the [[Dreamlands]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[Dream Cycle]]''  and ''[[The Neverending Story]]''{{'}}s world of Fantasia, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by [[Philip K. Dick]], such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' and ''[[Ubik]]''. Similar themes were explored by  [[Jorge Luis Borges]], for instance in ''[[The Circular Ruins]]''.

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' book series, [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] is a dream world that exists in close proximity to the real world. Objects and physical locations that do not frequently change in the real world have parallels in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]]. Ordinary people can occasionally slip into [[Tel'aran'rhiod]], and events that occur within this dream world have physical consequences. A person that dies in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] will never wake up again, and in several cases it is shown that physical injuries gained there persist to the waking world. [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] can be controlled similar to a [[lucid dream]], and several characters in the series can enter and manipulate [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] at will.

''[[Paprika (novel)|Paprika]]'' (1993) by [[Yasutaka Tsutsui]] is a [[science fiction]] novel that involves entering dream worlds using technology. In the book, dream monitoring and intervention as a means of treating [[mental disorder]]s is a developing new form of [[psychotherapy]] in the near future. Unrest ensues when a new psychotherapy dream-analysis device is stolen, allowing the assailant to enter and manipulate people's dreams.

In the feminist science fiction novel ''[[The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You]]'', the Kin of Ata maintain the real world through their dreaming, making the real world a form of  dream.

===Film===
In the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 movie]], [[Land of Oz|Oz]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' was altered from a fantasy world (in the novel) to a dream world of Dorothy's; characters who were independent inhabitants of Oz were transformed into dream parallels of introduced Kansas characters.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo and the rest of the humans live inside a dream world. Their brains are hooked up to a computer network that creates this dream world. However, some may argue that this is not a dream world, as it seems completely normal and indistinguishable from reality (aside from time differences). In the 1980s, the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series]] of horror films introduced a dark dream realm inhabited by the supernatural serial killer [[Freddy Krueger]].

In the movie ''[[Sharkboy and Lavagirl]]'' the main characters enter a world dreamt up by a small boy in order to save the real world.
Down Town is the land of nightmares where all people who are in comas go in the movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''. Dreamworlds also appear in ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' and ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''.

''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'' (2006) is an [[anime]] film adaptation of the 1993 novel of the same name, which involves entering and manipulating dream worlds using dream-analysis devices.

The film ''[[Waking Life]]'' takes place almost entirely in a dream realm.  In the 2010 film ''[[Inception]]'', main characters create artificial, vivid dream worlds and bring others into the dream worlds and perform various things with their brains, without them knowing. This may involve 'Extraction' (stealing memories and secrets), 'Inception' (planting an idea into the mind) and others.

===Comic books, graphic novels and animation===
[[File:Little Nemo 1906-07-22 last two panels.jpg|thumb|A panel from [[Little Nemo]] (1906).]]
One of the earliest newspaper comic strips, recounting [[Little Nemo]]'s adventures in [[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland|Slumberland]], had a dream world theme.

Writer [[Neil Gaiman]] was tasked with re-imagining a Golden Age character, "[[Sandman (DC Comics)|The Sandman]]".  In his version, the Sandman becomes [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], the Lord of Dreams (also known, to various characters throughout the series, as [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]], [[Oneiroi|Oneiros]], the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, Dream Cat, Murphy, Kai'ckul, and Lord L'Zoril), who is essentially the [[anthropomorphic]] personification of [[dream]]s. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence.

Dream worlds also  appear in ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'', in the Outback(s) of ''[[The Maxx]]''; in Dream Land, the main setting of many [[Kirby series|''Kirby'' games]], in the webcomic ''[[The Dreamland Chronicles]]'',  and the movie ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS movie|Sailor Moon Super S the Movie: Black Dream Hole]]'' also have dream realms in their universes.

The ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]'' episode "Dreamscape" takes place mainly in a dream realm. Similarly, the ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' episode [[Dreamscape (Xiaolin Showdown)|of the same title]] also uses the dream world in its plotline.

In ''[[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]'' manga series such as ''[[X/1999]]'', ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', the dream world is very important to the events that occur within each story. It is later revealed in ''xxxHolic'' that the dream world itself is its own world, as part of the Clamp multiverse. Similarly, in the ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' graphic novel series by Jeff Smith, the primary plot device is a dream world called "The Dreaming." It exists independently from the real world, and it is described similarly to a river, being said to "flow" through people in "currents."

In ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' part 3 "[[Stardust Crusaders]]," Jotaro and his friends and grandpa are put in a dream world which takes the form of an amusement park by Mannish Boy and his Death 13 stand.

In the ''[[Jay Jay the Jet Plane]]'' cartoon series, adventures where air-breathing jet planes cannot go (underwater and in space) happen as dreams.

===TV===
The ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Waking Moments]]" uses several dream realms and false awakenings. In the ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' episode "Ordeal," Foster's abduction and rescue is explained away as a dream. The whole of season 8 of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' was retroactively explained, at the start of Season 9, as a dream had by [[Bobby Ewing]]. In the [[Xena: Warrior Princess]] episode, "Dreamworker", [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], god of dreams, abducts Gabrielle to take as his bride. But Xena follows them into his realm, the DreamScape, where she battles to stop the impending [[forced marriage]]. The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode, "[[Amy's Choice (Doctor Who)|Amy's Choice]]" also depicts multiple dream worlds, which were found out to have been induced by a parasitic seed. Dreamworlds are revisited in the ''Doctor Who'' Christmas special, "[[Last Christmas (Doctor Who)|Last Christmas]]," which depicts dreams within dreams caused by mind-leeching aliens.

===Video games===
The video games ''[[Link's Awakening]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' take place in a dream of the Wind Fish's (whom [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must wake up) and [[Mario]]'s respectively.

''[[Alundra]]'' revolves around a dreamwalker who can enter people's dreams. It takes place on an island, where a village has locals suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dreamwalking ability, the titular protagonist Alundra attempts to help the locals by entering their dreams.

In the first two games of the [[EarthBound (series)|''EarthBound'']] series, the protagonist (Ninten in ''[[EarthBound Zero]]'' and Ness in ''[[EarthBound]]'') must travel to a dream world named Magicant. However, the two Magicants are different from each other. Ninten visits his Magicant, which is light pink and has seashell spires and clouds, multiple times during the story, until it is revealed to not be his own Magicant but instead just a collection of the memories of his great-grandmother, Maria. Ness's Magicant is a surreal, spacelike land in a purple sea that Ness only gains access to once he records the eight melodies into his Sound Stone, which he then must travel to the center of in order to overcome his weaknesses, characterized by a boss battle against his 'Nightmare' (with an appearance similar to the 'Mani-Mani Statue', a mysterious object encountered in another dreamworld called Moonside), and absorb the power of the Earth into his heart.

About a half of ''[[Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams]]'' takes place in the Dream World, home to the Staff of Dreams, which was later split by Pins and Needles, where Tak has a half of the staff and Pins and Needles have the Staff of Nightmares half. By the end of the game, Tak restored the staff.

In ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie]]'', the game is split between two worlds initially known as the Real World and the Phantom World, named such because any being from the Real World is rendered unseen by the inhabitants of the Phantom World, like a phantom, and are only capable of becoming visible after drinking a special [[elixir]]. After a time, it is revealed that the Phantom World is in fact the true Real World, while the former Real World is called the Dream World, created from the dreams of the people of the Real World, in which each inhabitant has a Dream World counterpart. In addition, the main antagonist of the game, Deathtamoor, plots to try to merge both the Real World and Dream World with his own "Dark World" in an attempt for world domination.

In ''[[Dreamfall: The Longest Journey]]'' and ''[[Dreamfall Chapters]]'' the protagonist Zoë Castillo can travel to Marcuria by dreaming. There's a third world called 'Storytime' inspired by the Australian ''[[Dreamtime]]'' myths which is the place of the creation and where every story begins and ends. Also, the protagonist must stop a corporation called WATI-Corp which want to steal dreams and memories from people through their new entertainment device: the Dreamachine which allows people to make lucid dreams.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', the main group of protagonists sometimes experience the lives of three soldiers, [[Laguna Loire|Laguna]], [[Kiros Seagill|Kiros]], and [[Ward Zabac|Ward]] in what they call "the dream world" (which is actually the past) through a mysterious and gifted woman who is acquainted with both parties. The whole of [[Zanarkand]] in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and its [[Final Fantasy X HD|HD remake]] was a dream, along with the main character, [[Tidus]].

In the video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', there is a short quest which takes place in a dream world. In the video game, ''[[Fallout 3]]'', a main storyline quest involves the main character going into a virtual reality simulator, referred to as "Tranquility Lane," a dream world simulation of a 1950s suburban neighborhood.   

Other dreamworlds are the Maginaryworld from ''[[Sonic Shuffle]]'', Dream Depot from ''[[Mario Party 5]]'', and in Nightopia and Nightmare (collectively known in a place called the "Night Dimension") from ''[[Nights into Dreams...]]'' and its sequel for the [[Wii]], ''[[Nights: Journey of Dreams]]''.

In the video game ''[[Driver: San Francisco]]'', main character John Tanner suffers a car accident that leaves him in a coma. The game take places in his dream, but the character himself doesn't realize he's dreaming. Instead, he thinks he had a lucky escape and with this, thinks that he got an ability to [[Spirit possession|possess]] other people. During the game, many billboards will turn black and show "wake up" messages.

In [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']] and its following sequel, players can tuck in one of their Pokémon via a system known as Game Sync. As the tucked in Pokémon falls asleep, it will then be sent to special website, where the player can play with his/her Pokémon in an alternate world called the "Dream World".

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', the seventh installment in the game series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', the two main protagonists are sent to worlds that are in slumber and that are dreaming in order to pass the Mark of mastery exam.

The Dream World is the main focus of ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team]]'' where [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] travel through a world full of Luigi's dreams.

''[[Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil]]'' takes place in Lunatea, a dream world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6080">The '''epic laws of folk narrative''' were a series of principles identified by [[Axel Olrik]] for understanding the structure and form of [[Oral tradition|folktales]], and have a foundational significance in European [[Folkloristics|folklore studies]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Epic Laws of Folk Narrative’, in The Study of Folklore, ed. by [[Alan Dundes]] (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), pp. 129–41 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Olrik's formulation of his 'epic laws' was inspired by an idea of [[Moltke Moe]], but whereas Moe sought to derive rules for the historical development of narratives, Olrik's approach focuses on the structure of oral narrative.&lt;ref name=Dundes85&gt;[[Alan Dundes]], ''International Folkloristics: Classic Contributions by the Founders of Folklore'', Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, {{ISBN|9780847695140}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jQ6bGz4qmWsC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Axel+Olrik,+Epic+laws&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UrzjUJPWNqjmiwLjuoHIDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Moe%27s%20notion%20of%20epic%20laws&amp;f=false p. 85].&lt;/ref&gt; The principles were articulated in various publications, the first prominent one appearing in Danish in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, 'Episke love i folkedigtningen', ''Danske Studier'', 5 (1908): 69-89 (http://danskestudier.dk/materiale/1908.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Olrik presented the principles in German at an interdisciplinary congress in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ‘Epic Laws of Folk Narrative’, trans. by Jeanne P. Steager in ''The Study of Folklore'', ed. by [[Alan Dundes]] (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), pp. 129–41 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Olrik's thought on 'epic laws' was part of a wider project, developed with [[Kristian Erslev]], for understanding oral narrative (which Olrik called ''sagn'' in Danish), also including principles for the study of sources and a theory of transmission.&lt;ref name="DBL"&gt;Bengt Holbek, [http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Historie/Folkemindeforsker/Axel_Olrik "Axel Olrik"], ''[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]'', retrieved 1 January 2013 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Olrik drew on non-European material, his focus was explicitly on European folk narrative.

The Dutch language is the dominant language of the [[Netherlands]], in the [[Flanders]] and in [[Suriname]]. It's also spoken in minority areas through Europe and in many immigrant communities in all over the world. [[Afrikaans]], even if it's a daughter language of Dutch it's regarded as a separate language and will not be analyzed in this article.

'''Ibtina theory''' is a new [[theory]] in the field of "logic of understanding religion" and has direct influence on the issues of [[philosophy of religion]]. Ibtina theory is a theory for explaining the process and mechanism of "religious knowledge" formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.iict.ac.ir/uploads/3_95_98_Rashad.pdf |format=PDF |title=Prof. Dr. Ali Akba Rashadi : CV |publisher=En.iict.ac.ir |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The theory was formulated and developed for the first time by [[Ali Akbar Rashad]] in 2009 and considered, studied and criticized by philosophers of religion as a new theory.&lt;ref name="iict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rashad.iict.ac.ir/index.aspx?fkeyid=&amp;siteid=17&amp;pageid=3019|title=علي اكبر رشاد - biography|publisher=rashad.iict.ac.ir|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldjusticeproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldjusticeproject.org/world-justice-forum-iv/agenda/speaker/ali-akbar-rashad|title=Ali-Akbar Rashad &amp;#124; The World Justice Project|publisher=worldjusticeproject.org|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Akbar Rashad explained the theory in his book “Logic of Understanding Religion”, moreover, many books and articles has been written and published by Iranian thinkers affected by this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rashad, Ali-Akbar, ''Nazariye Ibtina'' ("Ibtina theory"), Sazmane Entesharate Pajuheshgahe Farhang va Anisheye Eslami (IICT), Tehran, 1389.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, an assembly held by [[National Secretary of Chairs and Forums for Theorization, Critique, Innovation and Debate]]” (affiliate center of Iranian [[Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution]]) to investigate and criticize the claims of this theory; consequently, after numerous debates and discussions it has been announced as a new theory in the field of “logic of Understanding Religion”  and “Philosophy of Religious Knowledge”.

In the same year, Ali Akbar Rahad was nominated for "eminent theoretician" (Farabi International Award) for his theorizing and then received prizes and awards from [[UNESCO]], [[ISESCO]], [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology]] (Iran) and the [[President of Iran]].&lt;ref name="iict2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rashad.iict.ac.ir/index.aspx?siteid=17&amp;siteid=17&amp;pageid=2822|title=علي اكبر رشاد - نظریه ابتناء برساختگی|publisher=rashad.iict.ac.ir|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iict3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.iict.ac.ir/index.aspx?siteid=3&amp;pageid=889&amp;newsview=621|title=News &amp;gt; The new theory of "Ibtina" by Professor Dr. Ali Akbar Rashad unveiled|publisher=en.iict.ac.ir|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims of the theory ==
[[Ali Akbar Rashad]] explained in his books and articles that Ibtina theory it to explain the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation.
He claims that religious knowledge is "the outcome of Permissible effort to explore religious statements and teachings". In another word (expression), "epistemic system derived from the usage of valid and permissible methodology for exploring religious propositions" is called religious knowledge. Philosophy of religious knowledge is also "philosophical quasi-science which is in charge of ultra-perspective and rational study on general principles for resulting religious knowledge of fundamental problems of religious knowledge".&lt;ref name="elmedini"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmedini.ir/author/rashad/|title=علی اکبر رشاد &amp;laquo; علم دینی|author=ElmeDini &amp;#124; BY Ahmmahdi|publisher=elmedini.ir|accessdate=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims that “some theories on the process and method of formation and resulting [[knowledge]] –in general sense (proper and improper) more or less have been presented by some philosophers. But, no one has presented a revised discussion of the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation.”
Although through some theories that has been presented on the religious knowledge we can acquire some view points of masters of knowledge. But they never present the discussion in the clear and self-evident manner about the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation.
From among the western thinkers, [[Hermeneuticians]] have discussed on the method of knowledge formation and the influence of some epistemic and non-epistemic factors in interpretation of the text.
But they have not explained the process of religious knowledge formation.
Also the theory of contraction and expansion which is a hermeneutical theory, concerns the justification of the problem of "religious knowledge evolution", but not the explanation of "knowledge formation".&lt;ref&gt;Rashad, Ali-Akbar, ''Manteqe Fahme Din'' ("Logic of Understanding Religion"), Sazmane Entesharate Pajuheshgahe Farhang va Anisheye Eslami (IICT), Tehran, 1389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous local products include [[peach]]es and [[rice]]. Local institutions of higher learning include  [[Korea Tourism College]] and [[Chungkang College of Cultural Industries]].

The [[Yeongdong Expressway]] and [[Jungbu Naeryuk Expressway]] pass through Icheon. In 2016, the city will connect into the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] via [[Yeoju Line]]'s Icheon Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Yeoju Line Set to Open in 2016|url = http://kojects.com/2015/07/22/yeoju-line-set-to-open-in-2016/|website = Kojects|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Icheon is home to [[Hynix]], the world's second largest memory chip maker.

The Icheon Ceramics Village features 300-plus ceramics-making firms in the area of Sugwang-ri, Sindun-myeon, Saeum-dong, and a popular visitor attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Icheon |work= Lonely Planet| url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/south-korea/gyeonggi-do/icheon 
| accessdate = 2014-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They use traditional skills and produce porcelains in some 40 traditional firewood kilns. This pottery is recognized both at home and abroad for its quality.

The Saeum-dong and Sindun-myeon areas also include a ceramics village with many ceramics stores. Potters have researched traditional methods and revived the manufacture of ceramics in the style of [[Goryeo celadon]] and [[Joseon white porcelain]] here. The village is the center of the effort to preserve these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Official pages of Icheon city&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19223">'''Internet metaphors''' provide users and researchers of the [[Internet]] a structure for understanding and communicating its various functions, uses, and experiences.  An advantage of employing [[metaphor]]s is that they permit individuals to visualize an abstract concept or phenomenon with which they have limited experience by comparing it with a concrete, well-understood concept such as physical movement through space. Metaphors to describe the Internet have been utilized since its creation and developed out of the need for the Internet to be understood by everyone when the goals and parameters of the Internet were still unclear.  Metaphors helped to overcome the problems of the invisibility and intangibility of the Internet's infrastructure and to fill linguistic gaps where no literal expressions existed.

"Highways, webs, clouds, matrices, frontiers, railroads, tidal waves, libraries, shopping malls, and village squares are all examples of metaphors that have been used in discussions of the Internet."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Over time these metaphors have become embedded in cultural communications, subconsciously shaping the [[cognitive frame]]works and perceptions of users who guide the Internet's future development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Popular metaphors may also reflect the intentions of Internet designers or the views of government officials.  Internet researchers tend to all agree that popular metaphors should be re-examined often to determine if they accurately reflect the realities of the Internet, but many disagree on which metaphors are worth keeping and which ones should be left behind.

==Overview==
[[File:Interstate 15.jpg|thumb|An earlier metaphor of the Internet was the [[information superhighway]].]]
'''Internet metaphors''' guide future action and perception of the Internet's capabilities on an individual and societal level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.metaphorik.de/sites/www.metaphorik.de/files/journal-pdf/18_2010_jamet.pdf|title = What Do Internet Metaphors Reveal about Perception of the Internet?|last = Jamet|first = Denis L.|date = 2010|journal = Metaphorik|accessdate = June 23, 2014|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet metaphors are contestable and sometimes may present political, educational, and cognitive issues.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Johnston, R. (2009). [http://firstmonday.org/article/view/2370/2158 Salvation or destruction: Metaphors of the Internet.] ''First Monday, 14''(4). Retrieved June 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tensions between producer and user, commercial and non-commercial interests, and uncertainty regarding privacy all influence the shape these metaphors take.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Common Internet metaphors such as the [[information superhighway]] are often criticized for failing to adequately reflect the reality of the Internet as they emphasize the speed of [[information transmission]] over the communal and relationship building aspects of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Markham, A. N. (2003, October). [http://pure.au.dk//portal/files/69632404/MarkhamTPW.pdf Metaphors reflecting and shaping the reality of the internet: Tool, place, way of being.] In ''Association of Internet Researchers conference, Montreal, Canada''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet researchers from a variety of disciplines are engaged in the analysis of metaphors across many domains in order to reveal their impact on user perception and determine which metaphors are best suited for conceptualizing the Internet.  Results of this research have become the focus of a popular debate on ''which'' metaphors should be applied in political, educational, and commercial settings as well as which aspects of the Internet remain unaccounted for with current metaphors, limiting the scope of users understanding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Metaphors of the Internet often reveal the intentions of designers and industry spokespeople, "For instance, those who use metaphors of consumption and shopping malls will devote resources to developing secure exchange mechanisms. Broadcasting metaphors carry with them assumptions about the nature of interactions between audiences and content providers that are more passive than those suggested by interactive game metaphors and applications.  [[Computer security]] experts deploy metaphors that invoke fear, anxiety, and apocalyptic threat" (Wyatt, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;244).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Wyatt, S. (2004). [http://virtualknowledgestudio.nl/documents/danger-metaphors.pdf Danger! Metaphors at work in economics, geophysiology, and the Internet.] ''Science, Technology &amp; Human Values'', ''29''(2), 242-261.&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent to which the Internet is understood across individuals and groups determines their ability to navigate and build [[Web sites]] and [[social networks]], attend online school, send e-mail, and a variety of other functions.  Internet metaphors provide a comprehensive picture of the Internet as a whole as well as describe and explain the various tools, purposes, and protocols that regulate the use of these communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Rudestam, K. E., &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, J. (2010). ''Handbook of online learning: innovations in higher education and corporate training'' (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the use of metaphors the concept of the Internet is abstract and its [[infrastructure]] difficult to comprehend.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dodge, M. (2008). ''Understanding Cyberspace Cartographies: A Critical Analysis of Internet Infrastructure Mapping. ''(Doctoral Dissertation). Retrieved from http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/thesis/chap_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  When it was introduced the Internet created a linguistic gap as no literal expressions existed to define its functions and properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Internet metaphors arose out of this predicament so that it could be adequately described and explained to the public.  Essentially all language now used to communicate about the Internet is of a metaphorical nature although users are often unaware of this reality because it is embedded in a cultural context that is widely accepted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are several types of metaphors that serve various purposes and can range from describing the nature of online relationships, modeling the Internet visually,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; to the specific functions of the Internet as a tool.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Each metaphor has implications for the experience and understanding of the Internet by its users and tends to emphasize some aspects of the Internet over others. Some metaphors emphasize space (Matlock, Castro, Fleming, Gann, &amp; Maglio, 2014).

== Popular culture ==
[[File:Internet.png|left|thumb|The World Wide Web was the first metaphor of the Internet, suggesting the networked connection of physical computers across the world.]]
Common recurring themes regarding the Internet appear in popular media and reflect pervasive cultural attitudes and perceptions.  Although other models and constructed metaphors of the Internet found in scholarly research and theoretical frameworks may be more accurate sources on the ''effects'' of the Internet, mass media messages in [[popular culture]] are more likely to influence how people think about and interact with the Internet.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Baym, N. K. (2010). ''Personal connections in the digital age''. Cambridge, UK: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first metaphor to describe the Internet was the [[World Wide Web]] proposed in 1989.  However, uncertainty surrounding the structure and properties of the Internet was apparent in the newspapers of the 1990s that presented a vast array of contradicting visual models to explain the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Spatial constructs were utilized to make the Internet appear as a tangible entity placed within a familiar geographical context.  A popular metaphor adopted around the same time was [[cyberspace]] coined by [[William Gibson]] in his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' to describe the world of computers and the society that gathers around them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Howard Rheingold]], an Internet enthusiast of the 1990s, propagated the metaphor of [[virtual communities]] and offered a vivid description of the Internet as "...a place for conversation or publication, like a giant coffee-house with a thousand rooms; it is also a world-wide digital version of the [[Speaker's Corner]] in London's Hyde Park, an unedited collection of letters to the editor, a floating flea market, a huge vanity publisher, and a collection of every odd-special interest group in the world" (Rheingold 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;130).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1991, [[Al Gore]]'s choice to use the information superhighway as a metaphor shifted perceptions of the Internet as a communal enterprise to an economic model that emphasized the speed of information transmission.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  While this metaphor can still be found in popular culture, it has generally been dropped in favor of other metaphors due to its limited interpretation of other aspects of the Internet such as social networks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most common types of metaphors in usage today relate to either social or functional aspects of the Internet&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ztomasze/ling440/webmetaphors.html|title = Conceptual Metaphors of the World Wide Web|date = 2002|accessdate = June 20, 2014|website = Web Metaphors|publisher = |last = Tomaszewski|first = Zach}}&lt;/ref&gt; or representations of its infrastructure through visual metaphors and models.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Social metaphors ===

Internet metaphors frequently arise from social exchanges and processes that occur online and incorporate common terms that describe offline social activities and realities.  These metaphors often point to the fundamental elements that make up [[social interaction]]s even though online interactions differ in significant ways from face-to-face communication.  Therefore, social metaphors tend to communicate more about the values of society rather than the technology of the Internet itself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Metaphors such as the electronic neighborhood and [[virtual community]] point to ways in which individuals connect to others and build relationships by joining a social network.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Global village (term)|Global village]] is another metaphor that evokes the imagery of closeness and interconnectedness that might be found in a small village, but is applied to the worldwide community of Internet users. However, the global village metaphor has sometimes been criticized for suggesting that the ''entire'' world is connected by the Internet as the continued existence of social divides prevent many individuals from accessing the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The electronic frontier metaphor conceptualizes the Internet as a vast unexplored territory, a source of new resources, and a place to forge new social and business connections.  Similar to the American ideology of the [[Western Frontier]], the electronic frontier invokes the image of a better future to come through new opportunities afforded by the Internet.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] is a non-profit digital rights group that adopted the use of this metaphor to denote their dedication to the protection of personal freedoms and fair use within the digital landscape.  Social metaphors and their pervasive influence indicate the increasing importance placed on social interaction on the Internet.

=== Functional metaphors ===
Functional metaphors of the Internet shape our understanding of the medium itself and give us clues as to how we should actually use the Internet and interpret its infrastructure for design and policy making.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  These exist at the level of the Internet as a whole, at the level of a website, and the level of individual pages.  The majority of these types of metaphors are based on the concept of various spaces and physical places, therefore, most are considered spatial metaphors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, this aspect should not be considered the only defining feature of a functional metaphor as social metaphors are often spatial in nature.

Cyberspace is the most widely used spatial metaphor of the Internet and the implications of its use can be seen in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' definition, which denotes cyberspace as a space within whose boundaries digital communications take place.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bittarello, M. B. (2010). [http://www.obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/viewArticle/237 Spatial Metaphors describing the Internet and religious Websites: sacred Space and sacred Place.] ''Observatorio (OBS*)'', ''3''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  The implications of this spatial metaphor in discourse on law can be seen in instances where the application of traditional laws governing real property are applied to Internet spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lemley, M. A. (2003). [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3481337?uid=3739600&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104381943743 Place and cyberspace]. ''California Law Review'', 521–542.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, arguments against this type of ruling have claimed that the Internet is a borderless space, which should not be subject to the laws applied to places.  Others have argued that the Internet is in fact, a real space not sealed from the real world and can be zoned, trespassed upon, or divided up into holdings like real property.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, M. (2013). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geoj.12009/abstract "Geography/Internet: Ethereal Alternate Dimensions of Cyberspace or Grounded Augmented Realities?"] ''The Geographical Journal'', ''179'', 177-182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blavin, J. H., &amp; Cohen, L. G. (2002). [http://farrall.org/research/cyberspace/cohen_blavin2002_cyberspace_metaphor_law.pdf Gore, Gibson, and Goldsmith: "The Evolution of Internet Metaphors in Law and Commentary"] ''Harv. JL &amp; Tech.'', ''16'', 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Surfing in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|''Surfing'' the 'Net' is a metaphor that uses the spatial domain of the ocean to suggest that navigating the Internet is similar to the flow of surfing in the sea of information.]]
Other functional metaphors are based on travel within space such as ''surfing'' the Net and suggest the Internet is similar to an ocean. [[Websites|Web''sites'']] indicate components of a space, which are static and fixed, whereas, [[webpages|web''pages'']] suggest pages of a book. Similarly, focal points of the Internet structure are called [[node (networking)|nodes]].  Home pages, chat rooms, windows, and the idea that you can ''jump'' from one page to the next also invoke spatial imagery that guide the functions that users perform on the Internet.  Other metaphors refer to the Internet as another dimension beyond typical spaces such as [[Web portal|portals]] and [[Gateway (web page)|gateways]] which refer to access and communication functions.  [[Firewalls and Internet Security|Firewalls]] invoke the image of physically blocking the incoming of information such as viruses and pop-up ads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Designers of computer systems often use spatial metaphors as a way of controlling the complexity of interfaces.  Designers create actions, procedures, and concepts of systems based on similar actions, procedures, and concepts of other domains such as physical spaces so that they will be familiar to users.  In designing [[hypertext]], a system that links topics on a screen to related information, navigational metaphors such as landmarks, routes, and way-finding have often been implemented for users ease of understanding how hypertext functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Y. C., &amp; Schwen, T. M. (2003). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581902001258 The effects of structural cues from multiple metaphors on computer users’ information search performance.] ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', ''58''(1), 39-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual metaphors ===
Visual metaphors are popular in conceptualizing the Internet and are often deployed in commercial promotions through visual media and imagery. The most common visual metaphor is a network of wires with [[node (networking)|nodes]] and route lines plotted on a geographically based map.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  However, maps of Internet infrastructure produced for network marketing are rarely based on actual pathways of wires and cable on the ground, but are instead based on [[circuit diagram]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s similar to those seen on subway map&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Dodge, M., &amp; Kitchin, R. (2001). ''[http://www.kitchin.org/atlas/contents.html Atlas of cyberspace]'' (Vol. 158). Reading: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[globe]], or the [[Earth]] viewed from space, with network arcs of [[data flow]] wrapped around it, is another dominant metaphor for the Internet in Western contexts&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and is connected with the metaphor of the [[Global village (term)|Global Village]].  
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Internet map plain 1024.png|left|thumb|An abstract visual 'map' of the Internet created using algorithms of raw data from networks that serves as a visual metaphor of the complexity of the Internet.]] --&gt;
Many [[abstraction|abstract]] visual metaphors based on [[organic structures]] and patterns are found in literature on the Internet's infrastructure.  Often, these metaphors are used as a visual [[shorthand]] in explanations as they allow one to refer to the Internet as a definite object without having to explain the intricate details of its functioning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Clouds are the most common of abstract metaphors employed for this purpose in [[cloud computing]] and have been used since the creation of the Internet.&lt;ref name="reynolds19841204"&gt;{{cite mailing list | url=http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftp/e/mail.84b | title=Kermit vs 4705? | publisher=Kermit Project, Columbia University | mailinglist=Info-Kermit Digest | date=1984-12-04 | accessdate=24 February 2016 | author=Reynolds, Steve | quote=After some attempts I decided to ask the 'cloud' about this.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other abstract metaphors of the Internet draw on the [[fractal]] branching of trees and leaves, and the [[latticework|lattice]]s of coral and webs, while others are based on the aesthetics of [[astronomy]] such as gas [[nebulas]], and [[star clusters]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Technical methods such as algorithms are often used to create huge, complex graphs or maps of raw data from networks and the topology of connections. The typical result of this process are visual representations of the Internet that are elaborate and visually striking, resembling organic structures.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These artistic, abstract representations of the Internet have been featured in art galleries, sold as wall posters, used on book covers, and have been claimed to be a picture of the ''whole'' Internet by many fans. However, there are no instructions on how these images may be interpreted. The main function of these representations has sometimes been explained as a metaphor for the complexity of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  '''  '''

'''Joseph Mede'''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Meade, Joseph Mead.&lt;/ref&gt; (1586 in [[Berden, Essex|Berden]] – 1639) was an English scholar with a wide range of interests. He was educated at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], where he became a Fellow from 1613.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MD603J|name=Meade, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now remembered as a biblical scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.virginia.edu/small/exhibits/brimstone/england.html Book of Revelation in England] &lt;!-- dead link: [http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/gatt/bible/catalog.asp?CN=3] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a naturalist and Egyptologist. He was a Hebraist, and became Lecturer of Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Dictionary of National Biography'', under Joseph Mead.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His ''Clavis Apocalyptica''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/13/timelines.php Illustration of a timeline from the work]&lt;/ref&gt; (1627 in Latin, English translation 1643,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/mede/key.html online text]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Key of the Revelation Searched and Demonstrated''&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], ''Religion, the Reformation &amp; Social Change'' (1956) says by the MP Richard More (p. 248); also CDNB, giving constituency Bishop's Castle, death in 1643.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a widely influential work on the interpretation of the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''. It projected the end of the world by 1716: possibly in 1654.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Edward Christopher Hill|Christopher Hill]], ''Milton and the English Revolution'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also posited that the [[Conversion of the Jews|Jews would be miraculously converted to Christianity]] before the second coming.&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1tQUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 ''Millennial Expectations and Jewish Liberties: A Study of the Efforts to Convert the Jews in Britain, Up to the Mid Nineteenth Century'']. Brill Archive. pps. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Hill considers that Mede deliberately refrained from publication.&lt;ref&gt;''A Nation of Change and Novelty'' (1990), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretation of the ''[[Book of Daniel]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://reformedlayman.com/Medes%2070%20weeks/Daniels%2070%20Weeks%20-web.htm online text]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Apostasy of Latter Times''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformedlayman.com/MedesApostasy/MedesApostasyCover.htm online text]&lt;/ref&gt; were published posthumously. On [[demon]]s, he explained at least some [[mental illness]] as demonic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971), p. 585; Mede, ''S. Iohn 10.20. He hath a Devill, and is mad'', published posthumously; [http://bibleapologetics.wordpress.com/2007/05/03/article-christianity-and-the-witch-hunt-era-810/]&lt;/ref&gt; His collected ''Works'' were published in 1665, edited by [[John Worthington (academic)|John Worthington]].

==Influence==
Those following Mede in part as a chronologist and interpreter included [[Thomas Goodwin]], [[Pierre Jurieu]], [[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref&gt;''Newton developed a method for the interpretation of prophecy based on the writings of the early seventeenth-century Cambridge divine, Joseph Mede. Mede's views were widely accepted and the scheme that Newton propounded to bring consistency to the unravelling of prophetic symbolism was not in itself controversial.'' [http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Exhibitions/Footprints_of_the_Lion/duty.pdf (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606234713/http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/exhibitions/Footprints_of_the_Lion/duty.pdf |date=6 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=15&lt;/ref&gt; and Aaron Kinne (1745–1824). As a critical scholar of the Bible, he started the discussion of the possible multiple authorship of the ''[[Book of Zechariah]]'', subsequently taken up by [[Richard Kidder]] (1633–1703) and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Zacharias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Popkin]]&lt;ref&gt;Pimlico/Columbia, ''History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; attributes Mede's interpretation to countering [[scepticism]], which gave it power to convince others, including the [[Hartlib circle]]. John Coffey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emanuel.ro/perichoresis/Perichoresis4.2(2006).pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024531/http://www.emanuel.ro/perichoresis/Perichoresis4.2%282006%29.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The ecumenist Scotsman [[John Dury]], the German scientist [[Samuel Hartlib]], and the Czech educationalist [[Comenius]] had each been profoundly influenced by the millenarianism of [[Alsted]] and Mede, and seem to have seriously entertained the idea that London was the centre from which human knowledge and divine rule would spread.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coffey also says, however, that [[millenarianism]] was rare in the 1630s, coming in only later as an important force. [[William Twisse]], of the [[Westminster Assembly]], added a preface to the 1643 ''Key to the Revelation'', a testimonial to its convincing power.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hill (1993), ''The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution'', p.304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Mede's pupils at Christ's was [[Henry More]]. [[John Milton]] studied at Christ's in Mede's time, and is considered to have been influenced by his ideas; but scholars have not found evidence that he was a pupil.&lt;ref&gt;''Mede, Milton and More: Christ's College Millenarians'' by Sarah Hutton, in Milton and the Ends of Time, edited by Juliet Cummins, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81665-6}}, {{ISBN|0-521-81665-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those following Mede's views in ''Doctrine of Demons'' include [[Arthur Ashley Sykes]] and Dr. [[Richard Mead]].

'''Kilwa Kisiwani''' is a community on an [[Indian Ocean]] [[island]] off the southern coast of present-day [[Tanzania]] in eastern Africa. Historically, it was the center of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]], a medieval sultanate whose authority at its height in the 13th-15th centuries CE stretched the entire length of the [[Swahili Coast]]. Kilwa Kisiwani has been designated by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the nearby stonetown [[Songo Mnara]].

== History and archaeology ==
Kilwa Kisiwani is an archaeological [[city-state]] site located along the Swahili Coast on the Kilwa [[archipelago]]. It was occupied from at least the 8th century CE and became one of the most powerful settlements along the coast. The seasonal wind reversals would affect trade circulations.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elkiss|first1=Terry A.|title=Kilwa Kisiwani: The Rise of an East African City-State|journal=African Studies Review|date=1973|volume=16|issue=1|pages=119–130|doi=10.2307/523737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade connections with the Arabian Peninsula as well as India and China influenced the growth and development of Kilwa, and, though there are Islamic words and customs that have been adapted to the culture, the origins are African.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008 /&gt; Many of the Swahili settlements showed complex layouts that reflected social relations between groups, however at Kilwa, there are many questions still left unanswered about the town layout. The cemeteries were located on the edge of the town, which was common for the region, and large, open spaces were likely used for social gatherings.&lt;ref name=FWJ2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleisher|first1=Jeffery|last2=Wynne-Jones|first2=Stephanie|title=Finding Meaning in Ancient Swahili Spatial Practices|journal=Afr Archaeol Rev|date=2012|volume=29|pages=171–207|doi=10.1007/s10437-012-9121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important city for trade, around the 13th century there were increased fortifications and a greater flow of goods. For these to take place, there would need to be a form of political administration overseeing the city, controlling the movement of goods. Much of the trade networks were with the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Kilwa Kisiwani reached its highest point in wealth and commerce between 13th and 15th centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Pollard2008"/&gt;

Evidence of growth in wealth can be seen with the appearance of stone buildings around the 13th century CE, before which all of the buildings were [[wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]]. The socio-economic status of the individuals residing there could be clearly seen in the type of structure they were living in. Among Kilwa's exports were spices, tortoiseshell, coconut oil, ivory, and aromatic gums, as well as gold.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973 /&gt; At around this time, Kilwa had seized control over the trade of gold at [[Sofala]]. The wealthy also possessed more commercial goods than the individuals who were of the lower class did. Luxury cloths and foreign ceramics were among a few of the items they would have owned, though some items, such as luxury clothes, do not preserve in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Edward John|title=THe maritime landscape of Kilwa Kisiwani and its region, Tanzania, 11th to 15th century CE|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=2008|volume=27|pages=265–280|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2008.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For approximately 500 years, Kilwa was minting coins. This lasted from about A.D 1100-1600 and the coins have been found across the region, including [[Great Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=CHAMI98&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chami|first1=Felix A.|title=A Review of Swahili Archaeology|journal=African Archaeological Review|date=1998|volume=15|issue=3|pages=199–218|doi=10.1023/a:1021612012892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine resources were abundant and utilized for food. Food sources would also come from the surrounding land. But because of the huge impact the sea, with all of the resources and trade opportunities, had on Kilwa, the archaeological investigation of the harbors and ports is considered to be quite important. The soil at Kilwa that was found over the limestone was of poor quality, so the land food sources came from the areas of higher ground. However, the soil in the Kilwa region would have been suitable for growing cotton, which could be used in sail manufacturer. 12th century [[spindle whorl]]s have been found, indicating that cotton was used and processed in this area.&lt;ref name="Pollard2008"/&gt;

===Ceramics===
At first, most of the focus was placed on the archaeology of Kilwa's ports and harbors, however, more and more emphasis is being placed on Kilwa's hinterlands. 
Ceramic artifacts are plentiful at the site and can be divided into two groups: regional and coastal. All of the ceramics with regional distribution were locally produced, but the area of distribution is limited. These unglazed ceramics were referred to as Kitchen Wares, though their uses were not necessarily just as cooking vessels.  All of the varieties of locally produced pottery found in the region were also uncovered at the site of Kilwa itself.&lt;ref name=WJ2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wynne-Jones|first1=Stephanie|title=Creating urban communities at Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania, CE 800-1300|journal=Antiquity|date=2007|volume=81|pages=368–380|doi=10.1017/s0003598x00095247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Kitchen Wares could be seen throughout the region, there were ceramics that were mostly seen within Kilwa itself. These included modeled forms and red-burnished wares. The distribution pattern of the red-burnished wares was coastal. Other ceramic types that were seemingly restricted to town were the imported ceramic vessels from the Arabian peninsula and China. Imported ceramic materials are not found in rural areas. They were used as a sign of social status by the elite. They were kept in wall niches made just for the purpose of displaying them. These imported ceramics played important symbolic roles along the Swahili Coast. The symbolism attached to the imported ceramics was so strong that it carried on to modern Swahili culture. The lack of imported goods in the hinterlands indicates that, while Kilwa was undergoing a process of urbanization, the local communities did not undergo a dramatic transformation.&lt;ref name=WJ2005 /&gt;

===Preservation===
In 2004, Kilwa Kisiwani was inscribed on UNESCO's [[List of World Heritage in Danger]]. There is a serious rapid deterioration of the archaeological and monumental heritage of these two islands due to various agents like erosion and vegetation. The eastern section of the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, for example, is progressively disappearing. The damage to the soil caused by rainwater wash is accentuating the risks of the collapse of the remaining structures on the edge of the cliff. The vegetation that proliferates on the cliff has limited the progression of the rain-wash effect but causes the break-up of the masonry structures. The [[World Monuments Fund]] included Kilwa on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites, and since 2008 has been supporting conservation work on various buildings.

==Notable features==

===Great Mosque===
The [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]] is a [[Jama Masjid|congregational]] [[mosque]] on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in [[Tanzania]]. It was likely founded in the tenth century, but the two major stages of construction date to the eleventh or twelfth and thirteenth century, respectively. It is one of the earliest surviving mosques on the Swahili Coast.

The smaller northern prayer hall dates to the first phase of construction. It contained a total of 16 bays supported by nine pillars, which were originally carved from [[coral]] but later replaced by timber. The structure was entirely roofed, and was perhaps one of the first mosques in the area to have been built without a courtyard.

In the early fourteenth century, [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]], who also built the nearby [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]], added a southern extension which included a great dome. This dome was described by [[Ibn Battuta]] after he visited Kilwa in 1331.

===Palace of Husuni Kubwa===
[[File:Kilwa Kisiwani Fort.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The fort on the banks of Kilwa Kisiwani.]]
Husuni Kubwa (the "Great Fort"), situated outside the town, was an early 14th-century sultan's palace and emporium.  Other defining features include [[causeway]]s and platforms at the entrance of the Harbour made from blocks of reef and coral nearly a meter high. These act as breakwaters, allowing mangroves to grow which is one of the ways the breakwater can be spotted from a distance. Some parts of the causeway are made from the bedrock, but usually the bedrock was used as a base. Coral stone was used to build up the causeways with sand and lime being used to cement the cobbles together. Some of the stones were left loose.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008intertidal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Edward|title=Inter-Tidal Causeways and Platforms of the 13th- to 16th-Century City-States of Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania|journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=2008|volume=1|issue=37|pages=98–114|doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.2007.00167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palace of Husuni Kubwa is a ruined structure on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in [[Tanzania]]. The majority of the palace was erected in the 14th century by [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]], who also built an extension to the nearby [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]], although portions may date back to the 13th century. The palace was inhabited only for a brief period of time, and abandoned before its completion.

The structure was built out of [[coral]] stone on a high bluff overlooking the [[Indian Ocean]]. It consists of three major elements: a south court, used primarily for commerce; a residential complex including over one hundred individual rooms; and a wide stairway leading down a mosque that was situated on the beach. Other notable features include pavilion, which likely served as a reception hall, and an octagonal swimming pool. All of Husuni Kubwa spans across approximately two acres. The coral rag was set in limestone mortar and cut stone was used for decorative pieces, door jams, and vaults. The rooms were about 3 meters tall. The roof was made from cut limestone blocks laid across cut timbers and the floors were white plaster. The main entrance to Husuni Kubwa is from the shore. Most of the imported glazed pottery recovered at the site was Chinese celadon, though there were a few Ying Ch'ing stoneware sherds present. A Yuan dynasty flask dated to about C.E. 1300. Neither the Kilwa Chronicle nor any Portuguese accounts describe a building comparable to Husuni Kubwa.&lt;ref name=Chittick63&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chittick|first1=Neville|title=Kilwa and the Arab Settlement of the East African Coast|journal=The Journal of African History|date=1963|volume=4|issue=2|pages=179–190|doi=10.1017/s0021853700004011|jstor=179533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Husuni Ndogo===
Husuni Ndogo ("Little Fort") is built from coral rubble and limestone mortar. The rectangular enclosure wall surrounds the complex and at each corner stands a tower. The foundations extend two meters below ground level. It appears to have been built as a fort, but the exact purposes and uses are somewhat unknown. There is some evidence that it, for at least a time, was used as a mosque. Architecturally, it appears to be different from other buildings along the coast, resembling buildings constructed under the Caliphs of the Umayyad at around C.E. 661-750. However, whether or not the structure is related or even dates to the Arabic buildings remains uncertain, though it seems unlikely.&lt;ref name=Chittick63 /&gt;

[[File:City of Kilwa, 1572.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1572 depiction of the city of Kilwa from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''Civitates orbis terrarum''.]]
A document written around CE 1200 called ''al-Maqama al Kilwiyya'', discovered in [[Oman]], gives details of a mission to reconvert Kilwa to [[Ibadism]], as it had recently been affected by the [[Ghurabiyya Shia]] doctrine from southern Iraq.

According to local oral tradition, in the 11th century the island of Kilwa Kisiwani was sold to Ali bin Hasan, son of the "King" of [[Shiraz]], in Persia. Another tradition relates that his mother was [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] (Habesha). Ali bin Al-Hasan is credited with founding the island city and with marrying the daughter of the local king. Though he was credited with the founding, he had arrived at an already inhabited area. He did, however, come to power and is credited with fortifying the city and increasing trade.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973 /&gt; Tradition also relates that it was the child of this union who founded the Kilwa Sultanate. Archaeological and [[documentary research]] has revealed that over the next few centuries, Kilwa grew to be a substantial city and the leading commercial [[entrepôt]] on the southern half of the [[Swahili Coast]] (roughly from the present Tanzanian-Kenya border southward to the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] River), trading extensively with states of the Southeast African hinterland as far as Zimbabwe. Trade was mainly in gold, iron, ivory and other animal products of the interior for beads, textiles, jewelry, porcelain and spices from Asia.

By the 12th century, under the rule of the Abu'-Mawahib dynasty, Kilwa had become the most powerful city on the Swahili Coast. At the zenith of its power in the 15th century, the Kilwa Sultanate claimed authority over the city-states of [[Malindi]], Mvita (Mombasa), [[Pemba Island]], [[Zanzibar]], [[Mafia Island]], [[Grande Comore|Comoro]], [[Sofala]] and the trading posts across the channel on [[Madagascar]].

[[Ibn Battuta]] recorded his visit to the city around 1331, and commented favorably on the generosity, humility, and religion of its ruler, [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]]. Ibn Battuta also describes how the sultan would go into the interior and raid the people taking slaves and other forms of wealth. He was also particularly impressed by the planning of the city and believed that it was the reason for Kilwa's success along the coast.&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Ross E.|title=The adventures of Ibn Battuta, a Muslim traveler of the fourteenth century|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520243854|edition=Rev. ed. with a new pref.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this period date the construction of the [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]] and a significant extension to the [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]], which was made of [[coral]] stones—the largest mosque of its kind. Kilwa was an important and also wealthy city for the trade of gold, because of this some of the people who lived in Kilwa had a higher standard of living, but many others were also poor. The wealthy enjoyed indoor plumbing in their stone homes and the poor lived in mud huts with thatched roofs.&lt;ref&gt;The Travels of Ibn Battuta&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 16th century, [[Vasco da Gama]] extorted tribute from the wealthy Islamic state. In 1505 another Portuguese force commanded by D. [[Francisco de Almeida]] took control of the island after besieging it. It remained in Portuguese hands until 1512, when an Arab mercenary captured Kilwa after the Portuguese abandoned their outpost. The city regained some of its earlier prosperity, but in 1784 was conquered by the [[Oman]]i rulers of [[Zanzibar]]. After the Omani conquest, the [[France|French]] built and manned a fort at the northern tip of the island, but the city itself was abandoned in the 1840s. It was later part of the colony of [[German East Africa]] from 1886 to 1918.

==Tourism==
The town is located within the [[Kilwa District]] of the [[Lindi Region]].

It is possible to visit the island of Kilwa Kisiwani and most people base themselves in Kilwa Masoko. The town Kilwa Masoko can be reached by bus from Dar es Salaam (leaving Mbagala bus stop), and is served by [[Coastal Aviation]]. There are numerous basic guesthouses and a handful of tourist hotels, mostly spread along Jimbiza beach and the beautiful and highly regarded Masoko Pwani.

A permit is needed to visit the ruins of Kisiwani itself, and can be easily obtained from the local government building on the main road in Kilwa Masoko. Once the permit has been obtained it is easy to arrange [[dhow]] transport over the narrow channel to Kisiwani.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">'''King Ahaz's seal''' is a [[Bulla (seal)|bulla]] (impressed piece of clay) originating from the 8th century BCE. The place of discovery of this seal is unknown, and it is currently part of [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]]'s private collection. The seal contains an [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|ancient Hebrew]] inscription mentioning the name of [[Ahaz]] of Judah, as well as the name of his father, [[Jotham of Judah|Yehotam]] (Jotham), identifying Ahaz as the "king of Judah". The bulla contains a fingerprint which may belong to Ahaz himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeological-center.com/en/monographs/m1&lt;/ref&gt;

Another extra-biblical source regarding the historicity of Ahaz comes from [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], mentioning tributes he received in gold and silver from Ahaz, and from the bulla known as [[Ushna seal]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger, Stephen L. Bible and Spade, Oxford University Press, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
[[Provenance|Unprovenanced]] artifacts that originate in the antiquities market are subject to authentication disputes. The authenticity of ancient bullae has been the topic of scholarly discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.bible-translation.net/upload/2891/Real_or_Fake_A_Special_Report.pdf Jerusalem Forgery Conference (Special report, Biblical Archaeology Society)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Deutsch, an archeologist who is also the antique dealer who sold the Ahaz bulla, most scholars believe the bullae to be authentic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.bible-translation.net/upload/2891/Real_or_Fake_A_Special_Report.pdf Hershel Shanks, Jerusalem Forgery Conference Report, p. 27 "Is it reasonable to ask whether they &amp;#91;bullae&amp;#93; could be fakes? The universal answer of all experts in the field is no. It is simply impossible to fake them."]&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Andrew Vaughn, agree that it would be difficult to fake a bulla, but do not rule out such a possibility, and in fact conclude that some bullae are forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.bible-translation.net/upload/2891/Real_or_Fake_A_Special_Report.pdf Hershel Shanks, Jerusalem Forgery Conference Report, p. 27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orte und Landschaften der Bibel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3277">'''Kita "Petre" Chkhenkeli''' ({{lang-ka|კიტა "პეტრე" ჩხენკელი}}; '''Tschenkéli''' in western literature) (8 November 1895 – 22 October 1963) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] linguist and lexicographer based in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. He is best known for his ''Georgisch-Deutsches Wörterbuch'', which is "widely regarded as the most comprehensive Georgian dictionary in any western language."&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, Mary (ed., 2007), ''Byzantines and Crusaders in Non-Greek Sources, 1025-1204'', p. 204. British Academy, {{ISBN|9780197263785}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tschenkéli was born in [[Kutaisi]], the second largest city of Georgia, then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was a younger brother of the prominent [[Social Democratic Labour Party of Georgia|Social-Democratic]] politician [[Akaki Chkhenkeli]]. He studied law and world literature at the [[University of Moscow]] from 1913 to 1917. Returning to Georgia after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Tschenkéli obtained, in 1920, a [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|state]] bursary to continue his education in Germany, where he attended the universities of [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]] and [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]]. The fall of the Georgian republic to the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Bolshevik invasion]] in 1921 precluded his return to the homeland. He lectured at the University of Hamburg and, after the end of [[World War II]], moved to [[Zürich]], where he taught the Georgian and Russian languages. In 1961, he obtained the [[honorary degree]] of doctorate from the [[University of Zürich]]. Tschenkéli died in Zurich of [[pneumonia]]. His grave has been lost.&lt;ref name="diaspora"&gt;[http://www.diaspora.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=166&amp;info_id=2533 ჩხენკელი კიტა (პეტრე) ივანეს ძე (Chkhenkeli, Kita)]. Georgian Diaspora. The Office of the State Minister for Diaspora Issues. Accessed January 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Tschenkéli's principal contribution to the [[Kartvelian studies|Georgian studies]] consists of a grammar (1958), chrestomathy (1958), and a voluminous Georgian-German dictionary, which was published posthumously from 1965 to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Cherchi, Marcello (1997), ''Modern Georgian Morphosyntax'', p. 52. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|3447039469}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Ruth Neukomm, he also contributed to and edited the German translations of the medieval Georgian epics ''[[Visramiani]]'' (''Wisramiani: oder die Geschichte der Liebe von Wis und Ramin'', 1957) and ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'' (''Der Mann im Pantherfell'', 1974).&lt;ref name="diaspora"/&gt;

[[Krakatoa]], in the [[Sunda Strait]] in [[Indonesia]], has attracted a significant literature and media response to the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|1883 eruption]].

==Nonfiction==

===Books===
* Alfred, E. &amp; Seward, A.C., ''The New Flora of the Volcanic Island of Krakatau'', (reissued by [[Cambridge University Press]] 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-108-00433-6}})
* [[Rogier Verbeek]]'s initial report on the eruption ran in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in May 1884. His book ''Krakatau'' was printed in 1885 in Dutch; a French translation (called ''Krakatau Atlas'') is in two volumes.
* [[C. A. Backer]]; ''The Problem of Krakatao as Seen By a Botanist'' (1929). Examines the "Krakatau problem"- whether or not all life was destroyed by the 1883 eruption.
* [[Rupert Furneaux]]; ''Krakatoa'' (1964). This came out just a few years before the theory of [[plate tectonics]] was adopted.
* [[Tom Simkin]] &amp; [[Richard S. Fiske]], [[Editing|editors]], ''[[Krakatau 1883: The Volcanic Eruption and Its Effects]]'' was written for the centenary of the event and provides source material that had previously been unavailable in English.
* [[Ian Thornton]]; ''Krakatau: The Destruction and Reassembly of an Island Ecosystem'' (1996)
* [[David Keys (author)|David Keys]]; ''Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of the Modern World'' (1999).
* [[Simon Winchester]]; ''[[Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded|Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, 27 August 1883]]'' explores the eruption of Krakatoa and the history of the region, the early [[spice]] trade, the growth of colonial governments, explains the geology of volcanos and describes in detail the series of eruptions and [[tsunami]]s and their effects around the globe.
* Mohammad Saleh; ''[[Syair Lampung Karam]]'' (Singapore, 1883); the only known account written by a local in the [[Malay language]], a poem.

===Film===
{{see also|Krakatoa, East of Java}}
* ''[[Krakatoa (film)|Krakatoa]]'', a short (26 min) 1933 teaching film about the volcano that won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Short Subject, Novelty for its producer [[Joe Rock]]. This movie was notable for overwhelming the [[sound reinforcement system|sound system]]s of the [[movie theater|cinemas]] of the time. In [[Australia]], the distributors insisted on a power output of 10 watts RMS as a minimum for cinemas wishing to show the movie. This was then considered a large system, and forced many cinemas to upgrade. A revised version was made in 1966 for the [[Library of Congress]].
There are several recent videos of Krakatoa uploaded onto [[YouTube]] showing the inside of its crater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krakatau|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb8UJTbpm58|date=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it erupting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anak Krakatoa from safer distance.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUF3aD-9av4|date=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
* "Ultimate Blast: Eruption at Krakatau" has been aired on [[Discovery Channel]], as part of the ''[[Moments in Time]]'' series.
* The 1883 eruption is reconstructed in the [[BBC Television]] [[docudrama]] ''[[Krakatoa: The Last Days]]'', first broadcast in May 2006. It was broadcast in the U.S. as ''Krakatoa: Volcano of Destruction'' on the [[Discovery Channel]].
* The 2007 episode "Krakatoa's Revenge" of [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s disaster-themed documentary series ''[[Mega Disasters]]'' features the volcano's active history and imminent future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=❤️ Mega Disasters - Krakatau's Revenge ❤️|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_sSkqygcuM|accessdate=8 November 2016|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2009 episode "Krakatoa" of History's geology-based documentary series ''[[How the Earth Was Made]]'' also chronicles the geologic history of Krakatoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch The Krakatoa Volcano Clip - How the Earth Was Made {{!}} HISTORY|url=http://www.history.com/shows/how-the-earth-was-made/videos/the-krakatoa-volcano#the-krakatoa-volcano|website=history.com|publisher=Video Gallery at History.com|ref=''How the Earth Was Made''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[The Truth (Seinfeld)|a 1991 episode]] of the TV show [[Seinfeld]], [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] (in 1985) is tricked by [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] into donating money to the Krakatoa relief fund, even though it erupted 102 years earlier.

'''Law''' is a [[system]] of rules that are created and [[law enforcement|enforced through social or governmental institutions]] to regulate [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined both as  "the [[soft science|Science]] of Justice" and "the [[the arts|Art]] of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/basharubin/2015/01/13/is-law-an-art-or-a-science-a-bit-of-both/ | title=Is Law an Art or a Science?: A Bit of Both}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oR0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=Roman+ars+boni+et+aequi | title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law| isbn=9780871694324| last1=Berger| first1=Adolf| year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law is a system that regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective [[legislature]] or by a single legislator, resulting in [[statute]]s, by the executive through [[decree]]s and [[regulation]]s, or established by judges through [[precedent]], normally in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding [[contract]]s, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]], written or tacit, and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]] and [[society]] in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

A general distinction can be made between (a) [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, in which a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and (b) [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[precedent]] is accepted as [[Legally binding|binding]] law. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Islamic [[Sharia law]] is the world's most widely used religious law, and is used as the primary legal system in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law|title=What is sharia law?|work=brightknowledge.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019060625/http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law/|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. [[Criminal law]] deals with conduct that is considered harmful to [[social order]] and in which the [[guilt (law)|guilty]] party may be imprisoned or fined. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of [[lawsuits]] (disputes) between individuals or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/criminal_civil_law-en.asp?l=4|title=Criminal and Civil Law|website=www.cscja-acjcs.ca|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into [[legal history]], [[philosophy]], [[economic analysis of law|economic analysis]] and [[sociology of law|sociology]]. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]].

== Definition ==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}

=== Mainstream definitions ===
Numerous definitions of ''law'' have been put forward over the centuries. The ''Third New International Dictionary'' from Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; defines law as: "Law is a binding custom or practice of a community; a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a [[sanction (law)|sanction]] (as an edict, decree, rescript, order, ordinance, statute, resolution, rule, judicial decision, or usage) made, recognized, or enforced by the controlling authority."

The ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' published by Scribner's in 1973 defined the concept of law accordingly as: "A legal system is the most explicit, institutionalized, and complex mode of regulating human conduct. At the same time, it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior, for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Charles Scribner's Sons, Editor Philip P. Weiner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whether it is possible or desirable to define law ===
There have been several attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition of law". In 1972, one source indicated that no such definition could be produced.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39"&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Coubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. ''Textbook on Jurisprudence''. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, "[[early customary law]]" and "[[municipal law]]" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word "Law". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), ''Philosophy, Politics and Society'' (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. ''The Symbols of Government''. 1935. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g. "let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]].

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice.]]

The history of law links closely to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements ("if … then ..."). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British [[Assyriologists]], and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, Italian, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Solonian Constitution|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name="St107"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=''"But what, after all, is a law? […] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. […] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."''|source=Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''[[The Social Contract]]'', II, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''The Social Contract'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rousseau/jean_jacques/r864s/book2.html#section16 Book II: Chapter 6 (Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosophy of law is commonly known as (general) jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], notably his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century.]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410.&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive law and non-positive law discussions ===
{{main|Positive law}}
One definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL VERIFIED, wherever possible--&gt;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a "system of rules";&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184&lt;/ref&gt; Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction";&lt;ref name="jap" /&gt; Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve [[justice]] in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'';&lt;ref name="Dworkin, [[Law's Empire]], 410"&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410&lt;/ref&gt; and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests.&lt;ref name="jra" /&gt; Holmes said "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Oliver Wendell. "The Path of Law" (1897) 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457 at 461.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'' Aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, St Thomas.

=== Economic analysis ===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges" /&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], dispute processing and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law.]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary" /&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological background ==
Law is complex from a methodological viewpoint. Its peculiar features make its unique against the background of other sciences and disciplines.

First, it is not only of a normative but also of a prescriptive nature. Law says how people ought to behave or not, what they may or may not require from others, and what they have to or have not to do if someone ask for that. But normative statements in law are deprived of a descriptive  or causal character as opposed to normative statements in empirical science (as a law of gravity) or even social science (as a law of demand and supply in economics).

Second, there is no possibility of empirical verification of the contents of law.  Whether the law should or should not comprise precepts of such-and-such import remains far beyond empirical proof. It is a matter of choice.

Third, law is dependent on the shape of the physical world and the limitations inherent in it. It cannot mandate behaviours which are unattainable or force people to do things which are beyond their capabilities.

Fourth, law is fully contingent on humans and their minds. Without humans and their mental operations it would be very difficult to speak about the law, its enforcement and application.

Fifth, law agents, such as judges, advocates and officials, are unspecialized in the sense that they lack some complex theories as to good and evil, empirical and social science or justice (proper distribution of goods/privileges and burdens in a society).

Sixth, the role of authority is prominent in law, while at the same time in law there are not means which enable us to check the correctness of authoritative statements (be they comprised in judicial opinions or scholarly literature).

Seventh, the procedure in which law is authoritatively applied is very specific. It is rigorous, precise, complex, casuistic and often very formal. The outcome of such procedure is obligatory in the sense that a judge cannot free himself or herself from passing his/her decision. There are also very limited means for re-opening such procedure when its being once completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Why Does Legal Reasoning Have to Be Unique?. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 3/2016, pp.  555–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal methods ==

There are distinguished methods of legal reasoning (applying the law) and methods of interpreting (construing) the law. The former are [[legal syllogism]], which holds sway in civil law legal systems,  [[analogy]], which is present in common law legal systems, especially in the US, and argumentative theories that occur in both systems. The latter are different rules (directives) of legal interpretation such as directives of linguistic interpretation, teleological interpretation or systemic interpretation as well as more specific rules, for instance, [[golden rule]] or [[mischief rule]]. There are also many other arguments and cannons of interpretation which altogether make [[statutory interpretation]] possible.

Law professor and former [[United States Attorney General]] [[Edward H. Levi]] noted that the "basic pattern of legal reasoning is reasoning by example" - that is, reasoning by comparing outcomes in cases resolving similar legal questions.&lt;ref&gt;Edward H. Levi, ''An Introduction to Legal Reasoning'' (2013), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding procedural efforts taken by a debt collection company to avoid errors, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]] cautioned that "legal reasoning is not a mechanical or strictly linear process"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerman v. Carlisle]]'', 130 S.Ct. 1605, 1614, 559 U.S. 573, 587 (2010), [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]], J.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal systems ==
{{Main|List of national legal systems}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

=== Civil law ===
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}

[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7| Emperor [[Justinian]] (527–565) of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who ordered the codification of [[Corpus Juris Civilis]].]]

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.

=== Common law and equity ===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

In [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law legal systems]], decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged as "law" on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process and with [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].  The "doctrine of precedent", or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts, and future decisions of the same court, to assure that similar cases reach similar results.  In [[Common law#2. Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems|contrast]], in "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" systems, legislative statutes are typically more detailed, and judicial decisions are shorter and less detailed, because the judge or barrister is only writing to decide the single case, rather than to set out reasoning that will guide future courts.

Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the law varied-shire-to-shire, based on disparate tribal customs. The concept of a "common law" developed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the late 12th century, when Henry appointed judges that had authority to create an institutionalized and unified system of law "common" to the country. The next major step in the evolution of the common law came when [[John of England|King John]] was forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralized. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a systematized process of developing common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the system became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible.  As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, courts of equity developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in England, and in [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|1937 in the U.S.]], the two systems were [[Common law#1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity|merged]].

In developing the common law, [[Common law#Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems|academic writings]] have always played an important part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious law ===
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the "path to follow"—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. [[Canon law]] is only in use by members of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

==== Sharia law ====
{{Main|Sharia}}
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being a first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232216/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm |date=30 August 2006 }}, Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[Global politics|world politics]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal institutions ==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20021125191001/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; and in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164330/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislature ===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101" /&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive ===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch.]]
The executive in a legal system serves as the centre of political [[authority]] of the [[State (polity)|State]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is led by the [[head of government]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany]] (appointed by [[Federal Convention (Germany)|members of federal and state legislatures]]), the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (an [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary office]]), and the [[President of Austria]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in the [[President of the United States|United States]] and in [[President of Brazil|Brazil]]. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

=== Military and police ===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organisations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229014447/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 |date=29 December 2006 }}, History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 193 member states.]]

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "[[red tape]]" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are considered a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a [[barrister]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]], a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as [[Esquire]], to indicate barristers of greater dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British English: Esquire|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=American English: Esquire|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of law]], to indicate a person who obtained a [[PhD]] in Law.

Many Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195205/http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf |date=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364" /&gt;

=== Civil society ===

[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

The [[classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''bürgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties. For further information, see Jakobs, ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities'', 5–6; Kaldor–Anheier–Glasius, ''Global Civil Society'', ''[http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf passim]'' (PDF); Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 282–283. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817130457/http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal subjects ==
All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "[[public law]]" (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "[[private law]]" (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]].

[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The Italian lawyer [[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]], the Father of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Vitoria: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=978-0-521-36714-1|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.
* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent World War II),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=18 February 2010 }}, United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080755/http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional and administrative law ===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything except that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing except that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can sue an agency, local council, public service, or government ministry  for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions, to ensure that they comply with the law, and that the government entity observed required procedure. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal law ===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paradigm]] case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However, for so called "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 17th-century criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th-century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of "[[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224504/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html |date=28 February 2005 }}, see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...". Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623085130/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ |date=23 June 2011 }}, International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract law ===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205104916/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html |date=5 December 2004 }}'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html §&amp;nbsp;311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html|title=§&amp;nbsp;105 BGB Nichtigkeit der Willenserklärung|work=dejure.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort law ===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|The "[[McLibel case]]" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence: (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]] of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway#Daily Telegraph libel case|George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property law ===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and trusts ===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed … This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

=== Further disciplines ===
Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in all member states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001253/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.
* '''[[Transactional law]]''' refers to the practice of law concerning business and money.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''[[Intellectual property law]]''' aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialisation]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation
[[File:1930-67B.png|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], and [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of [[consumer welfare]].
* '''[[Consumer protection|Consumer law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair [[contractual terms]] and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the potential danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to penalise [[pollution|polluters]] within domestic legal systems.

This '''list of [[eponym]]ous laws''' provides links to articles on [[Law (principle)|laws]], [[principle]]s, [[adage]]s, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as [[Parkinson's law]]. In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with [[Moore's law]]. There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as [[Murphy's law]]; or given [[eponym]]ous names despite the absence of the named person.

'''''O'Flaherty V.C., A Recruiting Pamphlet''''' (1915) is a comic one-act play written during [[World War I]] by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. The plot is about an Irish soldier in the British army returning home after winning the [[Victoria Cross]]. The play was written at a time when the British government was attempting to promote recruitment in Ireland, while many [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] expressed opposition to a war to defend the British Empire.

==Characters==
*Dennis O'Flaherty, Irish soldier
*Teresa Driscoll, his girlfriend
*Mrs O'Flaherty, his mother
*General Sir Pearce Madigan, his commanding officer

==Plot==
Dennis O'Flaherty, winner of the Victoria Cross for his outstanding bravery, has returned home to his local village to take part in a recruitment campaign. In conversation with General Pearce Madigan, the local squire, O'Flaherty admits that he had not told his Fenian mother that he would be fighting for the British side in the war, not against it. Madigan says he must explain to her why the war is being fought, and that even Republicans should help in the struggle against German oppression. O'Flaherty says he's no idea why the war is being fought, he just joined up to get away from home, but one thing he's become convinced of is that patriotism is part of the problem: "You'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race". His mother appears, horrified to discover he's being fighting ''for'' the British. But she's even more horrified when Dennis' girlfriend, Teresa, arrives, expecting that the V.C. comes with a large payout in cash. She's dismayed to learn that the government may only give him a pension if he is wounded first. Still, she thinks it will be worth it, even if he does have to be badly wounded. Dennis says he's sick of life in provincial Ireland. Since he's experienced France, he never wants to come back. He hopes he can get a French wife. Teresa is outraged. When Mrs O'Flaherty discovers that her son gave Teresa a valuable gold watch, she launches into a tirade and the two women berate each other mercilessly. O'Flaherty says he can't wait to get back to the peace and quiet of the trenches. General Madigan sympathises, commenting, "Do you think that we should have got an army without conscription if domestic life had been as happy as people say it is?"

==Preface==
In the preface Shaw argues that most soldiers do not enlist for patriotic reasons, but through a desire for adventure, or to get away from a restricted life. This is especially true of the Irish, since an Irishman's hopes and opportunities depend on "getting out of Ireland". He adds that recruitment was nevertheless at a low ebb in 1915, as it had been "badly bungled... The Irish were for the most part Roman Catholics and loyal Irishmen, which means that from the English point of view they were heretics and rebels." Shaw said that he gave his character a self-serving girlfriend and a harridan of a mother ("a [[Volumnia]] of the potato-patch") in order to emphasise the kind of petty oppression from which poor youths fled to join up.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, ''Complete Plays: With Prefaces'', Volume: 5., "Dodd, Mead", New York, 1963, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and productions==
[[File:Michael O'Leary WWI poster.jpg|thumb|150px|A recruiting poster depicting Irish war hero Michael John O'Leary]]
O'Flaherty's exploits in the war and role in recruiting drives are based on those of Irish Catholic Victoria Cross winner [[Michael John O'Leary]].&lt;ref name = bat&gt;Batchelor, Peter F. &amp; Matson, Christopher (1997). ''VCs of the First World War – The Western Front 1915''. Sutton Publishing, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1915 O'Leary had captured two German barricades, killing the gun crew of the first and capturing the second after running out of ammunition. O'Leary been given a grand reception attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July 1915. Recruitment was a highly divisive subject in Ireland at the time. O'Leary was also greeted by cheering crowds in his home town of Macroom, but he was jeered by [[Ulster Volunteers]] at a recruitment drive in Ballaghaderrin during the autumn of 1915. This treatment caused such a scandal that it was raised in the [[Houses of Parliament]] in December.&lt;ref name = bat/&gt; Like O'Flaherty's mother, O'Leary's father was a fervent Irish nationalist.

The play was intended for the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, which was suffering financially in the war, but the play's anti-war message led to a wartime ban on performance by the military authorities in Ireland.&lt;ref name =dic&gt;Broad, Violet &amp; Broad C. Lewis, ''Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw'', A. &amp; C. Black, London, 1929, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bernard Shaw's Suppressed Play," ''Current Opinion'', New York, August, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw later wrote to Yeats that he was not sure that the play would work there anyway, and that [[St John Ervine]], who was to have played the lead role, was not suited to the part.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Welch, ''The Abbey Theatre, 1899–1999: Form and Pressure'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The first production was an amateur performance put on by officers of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name = mrr/&gt; The first professional production was by the [[Incorporated Stage Society]] at the [[Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith]], 20 December 1920. It was paired with [[H. O. Meredith]]'s ''Forerunners''. On 20 November (what year? can't be 1920) Shaw himself gave a radio broadcast version of the play.&lt;ref name = arc&gt;Henderson, Archibald, ''George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century'', Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p. 572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
[[Beatrice Webb]] wrote in her diary that "O'Flaherty V.C. is a brilliant but serious piece of work—a jewel of a one-act play."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret I. Cole (ed), ''Beatrice Webb's Diaries, 1912–1924'', Longmans, Green and Co, London, 1952, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen Murray in ''English War Plays of the First World War'', says that "Shaw tackles the issues of the war in a juxtaposition of serious and inconsequential subject-matter and tones which in many ways do take away from the important points he wishes to disclose. These fragment the unity of theme and mood."&lt;ref name = mrr&gt;Murray, Stephen, ''English War Plays of the First World War''&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw's friend [[Archibald Henderson (professor)|Archibald Henderson]] says that "The Irish peasants are portrayed as hopelessly insular and sadly benighted. Their prejudice against the British is bitter and incorrigible."&lt;ref name = arc/&gt; Bernard Dukore notes that the play "vividly contrasts as background the poverty of the lower-class Irish with the prosperity of the landed Anglo-Irish ascendancy. Because O'Flaherty's mother nursed the son of Sir Pearce, she had to bring up her own daughter on the bottle. When Sir Pearce mentions a citizen's obligation to king and country, O'Flaherty comments, 'Well, sir, to you that have an estate in it, it would feel like your country. But the devil a [[Rod (unit)|perch]] of it ever I owned.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard F. Dukore, ''Bernard Shaw, Playwright: Aspects of Shavian Drama'', University of Missouri Press, Columbia, MO., 1973, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''OId Jewish Cemetery''' is almost 500 years old cemetery in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Site is located on the slopes of [[Trebević]] mountain, in the Kovačići-Debelo Brdo area, in the south-western part of the city. It is one of the largest [[Jewish cemetery|Jewish cemeteries]] in South-East Europe. It was in use from the beginning of the 16th or 17th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=jewish+cemetery+sarajevo+established&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viYqUobfNuXD4AOX5IGwBw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jewish%20cemetery%20sarajevo%20established&amp;f=false |title=Antisemitism in Eastern Europe: History and Present in Comparison - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1966.&lt;ref name="jew-cem-unesco"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Centre |first1=UNESCO World Heritage |title=Jewish Cemetery in Sarajevo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6334/ |website=whc.unesco.org |accessdate=31 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Established by [[Sephardic Jew]]s during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]], it also became the burial ground for [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s after they arrived in Sarajevo with the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in the late 19th century. It contains more than 3850 tombstones and covers an area of 31160 square meters. It has four monuments dedicated to the victims of [[fascism]]: a Sephardi one designed by Jahiel Finci and erected in 1952, two Ashkenazi ones, and one dedicated to the victims of [[Ustasha]] militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JEWISH CEMETERY Sarajevo Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/see/IRPPSAAH/PTA/BiH/PTA_BosniaandHerzegovina_JewishCemetery.pdf|publisher=Coe.int|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During war of the 1990s===
The Jewish Cemetery was on the [[front line]] during the [[Bosnian War|war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and was used as an [[artillery]] position by [[Bosnian Serb]]s. It was thus severely damaged by bullets and fire caused by explosions. It was also heavily mined but was completely cleared in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Commission Urges Sarajevo Cemetery Restoration|url=http://www.isjm.org/links/sarajevo.htm|publisher=Isjm.org|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable burials and memorials==
Notable people buried in the cemetery include [[Rabbi]] Samuel Baruh (first rabbi of Sarajevo from 1630 to 1650; his grave is believed to be the oldest in the cemetery),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cvk6oMf9R7AC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=jewish+cemetery+sarajevo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eiYqUveNPLWn4AOhy4GYDA&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jewish%20cemetery%20sarajevo&amp;f=false |title=Bosnia: A Short History - Noel Malcolm - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Isak Pardo (rabbi from 1781 to 1810), Rabbi Avraham Abinun (Grand Rabbi from 1856 to 1858), [[Moshe ben Rafael Attias]] (1845 – 1916), Laura Levi Papo LaBohoreta (writer of the early 20th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Women in  Yugoslavia|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/yugoslavia|publisher=Jwa.org|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Isak Samokovlija]].
There are also four memorials erected to the victims of Fascist terror, along with several cenotaphs, an empty memorial tombs, with the names of people who died elsewhere and whose grave locations are unknown.

===Genizah===
Separate vault or "grave" for damaged books known as a [[Genizah]], is located in the southeastern part of the cemetery, with the first burial taking place on 3 July 1916. Assumption is that some 14 chests of holy books were buried in the second burial ceremony, so currently exhumation of Geniza is under way to determine its content.

==National and World Heritage designation==
Cemetery is designated national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina as "Sepulchral ensemble – Jewish cemetery in Sarajevo".
In preparation for nomination for the inclusion on [[World Heritage site]] list, Bosnian delegates submitted documentation for the tentative list at [[UNESCO]] on April 3, 2018, under the "Cultural" category and criteria "(ii)", "(iii)", "(iv)", "(vi)".&lt;ref name="jew-cem-unesco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jevrej-unesco-oslobodjenje"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Šimić |first1=Angelina |title=Oslobođenje - Očekuje se upis Jevrejskog groblja u UNESCO |url=https://www.oslobodjenje.ba/o2/rodni-kraj/zemlja-koju-volimo/ocekuje-se-upis-jevrejskog-groblja-u-unesco |accessdate=31 May 2018 |work=Oslobođenje d.o.o. |date=5 February 2018 |language=bs-ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Panayiotou and others v Sony Music Entertainment (UK) Ltd.''''' ([1994] ChD 142) was a contract and entertainment law case before the [[High Court of Justice]]'s [[High Court of Justice#Chancery Division|Chancery Division]]. The plaintiff, entertainer [[George Michael]], argued that his recording contract constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. Michael alleged that the defendant had failed to promote his album ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'' with due vigour as punishment when the artist decided to downplay his status as a sex symbol. Michael described his situation as "professional slavery" because his contract required that he produce music and cede the copyright to Sony for many years, leaving him no control over how the music would be marketed nor placing a reciprocal requirement that the label invest in promotion. Had the case succeeded, it might have curtailed the practice of signing artists to multi-album contracts. The court wholly rejected the claims.

==Background==
Georgios Panayiotou, known professionally as George Michael, signed with [[Innervision Records]] in 1982 at the age of eighteen as part of the then relatively unknown pop duo [[Wham!]].&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1993 /&gt; Innervision were distributed by [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]. In 1984 this contract was nullified as part of a legal compromise wherein Wham! were obligated to produce up to eight new albums for CBS Records; the label and the contract were acquired by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt; Following Wham!'s success and subsequent break up, Michael renegotiated a new eight-album deal with Sony as a solo artist in 1988.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt; This deal was further renegotiated in 1990 to reflect Michael's superstar status, achieving terms comparable to similarly high-grossing artists.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt; Michael's first solo album, [[Faith (George Michael album)|''Faith'']], was released in 1987 and had sold 14 million copies by the time suit was filed; his second solo album, ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'' was released in 1990 and had sold 5 million copies.&lt;ref name=NYT1994 /&gt; ''Listen Without Prejudice'' represented a new direction for Michael, downplaying the sex symbol status he had cultivated with Wham! in favour of a more reserved identity purely as a serious musician; he decided not to place his highly recognisable image on the album cover and declined to appear in promotional videos. Michael alleged that Sony under-promoted his new album in response to these decisions. He further charged that the contract restricting him from seeking a new label and prevented him from managing his professional image as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep1993 /&gt; Michael described this imbalance of power and his long-term lack of control over his career as "professional slavery".&lt;ref name=NYT1994 /&gt;

It was common practice in the recording industry to sign many emerging artists like Wham!, banking that long-term profits from the few commercial successes would cover the losses from promoting the remainder. A decision holding Michael's contract unenforceable could have dramatically reduced the expected return on investment for signing and promoting an emerging artist, leading to fears that the practice would end. Michael argued that the structure of the industry concentrated power in too few hands, and that these companies competed by selling music, but not in the terms offered to new artists. This led to an imbalance of power, where the artist was contractually obligated to produce a set number of albums of acceptable quality and cede copyright to the label, but the label did not bear a reciprocal obligation to market and promote the product, in accordance with the artist's wishes or otherwise.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep1993 /&gt;

Michael was advanced a sum of £1 million in February 1992 under the terms of the 1990 contract. This amount was returned to Sony in August of the same year in preparation for filing suit in October.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-report /&gt;

==Decision==
Michael filed suit before the [[Chancery Division]] on 30 October 1992, and Justice Jonathan Parker issued a ruling on 1 June 1994. The plaintiff's claims were wholly rejected. Parker held that Michael's contracts were reasonable and fair,&lt;ref name=Nordenfelt /&gt; especially in consideration of his access to expert legal advice, several renegotiations, and terms comparable to the industry standard for an artist of his commercial success.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt; There were five prongs to the justice's dismissal:
*the case was indeed such that the doctrine of restraint of trade would be applicable;
*the 1984 agreement was a compromise in good faith and the conditions obtaining there would pertain to all subsequent renegotiations: there is a legitimate public interest in upholding such a compromise, and the suit fails at the initial hurdle;
*leaving aside the origin of the 1988 agreement, its provisions were justifiable: the label has a legitimate and enforceable ''recoupment interest'' in an exclusive contract of some duration;
*restraint of trade under Article 85 of the [[Treaty of Rome]] establishing the European Community concerns trade between member states, and was held not to apply; Article 222 governing property ownership, including intellectual property, would have superseded in any case;
*by activating its terms in requesting an advance in 1992, Michael affirmed the 1988 agreement.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-report /&gt;

In July 1995, Sony sold the contract to rival record companies Virgin Records and DreamWorks Records.

Rowling has also been parodied (and parodied herself) in a number of instances.

To date, there are four complete books - ''Garry Poker and the Blue Ace of Spades'', ''Garry Poker and his Blissful Years of Secrets'', ''Garry Poker and the Prisoner of Az-Cardan'', ''Garry Poker and the Goblet of Putrefy'' and several chapters of the fifth available in Czech, but the author made a list of names in English for further translations.&lt;ref name="garrypoker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garrypoker.cz/?kat=english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509194135/http://www.garrypoker.cz/?kat=english |archive-date=9 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |title=Garry Poker |accessdate=25 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Lisa's favorite book series, '''Angelica Button''', is a recurring gag and clearly a parody of Harry Potter
:* In the episode "[[The Haw-Hawed Couple]]", Lisa asks [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] to read her Angelica Button book to her for bedtime. Homer, learning that the character Headmaster Greystash will die (à la [[Albus Dumbledore]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''), hides the fact from Lisa by inventing a happier ending, though Lisa does read the real ending and decides that Homer's was better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Haw-Hawed Couple|work=tv.com|url=http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/the-haw-hawed-couple/episode/914674/recap.html|accessdate=15 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206200511/http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/the-haw-hawed-couple/episode/914674/recap.html|archivedate=6 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He reappeared in the episodes "[[Nigel Planter and the Chamber Pot of Secrets]]", "[[One Crazy Summoner]]" and "Order of the [[Peanuts]]". The episodes feature Lord Moldybutt, a parody of [[Lord Voldemort]], and whenever someone says his name, something unfortunate happens. Toadblatt's School of Sorcery is a parody of [[Hogwarts]], and the Squid Hat is a parody of the [[Sorting Hat]], and is voiced by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography (1959-)|work=.filmreference.com|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/90/Weird-Al-Yankovic.html |accessdate=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the house of Weaslethorpe, parodying [[Hogwarts#Gryffindor|Gryffindor]].

Nigel then asks for help winning the affections of Herfefnie Pfefferpfeffer, a parody of [[Hermione Granger]], who ends up falling for Dorko Malfly, a parody of [[Draco Malfoy]], instead.
:*In the episode "Order of the Peanuts" Mandy was able to predict how Nigel Planter would sneak in to the school. She was right in guessing that he'd fill the position of "Defence against really dark things" since it changes every movie. They also commented on the changing of Dumbledore's actor after the second film.
*In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode, "Dope and Faith", Steve is apparently accepted into 'Hogwarts'. Later in the episode, he quotes to one of the Crack scientists that "Your pretty strict, you'll probably turn out to be a good guy", referring to Professor Snape.
* ''Henry Skreever'' was the title of a book series in three episodes of the children's television show ''[[Arthur (cartoon)|Arthur]]''. In the first, "Prunella's Special Edition", a new book had just come out entitled ''Henry Skreever and the Cabbage of Mayhem'' and all the characters were reading it. The second, "Prunella Sees the Light", featured the Henry Skreever movie, ''Henry Skreever and the Brick of Wonders''. This parody features the villain "Lord Moldywort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PBS's ARTHUR(R) Receives Vernon Henley Award From The American Council Of The Blind|work=Market Wire|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200207/ai_mark03044184|year=2002|accessdate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third, "Prunella Deegan and the Disappointing Ending", Marina and Prunella race to see who can finish reading the last book, ''The Knights of the Bouillabaisse'', first. The school of magic that Henry attends is known as "Pigblisters" (Hogwarts). Students participate in the game "Soupitch" (Quidditch), a dangerous, mobile tree is called "The Mangling Maple" (The Whomping Willow), and instead of broomsticks, students ride on flying carpets.
* In the animated series ''[[Cyberchase]]'', the young spellcaster Shari Spotter attends Frogsnorts school of magic under Professor Stumblesnore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/cyberchase/shari-spotter-and-the-cosmic-crumpets/episode/364854/summary.html TV.com: Sharri Spotter and Cosmic Crumpets] accessed 26 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The show's main characters must solve a series of magical themed logic problems to save the day.
* One of ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'' episodes is called "The Prisoner of Kuzcoban", which is a parody of "[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]".
* In the ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'' episode "Magic in the Air", Charley becomes so overly obsessed with fictional book character, Peter Poundstone (a series of books about a young wizard similar to the Potter series), that he attempts to use magic to create a diorama (as part of a school assignment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magic in the Air / Everyone Loves Clifford|work=TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/clifford-the-big-red-dog/magic-in-the-air---everyone-loves-clifford/episode/179557/summary.html|year=2002|accessdate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the cartoon animated version of ''[[Martha Speaks (TV series)|Martha Speaks]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], the character TD is a fan of a character called ''Harry Blotter''. TD sat down to watch a marathon of the films in the series. He said that all four prequels and all four sequels were being aired, followed by the premiere of the ninth movie, which didn't make much sense, as there should already have been nine movies if there were four prequels and four sequels. Blotter's enemy, possibly, is the "Dark Lord of Really Dark Darkness", though this may have been a character created by TD for a school project about [[Thomas Edison]].
* In the ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' episode "Potions 11 / Moves Like Jabba", Harry Potter gathers a team of wizards to find a wand that will let the franchise live forever in a parody of ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's 11]]''.

* Harry Potter has been parodied several times on the US [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In all sketches, Harry is portrayed by [[Rachel Dratch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rachel Dratch biography at TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/rachel-dratch/person/40078/biography.html|accessdate=5 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003321/http://www.tv.com/rachel-dratch/person/40078/biography.html|archivedate=28 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for the "Welcome Back Potter" sketch in which Harry is played by [[Will Forte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturday Night Live Transcripts|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02f.phtml|accessdate=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Hermione Granger was played by [[Lindsay Lohan]], who wore a revealing sweater that showed a good deal of her breasts, causing Harry and Ron, then the Weasley twins, and even Snape and Hagrid to gawk at her in amazement and lust. (The boys decide to use the Invisibility Cloak to spy on Hermione in the bath.) This was to parody the fact that Hermione had reached puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturday Night Live Transcripts|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/03/03rpotter.phtml|accessdate=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent sketch featuring [[J. K. Rowling]] (played by [[Amy Poehler]]) showed deleted scenes from [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]] where [[Albus Dumbledore]] (played by [[Bill Hader]]) acts [[Effeminacy|gay]]. Most recently, [[Daniel Radcliffe]] portrayed Potter in a sketch where it has been ten years since his Graduation (though this was never shown in the books), and is still at Hogwarts as a tenant.

*On the Disney Channel comedy series, ''[[So Random!]]'', a sketch called ''Harry Potter: In The Real World'', is shown to have Harry in the real world, trying to find a job at fictional fast food restaurant, Flippy's. Harry's lightning bolt birth mark and his birth scroll are shown. The ''So Random'' Christmas special also has a Volde-mart sketch where Voldemort owns a supermarket and can't get any of his Voldemort dolls to sell, and is furious when he finds out that the Harry Potter dolls are flying off the shelves, so furious that he uses the Avada Kedavra curse on a Harry Potter cardboard cutout in similar style to how Ralph Fiennes does the curse when he destroys the Horcrux in Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2''. Also as a parody of the final film, Harry Potter enters and says Daniel Radcliffe's line, "Come on Tom, let's finish this the way we started it, together." and then hugs Voldemort. Also mentioned in this sketch is Toy's R Severus, in parody of the character Severus Snape.
* "Harry Bladder" was a sketch on the sketch comedy show ''[[All That]]''. Instead of flying on a broom, Harry rode a leaf-blower. The sketch also featured a bowlegged Professor Chafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Summer on "All That"|author=Kyle Sullivan|work=Officially Kyle Sullivan|url=http://www.kyle-sullivan.com/articles/msoat.htm|accessdate=20 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519033343/http://www.kyle-sullivan.com/articles/msoat.htm|archivedate=19 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumbledore is parodied as Headmaster Crumbs, Draco Malfoy is parodied as Jerko Phoenix, and the villain is Dr. Evilini, who plans on taking Justin's powers. Quidditch is parodied through a game called 12-ball, which is similar to ping pong. To end the game, you "hit the tattler"; tattler also being another name for a "snitch." In another episode of the same show, Alex, Justin and Max magically travel to an apartment where they meet author H. J. Darling, (a parody of [[J. K. Rowling]]) to inquire as to her reasoning for using stories from their lives in her series called "Charmed and Dangerous", (a parody of the Harry Potter books themselves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Wizards of Waverly Place" Wizard School (2008)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045552/|accessdate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[The Shakespeare Code]]'', [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] and [[Martha Jones]] talk about witches and refer to the book saga, she says: "It's all a bit [[Harry Potter universe|Harry Potter]]" which The Doctor replies saying that he already read '[[Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows|Book 7]]' and that he cried at the end (the episode aired 3 months before the book release and at the time they didn't know the name of the book, that's why it is referred as 'Book 7').

* A parody of Hogwarts can be seen in ''[[Futurama Comics]]'' No. 16. While trying to find a boarding school for Cubert, the crew visits a magic school on the planet Rowling VI.

* In [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]'s comic book series ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', which crosses over countless works of fiction in the same universe, the third volume chronicles events that culminate in the events of the Harry Potter series. In the novel an unrecognizable Harry is portrayed as the [[Anti-Christ]], and all his adventures have merely been staged to manipulate him into destroying the world. On learning this, Harry destroys Hogwarts and murders everyone in it, including Ron and Hermione. Various characters describe Harry as 'banal.'  He appears at the end of the novel as a rapidly mutating monster before he is destroyed. None of the characters or locations in the series are mentioned by name to avoid conflict with J.K. Rowling, as Moore has done with other characters belonging to other authors. No references are made to any of the actual events of the series, and the summary given of them is inconsistent with the actual story.

===Online audio===
* ''Harry Potter and the Half-Assed Parody'', a chapter-by-chapter parody of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. It was written and performed by The Deadly Abridgment and is currently available on both iTunes and YouTube.
* ''Dirty Potter'', a trilogy of audio shorts were made through creative use of word splicing and sound editing. The characters have been reimaged into overly lustful and sex-crazed; frequently engaging in comedic and lewd activities and using vulgar language. Each audio short is narrated by British actor [[Jim Dale]], who also has been reimaged in the context of the parody. These clips were previously only hosted on [[YouTube]], but were "removed due to a Terms of Use violation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z18Xmw71A4E|title=YouTube: Original Dirty Potter location (Removed)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clips are now available at the "Dirty Potter" website and have since been re-added to YouTube.

* Webcomic [[Sluggy Freelance]]'s main character is Torg, a bright but uncomplicated fellow whose last name we never learn. In Pete Abrams' first parody, ''Torg Potter and the Sorcerer's Nuts'', Torg is mistaken for the Lastnameless One and brought into Hoggelrynth to learn magic. He subsequently defeats a plot by Professor Santory Snapekin to achieve ultimate power. (Maybe.) Despite Torg's not having any actual magic powers he is embroiled in a plot to turn everybody into chocolate in ''Torg Potter and the Chamberpot of Secretions''. In ''Torg Potter and the President from Arkansas'' Blearious Stank escapes from prison, and Torg is considered to be in danger due to being the "Torg Potter of record". Torg is jibported back to Hoggelrynth to take part in the Tri-Gizzard Tournament in ''Torg Potter and the Giblets with Fiber''. The parodies are modelled after the movies, not the books, and follow the movie releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torg Potter and the Sorcerer's Nuts|url=http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=030915|accessdate=18 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030922090613/http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=030915|archive-date=22 September 2003|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torg Potter and the Chamberpot of Secretions|url=http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=050822|accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torg Potter and the President From Arkansas|url=http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=020902|accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torg Potter and the Giblets with Fiber|url=http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=080305|accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The webcomic [[Gunnerkrigg Court]] had a short little scene where the main characters, Annie and Kat, hear about a new student the local bully is terrorizing. Just before the bully can hang the boy (who looks exactly like a cartoon Harry Potter) up on the flagpole, Annie and Kat stop him and chase the bully away. However, instead of being grateful he claims that he and his wand had it under complete control. When Annie points out the "wand" is just a twig, he gets offended and tries to cast a spell on Annie and Kat in exactly the same pose has Harry in many of the movies when he casts a powerful spell. Nothing happens and Annie and Kat end up hanging him up on the flagpole themselves.
* ''Wizard School'' is a webcomic parody of Harry Potter, in which an eight-year-old "chosen one" with a mark on his forehead is replaced by the villain with a drunken adult jerk with a tattoo, who attends the school for wizards in his place.
* ''Potters and Potions'' is a screencap comic in the vein of ''Darths and Droids'', or ''DM of the rings''. It follows the plot of the movies, as if the characters had been players in an RPG.
* ''Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash'' is a one-chapter AI-assisted-generated short story produced using software from Botnik. The AI program is fed all 7 volumes of [[J.K.Rowling]]'s books, and the output text resembles her writing style. &lt;ref name="Botnik Studio | Harry Potter"&gt;{{cite web |title= Botnik Studio {{!}} Harry Potter |url= http://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter chapter written by bots is magically terrible|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/harry-potter-new-chapter-predictive-text-botnik/|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contained characters such as Barry Popper, Ren Beaseley, Harmony Grunge and Professor Dumbledoofus going on a quest to defeat the Dark Lord Monty (Voldemort's younger brother). A sequel is being written.
* ''Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?'', a play by [[Desert Star Theater]] in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis. The plot, which takes place at the Utah-based Warthogs school for wizards, features Harry Podder, Hermione Ranger, Ron Sneasley, Professor McGargoyle and the Dark wizard Voldie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar|work=Desert News (Salt Lake City)|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050605/ai_n14655523|accessdate=20 May 2007 | date=5 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Chuckle Brothers]] toured the stage show ''Barry Potty and his Smarter Brother Paul'' in the Chamber of Horrors
*''Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice - The Parody!'', a cross parody of ''Stranger than Fiction'' and the Harry Potter books and movies. Written by Jeannette Jaquish in 2007 for actors aged 5 to adult, the story's theme is the widening rift between facts of the movies and the books demonstrated in bizarre "changes" at Hogwarts that only Harry can see. Comic scenes of Dobby and Winky panicking over missing cheese, Ron slopping a potion on Snape, Dumbledore missing his meal ticket as well as his mind, and Malfoy deflecting a dementor as he earns his free lunch in the Hogwarts cafeteria poke fun at the icons of J.K. Rowling's books. In 2010, Jaquish wrote two additional scenes which added Peeves, Moaning Myrtle, Luna Lovegood and the Hogwarts Kitchen House Elves. The show first played at the Firehouse Theater in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] in September 2007, and since has performed in England, many U.S. states and toured Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/theaterscripts/harrypotter-obnoxiousvoice.html|title=Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice script excerpts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==J. K. Rowling parodies==
[[Image:Jo simpsons.jpg|200 px|thumb|[[J. K. Rowling]]'s appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'']]
[[J. K. Rowling]], the Harry Potter writer, has been parodied several times:
* Rowling made a guest appearance as herself on the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in a special British-themed episode entitled "[[The Regina Monologues]]". The dialogue consisted of a short conversation between Rowling and [[Lisa Simpson]], who mispronounces Rowling's name. She acknowlewdges Lisa with "Thank you, young Muggle". When Lisa asks her about the ending of ''Harry Potter'', Rowling sighs and says: "He grows up, and marries you. Is that what you want to hear?" to which Lisa swoons and dreamily replies, "Yes!" before Rowling rolls her eyes and walks away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Regina Monologues episode trivia|url=http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/the-regina-monologues/episode/223791/trivia.html|accessdate=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rowling is also parodied in an episode of [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', in which a character from the future travels through time in an attempt to completely destroy her chance at fame by giving Rowling a terrible idea for a novel: "A raccoon with an afro named Squiggles who shoots pixie dust from his bunghole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robot Chicken: Federated Resources|work=tv.com|url=http://www.tv.com/robot-chicken/federated-resources/episode/696410/trivia.html|accessdate=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rowling appears as a wrestler on ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', where she uses ''[[Harry Potter]]''-style spells against [[Stephen King]]. It ends when she kills Stephen King through a lightning bolt manifested from the power of Voldemort. However, after he dies, King's robotic leg acts up and ends up killing Rowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creepshows: Stephen King Movies: Celebrity Deathmatch|url=http://www.stephen-king.tk/index.htm?http://www.stephen-king.tk/celebdeathmatch.htm|accessdate=25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On a couple of occasions, [[Craig Ferguson]] of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' has done a sketch where he portrays J.K. Rowling as a power-hungry, money-obsessed individual. Once he portrayed her doing a talkshow, similar to [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]], and advertising ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'': "It really moved me...into a bigger mansion. HAHAHAHA! I'M RICH! I'M RICH!"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
* In 2002, the Canadian newspaper ''[[National Post]]'', in its satirical column ''Post Morten'', wrote a spoof article claiming that:
::Rowling – or, as the article referred to and credited her, Mrs. J. K. Satan – said that as she sat in a coffee shop one grey day, wondering what to do with her empty, aimless life, it hit her: "I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!"
:Like ''The Onion''{{'}}s article on Harry Potter and Satanism, this article too was copied into a chain letter and released as truth onto the web.&lt;ref name=morten /&gt;
* In one episode of the second series of [[Tracey Ullman's State of the Union]], [[Tracey Ullman]] parodies J.K. Rowling as bossy and very keen on keeping her creations copyrighted, for example, she believes a [[hobo]] is impersonating Hagrid.
* Maureen Johnson (author) has on multiple occasions parodied J. K. Rowling on her blog. She has described J. K. Rowling as a deranged, food-obsessed psycho who keeps Alan Rickman prisoner in her basement.

'''Philosophy of religion''' is "the philosophical examination of the central themes and concepts involved in religious traditions."&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Winter 2014|title = Philosophy of Religion|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/|date = 1 January 2014|first = Charles|last = Taliaferro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sorts of philosophical discussion are ancient, and can be found in the earliest known [[manuscripts]] concerning philosophy. The field is related to many other branches of philosophy, including [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion/#FieSig "Philosophy of Religion."]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosophy of religion differs from [[religious philosophy]] in that it seeks to discuss questions regarding the nature of religion as a whole, rather than examining the problems brought forth by a particular belief system. It is designed such that it can be carried out dispassionately by those who identify as [[religious belief|believers]] or non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=C. Stephen|title=Philosophy of Religion: Thinking about Faith|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=1985|pages=16|isbn=978-0-87784-343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Bronnikov gimnpifagoreizev.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Pythagoreans Celebrate the Sunrise'' (1869) by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]. [[Pythagoreanism]] is one example of a [[Greek philosophy]] that also included religious elements.]]
Philosopher [[William L. Rowe]] characterized the philosophy of religion as: "the critical examination of basic religious beliefs and concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Philosophy of Religion, An Introduction, Fourth Edition, 2007, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of religion covers alternative beliefs about God (or gods), the varieties of [[religious experience]], the interplay between science and religion, the nature and scope of good and evil, and religious treatments of birth, history, and death.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; The field also includes the ethical implications of religious commitments, the relation between faith, reason, experience and tradition, concepts of the miraculous, the sacred revelation, mysticism, power, and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin, N, Tsui-James, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HNWIcgEswrsC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=philosophy+of+religion+field&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RvFjVPmhPKSe7gbU1YGgAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20religion%20field&amp;f=false ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 453.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Philosophy of Religion" did not come into general use in the West until the nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, WJ., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC&amp;dq=oxford+handbook+Philosophy+religion&amp;q=%22come+into+general%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22come%20into%20general%22&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion''], Oxford Handbooks Online, 2004, p. 3. "The expression "philosophy of religion" did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice."&lt;/ref&gt; and most pre-modern and early modern philosophical works included a mixture of religious themes and "non-religious" philosophical questions. In Asia, examples include texts such as the Hindu [[Upanishads]], the works of [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhist texts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: History of the philosophy of religion.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophies like [[Pythagoreanism]] and [[Stoicism]] included religious elements and theories about deities, and [[Medieval philosophy]] was strongly influenced by the big three Monotheistic [[Abrahamic religions]]. In the Western world, early modern philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], and [[George Berkeley]] discussed religious topics alongside secular philosophical issues as well. &lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion/#FieSig "Philosophy of Religion."]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosophy of religion has been distinguished from [[theology]] by pointing out that, for theology, "its critical reflections are based on religious convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': Theology.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "theology is responsible to an authority that initiates its thinking, speaking, and witnessing ... [while] philosophy bases its arguments on the ground of timeless evidence."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590855/theology/14945/Relationship-to-philosophy Theology; Relationship of theology to the history of religions and philosophy; Relationship to philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of philosophy of religion have classically been regarded as a part of [[metaphysics]]. In [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics'', the necessarily prior cause of eternal motion was an [[unmoved mover]], who, like the object of desire, or of thought, inspires motion without itself being moved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abu.nb.ca/courses/grphil/philrel/aristotle.htm Aristotle], Professor Barry D. Smith, Crandall University&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Aristotle, is God, the subject of study in [[theology]]. Today, however, philosophers have adopted the term "philosophy of religion" for the subject, and typically it is regarded as a separate field of specialization, although it is also still treated by some, particularly [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[philosopher]]s, as a part of metaphysics.

==Basic themes and problems==
===Ultimate Reality===
Different religions have different ideas about Ultimate Reality, its source or ground (or lack thereof) and also about what is the "Maximal Greatness".&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith E. PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION A contemporary introduction, Routledge, 2002, Part II in general&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, William, "Concepts of God", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/concepts-god/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Tillich]]'s concept of 'Ultimate Concern' and [[Rudolf Otto]]'s 'Idea of the Holy' are concepts which point to concerns about the ultimate or highest truth which most religious philosophies deal with in some way. One of the main differences among religions is whether the Ultimate Reality is a personal God or an impersonal reality.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meister, Chad. Introducing Philosophy of Religion. Routledge 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Western religions, various forms of [[Theism]] are the most common conceptions of the ultimate Good, while in [[Eastern Religions]], there are theistic and also various non-theistic conceptions of the Ultimate. Theistic vs non-theistic is a common way of sorting the different types of religions.&lt;ref&gt;see the whole structure of 'Yandell, 2002.'&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several philosophical positions with regard to the existence of [[God]] that one might take including various forms of [[Theism]] (such as [[Monotheism]] and [[Polytheism]]), [[Agnosticism]] and different forms of [[Atheism]].

====Monotheism====
[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Aquinas]] considered five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).]]
{{Main|Existence of God}}
Monotheism is the belief in a single deity or [[God]], who is ontologically independent.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many forms of monotheism. [[Keith Yandell]] outlines roughly three kinds of historical monotheisms: Greek, Semitic and Hindu. Greek monotheism holds that the world has always existed and does not believe in Creationism or divine providence, while Semitic monotheism believes the world is created by a God at a particular point in time and that this God acts in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith E. PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION A contemporary introduction, Routledge, 2002, page 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian monotheism meanwhile teaches that the world is beginningless, but that there is God's act of creation which sustains the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt to provide proofs or arguments for the existence of [[God]] is one aspect of what is known as [[natural theology]] or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief in God by independent grounds. Perhaps most of philosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology's assumption that the existence of God can be justified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological debate about the kinds of proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this discourse.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Antony Flew]], [[John Polkinghorne]], [[Keith Ward]], [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Richard Swinburne]]&lt;/ref&gt; Common types of arguments for the existence of god include:

*[[Cosmological Argument]]
*[[Ontological Argument]]
*[[Teleological argument]]
*[[Argument from religious experience]]
*[[Argument from morality]]
*Wager arguments like [[Pascal's Wager]] attempts to rationally argue that one ''should'' believe in God.

Skeptics and atheists have put forth various arguments against the existence of God including:

*The [[argument from inconsistent revelations]]
*The [[problem of evil]], the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with that of a [[deity]] who is, in either absolute or relative terms, [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]].&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Argument from poor design]]
*[[Argument from nonbelief]] or the argument from divine hiddenness

====Non-theistic conceptions====
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumb|225px|The Buddhist [[Vasubandhu]] argued against Hindu Creator God views and for an impersonal conception of absolute reality that has been described as a form of Idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Sean (2011) "Idealism in Yogācāra Buddhism," The Hilltop Review: Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 6. Available at: http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/hilltopreview/vol4/iss1/6&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Eastern Religions have included both theistic and other alternative positions about the ultimate nature of reality. One such view is [[Jainism]], which holds a dualistic view that all that exists is matter and a multiplicity of souls ([[jiva]]), without depending on a supreme deity for their existence. There are also different Buddhist views, such as the [[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma]] view, which holds that the only ultimately existing things are transitory phenomenal events (''[[Abhidharma#Dharma_theory|dharmas]]'') and their [[dependent origination|interdependent relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhists such as [[Nagarjuna]] hold that Ultimate reality is emptiness ([[shunyata]]) while the [[Yogacara]] holds that it is ''vijñapti'' (mental phenomena). In Indian philosophical discourses, monotheism was defended by Hindu philosophers (particularly the [[Nyaya]] school), while Buddhist thinkers argued against their conception of a Creator God (Sanskrit: [[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad (Reviewer) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z88GAfvNGH0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Nyaya&amp;f=false Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India]''. By Parimal Patil. New York: Columbia University Press, 2009. Pp. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu view of [[Advaita Vedanta]], as defended by [[Adi Shankara]], is a total [[non-dualism]]. Though Advaitins do believe in the usual Hindu gods, their view of ultimate reality is a radically [[monistic]] oneness ([[Brahman]] without qualities) and anything which appears (like persons and gods) is illusory (''maya'').&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The various philosophical positions of Chinese [[Taoism]] can also be viewed as non-theistic about the ultimate reality ([[Tao]]).

For most of these non-theistic traditions, the path to ultimate reality includes various spiritual practices such as [[yoga]] and [[meditation]].

It is important to note that the above philosophical views do not necessarily entail atheism. Traditionally, Jains and Buddhists did not rule out the existence of limited deities or divine beings, they only rejected the idea of a single all powerful creator God or First cause posited by monotheists.

[[File:Blind monks examining an elephant.jpg|thumb|The [[Blind men and an elephant]] is a parable widely used in Buddhism and Jainism to illustrate the dangers of dogmatic religious belief]]
All religious traditions make knowledge claims which they argue are central to religious practice and to the ultimate solution to the main problem of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; These include epistemic, metaphysical and ethical claims. 

[[Evidentialism]] is the position that may be characterized as "a belief is rationally justified only if there is sufficient evidence for it".&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 105&lt;/ref&gt; Many theists and non-theists are evidentialists, for example, Aquinas and Bertrand Russell agree that belief in God is rational only if there is sufficient evidence, but disagree on whether such evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 105&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments often stipulate that subjective religious experiences are not reasonable evidence and thus religious truths must be argued based on non-religious evidence. One of the strongest positions of evidentialism is that by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] who wrote: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent supporters of evidentialism include [[Antony Flew]] ("The Presumption of Atheism", 1972) and [[Michael Scriven]] (Primary philosophy, 1966). Both of them rely on the [[Ockhamist]] view that in the absence of evidence for X, belief in X is not justified. Many modern [[Thomists]] are also evidentialists in that they hold they can demonstrate there is evidence for the belief in God. Another move is to argue in a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] way for the probability of a religious truth like God, not for total conclusive evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers however, argue that religious belief is warranted ''without evidence'' and hence are sometimes called ''non-evidentialists''. They include [[Fideism|fideists]] and [[reformed epistemologists]]. [[Alvin Plantinga]] and other [[reformed epistemologists]] are examples of philosophers who argue that religious beliefs are "properly basic beliefs" and that it is not irrational to hold them even though they are not supported by any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale here is that some beliefs we hold must be foundational and not be based on further rational beliefs, if this is not so we risk an [[infinite regress]]. This is qualified by the proviso that they can be defended against objections (this differentiates this view from fideism). A properly basic belief is a belief that one can reasonably hold without evidence, such as a memory, a basic sensation or a perception. Plantinga's argument is that belief in God is of this type, because within every human mind there is a natural awareness of divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] in his essay "[[The Will to Believe]]" argues for a pragmatic conception of religious belief. For James, religious belief is justified if one is presented with a question which is rationally undecidable and if one is presented with genuine and live options which are relevant for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 98&lt;/ref&gt; For James, religious belief is defensible because of the pragmatic value it can bring to one's life, even if there is no rational evidence for it.

Some work in recent epistemology of religion goes beyond debates over evidentialism, fideism, and reformed epistemology to consider contemporary issues deriving from new ideas about knowledge-how and practical skill; how practical factors can affect whether one could know whether theism is true; from formal epistemology's use of probability theory; or from social epistemology (particularly the epistemology of testimony, or the epistemology of disagreement).&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see {{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |last2=Hawthorne |first2=John |last3=Rabinowitz |first3=Dani |title=Knowledge, Belief, and God: New Insights in Religious Epistemology |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780198798705 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/knowledge-belief-and-god-9780198798705}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an important topic in the epistemology of religion is that of religious disagreement, and the issue of what it means for intelligent individuals of the same epistemic parity to disagree about religious issues. Religious disagreement has been seen as possibly posing first-order or higher-order problems for religious belief. A first order problem refers to whether that evidence directly applies to the truth of any religious proposition, while a higher order problem instead applies to ''whether one has rationally assessed'' the first order evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Pittard, John. Religious Disagreement, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/rel-disa/&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a first order problem is the [[Argument from nonbelief]]. Higher order discussions focus on whether religious disagreement with epistemic peers (someone whose epistemic ability is equal to our own) demands us to adopt a skeptical or agnostic stance or whether to reduce or change our religious beliefs.

===Faith and reason===
While religions resort to rational arguments to attempt to establish their views, they also claim that religious belief is at least partially to be accepted through [[faith]], confidence or trust in one's religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 91&lt;/ref&gt; There are different conceptions or models of faith, including:&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, John, "Faith", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/faith/.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] model of faith sees it as a feeling of trust, a psychological state
*The special knowledge model of faith as revealing specific religious truths (defended by [[Reformed epistemology]])
*The belief model of faith as the theoretical conviction that a certain religious claim is true.
*Faith as trusting, as making a [[Fiduciary|fiducial]] commitment such as trusting in God.
*The practical [[doxastic]] venture model where faith is seen as a commitment to believe in the trustworthiness of a religious truth or in God. In other words, to trust in God presupposes belief, thus faith must include elements of belief and trust.
*The non-doxastic venture model of faith as practical commitment ''without actual belief'' (defended by non-realists like [[J. L. Schellenberg]] and [[Don Cupitt]]). In this view, one need not believe in literal religious claims about reality to have religious faith. 
*The hope model, faith as hoping

There are also different positions on how faith relates to reason. One example is the belief that faith and reason are compatible and work together, which is the view of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and the orthodox view of Catholic [[natural theology]]. According to this view, reason establishes certain religious truths and faith (guided by reason) gives us access to truths about the divine which, according to Aquinas, "exceed all the ability of human reason."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another position on is [[Fideism]], the view that faith is "in some sense independent of, if not outright adversarial toward, reason."&lt;ref&gt;Amesbury, Richard, "Fideism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Fall 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/fideism/.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was famously defended by the theologian [[Tertullian]] (c.160–230 CE). Modern philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[William James]], and [[Wittgenstein]] have been associated with this label. [[Kierkegaard]] in particular, argued for the necessity of the religious to take a non-rational [[leap of faith]] to bridge the gulf between man and God. Wittgensteinian fideism meanwhile sees religious [[language games]] as being incommensurate with scientific and metaphysical language games, and that they are autonomous and thus may only be judged on their own standards. The obvious criticism to this is that many religions clearly put forth metaphysical claims.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several contemporary [[New Atheist]] writers which are hostile to religion hold a related view which says that religious claims and scientific claims are opposed to each other, and that therefore religions are false.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant theologian [[Karl Barth]] (1886–1968) argued that religious believers have no need to prove their beliefs through reason and thus rejected the project of [[natural theology]]. According to Barth, human reason is corrupt and God is utterly different from his creatures, thus we can only rely on God's own revelation for religious knowledge. Barth's view has been termed [[Neo-orthodoxy]]. &lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[D.Z. Phillips]] argues that God is not intelligible through reason or evidence because God is not an empirical object or a 'being among beings'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Brian. An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion 2rd Edition, 1993, p. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Brian Davies points out, the problem with positions like Barth's is that they do not help us in deciding between [[Argument from inconsistent revelations|inconsistent and competing revelations]] of the different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{Main article|Relationship between religion and science}}

The topic of whether religious beliefs are compatible with [[science]] and in what way is also another important topic in the philosophy of religion as well as in [[theology]]. This field draws the historical study of their interactions and conflicts, such as the debates in the United States over the teaching of [[evolution]] and [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;De Cruz, Helen, "Religion and Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/religion-science/.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different models of interaction that have been discussed in the philosophical literature, including :&lt;ref&gt;De Cruz, Helen, "Religion and Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/religion-science/.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Conflict thesis]] which sees them as being in constant conflict, such as during the reception of the theory of [[evolution]] and the current debate over [[creationism]].
*Independence model, both have separate domains, or [[non-overlapping magisteria]]
*Dialogue model, some overlap between the fields, they remain separate but share some concepts and presuppositions
*Integration or unification model includes projects like [[natural theology]] and [[process theology]]

The field also draws the scientific study of religion, particularly by psychologists and sociologists as well as cognitive scientists. Various theories about religion have arisen from these various disciplines. One example is the various [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolutionary theories of religion]] which see the phenomenon as either adaptive or a by-product. Another can be seen in the various theories put forth by the [[Cognitive science of religion]].

===Religious experience===
{{See also|Religious experience|Phenomenology of religion}}
[[File:William_James_b1842c.jpg|thumb|225px|[[William James]] wrote [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]].]]
Closely tied to the issues of knowledge and belief is the question of how to interpret [[religious experiences]] vis-à-vis their potential for providing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious experiences have been recorded throughout all cultures and are widely diverse. These personal experiences tend to be highly important to the individuals who undergo them.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions about religious experiences can be said to be informed in part by the question: "what sort of information about what there is might religious experience provide, and how could one tell?"&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One could interpret these experiences either veridically, neutrally or as delusions. Both monotheistic and non-monotheistic religious thinkers and mystics have appealed to religious experiences as evidence for their claims about ultimate reality. Philosophers such as [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[William Alston]] have compared religious experiences to everyday perceptions, that is, both are [[noesis|noetic]] and have a perceptual object, and thus religious experiences could logically be veridical unless we have a good reason to disbelieve them.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]] common objections against the veridical force of religious experiences include the fact that experience is frequently deceptive and that people who claim an experience of a god may be "mistakenly identifying an object of their experience", or be insane or hallucinating.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues that we cannot deduce from the fact that our experiences are ''sometimes'' mistaken, hallucinations or distorted to the conclusion that all religious experiences are mistaken etc. Indeed, a drunken or hallucinating person could still perceive things correctly, therefore these objections cannot be said to ''necessarily'' disprove all religious experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to C. B. Martin, "there are no tests agreed upon to establish genuine experience of God and distinguish it decisively from the ungenuine", and therefore all that religious experiences can establish is the reality of these psychological states.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Naturalistic explanations for religious experiences are often seen as undermining their epistemic value. Explanations such as the [[Death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[suggestion]], [[Regression (psychology)|infantile regression]], [[sexual frustration]], neurological anomalies ("it's all in the head") as well as the socio-political power that having such experiences might grant to a mystic have been put forward.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; A hostile position was famously taken by [[Bertrand Russell]] who have compared the veridical value of religious experiences to the [[hallucinations]] of a drunk person: "From a scientific point of view, we can make no distinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks much and sees snakes. Each is in an abnormal physical condition, and therefore has abnormal perceptions."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell "Mysticism" From Religion and Science (Oxford University Press, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[William L. Rowe]] notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hidden assumption in Russell's argument is that bodily and mental states that interfere with reliable perceptions of the physical world also interfere with reliable perceptions of a spiritual world beyond the physical, if there is such a spiritual world to be perceived. Perhaps this assumption is reasonable, but it certainly is not obviously true.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, as argued by [[C.D. Broad]], "one might need to be slightly 'cracked'" or at least appear to be mentally and physically abnormal in order to perceive the supranormal spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 85&lt;/ref&gt; 

William James meanwhile takes a middle course between accepting mystical experiences as veridical or seeing them as delusional. He argues that for the individual who experiences them, they are authoritative and they break down the authority of the rational mind. Not only that, but according to James, the mystic is justified in this. But when it comes to the non-mystic, the outside observer, they have no reason to regard them as either veridical nor delusive.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study of religious experiences from the perspective of the field of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has also been a feature of the philosophy of religion. Key thinkers in this field include [[William Brede Kristensen]] and [[Gerard van der Leeuw]].

====Types====
[[File:Avatars of Vishnu.jpg|thumb|225px|Depiction of the [[theophany]] scene in the [[Bhagavadgita]] wherein [[Krishna]] reveals his universal form to [[Arjuna]].]]
Just like there are different religions, there are different forms of religious experience. One could have "subject/content" experiences (such as a euphoric meditative state) and "subject/consciousness/object" experiences (such as the perception of having seen a god, i.e. [[theophany]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 40, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences of [[theophany]] are described in ancient Mediterranean religious works and myths and include the story of [[Semele]] who died due to her seeing [[Zeus]] and the Biblical story of the [[Burning bush]]. Indian texts like the [[Bhagavadgita|Bhagavad Gita]] also contain theophanic events. The diversity (sometimes to the point of contradiction) of religious experiences has also been used as an argument against their veridical nature, and as evidence that they are a purely subjective psychological phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western thought, religious experience (mainly a theistic one) has been described by the likes of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[William James]]. According to Schleiermacher, the distinguishing feature of a religious experience is that "one is overcome by the feeling of absolute dependence."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, 2007, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Otto meanwhile, argued that while this was an important element, the most basic feature of religious experiences is that it is ''[[numinous]]''. He described this as "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self" as well as having the qualities of being a mystery, terrifying and fascinating.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). Alles, Gregory D., ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Autobiographical and Social Essays'']. Berlin: [[Walter de Gruyter]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22ganz+andere%22%22ganz+an%22%22ders+%5bwholly+other%5d%22 30]. {{ISBN|978-3-110-14519-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rowe meanwhile defined a religious experience as "an experience in which one senses the immediate presence of the divine."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pg. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rowe, religious experiences can be divided in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 73, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

*Religious experiences in which one senses the presence of the divine as being distinct from oneself.
*Mystical experiences in which one senses one's own union with a divine presence.
**The extrovertive way looks outward through the senses into the world around us and finds the divine reality there.
**The introvertive way turns inward and finds the divine reality in the deepest part of the self.

Non-monotheistic religions meanwhile also report different experiences from theophany, such as [[non-dual]] experiences of oneness and deeply focused meditative states (termed [[Samadhi]] in Indian religion) as well as experiences of final enlightenment or liberation ([[moksha]], [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]], [[kevala]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] respectively).

Another typology, offered by Chad Meister, differentiates between three major experiences:&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 171-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Regenerative experiences, in which an individual feels reborn, transformed or changed radically, usually resulting in religious conversion.
*Charismatic experiences, in which special gifts, abilities, or blessings are manifested (such as healing, visions, etc.)
*[[Mystical experiences]], which can be described using William James qualifications as being: [[Ineffable]], [[Noesis|Noetic]], transient and passive.

====Perennialism vs Constructivism====
Another debate on this topic is whether all religious cultures share common core mystical experiences ([[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]]) or whether these experiences are in some way socially and culturally constructed ([[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]] or [[Contextualism]]). According to [[Walter Stace]] all cultures share mystical experiences of oneness with the external world, as well as introverted "Pure Conscious Events" which is empty of all concepts, thoughts, qualities, etc. except pure consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Ninian Smart]] argued that monistic experiences were universal. Perennialists tend to distinguish between the experience itself, and its post experience interpretation to make sense of the different views in world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some constructivists like [[Steven T. Katz]] meanwhile have argued against the common core thesis, and for either the view that every mystical experience contains at least some concepts (soft constructivism) or that they are strongly shaped and determined by one's religious ideas and culture (hard constructivism).&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the conceptual scheme of any mystic strongly shapes their experiences and because mystics from different religions have very different schemas, there cannot be any universal mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and ethics===
[[File:Sacrifice of Isaac-Caravaggio (Uffizi).jpg|thumb|''Sacrifice of Isaac'', by [[Caravaggio]].]]
All religions argue for certain values and ideas of the moral Good. Non-monotheistic Indian traditions like Buddhism and [[Advaita Vedanta]] find the highest Good in [[nirvana]] or [[moksha]] which leads to release from suffering and the [[Samsara|rounds of rebirth]] and morality is a means to achieve this, while for monotheistic traditions, God is the source or ground of all morality and heaven in the highest human good. The world religions also offer different conceptions of the source of [[evil]] and [[suffering]] in the world, that is, what is wrong with human life and how to solve and free ourselves from these dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 180&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for Christianity, [[Sin in Christianity|sin]] is the source of human problems, while for Buddhism, it is [[Taṇhā|craving]] and [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]]. 

A general question which philosophy of religion asks is what is the relationship, if any, between morality and religion. Brian Davies outlines four possible theses:&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Morality somehow requires religion. One example of this view is [[Kant]]'s idea that morality should lead us to believe in a moral law, and thus to believe in an upholder of that law, that is, God.
*Morality is somehow included in religion, "The basic idea here is that being moral is part of what being religious means."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Morality is pointless without religion, for one would have no reason to be moral without it.
*Morality and religion are opposed to each other. In this view, belief in a God would mean one would do whatever that God commands, even if it goes against morality. The view that religion and morality are often opposed has been espoused by atheists like [[Lucretius]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] as well as by theologians like [[Kierkegaard]] who argued for a '[[Fear_and_Trembling#Teleological_Suspension_of_the_Ethical|teleological suspension of the ethical]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotheistic religions who seek to explain morality and its relationship to God must deal with what is termed the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], famously stated in the [[Platonic dialogue]] "[[Euthyphro]]" as: "Is the [[Piety|pious]] (τὸ ὅσιον, i.e. what is morally good) loved by the [[Deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" Those who hold that what is moral is so ''because'' it is what God commands are defending a version of the [[Divine command theory]].

Another important topic which is widely discussed in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] monotheistic religious philosophy is the problem of human [[Free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. God's omniscience could presumably include perfect knowledge of the future, leading to [[Theological determinism]] and thus possibly contradicting with human free will.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Lockyer Jordan; Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate; Neil Lockyer; Edwin Tate (25 June 2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC ''Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition'']. Nelson Thornes. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-0-7487-8078-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different positions on this including [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] (free will is true) and [[Predestination]].

===Miracles===
{{Main article|Miracle}}
Belief in [[miracles]] and [[supernatural]] events or occurrences is common among world religions. A miracle is an event which cannot be explained by rational or scientific means. The [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and the [[Miracles of Muhammad]] are examples of miracles claimed by religions.

[[Skepticism]] towards the supernatural can be found in early philosophical traditions like the Indian [[Carvaka]] school and Greco-Roman philosophers like [[Lucretius]]. [[David Hume]], who defined a miracle as "a violation of the laws of nature", famously argued against miracles in [[Of Miracles]], Section X of ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748). For Hume, the probability that a miracle hasn't occurred is always greater than the probability that it has because "as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws [of nature], the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined" (''Enquiry''. X. p. 173).[http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Hume/HumeMiracles.pdf] Hume doesn't argue that a miracle is impossible, only that it is unreasonable to believe in any testimony of a miracle's occurrence, for evidence for the regularity of natural laws is much stronger than human testimony (which is often in error).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 142&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rowe, there are two weaknesses with Hume's argument. First, there could be other forms of indirect evidence for the occurrence of a miracle that does not include testimony of someone's direct experience of it. Secondly, Rowe argues that Hume overestimates "the weight that should be given to past experience in support of some principle thought to be a law of nature." For it is a common occurrence that currently accepted ideas of natural laws are revised due to an observed exception but Hume's argument would lead one to conclude that these exceptions do not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 143&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe adds that "It remains true, however, that a reasonable person will require quite strong evidence before believing that a law of nature has been violated. It is easy to believe the person who claimed to see water run downhill, but quite difficult to believe that someone saw water run uphill."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of a miracle is possible however, which is termed the [[Epistemic theory of miracles]] and was argued for by [[Spinoza]] and [[St. Augustine]]. This view rejects that a miracle is a transgression of natural laws, but is simply a transgression of our current ''understanding'' of natural law. In the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'', [[Spinoza]] writes: "miracles are only intelligible as in relation to human opinions, and merely mean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained by a reference to any ordinary occurrence, either by us, or at any rate, by the writer and narrator of the miracle" (''Tractatus'' p. 84). Similarly, R.F. Holland has defined miracle in a naturalistic way in a widely cited paper. For Holland, a miracle need only be an extraordinary and beneficial coincidence interpreted religiously.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, R.F. (1965), "The Miraculous," ''American Philosophical Quarterly ''2:43-51&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Davies notes that even if we can establish that a miracle has occurred, it is hard to see what this is supposed to prove. For it is possible that they arise due to agencies which are unusual and powerful, but not divine.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 1993, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afterlife===
{{Main article|Afterlife}}
World Religions put forth various theories which affirm [[life after death]] and different kinds of postmortem existence. This is often tied to belief in an immortal individual [[soul]] or self ([[Sanskrit]]: [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]) separate from the body which survives death, as defended by [[Plato]], [[Descartes]], Monotheistic religions like Christianity and many [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]]. This view is also a position on the [[mind body problem]], mainly, [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; This view then must show not only that dualism is true and that souls exist, but also that souls survive death. As [[Kant]] famously argued, the mere existence of a soul does not prove its immortality, for one could conceive that a soul, even if it is totally simple, could still fade away or lose its intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.H. Price]] is one modern philosopher who has speculated at length about what it would be like to be a disembodied soul after death. 

One major issue with soul beliefs is that since [[personhood]] is closely tied to our physical bodies, it seems difficult to make sense of a human being existing apart from their body. A further issue is with continuity of [[personal identity]], that is, it is not easy to account for the claim that the person that exists after bodily death is the ''same'' person that existed before.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 150-151&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bertrand Russell]] put forth the general scientific argument against the afterlife as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persons are part of the everyday world with which science is concerned, and the conditions which determine their existence are discoverable...we know that the brain is not immortal, and that the organized energy of a living body becomes, as it were, demobilized at death and therefore not available for collective action. All the evidence goes to show that what we regard as our mental life is bound up with brain structure and organized bodily energy. Therefore it is rational to suppose that mental life ceases when bodily life ceases. The argument is only one of probability, but it is as strong as those upon which most scientific conclusions are based.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contra Russell, [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] argues that we have no scientific proof that the mind is dependent on the body in this particular way. As Rowe notes, the fact that the mind depends on the functions of the body while one is alive is not necessarily proof that the mind will cease functioning after death just as a person trapped in a room while depending on the windows to see the outside world might continue to see even after the room ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] is one religion which, while affirming postmortem existence (through [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]), denies the existence of individual souls and instead affirms a deflationary view of personal identity, termed ''not-self'' ([[anatta]]).

While [[physicalism]] has generally been seen as hostile to notions of an afterlife, this need not be the case. Abrahamic religions like Christianity have traditionally held that life after death will include the element of bodily resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; One objection to this view is that it seems difficult to account for personal continuity, at best, a resurrected body is a replica of the resurrected person not the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; One response is the constitution view of persons, which says persons are constituted by their bodies and by a "first-person perspective", the capacity to think of oneself ''as oneself''. In this view, what is resurrected is that first person perspective, or both the person's body and that perspective. An objection to this view is that it seems difficult to differentiate one person's first person perspective from another person's without reference to temporal and spatial relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter van Inwagen]] meanwhile, offers the following theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps at the moment of each man's death, God removes his corpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or rots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He removes for "safekeeping" only the "core person"—the brain and central nervous system—or even some special part of it. These are details. (van Inwagen 1992: 245–46)&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view shows how some positions on the nature of the afterlife are closely tied to and sometimes completely depend upon theistic positions. This close connection between the two views was made by [[Kant]], who argued that one can infer an afterlife from belief in a just God who rewards persons for their adherence to moral law.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other discussions on the philosophy of the afterlife deal with phenomena such as [[near death experiences]], [[reincarnation research]], and other [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] events and hinge on whether naturalistic explanations for these phenomena is enough to explain them or not. Such discussions are associated with philosophers like [[William James]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[C.D. Broad]], and [[H.H. Price]].&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity and pluralism===
{{See also|Religious pluralism}}
[[Image:Yashovijaya.jpg|thumb|225px|Jain philosophers, such as [[Yashovijaya]], defended a theory of [[Anekantavada]] which could be interpreted as a form of inclusivism.]]
The issue of how one is to understand religious diversity and the plurality of religious views and beliefs has been a central concern of the philosophy of religion. 

There are various philosophical positions regarding how one is to make sense of religious diversity, including exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism, relativism, [[atheism]] or [[antireligion]] and [[agnosticism]]. 

[[Religious exclusivism]] is the claim that only one religion is true and that others are wrong. To say that a religion is exclusivistic can also mean that salvation or human freedom is only attainable by the followers of one's religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 181&lt;/ref&gt; This view tends to be the orthodox view of most monotheistic religions, such as Christianity and Islam, though liberal and modernist trends within them might differ. William L Rowe outlines two problems with this view. The first problem is that it is easy to see that if this is true, a large portion of humanity is excluded from salvation and it is hard to see how a loving god would desire this. The second problem is that once we become acquainted with the saintly figures and virtuous people in other religions, it can be difficult to see how we could say they are excluded from salvation just because they are not part of our religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 182&lt;/ref&gt; 

A different view is inclusivism, which is the idea that "one's own tradition alone has the whole truth but that this truth is nevertheless partially reflected in other traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. "On Conflicting Religious Truth-Claims," p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; An inclusivist might maintain that their religion is privileged, they can also hold that other religious adherents have fundamental truths and even that they will be saved or liberated.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain view of [[Anekantavada]] ('many-sidedness') has been interpreted by some as a tolerant view which is an inclusive acceptance of the partial truth value of non-Jain religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Barbato, Melanie. Jain Approaches to Plurality: Identity as Dialogue. BRILL 2017, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As Paul Dundas notes, the Jains ultimately held the thesis that Jainism is the final truth, while other religions only contain partial truths.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dundas (2004). Tara Sethia, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC ''Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism'']. Motilal Banarsidass. p. 123-125. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2036-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as Kristin Beise Kiblinger have also argued that some of the Buddhist traditions include inclusivist ideas and attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Beise Kiblinger. Buddhist Inclusivism: Attitudes Towards Religious Others&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern Western study of religion, the work of [[Ninian Smart]] has also been instrumental in representing a more diverse understanding of religion and religious pluralism. Smart's view is that there are genuine differences between religions.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pluralism is the view that all religions are equally valid responses to the divine and that they are all valid paths to personal transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 185&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is taken by [[John Hick]], who has developed a pluralistic view which synthesizes components of various religious traditions. Hick promotes an idea of a noumenal sacred reality which different religions provide us access to.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick defines his view as "the great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions of, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real or the Ultimate."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. "On Conflicting Religious Truth-Claims," p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; For Hick, all religions are true because they all allow us to encounter the divine reality, even if they have different deities and conceptions of it. Rowe notes that a similar idea is proposed by [[Paul Tillich]]'s concept of ''Being-itself''.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of [[Perennial philosophy|perennialism]] is that there is a single or core truth or experience which is shared by all religions even while they use different terms and language to express it. This view is espoused by the likes of [[Aldous Huxley]], the thinkers of the [[Traditionalist School]] as well as [[Neo-Vedanta]]. 

Yet another way of responding to the conflicting truth claims of religions is [[Relativism]]. [[Joseph Runzo]]., one of its most prominent defenders, has argued for ''henofideism'' which states that the truth of a religious worldview is relative to each community of adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus while religions have incompatible views, each one is individually valid as they emerge from individual experiences of a plurality of phenomenal divine realities.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to Runzo, this view does not reduce the incompatible ideas and experiences of different religions to mere interpretations of the Real and thus preserves their individual dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Another response to the diversity and plurality of religious beliefs and deities throughout human history is one of [[skepticism]] towards all of them (or even [[antireligion]]), seeing them as illusions or human creations which serve human psychological needs.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 184&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] was a famous proponent of this view, in various publications such as ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930). According to Freud, "Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires."&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

While one can be skeptical towards the claims of religion, one need not be hostile towards religion. [[Don Cupitt]] is one example of someone who, while disbelieving in the metaphysical and cosmological claims of his religion, holds that one can practice it with a "non-realist" perspective which sees religious claims as human inventions and myths to live by.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious language===
{{Main Article|Problem of religious language}}
The question of religious language and in what sense it can be said to be meaningful has been a central issue of the philosophy of religion since the work of the [[Vienna circle]], a group of philosophers who, influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], put forth the theory of [[Logical positivism]]. Their view was that religious language, such as any talk of God cannot be verified empirically and thus was ultimately meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Brian. An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion 2rd Edition, 1993, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This position has also been termed [[Theological noncognitivism]]. A similar view can be seen in [[David Hume]]'s [[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]], where he  famously wrote that any work which did not include either (1) abstract reasoning on quantity or number or (2) reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence was "nothing but sophistry and illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kvanvig|first=Jonathan L.|title=Faith and Humility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yv5cDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19|year=2018|publisher=OUP Oxford|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-253727-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, [[Antony Flew]], questioned the validity of religious statements because they do not seem to be [[falsifiable]], that is, religious claims do not seem to allow any counter evidence to count against them and thus they seem to be lacking in content.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; While such arguments were popular in the 1950s and 60s, the [[verification principle]] and [[falsifiability]] as a criterion for meaning are no longer as widely held.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; The main problem with verificationism is that it seems to be self refuting, for it is a claim which does not seem to be supported by its own criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]], when talking about God and religious truths, religious traditions tend to resort to [[metaphor]], negation and [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[via negativa]] has been defended by thinkers such as [[Maimonides]] who denied that positive statements about God were helpful and wrote: "you will come nearer to the knowledge and comprehension of God by the negative attributes."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches based on negation can be seen in the Hindu doctrine of [[Neti neti]] and the Buddhist philosophy of [[Madhyamaka]]. 

[[Wittgenstein]]'s theory of [[language games]] also shows how one can use analogical religious language to describe God or religious truths, even if the words one is using do not in this case refer to their everyday sense, i.e. when we say God is wise, we do not mean he is wise in the same sense that a person is wise, yet it can still make sense to talk in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Patrick Sherry notes, the fact that this sort of language may make sense does not mean that one is warranted in ascribing these terms to God, for there must be some connection between the relevant criteria we use in ascribing these terms to conventional objects or subjects and to God.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; As Chad Meister notes though, for Wittgenstein, a religion's [[language game]] need not reflect some literal picture of reality (as a [[picture theory of meaning]] would hold) but is useful simply because its ability to "reflect the practices and forms of life of the various religious adherents."&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Wittgenstein, philosophers of religion like [[Norman Malcolm]], [[B. R. Tilghman]], and [[D. Z. Phillips]] have argued that instead of seeing religious language as referring to some objective reality, we should instead see it as referring to ''forms of life''. This approach is generally termed non-realist.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this view, realists respond that non-realism subverts religious belief and the intelligibility of religious practice. It is hard to see for example, how one can pray to a God without believing that they really exist. Realists also argue that non-realism provides no normative way to choose between competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy of religion==
In ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion'', James Franklin Harris noted that
{{quote|
analytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'.... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have actually provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.&lt;ref name=harris2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=James Franklin |title=Analytic philosophy of religion |date=2002 |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-1402005305 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rx2Qf9ieFKYC}} (432 pages)  (volume 3 of Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, ISSN 1568-1556)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}
}}

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of philosophy of religion, largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists view) the subject as part of metaphysics and therefore meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;(a notable exception is the series of [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael B. Forest]]'s 1934-36 [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'' articles involving the Christian doctrine of creation and the rise of modern science).]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The collapse of [[logical positivism]] renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like [[William Alston]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], Alvin Plantinga, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]], Richard Swinburne, and Antony Flew not only to introduce new problems, but to re-open classical topics such as the nature of [[miracle]]s, theistic arguments, the problem of evil, (see [[existence of God]]) the rationality of belief in [[God]], concepts of the nature of God, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Michael et al. (2003). ''Reason and Religious Belief''&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the ''free will defense'' as a way to solve the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John L. (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God''&lt;/ref&gt; Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic philosophy of language, worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. (1987). ''The Virtue of Faith And Other Essays in Philosophical Theology''&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the [[reformed epistemology|reformed epistemologists]] like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], as well as his interpretation of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Creegan, Charles. (1989). ''Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard: Religion, Individuality and Philosophical Method''&lt;/ref&gt; Using first-hand remarks (which would later be published in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', ''Culture and Value'', and other works), philosophers such as [[Peter Winch]] and [[Norman Malcolm]] developed what has come to be known as ''contemplative philosophy'', a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the "Swansea tradition" and which includes Wittgensteinians such as [[Rush Rhees]], Peter Winch and D. Z. Phillips, among others. The name "contemplative philosophy" was first coined by D. Z. Phillips in ''Philosophy's Cool Place'', which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's "Culture and Value."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D. Z. (1999). ''Philosophy's Cool Place.'' Cornell University Press. The quote is from Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'' (2e): "My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them."&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was first labeled, "Wittgensteinian Fideism," by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D. Z. Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=fideism |title=Fideism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this interpretation, [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] and [[D.Z. Phillips]] became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Kai and D.Z. Phillips. (2005). ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Q'umarkaj''', ([[K'iche' language|K'iche']]: {{IPA|[qʔumarˈkah]}}) (sometimes rendered as '''Gumarkaaj''',  '''Gumarcaj''', '''Cumarcaj''' or '''Kumarcaaj''') is an archaeological site in the southwest of the [[El Quiché]] department of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; Q'umarkaj is also known as '''Utatlán''', the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] translation of the city's name. The name comes from [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] ''Q'umarkah'' "Place of old reeds".&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200" /&gt;

Q'umarkaj was one of the most powerful [[Maya civilization|Maya]] cities when the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] arrived in the region in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the capital of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]] Period.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.621-622.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish Conquest]], Q'umarkaj was a relatively new capital, with the capital of the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' kingdom]] having originally been situated at Jakawitz (identified with the archaeological site [[Chitinamit]]) and then at [[Q'umarkaj#Pismachi'|Pismachi']].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.622-623. Carmack 2001a, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; Q'umarkaj was founded during the reign of king Q'uq'umatz ("Feathered Serpent" in K'iche') in the early 15th century, immediately to the north of Pismachi'.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.623"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.623.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1470 the city was seriously weakened by a rebellion among the nobility that resulted in the loss of key allies of the K'iche'.

[[archaeology|Archaeologically]] and [[ethnohistory|ethnohistorically]], Q'umarkaj is the best known of the Late Postclassic [[Guatemalan Highlands|highland]] Maya capitals.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt; The earliest reference to the site in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] occurs in [[Hernán Cortés]]' letters from [[Mexico]]. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving [[Maya architecture|architecture]], which includes a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]], temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build the nearby town of [[Santa Cruz del Quiché]].

The major structures of Q'umarkaj were laid out around a plaza. They included the temple of [[Tohil]], a [[jaguar]] god who was patron of the city, the temple of [[Awilix]], the patron goddess of one of the noble houses, the temple of [[Jacawitz|Jakawitz]], a mountain deity who was also a noble patron and the temple of [[Q'uq'umatz]], the [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Feathered Serpent]], the patron of the royal house. The main ballcourt was placed between the palaces of two of the principal noble houses. Palaces, or ''nimja'', were spread throughout the city. There was also a platform that was used for gladiatorial sacrifice.

The area of Greater Q'umarkaj was divided into four major political division, one for each of the most important ruling lineages, and also encompassed a number of smaller satellites sites, including Chisalin, Pismachi', Atalaya and Pakaman.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.326" /&gt; The site core is open to the public and includes basic infrastructure, including a small site museum.&lt;ref&gt;Vásquez et al. 2009, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Q'umarkaj comes from the K'iche' ''Q'umqaraq'aj''.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt; While often translated as "place of old reeds" or "place of rotted cane",&lt;ref name="Sharer 2000, p.490"&gt;Sharer 2000, p.490.&lt;/ref&gt; the name Q'uma'rka'aaj translates more precisely as "rotted reed houses" (q'uma'r = "rotten";&lt;ref&gt;Christenson.&lt;/ref&gt; ka'aaj = "house or shack built of cane and reeds"). It was translated as ''Tecpan Utatlan'' by the Nahuatl-speaking [[Tlaxcala]]n allies of the Spanish [[conquistador]]s,&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Tecpan'' being added to distinguish the city as being a seat of rule, equivalent to the ''[[Tollan]]'' used in [[Mesoamerica]] in earlier times.&lt;ref name="Fox 1989, p.667"&gt;Fox 1989, p.667.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The ruins of the city are {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} to the west of the modern city of [[Santa Cruz del Quiché]].&lt;ref name= "Carmack 2001a, p.218"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.218.&lt;/ref&gt; Q'umarkaj completely occupies {{convert|120000|m2|sqft}} of an easily defended [[plateau]] surrounded by [[ravine]]s over {{convert|100|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.623"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.218" /&gt; The ravines are part of a drainage system feeding the [[Negro River (Guatemala)|Negro River]], which flows into the [[Chixoy River]] and eventually into the [[Usumacinta River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.218" /&gt; A natural causeway to the southeast of the site links the plateau with a wide plain to the east.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.218" /&gt;

Q'umarkaj is the largest in a group of five major sites tightly clustered in an area of {{convert|4|km2|sqmi}}, with the area between the sites showing signs of also having been heavily occupied.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.326"&gt;Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.326.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Q'umarkaj#Atalaya|Atalaya]] and [[Q'umarkaj#Pakaman|Pakaman]] lie to the east, [[Q'umarkaj#Pismachi'|Pismachi']] lies to the south and [[Q'umarkaj#Chisalin|Chisalin]] is to the north.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.326" /&gt;

==Inhabitants==
{{Maya civilization}}
In the Late Postclassic, the greater Q'umarkaj area is estimated to have had a population of around 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1989, p.673.n2.&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of Q'umarkaj were divided socially between the [[nobility]] and their [[vassal]]s.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt; The nobles were known as the ''[[ajaw]]'', while the vassals were known as the ''[[al k'ajol]]''.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717" /&gt; The nobility were the [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descendents of the founding warlords who appear to have entered as conquerors from the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf coast]] around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharer 2000, p.490"/&gt; The nobles were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery.&lt;ref name ="Coe 1999, p.189"&gt;Coe 1999, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vassals served as foot-soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by the nobility, although they could receive military titles as a result of their battlefield prowess.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt; The social divisions were deep seated and were equivalent to strictly observed [[caste]]s.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt; The merchants were a privileged class, although they had to make tributary payments to the nobility.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt; In addition to these classes, the population included rural labourers and artisans.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt; Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.189" /&gt;

There were twenty-four important lineages, or ''nimja'',&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717" /&gt; in Q'umarkaj, closely linked to the palaces in which the nobility attended to their duties;&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.190" /&gt; ''Nimja'' means "big house" in K'iche', after the palace complexes that the lineages occupied.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.329"&gt;Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.329.&lt;/ref&gt; Their duties included marriage negotiations and associated feasting and ceremonial lecturing.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.190" /&gt; These lineages were strongly patrilineal and were grouped into four larger, more powerful ''nimja''&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.329"/&gt; that chose the rulers of the city.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717" /&gt; At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Conquest]], the four ruling ''nimja'' were the Kaweq, the Nijaib, the Saqik and the Ajaw K'iche'.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717" /&gt; The Kaweq and the Nijaib included nine principal lineages each, the Ajaw K'iche' included four and the Saqik had two.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.329"/&gt; As well as choosing the king and king elect, the ruling Kaweq dynasty also had a lineage that produced the powerful priests of [[Gukumatz|Q'uq'umatz]], who may have served as stewards of the city.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.367"/&gt;

The K'iche' kingdom was ruled by a king, a king-elect and two captains,&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.190"&gt;Coe 1999, p.190.&lt;/ref&gt; a four-way joint rule embodied in four leaders, one from each of the four most important lineages in the city of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.190" /&gt; This form of rule was also known among the Maya of [[Yucatan]].&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.190" /&gt; The ruling lineage was the Kaweq ("Rain") dynasty, that chose both the king and the king-elect.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p.190. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717.&lt;/ref&gt; The king was known as the ''ajpop'', "He of the Mat".&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.623"/&gt; The king-elect bore the title of ''ajpop k'amha'' and assisted the king until he became king himself.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nijaib and the Saqik noble houses chose the ''q'alel'' (supreme judge) and the Ajaw K'iche' chose the ''atzij winaq'' (speaker).&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.717" /&gt;

==History==
{{main article|K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj}}

Ceramic remains from the site include pieces that date as far back as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic Period]] but the majority of finds date to the Late Postclassic and the height of the K'iche' kingdom.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.201"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was founded by king Q'uq'umatz around 1400 for its defensive position,&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.201" /&gt; however there is some disagreement as to whether he is a historical or a mythological figure.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001b, p.178"&gt;Carmack 2001b, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; Q'uq'umatz is K'iche for feathered serpent, and feathered serpent is used as a title in other parts of [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001b, p.178" /&gt;  It is probable that Q'uq'umatz was really the title of another ''ajpop'' mentioned in the sources, Kotuja', and was actually the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001b, pp.180-1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Título de los Señores de Totonicapán'', an early Colonial era K'iche' document, he is listed as Q'uq'umatz Kotuja'.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001b, p.181"&gt;Carmack 2001b, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same title, his father is listed as Kotuja' Q'uq'umatz, and there is confusion in the K'iche' documents as to whether they were one and the same, or father and son with very similar names.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001b, p.181" /&gt;

K'otuja Q'uq'umatz married Xlem, daughter of the king of the [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujils]] of Malaj, a precolumbian settlement near modern-day [[San Lucas Tolimán]], on the shores of [[Lago de Atitlán|Lake Atitlán]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.159.&lt;/ref&gt; Great magical powers were attributed to Q'uq'umatz and he was said to be able to transform himself into a snake, an eagle, a jaguar and blood.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.161"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.161.&lt;/ref&gt; Q'uq'umatz had several children, one of whom (K'iq'ab) became king after him.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001b, p.181" /&gt; Q'uq'umatz was killed in battle against the K'oja Maya.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.161" /&gt;

Q'uq'umatz greatly expanded the K'iche' kingdom, first from Pismachi' and later from Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.158.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the K'iche's were closely allied with the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikels]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; Q'uq'umatz sent his daughter to marry the lord of the [[K'oja]], a Maya people based in the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes|Cuchumatan mountains]], somewhere between [[Sacapulas]] and [[Huehuetenango]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.160-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of marrying her and submitting to the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance, Tekum Sik'om, the K'oja king, killed the offered bride.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.161" /&gt; This act initiated a war between the K'iche'-Kaqchikel of Q'umarkaj and the K'oja.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.161" /&gt; Q'uq'umatz died in the resulting battle against the K'oja.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.161" /&gt;

With the death of his father in battle against the K'oja, his son and heir K'iq'ab swore vengeance, and two years later he led the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance against his enemies, together with the ''Ajpop K'amha'' (king-elect).&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.162"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; The K'iche'-led army entered K'oja at first light, killed Tekum Sik'om and captured his son.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.162" /&gt; K'iq'ab recovered the [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|bones]] of his father and returned to Q'umarkaj with many prisoners and all the [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] and [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|metal]] that the K'oja possessed, after conquering various settlements in the Sacapulas area, and the [[Mam people]] near [[Zaculeu]].&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.162" /&gt;

K'iq'ab was said to have had magical powers like his father.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.161"/&gt; K'iq'ab was a particularly warlike king and during his reign he greatly expanded the kingdom to include [[Rabinal]], [[Cobán]] and [[Quetzaltenango]], and extended as far west as the Okos River, near the modern border between the [[Chiapas]] coast of Mexico and Guatemalan Pacific coast.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.162" /&gt;  With Kaqchikel help, the eastern frontier of the kingdom was pushed as far as the [[Motagua River]] and south as far as [[Escuintla]].&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.163"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also suffered a humiliating rebellion that eventually resulted in the loss of his key [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] allies.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.163-165.&lt;/ref&gt; K'iq'ab died around 1475.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.165"/&gt;

===Internal strife===
In 1470 a rebellion shook Q'umarkaj during a great celebration that saw a large gathering that included representatives of all the most important highland peoples.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.163" /&gt; Two sons of K'iq'ab together with some of his vassals rebelled against their king, killing many high ranking lords, Kaqchikel warriors and members of the Kaweq lineage.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.164"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels tried to kill K'iq'ab himself but he was defended by sons loyal to him in Pakaman, on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.164" /&gt; As a result of the rebellion, K'iq'ab was forced to make concessions to the rebelling K'iche' lords.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.165"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; The newly empowered K'iche' lords turned against their Kaqchikel allies, who were forced to flee Q'umarkaj and found their own capital at [[Iximche]].&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.165" /&gt;

After the death of king K'iq'ab in 1475 the K'iche' were engaged in warfare against both the Tz'utujils and the Kaqchikels, perhaps in an attempt to recover the former power of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.166" /&gt; A short time after the death of K'iq'ab, under the leadership of Tepepul, Q'umarkaj attacked Iximche, the capital of the Kaqchikels, and suffered a disastrous defeat that greatly weakened the K'iche'.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.166"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; After this Q'umarkaj never again directly challenged the Kaqchikels of Iximche.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.166" /&gt; The next leader after Tepepul was Tekum, who was a son of K'iq'ab. who led the K'iche's against the Tz'utujils and was killed in battle near the south shore of Lake Atitlan.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.167"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the history of Q'umarkaj, the Nijaib appear to have been challenging the ruling Kaweq house for supremacy.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.331"&gt;Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest and destruction===
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|right|Pedro de Alvarado, the [[conquistador]] who razed Q'umarkaj.]]
In March 1524, the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] entered Q'umarkaj when invited by the remaining lords of the K'iche', after he defeated the K'iche' army in the [[Quetzaltenango]] valley, in a battle that had resulted in the death of [[Tecun Uman]], one of the four lords of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765. Recinos 1952, 1986, pp.68, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarado feared that a trap had been laid for him by the K'iche' lords but entered the city anyway.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765"/&gt; However, he encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1952, 1986, p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing the great number of K'iche' warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q'umarkaj, he invited the highest lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the ''ajpop'') and Beleheb-Tzy (the ''ajpop k'amha'') to visit him in his camp.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1952, 1986, p.75. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765.&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp.&lt;ref name="Recinos 1952, 1986, p.75"&gt;Recinos 1952, 1986, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; The K'iche' warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers.&lt;ref name="Recinos 1952, 1986, p.75" /&gt; At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, he then proceeded to burn the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1952, 1986, pp.74-5. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The site was extensively documented in the colonial era. [[Francisco Ximénez]], who first revealed the K'iche' epic [[Popul Vuh]] to the world, visited Q'umarkaj in the final years of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.356-357.&lt;/ref&gt; Miguel Rivera y Maestre wrote a report of the site for the government of Guatemala in 1834.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.201" /&gt; In 1840 [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] paid a brief visit to the site after reading Rivera y Maestre's report, and Catherwood mapped the site and produced a drawing of the Temple of Tohil.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.201" /&gt; In 1865, the French architect Cesar Daly mapped the five clustered sites that include Q'umarkaj, although the maps have since been lost.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.326" /&gt; A more detailed survey of the site was made by [[Alfred P. Maudslay]] in 1887, being published between 1889 and 1902.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.201" /&gt; Archeological excavations were carried out in the 1950s and the 1970s.

Jorge F. Guillemín cleared the ruins in 1956, mapped the surviving structures, as well as mapping the central K'iche' region and Q'umarkaj's satellite sites.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.326" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.202"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.202.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State University of New York at Albany]] spent three seasons excavating the ruins in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.202"/&gt; Kenneth Brown of the [[University of Houston]] started major excavations at Q'umarkaj in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Proyecto Etnoarqueológico Q’um’arkaj ("Q'umarkaj Ethnoarchaeological Project") has worked to reconstruct the history and socio-political organisation of the city through archaeological studies combined with ethnohistorical investigations.&lt;ref name="Putzeys&amp;C08p2"&gt;Putzeys et al 2008, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological site is still used for traditional Maya ceremonies, and is one of the most popular destinations in Guatemala for this kind of ritual activity, especially at the [[solstice]]s and for the New Year.&lt;ref name="Putzeys&amp;C08p7"&gt;Putzeys et al 2008, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site can be visited, although little restoration work has been done to it. Various temple pyramids, the remains of palaces (mostly reduced to mounds of rubble) and a court for playing the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] can be seen in the site core. In the Greater Q'umarkaj area there were four [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]]s, one in each of the four major political divisions of the city, testifying to the central role of the ballgame ritual in the sociopolitical organisation of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1991, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut stone originally facing the buildings was taken to build the new buildings of Santa Cruz del Quiché;&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200" /&gt; the ruins were still being mined for construction material through the late 19th century, doing extensive damage to the remains of the old buildings.

The major structures of Q'umarkaj were laid out around a plaza, which had a plaster floor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Coe 1999, p.190. Kelly 1996, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; The K'iche' colonnaded buildings at Q'umarkaj appear to indicate ties with the distant city of [[Mayapan]] in the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.625.&lt;/ref&gt; The parallels also include skull imagery, effigy figure censers, squatting figures and the generous application of stucco.&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath &amp; Peraza Lope 2003, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; A combined aerial and surface analysis of the ruins has revealed a strongly patterned arrangement with repeating combinations of pyramids, long structures and multipatio residential complexes.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.330"&gt;Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.330.&lt;/ref&gt; These repeating combinations appear to be linked to the different '' nimja'' lineages.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.330" /&gt; In addition there appears to be a larger division of the site, separating it into northwestern and southwestern halves.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.329"/&gt; The dividing line runs from the west along a street to the central plaza, crosses the ballcourt and the plaza, then separates the northern and eastern branches of the site up to the rim of the canyon on the eastern side.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, pp.329-330.&lt;/ref&gt; This larger site division places six ''nimja'' complexes in the northern half and six in the south, although this larger division may not have been strictly along lineage lines, since Kaweq-linked structures are found in both halves of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, pp.330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaweq and their allies dominated most of the site, with the Nijaib occupying the eastern portion, possibly as far as the satellite site of Atalaya.&lt;ref name="Carmack &amp; Weeks 1981, p.331"/&gt;

===Temple of Tohil===
[[Image:Utatlan3.jpg|left|thumb|The remains of the temple of Tohil at Q'umarkaj.]]
The plaza was dominated by the Temple of [[Tohil]], who was a [[jaguar]] deity associated with the sun and with rain and was the patron deity of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p.190. Carmack 2001a, p.358.&lt;/ref&gt; This temple lies on the western side of the main plaza.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200" /&gt; The standing remains are reduced to the rubble and mud core of the temple, with an opening where modern Maya still make offerings.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200" /&gt; As late as the middle of the 19th century, this temple was much better preserved and was described by John Lloyd Stephens.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.355.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the temple consisted of a steep pyramid with stairways on three sides, all except the west, and a temple building was on the summit.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200" /&gt; The base was {{convert|33|ft|m}} on each side and the exterior of the building was covered in painted stucco.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.355, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherwood's copy of Rivera y Maestre's drawing of the temple showed the body of the pyramid divided into four [[talud-tablero]] terraces and 19 steps in each of the three stairways, while Rivera y Maestra's drawing depicts 24 steps and six terraces.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.356"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.356.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Ximénez]], writing at the end of the 17th century, described the temple as the tallest building in Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.356" /&gt; The identity of the temple as that of Tohil was known during the lifetime of Ximénez, when 30 steps were visible in each stairway and the remains of the pillars that supported the temple roof were still standing.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.357.&lt;/ref&gt; The building style of the Temple of Tohil is similar to that of the most important temples of Mayapan and [[Chichen Itza]], far to the north in the Yucatan Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.358.&lt;/ref&gt; The pillars possibly once supported an elaborate masonry roof.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.361"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.361.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple of Tohil was used for human sacrifice, the bodies of the sacrificial victims were probably hurled down the front stairway before being decapitated and the heads places on a [[Tzompantli|skull rack]].&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.360"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt; This ''tzumpan'' was likely to have been located immediately to the southeast of the temple, in an area that is now buried under rubble fallen from the temple itself.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.374"/&gt;

An image of a jaguar was found painted onto the stucco of the temple, an animal that was a [[nahual]] of the ruling Kaweq dynasty.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.360" /&gt;

===Temple of Awilix===
[[File:Temple of Awilix.jpg|thumb|right|The Temple of Awilix.]]
The Temple of [[Awilix]] is on the east side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200"/&gt; Awilix was the patron goddess of the Nijaib lineage and is identified with Ixbalanque, one of the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero Twins]] from the Popul Vuh.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.362. Fox &amp; Cook 1996, p.813.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a drawing made by Rivera y Maestre, the temple of Awilix was not as tall as the temple of Tohil.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.362"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.362.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure was apparently the second most important temple in Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.362" /&gt; Originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure on the east side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.200. Carmack 2001a, p.361.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide stairway climbed the west side of the temple, it was flanked on the lower level by two large talud-tablero panels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The exterior stonework of the building has been completely stripped away.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.361" /&gt; The temple is similar in form to a temple mound on the west side of the first plaza in [[Iximche]], the postclassic capital of the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.361" /&gt; There were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that the temple had been repaired various times prior to the Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.361-362.&lt;/ref&gt; The floor under the third phase of construction had been painted dark green.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.362" /&gt; Archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath the first building phase.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.362" /&gt;

===Temple of Jakawitz===
A large mound on the south side of the plaza was once the Temple of [[Jacawitz|Jakawitz]], a deity of the mountains and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.200. Carmack 2001a, pp.367, 369.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, leaving only a rubble and mud core.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.367"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.367.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace on the southern side and a long building on the east.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.367" /&gt; The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.367" /&gt; Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple of Q'uq'umatz===
The temple of [[Gukumatz|Q'uq'umatz]] was a circular temple of the [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|feathered serpent]], and a palace in honour of the Kawek lineage, the ruling dynasty of the city.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The temple is now only a circular impression in the surface of the main plaza.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.364"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.364.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located directly between the temples of Tohil and Awilix, slightly north of the central axis of the Tohil temple and slightly south of the axis of the Awilix temple.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.364" /&gt; From the traces left in the plaza it is evident that the temple consisted of a circular wall measuring {{convert|6|m|ft}} across, running around a circular platform, with a {{convert|1|m|ft|adj=on}} wide circular passage between the two.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.364" /&gt; The whole structure probably once supported a roof and there were small stone platforms on the east and west sides of the temple, each about {{convert|1|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.364" /&gt;

The priests of Q'uq'umatz were drawn from an important lineage among the ruling Kaweq dynasty and this was likely to have been a source of power and prestige for the Kaweq.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.366.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple of Q'uq'umatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after the Spanish Conquest since it is not mentioned by any of the Colonial era visitors, and early drawings of the site show only vegetation where the temple once stood.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.364"/&gt; The tradition of circular temples dedicated to the Feathered Serpent deity was an ancient one in the Mesoamerican cultural region.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.365.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballcourt===
[[Image:Utatlan2.jpg|thumb|right|The central ballcourt of Q'umarkaj.]]
The Ballcourt lies close to, and just south of, the temple of Tohil, on the southwest side of the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.200. Fox 1991, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballcourt still retains its distinctive shape, although the structures have been robbed of their facing.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.370.&lt;/ref&gt; The visible ballcourt was one of four in Q'umarkaj and was administered by the Popol Winaq branch of the ruling Kaweq lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1991, p.213. Carmack 2001a, p.371.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballcourt is aligned east-west with a length of {{convert|40|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1991, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballcourt was located exactly between the palaces of the Kaweq and the Ajaw K'iche', which were located {{convert|15|m|ft}} to the north and the south of the ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Fox 1991, p.217"&gt;Fox 1991, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, the north range of the ballcourt appears to have been associated with the Kaweq lineage and the south range with the Ajaw K'iche' lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1991, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palaces===
A small palace belonging to the Nijaib lineage was located directly behind the temple of Awilix.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.363.&lt;/ref&gt; These lineage houses, ''nimja'', are found throughout the city of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Fox 1991, p.217"/&gt; As with the other buildings of the site, the outer stonework and plastering has been lost.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.375.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nimja'' are long rectangular structures located beside the plazas upon {{convert|1|m|ft|adj=on}} high platforms.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375" /&gt; Upon these platforms, the palaces generally consisted of two levels, a lower roofed antechamber with a second, higher level supporting the main rooms of the structure.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375" /&gt; Some of the larger palaces had several stairways giving access to the antechamber, and multiple doors and pillars opening into the rooms of main building.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375" /&gt;

Another ''nimja'' palace structure lies to the southeast of the main plaza.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375" /&gt; Excavations in 1972 uncovered a simple superstructure consisting of a room with a bench at the back and an altar in the middle.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375" /&gt; Six funerary urns were found in the remains of the palace, one of which was found near the altar and contained rich offerings that included a gold necklace.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.375-376.&lt;/ref&gt; There were traces of hearths at each extreme of the main chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.376.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other structures===
In the central plaza there are traces of thirteen small platforms that once stood there.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.372.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these, each measuring {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} wide, were located to the north of the Temple of K'ucumatz.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.373.&lt;/ref&gt; A line of five similar structures was also located to the south of the same temple, with an alternating pattern of a circular platform, then a square platform, followed by another circular platform and so on.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373" /&gt; There was a sixth small platform nearby, which was square in shape.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373" /&gt; These platforms appear to have served as altars.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373" /&gt;

To the south of the line of platforms are the traces of two larger square platforms. One of these measured {{convert|10|m|ft}} on each side, the other measured {{convert|8|m|ft}} per side.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373" /&gt; A circular impression lies between these two platforms, which is all that remains of another platform, of a different type, that must have stood there.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373" /&gt; The larger platforms may also have served as auxiliary altars to those of the principle temples.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.374"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.374.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large square platform in the northwest section of the central plaza, measuring {{convert|18|m|ft}} on each side, it is located immediately behind the Temple of Tohil and stands {{convert|2|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373" /&gt; Although, typically for the site, the outer stonework has been robbed, there are the remains of six layers of plaster on the floor of the platform's upper surface.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.373" /&gt; This platform has been identified as the ''sokib'al'', the platform of gladiators described in early sources.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.374" /&gt; This platform seems to have been closely linked to the military lineages of the Kaweq, such as the Nima Rajpop Achij.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375" /&gt;

Two large platforms lie in the southeastern section of the main plaza, their use remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.375" /&gt;

===Caves===
[[Image:View out of the tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Smoke filled tunnel under the ruins of Q'umarkaj.]]
In addition, a series of three caves tunnel straight into the limestone immediately to the north of the site.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, p.200" /&gt;  The first and most extensive cave is about 30 meters long with various altars carved into the rock inside. Some modern Quiché, although officially [[Roman Catholic]], still burn [[candle]]s and [[incense]] at the ruined temples.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.218-219.&lt;/ref&gt; The caves may have represented ''Tulán Zuyuá'', the "Place of Seven Caves" described in the K'iche' origin legend recounted in the Popul Vuh.&lt;ref name="Fox 1989, p.667"/&gt;

==Satellite sites==
A number of other archaeological sites are included within the area of Greater Q'umarkaj (usually referred to as Greater Utatlan).

===Chisalin===
Chisalin is alson known by the alternative names of Pilokab' and Muqwitz Pilokab'.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.221"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.221.&lt;/ref&gt; Chisalin is located a few hundred meters north of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.221" /&gt; The ruins are located on a narrow strip of land with an area of {{convert|110000|sqm|sqft}} surrounded by steep ravines.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; On the northeast side the strip is connected to a plateau that forms a part of the plain to the east of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.221" /&gt; Chisalin has a small, heavily eroded plaza, and the whole strip is occupied by ruins, with the exception of a small section.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.222"/&gt;

===Pismachi'===
Pismachi' (sometimes referred to as Ismachi') occupies a small plateau {{convert|600|m|yd}} south of the site core and is surrounded by steep ravines.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.219"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt; The plateau is separated from the Q'umarkaj plateau by the ravine containing the Ismachi' river.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.219-220.&lt;/ref&gt; Pismachi' was the K'iche' capital before it was moved to nearby Q'umarkaj, and was probably founded early in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; Its location was never forgotten by the local K'iche's although it was from time to time lost by outside investigators.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.219" /&gt; French missionary [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] located Pismachi' in the middle of the 19th century, it was then lost until it was relocated in 1956 by Jorge Guillemín, working in collaboration with the government of Guatemala, the location was reconfirmed by Robert Carmack in 1969.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.219" /&gt; Although the Pismachi' plateau is twice the size of the Q'umarkaj plateau, the ruins occupy a small area on the southeast portion of the hilltop.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.219" /&gt; The ruins are still used for the rituals of modern K'iche' shamans.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.219" /&gt;

===Atalaya===
Atalaya (Spanish for "watchtower") is located at a distance of {{convert|600|m|yd}} to the east of the site core.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.222"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was built upon four terraces that dominated the approach to Q'umarkaj, at the beginning of the eastern plain occupied by the modern town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, pp.222-223"&gt;Carmack 2001a, pp.222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was very small, covering an area of {{convert|3250|sqm|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.223"&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; A paved avenue (or [[sacbe]]) is said by locals to have passed the tower, which was closely linked to the Nijaib lineage.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, pp.222-223" /&gt; Between Q'umarkaj and Atalaya there was a place where criminals were punished.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.222" /&gt; Atalaya is used for modern K'iche' rituals and is the focus of local folklore, which relates that Tecún Umán is buried there and that it is haunted by [[Tzitzimitl|tzitzimit]] spirits.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.223" /&gt; Towards the end of the 20th century the majority of the land making up the site still belonged to the Rojas family, descendents of the kings of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.223" /&gt;

===Pakaman===
Pakaman is located {{convert|1000|m|yd}} east of Atalaya and {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0}} east of Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, pp.222-223" /&gt; The same ''sakbe'' that passed the north side of Atalaya is said to pass south of Pakaman.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.223" /&gt; The original name of Pakaman is likely to have been ''Panpetaq'' ("place of arrival") and was the first important outpost on the entry road to Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="Carmack 2001a, p.223" /&gt;

The '''Rolf Schock Prizes''' were established and endowed by bequest of philosopher and artist [[Rolf Schock]] (1933–1986). The prizes were first awarded in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in 1993, and since 2005 are awarded every three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfschockprizes.se/engelskasidor/home/theprize.9_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipient currently receives [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 400,000 (''ca.'' [[United States dollar|US$]] 60,000). A similar prize is the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]], established by the [[Inamori Foundation]].

The Prizes are awarded in four categories and decided by committees of three of the [[Swedish Royal Academies]]:

*[[Logic]] and [[Philosophy]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]])
*[[Mathematics]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]])
*[[Visual art|Visual Arts]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]])
*[[Music|Musical Arts]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]])

[[File:Con Colleano on a slack-wire, circa 1920.jpg|thumb|Con Colleano on a slack-wire, circa 1920]]
'''Slackwire (Slack wire)''' is an [[acrobatic]] [[circus]] act, that involves the balancing skills of moving along a flexible/slack thin wire suspended in the air, connected to two anchor points. 
Not to be confused with [[Slackline|slacklining]].

==Description and setup ==

Usually "slack wire" utilizes a steel wire {{cvt|4|-|8|mm|frac=16}} in diameter fixed between two anchor points.
It can have two single stands with two extending wire pieces each to install the apparatus in an arena, 
or two "A" frames stands with one extending wire piece for each. It can also be mounted between two trees at an appropriate distance apart or fixed to a ceiling or any points which are strong enough to hold a performer's weight.

Wire walking artists usually use soft shoes made of leather.

===Slack Rope (Slackrope)===

A slack rope is very similar to a slack wire. The difference between a slack rope and a slackwire is in the characteristics of rope and wire. 
A slack rope usually utilizes a rope {{cvt|10|-|20|mm|frac=16}} in diameter. For both slack wire and slack rope, there are pluses and minuses to do stunts.
For example, it is easier and more comfortable to do "sliding" tricks on a wire than on a rope. On a Slack rope a performer can walk without shoes, but that is painful on a Slackwire. In addition, a Slack rope is very similar to a [[Cloud Swing]].

===Technique of Balance and Angle of Slackwire===
The technique of balance – a performer balances or moves on the wire while needing to control the wire beneath him from moving abruptly side to side, making continual adjustments. This skill is similar to balancing a stick on one’s head or on a finger. Each Slackwire performer usually uses his/her own preferred angle of slack and length of the wire.

The slack angle is the V-shaped angle created when a performer stands in the middle of the walking part of the wire. The angle depends on how long or short the wire is relative to the distance between two anchor points.  This also affects the swing amplitude of the wire side to side. Some slackwire artists change the angle of the wire during their act. See video in which a Chinese artist performs on the Slackwire, changing the angles of the wire with the help of a winch several times during the performance.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOWo56CmYrI  Video]

The degree of ease or difficulty for a performer to move the wire is dependent upon how thick the wire or rope is. The heavier the wire or rope, the more inertia is required to move it laterally, but also requires more force to contro; to movement or bring to bring it back to a place of rest.

===Skills===
The skills and stunts commonly performed on a slack Wire and slackrope include:

Beyond standing and walking artists can also do turns, lying own, knee stands, sliding, forward and backward rolls, splits, hand stands, including cartwheels, head stands. Props such as a ladder, chair, unicycle, bicycle, and even a rola-bola are incorporated into some acts.

Some more advanced Slackwire stunts are done while the wire is swinging, including standing, handstands, and walking. Slackwire balancing skills also can be combined with tricks as various kinds of juggling, balancing a stick on the performer’s head, playing a musical instrument, etc.
Some of the same skills can be seen in [[Cloud Swing]] or [[Trapeze]] acts as well.
		
====Jumping Rope on a Slack Wire====
[[Skipping rope|Jumping Rope]] is popular in many circus acts.
The skill has been performed on the ground in many variations, and on a [[Tightrope walking|Tightrope]], on a [[Slacklining|slackline]], but difficult on a slackwire because the wire moves when the performer jumps up and there is no way to control the swing and position of the wire when landing. This makes such stunts as somersaults and acrobatic tumbling virtually impossible.

Jumping rope on a slackwire was first accomplished in 1985. The only person to do the stunt is [[Sergey Alexandrovich Pavlov|Sergey Pavlov (the clown LALALA)]]
Sergey has even been able to complete up to 7 consecutive jumps.

*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URWheYZktVE Video - S. Pavlov - 5 skips]

==Similarities and Differences==

===Slackwire and Tightrope===
Slackwire and tightrope appear to be very similar skills to walking and balancing on a thin wire/rope. But actually the technique of balance is very different between them. 
[[File:Korea-Jeonju-Jultagi-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Tightrope performance (Korea)]]
The citation from [[Tightrope walking]]:
"Slackwire and tight wire/tightrope require different balancing techniques: tightrope performers keep their balance by shifting their weight over the rigid tight wire, while slackwire performers use a precise swinging motion to move the relaxed slackwire under their center of mass." Because of this, an artist who works on a tightrope cannot easily make a transition to the Slackwire. He/she needs to spend time to train himself/herself to balance in this different manner and vice versa for artists working first on a slackwire.


Some tight-wire artists demonstrate a stunt called “the swings”. 
An artist takes the position on the wire, then his assistant reduces the tightness/tension of the wire and the artist demonstrates “swings.” The tight wire is adjusted to a slightly less tight condition. This stunt involves multiple skills to maintain balance. After the demonstration the assistant adjusts the wire back to its original tightness/tension.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5znx0XY9jo video - Volzhansky family "Prometheus"/"Прометей", 1977" (timer: 4:55)]

The same stunt can also be demonstrated on a slackline.

===Slack Wire and [[Slacklining|Slackline]]===
[[File:Slackline in the sun.jpg|thumb|Slacklining in a park]]
There is confusion that Slackline means the same as Slackwire. They are not the same. They are different kinds of apparatuses that require different techniques of balancing.

The differences between Slackwire and Slackline:

* Slackwire utilizes a steel wire {{cvt|4|-|8|mm|frac=16}} in diameter, while Slackline utilizes a nylon webbing/strap approximately {{convert|2|in|-1|order=flip|abbr=in}} in width.
* Different Techniques of balancing: 
A slackwire has a loop and can be used like a swing, but a slackline has no loop. The line is stretched tight between two anchor points like a tightrope and can only swing within a very small amplitude.

* A slackline can be used like a trampoline, allowing for an easy landing on the line after a jump. In contrast, a Slackwire cannot be used like a trampoline, because when a performer jumps up from the loop of wire it will swing away with no way to anticipate its location upon landing.

'''Suomen kronikka''' ([[Latin|lat]]. ''Chronicon Finlandiae'', [[English language|eng]]. ''The Chronicle of Finland'') is a [[chronicle]] written in 1670s describing the history of Finland until [[Middle Ages|middle ages]].

The writer is unknown, but the most likely candidate is painter [[Elias Brenner]]. He was known patron of Finns and Finland and his stages of life support the possibility. If Brenner is the author of the chronicle, it has been written between 1672-1674. The original chronicle was published in [[Latin]] in 1728 by [[Christian Nettelblad]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Messenius, Johannes: Suomen, Liivinmaan ja Kuurinmaan vaiheita, sekä tuntemattoman tekijän Suomen kronikka.|last=Translated to Finnish from Latin: Martti Linna, Jorma Lagerstedt, Erkki Palmén.|first=|publisher=Historian ystäväin liitto.

The chronicle was aimed at creating a great past to Finns who were still under Swedish rule. This is possibly the reason that it was only printed after the death of the author and the fall of the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish empire]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The author mainly uses sagas and historians as sources of the chronicle, such as [[Saxo Grammaticus]], [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], [[Johannes Magnus]], [[Olaus Magnus]], [[Anders Bure]], [[Michael Wexionius]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Other uses}}
{{Wiktionary|supine}}

In [[grammar]], a '''supine''' is a form of [[verbal noun]] used in some languages. The term is most often used for [[Latin]], where it is one of the four [[principal parts]] of a verb.

==Latin==
{{see also|Latin conjugation#Supine|Latin syntax#The supine}}

There are two supines, I (first) and II (second). They are originally the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Ablative case|ablative]] forms of a [[verbal noun]] in the [[Latin declensions|fourth declension]], respectively. The first supine ends in ''-um''. It has two uses. The first is with verbs of motion and indicates purpose. For example, "Gladiatores adierunt '''pugnatum'''" is Latin for "The gladiators have come '''to fight'''", and "Nuntii '''gratulatum''' et '''cubitum''' venerunt" is Latin for "The messengers came '''to congratulate''' and '''to sleep'''". The second usage is in the [[Future tense|future]] [[Passive voice|passive]] [[infinitive]], for example "'''amatum iri'''" means "to be about to be loved". It mostly appears in indirect statements, for example "credidit se '''necatum iri'''", meaning "he believed that he was '''going to be killed'''".

The second supine can be used with adjectives but it is rarely used, and only a few verbs traditionally take it. It is derived from the ''dativus finalis'', which expresses purpose, or the ''ablativus respectivus'', which indicates in what respect. It is the same as the first supine without the final ''-m'' and with lengthened "u". "Mirabile dictū", for example, means "amazing to say", where ''dictū'' is a supine form.

==Germanic languages==
In [[English grammar]], the term "supine" is sometimes used to refer to the [[to-infinitive|''to''-infinitive]], in sentences like "'''To err''' is human; '''to forgive''' divine."

In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the supine is used with an [[auxiliary verb]] to produce some compound verb forms ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] forms). ''See'' [[Swedish grammar#Supine form|Swedish grammar]].

In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] grammar, ''sagnbót'' (usually translated as "supine") is a verbal form identical to the neuter participle, used to form certain verb tenses.

==Finnic languages==
In [[Estonian language|Estonian]], the supine is called "ma-tegevusnimi" (lit. "ma-action name") because all the words in supine have "ma" in the end (as in "tegema", "jooksma", "kõndima"), and they act similarly to the Latin example. The supine is also the common [[dictionary form]] for verbs.

==Romance languages==
In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the supine generally corresponds to an English construction like ''for doing'': "Această carte este '''de citit'''" means "This book is '''for reading'''".

==Slavic languages==
The [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and the [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]] supine is used after verbs of movement; ''see'' [[Slovenian verbs#Supine and Infinitive (Namenilnik in nedoločnik)|Slovenian verbs]]. The supine was used in [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] but it was replaced in most [[Slavic languages]] by the [[infinitive]] in later periods.

==Baltic languages==
In some dialects of [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], the supine is used with verbs of motion to indicate purpose: ''Moterys eina miestan duonos '''pirktų''' '', which means "The women are going to the town to buy some bread" (more archaic forms are '''pirktun''' and '''pirktum'''). The standard language uses the infinitive, '''pirkti''', instead of the supine. In the past, the supine was much more widespread form than now.

'''''The Hunger Games''''' is a [[trilogy]] of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] novels written by American novelist [[Suzanne Collins]].

The novels in the trilogy are titled [[The Hunger Games (novel)|''The Hunger Games'']] (2008), ''[[Catching Fire]]'' (2009), and ''[[Mockingjay]]'' (2010). The novels have all been developed into [[The Hunger Games (film series)|films]] starring [[Jennifer Lawrence]], with the film adaptation of ''Mockingjay'' split into two parts. The first two books in the series were both [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best sellers]], and ''Mockingjay'' topped all US bestseller lists upon its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Children's Books | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/books/bestseller/bestchildren.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date= December 27, 2009 | accessdate=December 31, 2009 | first=Gregory | last=Cowles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Mockingjay Tops All National Bestseller Lists with Sales of More Than 450,000 Copies in its First Week of Publication | url=http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/363 | publisher=Scholastic | date=September 2, 2010 | accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[The Hunger Games (film)|the film adaptation]] of ''The Hunger Games'' was released in 2012, the publisher had reported over 26 million ''Hunger Games'' trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Karen | last=Springen | title=The Hunger Games Franchise: The Odds Seem Ever in Its Favor | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/51167-the-hunger-games-franchise-the-odds-seem-ever-in-its-favor.html | newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] | date=March 22, 2012 | accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, children from the districts are selected to participate in a compulsory televised [[battle royal]]e death match called [[The Hunger Games universe#The Hunger Games|The Hunger Games]].

The novels were all well received. In August 2012, the series ranked second, exceeded only by the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series in [[NPR]]'s poll of the top 100 teen novels, which asked voters to choose their favorite young adult books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/07/157795366/your-favorites-100-best-ever-teen-novels |title=Your Favorites: 100 Best-Ever Teen Novels| publisher=NPR | date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=August 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 2012, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] announced ''The Hunger Games'' trilogy as its top seller, surpassing the record previously held by the ''Harry Potter'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/amazon-crowns-hunger-games-as-its-top-seller-surpassing-harry-potter-series/ | work=The New York Times | first=Julie | last=Bosman | title=Amazon Crowns 'Hunger Games' as Its Top Seller, Surpassing Harry Potter Series | date=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, the trilogy has sold more than 65 million copies in the U.S. alone (more than 28 million copies of ''The Hunger Games'', more than 19 million copies of ''Catching Fire'', and more than 18 million copies of ''Mockingjay'').

==Setting==
{{Main|Fictional universe of The Hunger Games}}
''The Hunger Games'' trilogy takes place in an unspecified future time, in the dystopian, [[Apocalypse|post-apocalyptic]] nation of Panem, located in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|title=The Hunger Games|year=2008|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|isbn=0-439-02348-3| page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country consists of a wealthy Capitol city, located in the [[Rocky Mountains]],&lt;ref name="HG_41"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|title=The Hunger Games|year=2008|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|isbn=0-439-02348-3|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by twelve (originally thirteen) poorer districts ruled by the Capitol. The Capitol is lavishly rich and technologically advanced, but the districts are in varying states of poverty. The trilogy's narrator and protagonist [[Katniss Everdeen]], lives in District 12, the poorest region of Panem, located in [[Appalachia]],&lt;ref name="HG_41"/&gt; where people regularly die of starvation. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol (called the "Dark Days"), in which District 13 was supposedly destroyed, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve remaining districts, between the ages of 12 and 18, are selected by lottery to compete in an annual pageant called the Hunger Games. The Games are a televised event in which the participants, called "tributes", are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous public arena. The winning tribute and his/her home district are then rewarded with food, supplies, and riches. The purposes of the Hunger Games are to provide entertainment for the Capitol and to remind the districts of the Capitol's power and lack of [[remorse]],
[[forgetfulness]], and [[forgiveness]] for the failed rebellion of the current competitors' ancestors.

===Structure===
Each book in ''The Hunger Games'' trilogy has three sections of nine chapters each. Collins has said this format comes from her playwriting background, which taught her to write in a [[three-act structure]]; her previous series, ''[[The Underland Chronicles]]'', was written in the same way. She sees each group of nine chapters as a separate part of the story, and comments still call those divisions "act breaks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Collins |first=Suzanne |title=Similarities To Underland |url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/similarities-to-underland.htm |type=Interview: Video |work=[[Scholastic Canada]] |accessdate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Collins says she drew inspiration for the series from both classical and contemporary sources. Her main classical source of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] is the Greek myth of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]], in which, as a punishment for past crimes, [[Minos]] forces [[Athens]] to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to the Minotaur, which kills them in a vast [[labyrinth]]. Collins says that even as a child, she was stunned by the idea since "it was just so cruel" to force Athens to sacrifice its own children.

Collins also cites as a classical inspiration the Roman [[gladiator]] games. She feels three key elements create a good game: an all powerful and ruthless government, people forced to fight to the death, and the game's role as a source of popular entertainment.&lt;ref name="classical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/classical-inspiration.htm |title=Video: Classical Inspiration – The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary source of inspiration was Collins' recent fascination with [[Reality TV|reality television programs]]. She says they are like ''The Hunger Games'' because the Games are not just entertainment but also a reminder to the districts of their rebellion. On a tired night, Collins says that while she was channel-surfing the television, she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the [[Iraq War]]. She described how the two combined in an "unsettling way" to create her first ideas for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/contemporary-inspiration.htm|title=Video: Contemporary Inspiration – The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trilogy==
===''The Hunger Games''===
{{Main|The Hunger Games (novel)}}
''The Hunger Games'' is the first book in the series and was released on September 14, 2008.

''The Hunger Games'' follows 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her younger sister [[Primrose Everdeen]]. Also selected from District 12 is [[Peeta Mellark]]. They are mentored by their district's only living victor, [[Haymitch Abernathy]], who won 24 years earlier and has since led a solitary life of [[alcoholism]].

Peeta confesses his longtime secret love for Katniss in a televised interview prior to the Games. This revelation stuns Katniss, who harbors feelings for [[Gale Hawthorne]], her friend and hunting partner. Haymitch advises her to feign feelings for Peeta in order to gain wealthy sponsors who can provide crucial supplies to the "[[star-crossed lovers]]" during the Games.

In the arena, Katniss allies with [[Rue (The Hunger Games)|Rue]], a young tribute from District 11 who reminds Katniss of her kid sister. When Rue is killed, Katniss places flowers around her body as an act of defiance toward the Capitol. Then the remaining tributes are alerted to a rule change that allows tributes from the same district to win as a team. Katniss finds a seriously wounded Peeta and nurses him back to health. When all of the other tributes are dead, the rule change is abruptly revoked. With neither willing to kill the other, Katniss comes up with a solution: a double suicide by eating poisonous berries. This forces the authorities to concede just in time to save their lives. During and after the Games, Katniss develops genuine feelings for Peeta and struggles to reconcile them with what she feels for Gale.

Haymitch warns her that the danger is far from over. The authorities are furious at being made fools of, and the only way to try to allay their anger is to pretend that her actions were because of her love for Peeta. On the journey home, Peeta is dismayed to learn of the deception.

===''Catching Fire ''===
{{Main|Catching Fire}}
''Catching Fire'' is the second installment in the series, released on September 1, 2009.

In ''Catching Fire'', which begins six months after the conclusion of ''The Hunger Games'', Katniss learns that her defiance in the previous novel has started a chain reaction that has inspired rebellion in the districts. President Snow threatens to harm Katniss' family and friends if she does not help to defuse the unrest in the districts and marry Peeta. Meanwhile, Peeta has become aware of Katniss' disingenuous love for him, but he has also been informed of Snow's threats, so he promises to help keep up the act to spare the citizens of District 12. Katniss and Peeta tour the districts as victors and plan a public wedding. While they follow Snow's orders and keep up the ruse, Katniss inadvertently fuels the rebellion, and the [[Mockingjays|mockingjay]] pin she wears becomes its symbol. District by district, the citizens of Panem begin to stage uprisings against the Capitol. Snow announces a special 75th edition of the Hunger Games—known as the [[Quarter Quell]]—in which Katniss and Peeta are forced to compete with other past victors, effectively canceling the wedding. At Haymitch's urging, the pair teams up with several other tributes, and manages to destroy the arena and escape the Games. Katniss is rescued by the rebel forces from District 13, and Gale informs her that the Capitol has destroyed District 12, and captured both Peeta and their District 7 ally, [[Johanna Mason]]. Katniss ultimately learns—to her surprise—that she had inadvertently been an integral part of the rebellion all along; her rescue had been jointly planned by Haymitch, [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch Heavensbee]], and [[Finnick Odair]], among others. After some hesitation Katniss joins the rebels.

===''Mockingjay''===
{{Main|Mockingjay}}
''Mockingjay'', the third and final book in ''The Hunger Games'' series, was released on August 24, 2010.

Most of the districts have rebelled against the Capitol, led by District 13 and its President [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Alma Coin|Alma Coin]]. The Capitol lied about the district being destroyed in the Dark Days. After a [[Mexican standoff]] with the Capitol, the District 13 residents took to living underground and rebuilding their strength. The District 12 survivors find shelter with them. Katniss, after seeing first-hand the destruction wrought on her district, agrees to become the "Mockingjay", the symbol of the rebellion. She sets conditions, however. Peeta, Johanna Mason, [[Annie Cresta]], and [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Enobaria|Enobaria]], fellow Games victors captured by the Capitol, are to be granted immunity. Katniss also demands the privilege of killing Snow, but Coin only agrees to flip for the honor.

For her sake, a rescue mission is mounted that succeeds in rescuing Peeta, Johanna and Annie. However, Peeta has been [[Mind control|brainwashed]] to kill Katniss, and he tries to choke her to death upon their reunion. He undergoes experimental treatment to try to cure him.

After she recovers, Katniss and a team known as the Star Squad, composed of Gale, Peeta, Finnick, a [[Film crew|camera crew]], and various other soldiers, are assigned to film propaganda in relatively quiet combat zones. Katniss, however, decides to go to the Capitol to kill Snow, pretending that Coin gave her that mission. Most of the squad are killed along the way, including recently married Finnick. As Katniss approaches Snow's mansion, she sees a group of Capitol children surrounding it as [[human shield]]s. Suddenly a hovercraft drops silver parachutes on the children, who reach for them, hoping they bear food. Some of the parachutes explode, creating carnage. The advancing rebels send in [[medic]]s, including Prim. Then the rest of the parachutes blow up, killing Prim, just as she spots her sister.

Later, Katniss, also injured, awakens from a [[coma]] to learn that the rebels have won, and Snow is awaiting execution at her hands. When she meets Snow by chance, he claims that it was Coin who secretly ordered the bombings in order to strip away the support of his remaining followers. Coin then asks the surviving victors to vote on a final Hunger Games, involving the children of high-ranking Capitol officials (including Snow's granddaughter). Katniss and Haymitch cast the deciding votes in favor of the scheme. However, at what is supposed to be Snow's execution, Katniss instead kills Coin with her bow. Snow laughs, then dies.

Katniss is tried, but the jury believes she was mentally unfit, and she is sent home to District 12. Both Katniss' mother and Gale take jobs in other districts. Peeta regains his sanity. Katniss settles down with him, and after many years of persuasion by him, she finally agrees to have children. They have a girl and then a boy.

The series received criticism regarding its [[reality TV]] "death game" theme being derivative of works such as ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Long Walk]]'',&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; and ''[[Series 7: The Contenders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Hehir, Andrew|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/what_came_before_the_hunger_games/|title=What came before 'The Hunger Games'|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=March 13, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was also criticized for the romantic plotline: Rollie Welch of Ohio's ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' criticized the characters' lack of resolute behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rollie|last=Welch|url=http://www.cleveland.com/bookreviews/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-1/125213948127050.xml&amp;coll=2|title='Catching Fire' brings back Suzanne Collins's kindhearted killer|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=September 6, 2009|location=[[Brooklyn, Ohio]]|accessdate=November 26, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68rJLJZUd?url=http://www.cleveland.com/bookreviews/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment-1%2F125213948127050.xml|archivedate=July 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jennifer Reese of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that there was little distinction between Peeta and Gale and the series lacked the "erotic energy" seen in the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Reese|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20300507,00.html|title=Catching Fire review|work = Entertainment Weekly |date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.C. Maçek III of ''[[PopMatters]]'' stated "While [[The Hunger Games (film series)|the film saga]] does capture the [[action (fiction)|action]] of ''The Hunger Games'', the novels are most assuredly the heart of the story. They are nothing less than 'The Writer’s Cut' of the films themselves."&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/the-hunger-games-the-writers-cut-really-is-better/|title='The Hunger Games': The Writer’s Cut Really Is Better|date=20 June 2016|first=J.C.|last=Maçek III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last book, ''Mockingjay'', was criticized by Dan Shade of ''[[SF Site]]'', who felt that Katniss is a weaker character than her comrades and less resolute in her journey to the Capitol, and that with respect to her vendetta against President Snow, her actions in the finale are inconsistent with her established character.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, Dan (2010).

{{nihongo|'''''The Window of Orpheus'''''|オルフェウスの窓|Orufeusu no Mado}}, also known as '''''Orpheus no Mado''''' or '''''Das Fenster von Orpheus''''', is a Japanese historical [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Riyoko Ikeda]]. It was published by [[Shueisha]] in ''[[Margaret (magazine)|Margaret]]'' from 1975 to 1981, and collected in 18 [[tankōbon|bound volumes]]. It takes place in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Russia]] with the backdrop story of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].

== Story ==
The story begins in [[Regensburg]], Germany in 1903. There is a rumor at the all-boys Catholic S. Sebastian Music Institute that if someone looks through a window known as The Window of Orpheus in one of the towers and sees a beautiful girl through it, he will fall in love with her. This love will only bring pain for it will end up like the tragic Greek [[Mythology|myth]] of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]].

Two of the students, Klaus and Isaac, see a girl through the window. Not realizing she is a fellow student named Julius, who was raised to be a boy, things spin out of control and their lives are changed forever.

'''''Time Team America''''' is an American [[television program|television series]] that airs on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. It premiered on July 8, 2009.

==Reviews==
A ''[[Newsday]]'' review said  "''Time Team America'' at moments, employs [an] approach much in favor at PBS, which worries &amp;mdash; needlessly, I think &amp;mdash; that the only way to make serious subjects appealing to the attention-deficit-disordered youth of our TV nation is to throw in plenty of zing, zest and zip.... But don't hold any of this against the show, because it's engaging, thoughtful, smart, nicely produced and really, really interesting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/ny-ettel0812946717jul06,0,4288646.story ''Time Team America'', archaeology on PBS], a July 8, 2009 ''[[Newsday]]'' review&lt;/ref&gt;

==The American Bar Association's list==
In 1989, the [[American Bar Association]] rated the twelve best trial films of all time, and provided a detailed and reasoned legal evaluation for its choices.&lt;ref name="aba-list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/students-teachers/movies.shtml|title=Verone, Patric M. "The 12 Best Trial Movies" from the ''ABA Journal''. November 1989 reprinted in ''Nebraska Law Journal''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten of them are in English; ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' is in German and ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'' is a French silent film. The films on the [[ABA Journal]] list are here:

|}

Ten of the movies take place (at least in part) in courtrooms.

The American Bar Association also published a list of the 12 best trial plays, noting that the transition from film to the stage is sometimes difficult. It also has an extensive honorable mention list.&lt;ref name="Schachner"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_theaters_12_greatest_courtroom_dramas/ |title=The Theater's 12 Greatest Courtroom Dramas |date=August 1, 2012 |first1=Jill Schachner |last1=Chanen |work=ABA Journal |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oddities===
The trial in ''M'' is ''not'' in a legal courtroom. Instead, the city's crime syndicate leaders and underground elements hold proceedings in a warehouse. Despite the lack of legal trappings, "it is one of the most effective trials ever filmed, questioning our notions of justice and revenge, mob rule and order, power and responsibility. Our social orientation is flip-flopped." Wearing long leather coats instead of robes, criminals become judges. The murderer is cast as the victim, while the forces of law and order must rely on luck. [[Peter Lorre]] strikingly raises the issue of his culpability due to alleged insanity, and the imposition of ultimate retributive justice is depicted as being unsatisfying for society and the survivors of the murdered victims.&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

Outside of the first few minutes of the film, ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' never enters a court room at all. It views the particular case and the system of justice through the prism of a jury's deliberations. The film explains practical explications of legal concepts basic to the American system of justice, and their effect on a particular trial and defendant. Those include the [[presumption of innocence]], [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and the requirement of proof beyond a [[reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref name="aba-list"/&gt;

==American Film Institute==
In 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] compiled its own "courtroom drama" ten best list. It includes five of the films on the ABA list — ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' and ''[[The Verdict]]'' — and adds ''[[A Cry in the Dark]]'', ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', and ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''.&lt;ref name="afi.com"/&gt;

==Military trial films==
Military trial films typically include conflicting questions of loyalty, command responsibility, ethical rules and rules of engagement, obedience to superior authority, politics and class conflict. [[War movies|War]] and trials are good foils for one another. The struggles are perennial and engaging. A partial list includes:
{|class="wikitable sortable"

| ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]''&lt;ref&gt;From the 1951 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning novel ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'' by [[Herman Wouk]], {{ISBN|0-89577-414-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; || 1954 || Climaxes in a strongly contested [[court martial]], and a particularly dynamic cross examination, in which [[Captain Queeg]], played by [[Humphrey Bogart]], acts out one of film's most dramatic meltdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azstarnet.com/accent/198010|title=Review noting Captain Queeg cross examination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was nominated for 7 [[Academy Awards]].

Anticipating the Nuremberg trials and the "[[Nuremberg Defense|defense of superior orders]]", the soldiers' main defense is that they were doing their duty as they understood it, and following orders and policy from above. Nevertheless, this "[[Kangaroo court]]" moves to its inevitable conclusion. As one review notes, it features one of the finest (and most succinct) closing arguments in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Breaker-Morant|title='Breaker' Morant, A film review by Christopher Null}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film can be seen from the perspective of Judicial Qualifications Commissions (also known as Judicial Tenure Commissions), which are judicial agencies charged with overseeing judicial performance and conduct. From that end of the telescope, the indictment of the courts and judicial system (and the examples) are not so outlandish as might be supposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=2841|title=Apollo Guide Review "And Justice for All" by Norman Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starred [[Al Pacino]], [[Jack Warden]], and [[John Forsythe]].

There exist various methods through which the [[ballot]]s cast at an [[election]] may be counted, prior to applying a [[voting system]] to obtain one or more winners.

==Manual counting==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ballot]] --&gt;
Manual counting requires a physical [[ballot]] that represents voter intent. The physical ballots are read and interpreted; then results are individually tabulated.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/primaries/sr_technology_history.html History of Voting Technology] from [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s [[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used in Sweden for example, and conducted as follows. The voter casts three ballots, one for each of the three elections (national, regional, and local), each in a sealed envelope. The party and candidate names are pre-printed on the ballot, or the voter can write them in on a blank ballot. When voting has finished, all envelopes are opened on the counting table, for one election at a time. They are sorted in piles according to party, inspecting them for validity. The piles are then counted manually, while witnesses around the table observe. The count is recorded, and the same pile is counted again. If the results do not agree, it is counted a third time. When all piles are counted and the results agree, the result is certified and transmitted for central tabulation. The count as received is made public, to allow anyone to double-check the tabulation and audit the raw data. There appears to be a high level of confidence in this system among the population, as evidenced by the lack of criticism of it.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Such a system may be used for [[recount]]s in areas where mechanical or automated counting systems are used.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Electromechanical and Optical scan counting==
{{further|Optical scan voting system}}
Paper [[ballots]], typically [[punched card]]s or [[marksense]], are collected and fed into a machine to tabulate vote totals. Tabulation can occur with each individual ballot, or in batches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/vc/vc31 Application of Technology in Vote Counting Systems] - [http://www.aceproject.org ACE Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct-recording voting (mechanical) counting==
Voters selecting switches (levers), pushing plastic chips through holes, or pushing mechanical buttons which increment a mechanical counter (sometimes called the odometer) for the appropriate candidate panot.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

==Direct-recording electronic counting==
{{main|DRE voting machine}}

Voting data and ballot images are recorded in memory components. Tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. This consolidation can be any subset of machines, such as all [[voting machine]]s in a [[polling station]], or all voting machines in a [[precinct]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eac.gov/VVSG%20Volume_I.pdf 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208184233/http://www.eac.gov/VVSG%20Volume_I.pdf |date=2006-02-08 }} from the US [[Election Assistance Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''wet feet, dry feet policy''' or '''wet foot, dry foot policy''' is the name given to a former interpretation of the 1995 revision of the application of the [[Cuban Adjustment Act]] of 1966 that essentially says that anyone who emigrated from [[Cuba]] and entered the [[United States]] would be allowed to pursue residency a year later. Prior to 1995, the US government allowed all Cubans who reached US territorial waters to remain in the US. After talks with the Cuban government, the [[Clinton administration]] came to an agreement with Cuba that it would stop admitting people intercepted in U.S. waters. For several decades thereafter, in what became known as the "Wet foot, Dry foot" policy, a Cuban caught on the waters between the two nations (with "wet feet") would summarily be sent home or to a third country. One who makes it to shore ("dry feet") gets a chance to remain in the United States, and later would qualify for expedited "legal [[permanent resident]]" status in accordance with the 1966 Act and eventually [[U.S. citizenship]]. In January 2017, the [[Obama administration]] announced the immediate end of the policy shortly before President [[Barack Obama]]'s term expired.&lt;ref name="policyended"/&gt;

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
Between 1960 and 1980, hundreds of thousands of Cubans entered the United States under the Attorney General's parole authority, many of them arriving by boat. In 1980, a mass migration of asylum seekers—known as the [[Mariel boatlift]]—brought approximately 125,000 Cubans (and 25,000 [[Haiti]]ans) to South Florida over a six-month period. After declining for several years, Cuban "boat people" steadily rose from a few hundred in 1989 to a few thousand in 1993. After [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] made threatening speeches in 1994, riots ensued in Havana, and the Cuban exodus by boat escalated. The number of Cubans intercepted by the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] or the [[United States Border Patrol|U.S. Border Patrol]] reached a post-Mariel high of 37,191 in 1994.

Until 1995, the United States generally had not repatriated Cubans (except certain criminal aliens on a negotiated list) under a policy established when the government became [[Communism|Communist]] within two years of the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]]. Not only has the United States  been reluctant to repatriate people to Cuba, but also the Cuban government typically has also refused to accept Cuban migrants who are excludable under the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA) (Cubans who have been convicted of crimes in the United States pose complex problems, as Cuba is among a handful of nations that does not generally accept the return of criminal aliens.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}})

"Normalizing" migration between the two nations was the stated purpose of the migration agreement enacted by the [[Clinton Administration]] on September 9, 1994, when the U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants was altered significantly. The plan's objectives of safe, legal, and orderly immigration relied on six points.

*The United States agreed to no longer permit Cubans intercepted at sea to come to the United States; rather, Cubans would be placed in a safe haven camp in a third location. Justifying this policy as a "safety of life at sea" issue, Cuba also agreed to use "persuasive methods" to discourage people from setting sail.
*United States and Cuba reaffirmed their support for the [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution on alien smuggling. They pledged to cooperate in the prevention of the illegal transport of migrants and the use of violence or "forcible divergence" to reach the United States.
*The United States agreed to admit no fewer than 20,000 immigrants from Cuba annually, not including the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.
*The United States and Cuba agreed to cooperate on the voluntary return of Cubans who arrived in the United States or were intercepted at sea.
*The United States and Cuba did not reach an agreement on how to handle Cubans who are excluded by the INA, but agreed to continue discussing the matter. (Grounds for removal include health-related grounds; criminal grounds; national security grounds; [[pursuit of Nazi collaborators|Nazi prosecution]] grounds; public charge grounds; [[illegal entry]] and [[immigration law]] violations; and lack of proper immigration documents.)
*The United States and Cuba agreed to review the implementation of this agreement and engage in further discussions.

It became apparent that the 20,000 minimum level per year could not be met through the INA preference system or the refugee provisions because of the eligibility criteria. In addition to those Cubans who may qualify to immigrate through the INA preference system and who may qualify as refugees, the United States decided to use other authority in the law (i.e., parole), to allow Cubans to come to the United States and become legal permanent residents through the Cuban Adjustment Act. Specifically, a "[[Immigration to the United States|visa lottery]]" program was established to randomly select who, among the many Cubans seeking to migrate, receives a visa.

As part of the effort to enact this agreement, [[Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage]] were executed to alleviate overcrowding at Guantanamo Bay by using temporary camps in Panama.

===Cuban Migration Agreement, March 1996 ===

On May 2, 1995, the Clinton administration announced a further agreement with Cuba that resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33,000 Cubans then encamped at Guantanamo. This new agreement, which came at the time of year when boat people traditionally begin their journeys, had two new points. Foremost, the United States allowed most of the Cubans detained at Guantanamo to come to the United States through the humanitarian parole provisions of the INA (Guantanamo).

Cuba agreed to credit some of these admissions toward the minimum 20,000 LPRs per year from Cuba, with 5,000 charged annually over three years. Secondly, rather than placing Cubans intercepted at sea in safe haven camps, the United States began repatriating them to Cuba. Both parties promised to act in a matter consistent with international obligations and to ensure that no action is taken against those repatriated. U.S. officials would inform repatriated Cubans about procedures to legally immigrate at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Those charged with alien smuggling, however, do face prison terms in Cuba.

Interdicted Cubans are given an opportunity to express a fear of persecution if returned to Cuba. Those who meet the definition of a refugee or asylee are resettled in a third country. From May 1995 through July 2003, about 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in 11 different countries, including [[Spain]], [[Venezuela]], [[Australia]], and [[Nicaragua]]. The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] is required to monitor whether those migrants who are returned to Cuba are subject to reprisals.

===Special Cuban Migration Lottery===
Since the 1994 migration agreement, the United States has conducted three visa lottery open seasons to implement the Special Cuban Migration Program. The three open seasons were at two-year intervals: Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, FY1996, and FY1998. The number of qualifying registrants has increased each year, from 189,000 in 1994, to 433,000 in 1996 and to 541,000 in 1998. Cubans qualifying through the 1998 lottery are still being paroled into the United States

Once selected through the lottery, the successful applicants are given parole status with a visa that is good for six months. The medical examination, required of all potential immigrants, is good for one year. Spouses and minor children may accompany the successful registrants. Over the years, there have been reports of barriers the potential Cuban parolees face, such as exorbitantly-priced medical exams, exit visas fees, and repercussions for family members who are sequestered.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=May 2016}}

==Recurring issues and criticism==

A well-publicized incident in June 1999 provoked outrage when the U.S. Coast Guard used pepper spray and a water cannon to prevent six Cubans from reaching Surfside Beach in Florida. A few weeks later, a Cuban woman drowned when a boat capsized during interdiction. Notably in late November 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard opted to bring six-year-old [[Elián González]] and two other survivors of an ill-fated journey to the United States rather than taking them to Cuba as the migration agreement provides.

In July 2003, a dozen people reportedly stole a Cuban-flagged boat from the marina where it was docked in Cuba and kidnapped the three watchmen guarding the marina in the process. When the boat was in international waters allegedly en route to Florida, Coast Guard officials tried to intercept it and reportedly faced violent resistance from the Cubans when they interdicted the vessel. All 15 persons on board were taken to the U.S. Coast Guard cutter and interviewed by a USCIS asylum officer. The three watchmen indicated a desire to return to Cuba. When the Cuban government offered to sentence the 12 persons implicated in crimes (purportedly boat theft, kidnapping, and assaulting federal officers) to 10 years in prison, the United States agreed to return them.

On January 7, 2006, the Coast Guard found 15 Cubans who had climbed onto a piling on the old [[Seven Mile Bridge]] in the Florida Keys.  The old bridge had been cut off from land because it was no longer in use and the United States Coast Guard argued that since the refugees could not walk to land, their feet were still "wet".  The decision to repatriate the Cubans was made by the Coast Guard's legal office in conjunction with [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]. The Coast Guard stated that the Cubans "were determined to be wet-feet and processed in accordance with standard procedure." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-09-cuban-policy_x.htm |title=15 Cubans sent home after policy dispute |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=USA Today |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation to the Cubans being returned, [[Ramón Saúl Sánchez]] led a [[hunger strike]] against the policy, and on January 18, the White House agreed to meet with Sánchez at some point in the near future. After eleven days, the hunger strike was ended, and Sánchez has yet to meet with White House officials. On February 28, 2007, a federal judge ruled that the United States government had acted unreasonably when it sent home the 15 Cubans. The judge ordered the government to make its best effort to help the immigrants return to the United States. Fourteen of the 15 Cubans re-landed on December 15, 2006 and were given migrant visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/12/15/cubans.ap/index.html |title=Cubans deported from bridge reach U.S. on 2nd try |date=14 January 2007 |publisher=[[CNN]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114175342/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/12/15/cubans.ap/index.html |archivedate=January 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in immigration patterns==
Since the late-1980s immigration patterns changed. Many Cuban immigrants departed from the southern and western coasts of Cuba and arrived at the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]]; many landed on [[Isla Mujeres]]. From there Cuban immigrants traveled to the [[United States-Mexico border|Texas-Mexico border]] and found asylum. Many of the Cubans who did not have family in Miami settled in [[Houston]].&lt;ref name="Houston Press"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-01-10/news/immigration-cubans-enter-u-s-at-texas-mexico-border |title=Immigration: Cubans Enter U.S. at Texas-Mexico Border |first1=Russell |last1=Cobb |first2=Paul |last2=Knight |date=9 January 2008 |newspaper=[[Houston Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "dusty foot" refers to Cubans immigrating to the U.S. through Mexico.&lt;ref name="Houston Press" /&gt;

Other migrants arrive in the U.S. crossing the Mona Channel that separates the [[Dominican Republic]] from [[Puerto Rico]], the latter being a U.S. Commonwealth.  Using smugglers based in the Dominican Republic, migrants make the hazardous journey using rickety fishing boats commonly called "yolas" and set foot on [[Isla de Mona]], a small uninhabited island that is part of Puerto Rico. Once on the island, [[U.S. Coast Guard]] patrol boats pick up the migrants and transfer them to [[Aguadilla]] where they are processed by U.S. immigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=16234 "Cubans using Haitian, Dominican soil to reach Puerto Rico concerns the U.S."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112075240/http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=16234 |date=2007-11-12 }}, ''Dominican Today'', accessed 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of policy==
Beginning with the [[United States–Cuban Thaw]] in 2014, anticipation of the end of the wet feet, dry feet policy led to increased numbers of Cuban immigrants.&lt;ref name="policyended"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gomez|first1=Alan|title=Obama to end 'wet foot, dry foot' policy for Cubans|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/12/obama-ends-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy-cubans/96505172/|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2017, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] announced the immediate cessation of the wet feet, dry feet policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obama|first1=Barack|author-link=Barack Obama|title=Statement by the President on Cuban Immigration Policy|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/12/statement-president-cuban-immigration-policy|website=The White House|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=January 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DHS%20Fact%20Sheet%20FINAL.pdf Fact Sheet: Changes to Parole and Expedited Removal Policies Affecting Cuban Nationals]".

The '''Winterville Site''' ([[Smithsonian trinomial|22 WS 500]]) is a major [[archaeological site]] in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Washington County, Mississippi]], north of [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]].  It consists of major earthwork monuments, including more than twelve large [[platform mound]]s and cleared and filled [[plaza]]s.  It is the [[type site]] for the ''Winterville Phase (1200 to 1400)'' of the Lower Yazoo Basin region of the [[Plaquemine Mississippian culture]]. Protected as a state park, it has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In June 2015 the state authorized $300,000 to restore the mounds to their pre-Columbian condition and add walking trails to the park.&lt;ref name="restore"&gt;[ "Mound Site Restoration Project Funded"], Mississippi Dept. of Archives and History, 5 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The site also includes a museum.

==Winterville Mounds==
Winterville Mounds, named for the nearby town of [[Winterville, Mississippi]], is the site of a prehistoric ceremonial center built by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s of the [[Plaquemine culture]], the regional variation of the [[Mississippian culture]]. This civilization thrived from about 1000 to 1450CE. The [[mound]]s, an expression of the Winterville society's religious and political system, were the site of sacred structures and ceremonies. They were built between 1200 and 1250.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite web|title=Winterville Site|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/mounds/win.htm|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeological]] evidence indicates that the Winterville people lived away from the mound center on family farms in scattered settlement districts throughout the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]]-[[Mississippi River]] Delta basin. Only a few of the higher-ranking tribal officials lived at this mound complex.

The Winterville ceremonial center originally contained at least twenty-three [[platform mound]]s surrounding several large, filled and smoothed [[plaza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brain|first= Jeffrey P.|title= Winterville-Late Prehistoric Culture Contact In the Lower Mississippi Valley| year= 1989 |publisher= Mississippi Department of Archives and History|isbn= 0-938896-58-X|page= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the mounds located outside current park boundaries were leveled by farming and highway construction before the site became protected as Winterville State Park.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt; Twelve of the site's largest mounds, including the {{convert|55|ft|m}} high Temple Mound, are the focus in the early 21st century of a long-range preservation plan being developed by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History and the [[University of Mississippi]]'s Center for Archaeological Research. In June 2015 the state legislature authorized $300,000 for a project to restore the mounds to their pre-Columbian condition. Trees and brush will be removed. In addition, two walking trails will be added to the park.&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt;

[[Image:ChromeSun Photo winterville01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mound A, the largest mound at the site]]
Archaeological evidence indicates that there are continuities in culture between the residents of the Winterville Mounds and the later [[Natchez people|Natchez Indians]], a Mississippi tribe documented by French explorers and settlers in the early 18th century. The Natchez Indians' society was divided into upper and lower ranks, with a person's social rank determined by [[Matrilineality|heredity through the female line]]. The chief and other tribal officials inherited their positions as members of the royal family. Such an elaborate leadership network was able to direct the mound building at Winterville by an organized civilian labor force. However, there is no evidence of a large residential population at this site or other similar sites. This lack of artifacts and remains indicates that this site was mostly used for ceremonial purposes.

A great fire during the late 14th century consumed the original building on the Temple Mound at Winterville. According to archaeological evidence, the cause of the fire remains a mystery.  The site continued to be used afterward, but no more mounds were built or maintained. Although the site continued to be occupied after the fire, the general population declined at Winterville while increasing at settlements and mound sites 50 miles to the south, in the lower Yazoo River basin. By AD 1450 the Winterville Mound site appears to have been abandoned completely. The period of the site's greatest florescence was used by archaeologists as the basis for describing the ''Winterville Phase (1200 to 1400 CE)'' of the Lower Yazoo Basin region.

The first modern archaeological excavations at the Winterville Site were conducted in the 1940s by the [[National Park Service]] and [[Harvard University]]'s Lower Mississippi Survey. [[Jeffrey P. Brain]] directed excavations at Winterville in 1967 and his report, ''Winterville: Late Prehistoric Culture Contact in the Lower Mississippi Valley,'' was published in 1989 by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Burials and structural remains were found at the site, along with items such as ceramic and stone artifacts, which can be seen at the Winterville Museum in the park.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

Winterville Mounds was dedicated as a [[Mississippi state park]] in March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=March 3, 1969 |title=Winterville Park dedicated |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5860346/the_delta_democrattimes/ |newspaper=[[The Delta Democrat-Times]] |location=Greenville, MS |publisher= |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=July 11, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;

===Pottery===
{{main|Plaquemine culture pottery|Mississippian culture pottery}}
[[Image:Winterville pottery HRoe 2004.jpg|right|250px|thumb|An assortment of pottery found at the site, on display at the site museum.]]
The Winterville people made pottery by building up strips of clay, and then smoothing them out, much like other [[Native American pottery|pottery]] in the Eastern American area where the potters wheel was unknown. Pottery was tempered with ground [[mussel]] shell, grit, grog, and angular bits of clay. Surface treatment ranged from carelessly polished to very finely polished. Forms for the pottery range from shallow plate like bowls to beakers and jars, with some pieces having animal effigies for handles. Surface decorations range from plain to incised [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|S.E.C.C.]] designs.

Most pottery found at the Winterville Site are of the kinds known as Addis Plain ''var. Addis'',  Addis Plain ''var. Greenville'' and Addis Plain ''var. Holly Bluff''. Some of the [[Mississippian culture pottery]] found at the Winterville site is believed to have been imported from other Mississippian societies (possibly from [[Cahokia]] or Cahokian-influenced peoples). Examples of these are pieces of pottery from the [[Nodena Phase|Nodena]] Red and White ''var. Dumond'' and [[Walls Phase|Walls]] Engraved ''var. Walls''. These examples have distinctive red and white slips, thinner walls, and more finely finished surfaces than locally produced wares and may have been valued for their exotic qualities and fine workmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brain|first= Jeffrey P.|title= Winterville-Late Prehistoric Culture Contact In the Lower Mississippi Valley| year= 1989 |publisher= Mississippi Department of Archives and History|isbn= 0-938896-58-X|pages= 69–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yangju highway incident''', also known as the '''Yangju training accident''' or '''Highway 56 Accident''', occurred on June 13, 2002, in [[Yangju]], [[Gyeonggi-do]], [[South Korea]]. A [[United States Army]] [[M60 AVLB|armored vehicle-launched bridge]], returning to base in [[Uijeongbu]] on a public road after training maneuvers in the countryside, struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls, Shin Hyo-sun ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 신효순) and Shim Mi-seon ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 심미선).

The American soldiers involved were found not guilty of [[negligent homicide]] in the [[court martial]], further inflaming [[Anti-American sentiment in Korea|anti-American sentiment in South Korea]]. The memory of the two schoolgirls is commemorated annually in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2003/06/nis-e0609-15.htm South Korea Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
[[File:Map Yangju-si.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Yangju]]]]

A U.S. military convoy from the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of [[Eighth United States Army]] set out to undertake a training exercise at a range approximately 20 kilometers (12 mi) north of metropolitan Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/07/31/kor_ed3__1.php Don Kirk, "Road Accident Galvanizes the Country: Deaths in Korea Ignite Anti-American Passion," ''International Herald Tribune''], July 31, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the convoy passed along a narrow country road near Yangju City, [[Gyeonggi Province]], one of the convoy's armored vehicles, weighing approximately 57 tons, struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls, Shim Mi-son and Shin Hyo-sun, as they walked along the side of the roadway on their way to a birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/international/asia/08KORE.html Howard W. French and Don Kirk, "American Policies and Presence Under Fire in South Korea," ''New York Times''], December 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
On July 5, 2002, as a result of this incident, and in accordance with the U.S.-ROK [[Status of Forces Agreement]] (SOFA), which stipulates that U.S. military personnel fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. military courts should they commit crimes while performing official duties, both the driver of the vehicle, Sergeant Mark Walker, and the vehicle’s commander, Sergeant Fernando Nino, were charged with "[[negligent homicide]]” under the U.S. military’s [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) for "negligently failing to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2097137.stm "US Soldiers Charged for Korean Deaths," ''BBC News: World Edition''], July 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to prosecute the two soldiers in civilian courts under South Korean law, however, on July 10, the South Korean Justice Ministry requested that the USFK command transfer jurisdiction in the case to the South Korean legal system. While the SOFA stipulates that U.S. military personnel performing official duties fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. military courts, jurisdiction can be transferred to South Korea at the discretion of the U.S. military commander.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

Citing concerns about setting a [[precedent]] in terms of allowing civilian proceedings against U.S. military personnel, then Judge Advocate of the USFK, Colonel Kent Myers, said the U.S. command would not do so, noting that the U.S. Army had waived jurisdiction only once before in a case in which the act committed was intentional and not accidental. In a statement issued by the USFK, Col. Myers noted that Walker and Nino were clearly performing assigned duties in an official capacity and were therefore subject to the UCMJ under the U.S.-ROK SOFA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2178156.stm "US Refuses Korean Justice for Soldiers," ''BBC News: World Edition''], August 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they refused the request of the South Korean Justice Ministry, American officials did, however, invite more than 30 media representatives, representatives from the South Korean Justice Ministry, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and from other South Korean non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to observe the trials. In addition, rooms with closed circuit television (CCTV) coverage were provided to accommodate the increased level of interest. Moreover, families of the victims were invited to attend and, to protect their privacy, were offered the use of a separate CCTV-equipped room staffed with an interpreter and military lawyer to explain the processes involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seoul.usembassy.gov/pi111902.html "US Leaders Emphasize Openness," News Release of the US Embassy Seoul], November 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these actions, public statements made by U.S. officials stressed the fair and impartial nature of the U.S. military legal process.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

During the proceedings, lawyers for Sgt. Nino contended that he attempted to alert Sgt. Walker to the presence of the two girls on the periphery of the road. Reports differ as to whether Sgt. Walker did not hear the order due to a defective communications device or because he had altered the frequency of his radio in order to communicate with others in the convoy.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

Sergeants Nino and Walker were subsequently found not guilty of "negligent homicide" in verdicts issued independently by two separate panels on Wednesday, November 20 and Friday, November 22, 2002. While demonstrators questioned the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of the U.S. military court and its [[verdict]], the South Korean Justice Ministry voiced dissatisfaction with the verdict, but respect for the process as employed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2497947.stm "Korean Anger as US Soldiers Cleared," ''BBC News: World Edition''], November 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquittal and expressions of anti-American sentiment==
Full apologies were issued by American civilian and military officials at various levels of authority immediately after the incident and repeated throughout the course of the legal proceedings. In addition, visits were made to the families of the two victims, and compensation was paid to the surviving family members. U.S. President George W. Bush also phoned then South Korean President [[Kim Dae-jung]] and expressed his regret over the deaths of the two South Korean schoolgirls.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

However, the acquittal of the two servicemen sparked anti-American demonstrations in various locations, termed "the biggest anti-American protests the country has seen in recent years" by a BBC report covering the December 2002 visit of then U.S. Deputy Secretary of State [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] to South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2497947.stm "US Official Met by Korean Anger," ''BBC News: World Edition''], December 10, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also suggested that presidential elections in South Korea, set to take place that same December, may have focused attention on the issue as a larger referendum on the U.S.-ROK relationship, and thus exacerbated tensions. In addition to anger, sadness, and outrage at the death of the two girls, this move sparked protests in several locations as South Koreans expressed a desire for greater control over foreign military forces stationed in South Korea and urged that the SOFA be revised accordingly. Father [[Mun Jeong Hyeon]], a Roman Catholic priest active in the anti-USFK movement, began a hunger strike outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=1912045 |title=1980s 'Reds' evolving into a broader-based anti-U.S. pressure bloc |date=6 December 2002 |work=Joongang Daily |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a leader of the Pan National Committee, during the [[Daechuri Protests|Daechuri protests]]. The [[Daechuri Protests]] were a 2005/6 protest against the expansion of Camp Humphreys, a U.S military base, in the small rural village of Daechuri. 

In addition to a series of large demonstrations at U.S. military installations and a rally attended by more than 50,000 people in Seoul during the second week of December, attacks, including fire bombings, were launched at the [[Yongsan Garrison]] and both the South Korean and American personnel responsible for guarding U.S. military installations in South Korea. In one incident in December 2002, an unarmed U.S. Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[Steven A. Boylan]], was attacked by three South Korean men wielding a knife outside the Garrison. Colonel Boylan suffered only minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2578655.stm "US Soldier Attacked in South Korea"]. BBC News: World Edition. December 16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13th June 2017, multiple K-POP stars boycotted or left the performance midway  during a US Military event for a camp stationed in Uijeongbu, citing protests by activists that the event fell on the 15th anniversary of the Yangju highway incident.

==Aftermath==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2011}}

In the months following the incident, both the U.S. military and the South Korean government took actions to attempt to address the circumstances seen as having led to the deaths of the two schoolgirls. As of August 2002, the U.S. Army banned all armored vehicles of the type involved in the June 13th accident from civilian roads. In addition, the U.S. Army announced more than 20 additional measures to improve safety during training exercises, including improvements to the notification system used to communicate with community leaders about upcoming training exercises, the installation of additional mirrors on U.S. Army vehicles to improve [[driver visibility]], and the retrofitting of additional intercom systems on U.S. military vehicles to allow for direct communication between drivers and vehicle commanders.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

Officials from Gyeonggi Province also took actions to address another issue seen to have contributed to the accident, inadequate transportation infrastructure. Reports indicated that one factor that may have contributed to the deaths of Shim Mi-son and Shin Hyo-sun, was the width and design of the roads in the area near their home village. Not only are roads in the area narrow, they do not always have space allocated along their periphery for pedestrians to use as walkways. Some have posited that this design contributes to the number of traffic accidents in South Korea in general. Given that the armored vehicles traveling in the convoy on June 13 are wider than both a typical passenger vehicle and than the lanes marked on most roads, and that the two girls were struck on the right-hand side of an uphill S-curve curving to the right, some reports posited that the design of the road where the accident occurred, and the width of the vehicles, the lanes on the road, and the road itself may have exacerbated the dangers already inherent when military vehicles operate within a civilian environment.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

As such, improvements were made to the road where the incident took place as part of a $94 million plan to improve more than {{convert|100|mi|km}} of roads throughout the province. A major focal point of the project was the completion of improvements to roads used by the 2nd Infantry Division. Officials focused on widening, straightening, and smoothing the roads, while also adding footpaths. Begun in December 2002, reports suggest the project was 85 percent complete as of February 2004 and set to be concluded by April 2004. While the South Korean national government spent almost $1 million to acquire the land necessary to widen several stretches of road, in some  cases by 2–3 feet, the cost of construction fell upon the Gyeonggi provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=19567&amp;archive=true Seth Robinson, "South Korea Widening Project to Help Prevent Repeat of 2002 Accident," ''Stars And Stripes''], February 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Čížečku, čížečku''' ("[[Eurasian siskin|Siskin]], o Little Siskin") is a traditional [[Czech language|Czech]] children's [[folk song]] and a [[singing game]] which was performed in the past as an annual custom supposed to enhance the yield of [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonín Václavík, "Výroční obyčeje a lidové umění", Československé akademie věd ([[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]]), 1959,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6sYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=cizecku+mak&amp;dq=cizecku+mak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRPeUuPPF8_coATwz4DwBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA p. 67]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is a chain of verses of the same pattern of [[call and response]]:
:''Call:''
:"Siskin, o little Siskin, a little birdie,
:Tell me o Siskin how the [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] is [[sowing|sown]]"
:''Response:''
:This is how the poppies are sowed (repeated, with variations)
In Czech language:
: Čížečku, čížečku, ptáčku maličký,
:pověz mi čížečku, jak sejou mák?
::Aj tak, tak sejou mák, aj tak, tak sejou mák,
::aj tak, tak sejou mák, tak sejou mák.
The call/response are repeated, with the verb "sown"  being replaced with other events with the poppies:
"grows", "blossoms", "is harvested", "is milled" (option: "crushed"), "is eaten". With every response the children are supposed to show a [[pantomime]] how exactly the poppy is sowed, grows,..., eaten.

It may also be arranged in the form of a dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.rvp.cz/Kabinet/Ucebni_texty/%C5%98%C3%ADkanky/Tane%C4%8Dky Tanečky: #20. ČÍŽEČKU, ČÍŽEČKU] (accessed January 21, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
