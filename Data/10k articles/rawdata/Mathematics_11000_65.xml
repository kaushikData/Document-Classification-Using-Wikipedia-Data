== History ==
AIMMS B.V. was founded in 1989 by noted mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology. His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models rather than programming. In Bisschop’s view, modeling was able to build the bridge between the people who had problems and the people helping them solve those problems. 

'''AIMMS''' (an acronym for "'''Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System'''") began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  

AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages and the creator (Johannes J. Bisschop) has been awarded with [[INFORMS]] Impact Prize for his work in this language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.informs.org/Blogs/E-News-Blog/INFORMS-Impact-Prize |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022091250/https://www.informs.org/Blogs/E-News-Blog/INFORMS-Impact-Prize |archive-date=2013-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a small private equity firm who saw the potential value of mathematics to business. This led to the creation of a partnership program, further technical investment and the evolution of the platform. In 2011, the company launched AIMMS PRO, a way to deploy applications to end-users who don't have a technical background. This was quickly followed by the ability to publish and customize applications using a browser so that decision support applications are available on any device. These innovations led to rapid customer adoption and growth for the company. In 2017, AIMMS was recognized as a top B2B technology in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.g2crowd.com/blog/technology-research/b2b-netherlands-tech-2017/|title=The State of the Netherland's B2B Tech Scene in 2017|date=2017-12-14|work=G2 Crowd|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the fastest growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aimms.com/english/news-archive/aimms-named-one-fastest-companies-netherlands-second-consecutive-year/|title=AIMMS :: AIMMS named one of the fastest growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year|website=AIMMS|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AIMMS SC Navigator Platform ==
In 2017, the product management team did a listening tour with supply chain executives. This, along with the growing interest in embedded advanced analytics for supply chain management, generated the initial idea for the AIMMS SC Navigator Platform and the democratization of supply chain analytics. SC Navigator consists of ready-made applications that are easily configurable to put supply chain analytics in the hands of supply chain professionals. 

AIMMS SC Navigator launched in October, 2017 with three initial cloud-based Apps: Supply Chain Network Design, Sales &amp; Operations Planning and Data Navigator. In 2018 two additional applications were rolled out - Center of Gravity and Product Lifecycle. Additional applications are rolling out every quarter.

==AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform==

The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an [[algebraic modeling language]], an [[integrated development environment]] for both editing models and creating a [[graphical user interface]] around these models, and a graphical end-user environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aimms.com/aimms/download/manuals/aimms_user.pdf|title=AIMMS User's Guide|last=Roelofs|first=Marcel|publisher=lulu.com|year=2010|isbn=978-0-557-06360-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
AIMMS is linked to multiple [[solver]]s through the AIMMS Open Solver Interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.aimms.com/aimms/AimmsOSI/frames.html?frmname=topic&amp;frmfile=index.html|title=AIMMS Open Solver Interface API|author=Paragon Decision Technology|year=2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Supported solvers include [[CPLEX]], [[MOSEK]], [[FICO Xpress]], CBC, Conopt, [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]] and [http://www.ilog.com/products/cpoptimizer/ CP Optimizer].

AIMMS features a mixture of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulation of optimization models takes place through declarative language elements such as sets and indices, as well as scalar and multidimensional parameters, variables and constraints, which are common to all [[algebraic modeling language]]s, and allow for a concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization. [[Units of measurement]] are natively supported in the language, and compile- and runtime unit analysis may be employed to detect modeling errors.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AIMMS for 
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* user interface event handling
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available. 
To support the re-use of common modeling components, AIMMS allows modelers to organize their model in user model [[library (computing)|libraries]].

AIMMS supports a wide range of mathematical optimization problem types:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Complementarity theory|Complementarity problems]] (MPECs)
* [[Stochastic programming]]
* [[Robust optimization]]
* [[Constraint programming]]
[[Uncertainty]] can be taken into account in [[deterministic system|deterministic]] linear and mixed integer optimization models in AIMMS through the specification of additional attributes, such that [[stochastic programming|stochastic]] or [[robust optimization|robust]] optimization techniques can be applied alongside the existing deterministic solution techniques.

Custom hybrid and decomposition algorithms can be constructed using the GMP system library which makes available at the modeling level many of the basic building blocks used internally by the higher level solution methods present in AIMMS, matrix modification methods, as well as specialized steps for customizing solution algorithms for specific problem types.

Optimization solutions created with AIMMS can be used either as a standalone [[desktop application]] or can be embedded as a [[software component]] in other applications.

==Use in industry==

AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform is used in a wide range of industries including retail, consumer products, healthcare, oil and chemicals, steel production and agribusiness.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3421">The theory of [[isometries]] in the framework of [[Banach spaces]] has its beginning in a paper by [[Stanisław Mazur]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanisław M. Ulam]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;S. Mazur and S. Ulam, ''Sur les transformationes isométriques d’espaces vectoriels normés'', C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris '''194'''(1932), 946–948.&lt;/ref&gt; They proved that each isometry of a normed real [[linear space]] onto a normed real linear space is a [[linear mapping]] up to translation. In 1970, [[Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov]] asked whether the existence of a single conservative distance for some mapping implies that it is an [[isometry]]. [[Themistocles M. Rassias]] posed the following problem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Aleksandrov–Rassias Problem.''' If ''X'' and ''Y'' are normed linear spaces and if ''T'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a continuous and/or surjective mapping which satisfies the so-called distance one preserving property (DOPP), is then ''T'' necessarily an isometry?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There have been several attempts in the mathematical literature by a number of researchers for the solution to this problem.

{{Spanish name|Ferrín}}
'''Antonia Ferrín Moreiras''' ([[Ourense]], May 13, 1914 – [[Santiago de Compostela]], August 6, 2009) was a [[mathematician]], professor and the first female [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[astronomer]]. Her main contributions to astronomy were works on [[stellar occultation]]s by the moon, measures of [[double star]]s and astrometric measurements, as well as the determination of the passage of stars through two [[vertical circle|verticals]]. She accomplished all of this while she was working at the Observatory of the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] (USC).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before the [[Spanish Civil War]], she obtained degrees in [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacy]] from the USC, earned her teaching diploma and studied Exact Sciences, the name for mathematics, for two years. She obtained her degree in mathematics in the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] some years later.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1963 she became the first Spanish woman to defend a thesis that addressed the issue of astronomy: ''Observaciones de pasos por dos verticales'' (in English, ''Observations of passages of stars through two verticals''). This thesis was also the first defended in the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Economic hardship forced her to study and work at the same time, but she earned scholarships that helped her reach her academic goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ferrín started school when she was seven years old and at only nine years old, she was ready to start high school. She did the Scientific [[Education in Spain|Bachillerato]], which is the stage of education for people over the age of 16 in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/vigo/vigo/2017/06/20/antonia-ferrin-primera-astronoma-gallega/0003_201706V20C7991.htm |title=Antonia Ferrín, la primera astrónoma gallega |date=June 20, 2017 |work=[[La Voz de Galicia]] |access-date=May 11, 2018 |language=es-ES |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, she studied the University Bachillerato, since admission to the university required the completion of this education stage, with twelve other girls.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Higher education and professional career ===
Ferrin started her higher education studies in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC, at a time when chemistry was the only major offered. Even though her father worked in the Faculty of Pharmacy, his income was not enough, so she obtained free tuition and scholarships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With such financial support, she could earn a degree in chemistry and the title of Schoolteacher in 1935.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She started working immediately after she graduated, but her first jobs were not paid. From 1934 to 1936, Ferrín worked as training assistant teacher of [[physics]] and mathematics in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC and as temporary assistant teacher in the Department of Science of the high school Arcebispo Xelmírez in Santiago de Compostela.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the same time, she was pursuing a pharmacy degree and the only two courses of Exact Sciences that the USC offered. In 1937, she started working as mathematics teacher in the orphan girls’ school Nuestra Señora de los Remedios, a position she held until 1948.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1937, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she was sanctioned because of her political convictions,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and an anonymous complaint lead to the opening of her file.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, she was removed from her duties as university teacher along with 45 other teachers. In 1940, however, she got her case reviewed, the sentence was revoked and she could teach again. After her removal, she restarted teaching at the university and sometimes she gave lessons in the girls' school until 1961.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the academic year 1939–1940, Ferrin completed the prerequisite courses for the pharmacy degree. It was during this time that she met Ramón María Aller,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the founder and director of the Astronomical Observatory of the USC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ztfnews.wordpress.com/2014/05/13/centenario-del-nacimiento-de-antonia-ferrin-moreiras/|title=Centenario del nacimiento de Antonia Ferrín Moreiras|last=Macho |first=M. |date=May 13, 2014 |website=Blog de la Facultad de Ciencia y Tecnologia |publisher=Universidad del País Vasco| language=Spanish|access-date=June 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the person who made it possible for her to become the first female Galician astronomer.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2009/08/10/actualidad/1249855211_850215.html|title=Fallece Antonia Ferrín Moreiras, primera astrónoma gallega|last=Montesinos |first=Benjamín |date=August 10, 2009 |work=[[El País]] |language=Spanish|access-date=June 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that observatory, Ferrín started to use the [[passage instrument]] and the {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}} [[refracting telescope]], which allowed her to visualize the concealment of stars by the [[moon]], the passage of stars through two [[Vertical circle|verticals]], or micrometric measurements of double stars. The results of these investigations were published in the Spanish magazine of astronomy, ''Urania''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ferrín recalled anecdotally that it was really cold while she was doing her research in the observatory. She never wore trousers because, according to her, it was a piece of clothing that “was not considered feminine and only the more daring movie actresses wore them on the big screen.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1950, she received a scholarship from the [[Spanish National Research Council]] to conduct research in the Astronomical Observatory of Santiago. This scholarship became a contract of research assistantship two years later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the same year, she obtained a degree in mathematics from the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], even though she was a guest student for the last three courses of the degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1953, she passed the civil service examinations for professor of mathematics in the Escuela de Magisterio of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.matematicalia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1809&amp;Itemid=5 |title=Fallece Antonia Ferrín Moreiras|last=|first=|date=August 10, 2009 |magazine=Matematicalia |publisher=| issn=1699-7700 |language=Spanish|access-date=June 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two years later, she transferred to the girls’ school Isabel la Católica of Santiago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1954 until 1956 she studied to earn a [[doctorate]] in astronomy in Madrid. In the meantime, she helped professor Vidal Abascal to create the degree in mathematics in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC, a feat accomplished in 1957.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Ferrín became the first female professor of this faculty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, she continued her research under the direction of Ramón María Aller.

The thesis that she defended in 1963 with the help of Aller, even though he was 80 years old, was probably her greatest accomplishment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; not only because it was the first read in the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.farodevigo.es/sociedad-cultura/2013/01/20/medio-siglo-primera-astronoma-gallega/743860.html |title=Medio siglo de la primera astrónoma gallega |last=|first=|date=January 20, 2013 |work=[[Faro de Vigo]] |language=Spanish| access-date=June 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the first one defended by a woman addressing the issue of astronomy in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mujeresconciencia.com/2014/05/13/antonia-ferrin-moreiras-primera-astronoma-gallega/|title=Antonia Ferrín Moreiras, primera astrónoma gallega |last=|first=|date=May 13, 2014 |website=Mujeres con ciencia |publisher=Cátedra de Cultura Científica de la [[Universidad del País Vasco]] |language=Spanish |access-date=June 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, she was appointed as full-time professor of mathematics in the Escuela de Magisterio Santa María in Madrid and she also worked as professor of mathematics in the degree of medicine for two years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, she taught astronomy and [[celestial mechanics]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/sociedad/2009/08/11/0003_7900585.htm|title=Fallece Antonia Ferrín Moreiras, pionera en las matemáticas y la astronomía gallega|last=Juanatey |first=Héctor |date=August 11, 2009 |work=[[La Voz de Galicia]]|language=Spanish|access-date=June 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; she served in management, and sat on the selection boards. She also participated in the first international meetings of mathematics that were carried out in Spain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, in spite of her great professional career, being a woman sometimes stood in the way of her aspirations. For example, when Aller got sick in 1964, a substitute was needed so that Aller’s chair of astronomy in the observatory could continue. Even though she applied for the public examination, she was excluded. She was considered as an applicant following a complaint, but the chair was declared void and the observatory deteriorated.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Ferrín retired in 1984.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://igualmat.uvigo.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AntoniaFerr%C3%ADnMoreiras_es.pdf|title=Antonia Ferrín Moreiras |last=Verdejo |first=Amelia |date=|format=PDF |publisher=[[University of Vigo]] |language=Spanish|access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors ==
On May 24, 2008, she was proclaimed as the patroness of the fiftieth anniversary of the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5650">In [[mathematics]] &amp;mdash; specifically, in [[functional analysis]] &amp;mdash; an '''Asplund space''' or '''strong differentiability space''' is a type of [[well-behaved]] [[Banach space]].  Asplund spaces were introduced in 1968 by the [[mathematician]] [[Edgar Asplund]], who was interested in the [[Fréchet derivative|Fréchet differentiability]] properties of [[Lipschitz function]]s on Banach spaces.

==Equivalent definitions==

There are many equivalent definitions of what it means for a Banach space ''X'' to be an '''Asplund space''':
* ''X'' is Asplund if, and only if, every [[separable space|separable subspace]] ''Y'' of ''X'' has separable [[continuous dual space]] ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.
* ''X'' is Asplund if, and only if, every [[continuous function|continuous]] [[convex function]] on any [[open set|open]] [[convex set|convex subset]] ''U'' of ''X'' is Fréchet differentiable at the points of a [[dense set|dense]] [[Gδ set|''G''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;delta;''&lt;/sub&gt;-subset]] of ''U''.
* ''X'' is Asplund if, and only if, its dual space ''X''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; has the [[Radon–Nikodym property|Radon–Nikodým property]].  This property was established by Namioka &amp; Phelps in 1975 and Stegall in 1978.
* ''X'' is Asplund if, and only if, every non-empty [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of its dual space ''X''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; has [[weak topology|weak-&amp;lowast;-slices]] of arbitrarily small diameter.
* ''X'' is Asplund if and only if every non-empty weakly-∗ [[compact set|compact]] [[convex set|convex]] subset of the dual space ''X''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the weakly-∗ closed [[convex hull]] of its weakly-∗ strongly [[exposed point]]s.  In 1975, Huff &amp; Morris showed that this property is equivalent to the statement that every bounded, closed and convex subset of the dual space ''X''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is closed convex hull of its extreme points.

==Properties of Asplund spaces==

* The class of Asplund spaces is closed under topological isomorphisms:  that is, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are Banach spaces, ''X'' is Asplund, and ''X'' is [[homeomorphic]] to ''Y'', then ''Y'' is also an Asplund space.
* Every [[closed set|closed]] [[linear subspace]] of an Asplund space is an Asplund space.
* Every [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of an Asplund space is an Asplund space.
* The class of Asplund spaces is closed under extensions:  if ''X'' is a Banach space and ''Y'' is an Asplund subspace of ''X'' for which the quotient space ''X''&amp;nbsp;⁄&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is Asplund, then ''X'' is Asplund.
* Every locally Lipschitz function on an open subset of an Asplund space is Fréchet differentiable at the points of some dense subset of its domain.  This result was established by [[David Preiss|Preiss]] in 1990 and has applications in optimization theory.
* The following theorem from Asplund's original 1968 paper is a good example of why non-Asplund spaces are badly behaved:  if ''X'' is not an Asplund space, then there exists an equivalent norm on ''X'' that fails to be Fréchet differentiable at every point of ''X''.
* In 1976, Ekeland &amp; Lebourg showed that if ''X'' is a Banach space that has an equivalent norm that is Fréchet differentiable away from the origin, then ''X'' is an Asplund space.  However, in 1990, Haydon gave an example of an Asplund space that does not have an equivalent norm that is [[Gâteaux derivative|Gâteaux differentiable]] away from the origin.

In [[game theory]], '''Bayesian regret''' is the average difference between the [[utility]] of a strategy and an ideal utility where desired outcomes are maximized. 

The term ''Bayesian'' refers to [[Thomas Bayes]] (1702–1761), who proved a special case of what is now called [[Bayes' theorem]], who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical data analysis using what is now known as [[Bayesian inference]].

==Social choice theory==
In [[social choice theory]], Bayesian regret is the average difference in [[Social welfare function|social utility]] between the chosen candidate and the best candidate. It is only measurable if it is possible to know the voters' true numerical utility for each candidate – that is, in [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of virtual elections. The term Bayesian is somewhat a misnomer, really meaning only "average probabilistic"; there is no standard or objective way to create distributions of voters and candidates.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The Bayesian regret concept was recognized as useful (and used) for comparing single-winner voting systems by Bordley and Merrill, and it also was invented independently by R. J. Weber.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Bordley attributed it (and the whole idea of the usefulness of "social" utility, that is, summed over all people in the population) to [[John Harsanyi]] in 1955.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Economics==
This term has been used to compare a random buy-and-hold strategy to professional traders' records. This same concept has  received numerous different names, as the New York Times notes: 

"In 1957, for example, a statistician named James Hanna called his theorem Bayesian Regret. He had been preceded by David Blackwell, also a statistician, who called his theorem Controlled Random Walks. Other, later papers had titles like 'On Pseudo Games', 'How to Play an Unknown Game', 'Universal Coding' and 'Universal Portfolios'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/weekinreview/pity-the-scientist-who-discovers-the-discovered.html|title=Pity the Scientist Who Discovers the Discovered|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=2006-02-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-27|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5660">'''Böttcher's equation''' is the [[functional equation]] 
::&lt;math&gt;F(h(z)) = (F(z))^n  &lt;/math&gt;
where 
* {{mvar|h}} is a given [[analytic function]] with a superattracting [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of order {{mvar|n}} at {{mvar|a}}, (that is, &lt;math&gt; h(z)=a+c(z-a)^n+O((z-a)^{n+1})  ~,&lt;/math&gt; in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of {{mvar|a}}), with ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 
* {{math|''F''}} is a sought function.  
The [[logarithm]] of this functional equation amounts to [[Schröder's equation]].
==Name==
The equation is named after [[Lucjan Böttcher]]. 

==Solution==
Solution of [[functional equation]] is a [[Function_(mathematics)|function]] in [[Implicit function|implicit form]]. 

[[Lucjan Böttcher|Lucian Emil Böttcher]] sketched a proof in 1904 on the existence of solution: an analytic function ''F'' in a neighborhood of the fixed point ''a'', such that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Böttcher |first=L. E. |year=1904 |title=The principal laws of convergence of iterates and their application to analysis (in Russian)|journal=Izv. Kazan. Fiz.-Mat. Obshch. |volume=14 |issue= |pages=155&amp;ndash;234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt;F(a)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This solution is sometimes  called:
* the Böttcher coordinate 
* the Böttcher function&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1920-021-03/S0002-9947-1920-1501149-6/S0002-9947-1920-1501149-6.pdf J. F. Ritt. On the iteration of rational functions . Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 21 (1920) 348-356. MR 1501149.]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* [[External ray|the Boettcher map]]
The complete proof was published by [[Joseph Ritt]] in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.|first=Joseph|last=Ritt|authorlink=Joseph Ritt|title=On the iteration of rational functions|volume=21|pages=348–356|issue=3|doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1920-1501149-6|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was unaware of the original formulation.&lt;ref name=stawiska13&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Stawiska|first= Małgorzata|eprint=1307.7778 |title=Lucjan Emil Böttcher (1872–1937) - The Polish Pioneer of Holomorphic Dynamics|class= math.HO|date=November 15, 2013|&lt;!--page=9--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first protein (outer circle) has the sequence a-b-c. After the permutation the second protein (inner circle) has the sequence c-a-b. The letters N and C indicate the location of the amino- and carboxy-termini of the protein sequences and how their positions change relative to each other.]]

A '''circular permutation''' is a relationship between [[protein]]s whereby the proteins have a changed order of [[amino acid]]s in their [[peptide sequence]]. The result is a [[protein structure]] with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – [[concanavalin A]] and [[lectin]] – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.

Circular permutation can occur as the result of [[evolution]]ary events, [[posttranslational modification]]s, or [[protein engineering|artificially engineered]] mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are ''permutation by duplication'' and ''fission and fusion''. Permutation by duplication occurs when a [[gene]] undergoes [[gene duplication|duplication]] to form a [[tandem repeat]], before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between [[prosaposin|saposin]] and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in [[NAD(P)+ transhydrogenase (Si-specific)|nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases]].

Circular permutations are routinely engineered in the laboratory to improve their [[catalysis|catalytic activity]] or [[thermostability]], or to investigate properties of the original protein.

Traditional [[algorithm]]s for [[list of sequence alignment software|sequence alignment]] and [[structural alignment software|structure alignment]] are not able to detect circular permutations between proteins. New [[nonlinear system|non-linear]] approaches have been developed that overcome this and are able to detect [[protein topology|topology]]-independent similarities.

==History==
[[File:Concanavalin A vs Lectin.png|thumb|250px|Two proteins that are related by a circular permutation. [[Concanavalin A]] (left), from the Protein Data Bank ({{PDB|3cna}}), and peanut [[lectin]] (right), from {{PDB|2pel}}, which is homologous to favin. The termini of the proteins are highlighted by blue and green spheres, and the sequence of residues is indicated by the gradient from blue (N-terminus) to green (C-terminus). The 3D fold of the two proteins is highly similar; however, the N- and C- termini are located on different positions of the protein.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt;]]

In 1979, Bruce Cunningham and his colleagues discovered the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunningham BA, Hemperly JJ, Hopp TP, Edelman GM | title = Favin versus concanavalin A: Circularly permuted amino acid sequences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 76 | issue = 7 | pages = 3218–22 | date = July 1979 | pmid = 16592676 | pmc = 383795 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.76.7.3218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After determining the peptide sequence of the [[lectin]] protein favin, they noticed its similarity to a known protein&amp;nbsp;– [[concanavalin A]]&amp;nbsp;– except that the ends were circularly permuted. Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Einspahr H, Parks EH, Suguna K, Subramanian E, Suddath FL | title = The crystal structure of pea lectin at 3.0-A resolution | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 261 | issue = 35 | pages = 16518–27 | date = December 1986 | pmid = 3782132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and showed that concanavalin A is permuted [[Posttranslational modification|post-translationally]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrington DM, Auffret A, Hanke DE | title = Polypeptide ligation occurs during post-translational modification of concanavalin A | journal = Nature | volume = 313 | issue = 5997 | pages = 64–7 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3965973 | doi = 10.1038/313064a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation.&lt;ref name="Bowles1988"/&gt;

After the discovery of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by [[Chemical ligation|chemically ligating]] the termini to create a [[cyclic peptide|cyclic protein]], then introducing new termini elsewhere using [[trypsin]].&lt;ref name="Goldenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldenberg DP, Creighton TE | title = Circular and circularly permuted forms of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 165 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–13 | date = April 1983 | pmid = 6188846 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(83)80265-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, [[Karolin Luger]] and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA.&lt;ref name="Luger1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luger K, Hommel U, Herold M, Hofsteenge J, Kirschner K | title = Correct folding of circularly permuted variants of a beta alpha barrel enzyme in vivo | journal = Science | volume = 243 | issue = 4888 | pages = 206–10 | date = January 1989 | pmid = 2643160 | doi = 10.1126/science.2643160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.&lt;ref name="Luger1989" /&gt;

Despite the early discovery of post-translational circular permutations and the suggestion of a possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular permutants, it was not until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered. [[Saposin]]s are a class of proteins involved in [[sphingolipid]] catabolism and [[antigen presentation]] of [[lipid]]s in humans. [[Chris Ponting]] and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant [[aspartic proteinase]], which they nicknamed [[plant-specific insert|swaposin]].&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ponting CP, Russell RB | title = Swaposins: circular permutations within genes encoding saposin homologues | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 179–80 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7610480 | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0004(00)89003-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

Hundreds of examples of protein pairs related by a circular permutation were subsequently discovered in nature or produced in the laboratory. As of February 2012, the Circular Permutation Database&lt;ref name=CircularPermutationDatabase&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sarst.life.nthu.edu.tw/cpdb/ |title=Circular Permutation Database |first1=Wei-Cheng |last1=Lo |first2=Chi-Ching |last2=Lee |first3=Che-Yu |last3=Lee |first4=Ping-Chiang |last4=Lyu | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Institute of Bioinformatics and Structural Biology, [[National Tsing Hua University]] |access-date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains 2,238 circularly permuted protein pairs with known structures, and many more are known without structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lo WC, Lee CC, Lee CY, Lyu PC | title = CPDB: a database of circular permutation in proteins | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = Database issue | pages = D328-32 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18842637 | pmc = 2686539 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CyBase database collects proteins that are cyclic, some of which are permuted variants of cyclic wild-type proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaas Q, Craik DJ | title = Analysis and classification of circular proteins in CyBase | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 94 | issue = 5 | pages = 584–91 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20564021 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/bip.21424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SISYPHUS is a database that contains a collection of hand-curated manual alignments of proteins with non-trivial relationships, several of which have circular permutations.&lt;ref name="Andreeva"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreeva A, Prlić A, Hubbard TJ, Murzin AG | title = SISYPHUS--structural alignments for proteins with non-trivial relationships | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = Database issue | pages = D253-9 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17068077 | pmc = 1635320 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
There are two main models that are currently being used to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins: ''permutation by duplication'' and ''fission and fusion''. The two models have compelling examples supporting them, but the relative contribution of each model in evolution is still under debate.&lt;ref name="Weiner06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner J, Bornberg-Bauer E | title = Evolution of circular permutations in multidomain proteins | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 734–43 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16431849 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msj091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, less common, mechanisms have been proposed, such as "cut and paste"&lt;ref name="Bujnicki02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bujnicki JM | title = Sequence permutations in the molecular evolution of DNA methyltransferases | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11914127 | pmc = 102321 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[exon shuffling]]".&lt;ref name="Jung" /&gt;

===Permutation by duplication===
[[File:Permutation by Duplication.svg|thumb|left|The permutation by duplication mechanism for producing a circular permutation. First, a gene 1-2-3 is duplicated to form 1-2-3-1-2-3. Next, a start codon is introduced before the first domain 2 and a stop codon after the second domain 1, removing redundant sections and resulting in a circularly permuted gene 2-3-1.]]

The earliest model proposed for the evolution of circular permutations is the permutation by duplication mechanism.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt; In this model, a precursor gene first undergoes a [[gene duplication|duplication]] and fusion to form a large [[tandem repeat]]. Next, [[genetic code#Start/stop codons|start and stop codons]] are introduced at corresponding locations in the duplicated gene, removing redundant sections of the protein.

One surprising prediction of the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated version of the protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have been extensively documented in protein families such as [[DNA methyltransferase]]s.&lt;ref name="Jeltsch"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeltsch A | title = Circular permutations in the molecular evolution of DNA methyltransferases | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–4 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10368444 | doi = 10.1007/pl00006529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saposin and swaposin====
[[File:Saposin Swaposin.svg|thumb|right|Suggested relationship between saposin and swaposin. They could have evolved from a similar gene.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Both consist of four alpha helices with the order of helices being permuted relative to each other.]]

An example for permutation by duplication is the relationship between saposin and swaposin. [[Prosaposin|Saposins]] are highly conserved [[glycoprotein]]s, approximately 80 amino acid residues long and forming a four [[Alpha helix|alpha helical]] structure. They have a nearly identical placement of cysteine residues and glycosylation sites. The [[cDNA]] sequence that codes for saposin is called [[prosaposin]]. It is a precursor for four cleavage products, the saposins A, B, C, and D. The four saposin domains most likely arose from two tandem duplications of an ancestral gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hazkani-Covo E, Altman N, Horowitz M, Graur D | title = The evolutionary history of prosaposin: two successive tandem-duplication events gave rise to the four saposin domains in vertebrates | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 30–4 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11734895 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00239-001-0014-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This repeat suggests a mechanism for the evolution of the relationship with the [[plant-specific insert]] (PSI). The PSI is a domain exclusively found in plants, consisting of approximately 100 residues and found in plant [[aspartic proteinase|aspartic proteases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guruprasad K, Törmäkangas K, Kervinen J, Blundell TL | title = Comparative modelling of barley-grain aspartic proteinase: a structural rationale for observed hydrolytic specificity | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 352 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–6 | date = September 1994 | pmid = 7925961 | doi = 10.1016/0014-5793(94)00935-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the saposin-like protein family (SAPLIP) and has the N- and C- termini "swapped", such that the order of helices is 3-4-1-2 compared with saposin, thus leading to the name "swaposin".&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruhn05"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruhn H | title = A short guided tour through functional and structural features of saposin-like proteins | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 389 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 249–57 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15992358 | pmc = 1175101 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20050051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fission and fusion===
[[File:Fission-fusion (genetics).svg|thumb|left|The fission and fusion mechanism of circular permutation. Two separate genes arise (potentially from the fission of a single gene). If the genes fuse together in different orders in two orthologues, a circular permutation occurs.]]

Another model for the evolution of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins. These may represent two independent polypeptides (such as two parts of a [[heterodimer]]), or may have originally been halves of a single protein that underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides.

The two proteins can later fuse together to form a single polypeptide. Regardless of which protein comes first, this fusion protein may show similar function. Thus, if a fusion between two proteins occurs twice in evolution (either between [[Homology (biology)#Paralogy|paralogues]] within the same species or between [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologues]] in different species) but in a different order, the resulting fusion proteins will be related by a circular permutation.

Evidence for a particular protein having evolved by a fission and fusion mechanism can be provided by observing the halves of the permutation as independent polypeptides in related species, or by demonstrating experimentally that the two halves can function as separate polypeptides.&lt;ref name=lee11&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee J, Blaber M | title = Experimental support for the evolution of symmetric protein architecture from a simple peptide motif | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–30 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21173271 | pmc = 3017207 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1015032108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transhydrogenases====
[[File:Transhydrogenase Circular Permutations.svg|thumb|300px|right|Transhydrogenases in various organisms can be found in three different domain arrangements. In [[cattle]], the three domains are arranged sequentially. In the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli|E.&amp;nbsp;coli]]'', ''[[Rhodobacter|Rb.&amp;nbsp;capsulatus]]'', and ''[[Rhodospirillum rubrum|R.&amp;nbsp;rubrum]]'', the transhydrogenase consists of two or three subunits. Finally, transhydrogenase from the protist ''[[Eimeria tenella|E.&amp;nbsp;tenella]]'' consists of a single subunit that is circularly permuted relative to cattle transhydrogenase.&lt;ref name="Hatefi1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatefi Y, Yamaguchi M | title = Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase: a model for utilization of substrate binding energy for proton translocation | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 444–52 | date = March 1996 | pmid = 8647343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An example for the fission and fusion mechanism can be found in [[NAD(P)+ transhydrogenase (Si-specific)|nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases]].&lt;ref name="Hatefi1996"/&gt; These are [[Cell membrane|membrane]]-bound [[enzyme]]s that catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion between [[NAD+|NAD(H)]] and [[NADPH|NADP(H)]] in a reaction that is coupled to [[Proton pump|transmembrane proton translocation]]. They consist of three major functional units (I, II, and III) that can be found in different arrangement in [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], and higher [[eukaryote]]s. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic analysis]] suggests that the three groups of domain arrangements were acquired and fused independently.&lt;ref name="Weiner06" /&gt;

===Other processes that can lead to circular permutations===

====Post-translational modification====
The two evolutionary models mentioned above describe ways in which genes may be circularly permuted, resulting in a circularly permuted [[mRNA]] after [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Proteins can also be circularly permuted via [[post-translational modification]], without permuting the underlying gene.  Circular permutations can happen spontaneously through [[autocatalysis]], as in the case of [[concanavalin A]].&lt;ref name="Bowles1988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bowles DJ, Pappin DJ | title = Traffic and assembly of concanavalin A | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 60–4 | date = February 1988 | pmid = 3070848 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0004(88)90030-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, permutation may require [[restriction enzyme]]s and [[ligase]]s.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg"/&gt;

==Role in protein engineering==
Many proteins have their termini located close together in 3D space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thornton JM, Sibanda BL | title = Amino and carboxy-terminal regions in globular proteins | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 167 | issue = 2 | pages = 443–60 | date = June 1983 | pmid = 6864804 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(83)80344-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YuLutz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu Y, Lutz S | title = Circular permutation: a different way to engineer enzyme structure and function | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–25 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21087800 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2010.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it is often possible to design circular permutations of proteins. Today, circular permutations are generated routinely in the lab using standard genetics techniques.&lt;ref name=Luger1989 /&gt; Although some permutation sites prevent the protein from [[protein folding|folding]] correctly, many permutants have been created with nearly identical structure and function to the original protein.

The motivation for creating a circular permutant of a protein can vary. Scientists may want to improve some property of the protein, such as:
* '''Reduce [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] susceptibility.''' The rate at which proteins are broken down can have a large impact on their activity in cells. Since termini are often accessible to [[protease]]s, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.&lt;ref name="Whitehead09"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead TA, Bergeron LM, Clark DS | title = Tying up the loose ends: circular permutation decreases the proteolytic susceptibility of recombinant proteins | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 607–13 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19622546 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzp034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Improve [[catalysis|catalytic activity]].''' Circularly permuting a protein can sometimes increase the rate at which it catalyzes a chemical reaction, leading to more efficient proteins.&lt;ref name="Cheltsov01"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheltsov AV, Barber MJ, Ferreira GC | title = Circular permutation of 5-aminolevulinate synthase.

* '''Alter substrate or [[ligand binding]].'''

Alternately, scientists may be interested in properties of the original protein, such as:

* '''Find insertion sites for other proteins.''' Inserting one protein as a domain into another protein can be useful.

==Algorithmic detection==
Many [[list of sequence alignment software|sequence alignment]] and [[structural alignment software|protein structure alignment algorithms]] have been developed assuming linear data representations and as such are not able to detect circular permutations between proteins.&lt;ref name="Weiner05" /&gt; Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are [[dynamic programming]] and many [[hidden Markov model]]s.&lt;ref name="Weiner05" /&gt; As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are able to detect [[protein topology|topology]]-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming.&lt;ref name="Weiner05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bachar93" /&gt; The table below is a collection of such methods.

The algorithms are classified according to the type of input they require. ''Sequence''-based algorithms require only the sequence of two proteins in order to create an alignment.&lt;ref name="Uliel99" /&gt; Sequence methods are generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins.&lt;ref name="Uliel99" /&gt; ''Structure''-based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered.&lt;ref name="Bliven10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prlic A, Bliven S, Rose PW, Bluhm WF, Bizon C, Godzik A, Bourne PE | title = Pre-calculated protein structure alignments at the RCSB PDB website | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 26 | issue = 23 | pages = 2983–5 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20937596 | pmc = 3003546 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btq572 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often slower than sequence-based methods, but are able to detect circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity.&lt;ref name="Bliven10" /&gt; Some structural methods are ''topology independent'', meaning that they are also able to detect more complex rearrangements than circular permutation.&lt;ref name="Shatsky04" /&gt;

In [[mathematical biology]], the '''community matrix''' is the [[linearization]] of the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]] at an [[equilibrium point]]. The [[eigenvalue]]s of the community matrix determine the [[Lyapunov stability|stability]] of the equilibrium point.

The Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl} 
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= x(\alpha - \beta y) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= - y(\gamma - \delta x),
\end{array} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''x''(''t'') denotes the number of prey, ''y''(''t'') the number of predators, and ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'' and ''δ'' are constants. By the [[Hartman–Grobman theorem]] the non-linear system is [[Topological conjugacy|topologically equivalent]] to a linearization of the system about an equilibrium point (''x''*, ''y''*), which has the form
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \frac{du}{dt} \\ \frac{dv}{dt} \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{A} \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' = ''x'' − ''x''* and ''v'' = ''y'' − ''y''*. In mathematical biology, the [[Jacobian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; evaluated at the equilibrium point (''x''*, ''y''*) is called the community matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Mathematical Ecology |first=Mark |last=Kot |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-00150-1 |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_IRlnNON7oC&amp;pg=PA144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[stable manifold theorem]], if one or both eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; have positive real part then the equilibrium is unstable, but if all eigenvalues have negative real part then it is stable.

In [[computer science]], a '''computation history''' is a sequence of steps taken by an [[abstract machine]] in the process of computing its result.  Computation histories are frequently used in [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] about the capabilities of certain machines, and particularly about the [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of various [[formal languages]].

Formally, a computation history is a (normally [[Finite set|finite]]) sequence of '''configurations''' of a formal [[automaton]].  Each configuration fully describes the status of the machine at a particular point.  To be valid, certain conditions must hold:
* the first configuration must be a valid initial configuration of the automaton and
* each transition between adjacent configurations must be valid according to the transition rules of the automaton.
In addition, to be '''complete''', a computation history must be finite and
* the final configuration must be a valid terminal configuration of the automaton.
The definitions of "valid initial configuration", "valid transition", and "valid terminal configuration" vary for different kinds of formal machines.

A [[deterministic]] automaton has exactly one computation history for a given initial configuration, though the history may be infinite and therefore incomplete.

== Finite State Machines ==
For a [[finite state machine]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, a configuration is simply
the current state of the machine, together with the remaining input.  The first configuration must be the initial state of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the complete input.  A transition from a configuration &lt;math&gt;(S,I)&lt;/math&gt; to
a configuration &lt;math&gt;(T,J)&lt;/math&gt; is allowed if &lt;math&gt;I=aJ&lt;/math&gt; for
some input symbol &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has a transition from
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  The final
configuration must have the empty string &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; as its remaining
input;  whether &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has accepted or rejected the input depends
on whether the final state is an accepting state. &lt;ref name="MumfordJain2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christine L. Mumford|author2=Lakhmi C. Jain|title=Computational Intelligence: Collaboration, Fusion and Emergence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eECU8WrC99wC&amp;pg=PA337|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-01798-8|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turing Machines ==

Computation histories are more commonly used in reference to [[Turing machines]].  The configuration of a single-tape Turing machine consists of the contents of the tape, the position of the read/write head on the tape, and the current state of the associated state machine;  this is usually written

&lt;math&gt;...0011010101q00110101010...&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the current state of the machine, represented in some
way that's distinguishable from the tape language, and where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is
positioned immediately before the position of the read/write head.

Consider a Turing machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  The first
configuration must be &lt;math&gt;q_0 w_0 w_1 ...&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;
is the initial state of the Turing machine.  The machine's state in the final
configuration must be either &lt;math&gt;q_a&lt;/math&gt; (the accept state) or &lt;math&gt;q_r&lt;/math&gt;
(the reject state).  A configuration &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a valid successor
to configuration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; if there's a transition from the state in
&lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to the state in &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; which manipulates the
tape and moves the read/write head in a way that produces the result in
&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Blass2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andreas Blass|title=Fields of Logic and Computation: Essays Dedicated to Yuri Gurevich on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqIRT51n74YC&amp;pg=PA468|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=22 October 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15024-1|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decidability results ===

Computation histories can be used to show that certain problems for
[[pushdown automata]] are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].  This is because the language of
non-accepting computation histories of a Turing machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;
on input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-free language]] recognizable by a
non-deterministic pushdown automaton.

We encode a Turing computation history &lt;math&gt;c_0,c_1,...,c_n&lt;/math&gt; as the
string &lt;math&gt;C_0 \# C^r_1 \# C_2 \# C^r_3 \# ... \# C_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;
is the encoding of configuration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, as discussed above, and where
every other configuration is written in reverse.  Before reading a particular
configuration, the pushdown automaton makes a non-deterministic choice
to either ignore the configuration or read it completely onto the stack.

* If the pushdown automaton decides to ignore the configuration, it simply reads and discards it completely and makes the same choice for the next one.
* If it decides to process the configuration, it pushes it completely onto the stack, then verifies that the next configuration is a valid successor according to the rules of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  Since successive configurations are always written in opposite orders, this can be done by, for each tape symbol in the new configuration, popping off a symbol from the stack and checking if they're the same.  Where they disagree, it must be accountable for by a valid transition of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  If, at any point, the automaton decides that the transition is invalid, it immediately enters a special accept state which ignores the rest of the input and accepts at the end.

In addition, the automaton verifies that the first configuration is the correct
initial configuration (if not, it accepts) and that the state of the final
configuration of the history is the accept state (if not, it accepts).  Since
a non-deterministic automaton accepts if there's any valid way for it to accept,
the automaton described here will discover if the history is not a valid
accepting history and will accept if so, and reject if not. &lt;ref name="Blum1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lenore Blum|title=Complexity and real computation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxtrVqUP-AwC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-98281-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This same trick cannot be used to recognize ''accepting'' computation histories
with an NPDA, since non-determinism could be used to skip past a test that would
otherwise fail.  A linear-bounded Turing machine is sufficient to recognize
accepting computation histories.

This result allows us to prove that &lt;math&gt;ALL_{PDA}&lt;/math&gt;, the language
of pushdown automata which accept all input, is undecidable.  Suppose
we have a decider for it, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.  For any Turing machine
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, we can form the pushdown automaton
&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which accepts non-accepting computation histories for that
machine.  &lt;math&gt;D(P)&lt;/math&gt; will accept if and only if there are no
accepting computation histories for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;; this
would allow us to decide &lt;math&gt;A_{TM}&lt;/math&gt;, which we know to be undecidable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2976">In [[type theory]], '''containers''' are abstractions which permit various "collection types", such as [[list (computing)|lists]] and [[tree (data structure)|trees]], to be represented in a uniform way. A ([[unary operation|unary]]) container is defined by a type of ''shapes'' S and a type family of ''positions'' P, indexed by S. The ''extension'' of a container is a family of dependent pairs consisting of a shape (of type S) and a function from positions of that shape to the element type. Containers can be seen as [[canonical form]]s for collection types.&lt;ref name='containers'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael Abbott |author2=Thorsten Altenkirch |author3=Neil Ghani |year=2005 |title=Containers: Constructing strictly positive types  |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=342 |issue=1 |pages=3–27 |doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2005.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For lists, the shape type is the [[natural number]]s (including zero). The corresponding position types are the types of natural numbers less than the shape, for each shape.

For trees, the shape type is the type of trees of units (that is, trees with no information in them, just structure). The corresponding position types are isomorphic to the types of valid paths from the root to particular nodes on the shape, for each shape.

Note that the natural numbers are isomorphic to lists of units. In general the shape type will always be isomorphic to the original non-generic container type family (list, tree etc.) applied to unit.

One of the main motivations for introducing the notion of containers is to support [[generic programming]] in a [[dependent type|dependently typed]] setting.&lt;ref name='containers'/&gt;

== Categorical aspects ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
The extension of a container is an [[endofunctor]]. It takes a function &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; to

&lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(s,f\right).\left(s,g\circ f\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the familiar &lt;code&gt;map g&lt;/code&gt; in the case of lists, and does something similar for other containers.

== Indexed containers ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
'''Indexed containers''' (also known as '''dependent polynomial functors''') are a generalisation of containers, which can represent a wider class of types, such as vectors (sized lists).&lt;ref name='indexed-containers'&gt;{{cite journal
| author         = Thorsten Altenkirch, Neil Ghani, Peter Hancock, [[Conor McBride]], and Peter Morris
| title          = Indexed Containers
| version        = Unpublished manuscript
| url            = http://strictlypositive.org/indexed-containers.pdf
| format         = PDF
| accessdate     = 2008-10-30
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The element type (called the ''input type'') is indexed by shape and position, so it can vary by shape and position, and the extension (called the ''output type'') is also indexed by shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">In [[finance]], '''delta neutral''' describes a portfolio of related financial securities, in which the portfolio value remains unchanged when small changes occur in the value of the underlying security. Such a [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] typically contains [[option (finance)|options]] and their corresponding underlying securities such that positive and negative [[Greeks (finance)|delta]] components offset, resulting in the portfolio's value being relatively insensitive to changes in the value of the underlying security.

A related term, delta hedging is the process of setting or keeping the [[Greeks (finance)|delta]] of a [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] as close to zero as possible.  In practice, maintaining a zero delta is very complex because there are risks associated with re-hedging on large movements in the underlying stock's price, and research indicates portfolios tend to have lower cash flows if re-hedged too frequently.&lt;ref&gt;De Weert F.  {{ISBN|0-470-02970-6}} pp. 74-81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;  The sensitivity of an option's value to a change in the underlying stock's price.

&lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;     The initial value of the option.

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;       The current value of the option.

&lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt;     The initial value of the underlying stock.

==Mathematical interpretation==
{{main|Greeks (finance)}}
Delta measures the sensitivity of the value of an option to changes in the price of the underlying stock assuming all other variables remain unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quantprinciple.com/invest/index.php/docs/quant_strategies/delta_neutral_hedging_strategies/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, delta is represented as [[partial derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial V}{\partial S}&lt;/math&gt; 
of the option's [[fair value]] with respect to the price of the [[underlying|underlying security]].

Delta is clearly a function of S, however Delta is also a function of [[strike price]] and time to expiry.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quantprinciple.com/invest/index.php/docs/quant_strategies/delta_neutral_hedging_strategies/&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, if a position is delta neutral (or, instantaneously delta-hedged) its instantaneous change in value, for an [[infinitesimal]] change in the value of the underlying security, will be zero; see [[Hedge (finance)]]. Since [[Greeks (finance)|''delta'']] measures the exposure of a [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] to changes in the value of the underlying, a portfolio that is delta neutral is effectively [[Hedge (finance)|hedged]]. That is, its overall value will not change for small changes in the price of its underlying instrument.

==Creating the position==
'''Delta hedging''' - i.e. establishing the required hedge -  may be accomplished by buying or selling an amount of the underlier that corresponds to the [[Greeks (finance)|delta]] of the portfolio.  By adjusting the amount bought or sold on new positions, the portfolio delta can be made to sum to zero, and the portfolio is then delta neutral. See [[Rational pricing#Delta hedging|Rational pricing delta hedging]].

Options [[market maker]]s, or others, may form a delta neutral portfolio using related options instead of the underlying. The portfolio's delta (assuming the same underlier) is then the sum of all the individual options' deltas.  This method can also be used when the underlier is difficult to trade, for instance when an underlying [[stock]] is hard to borrow and therefore cannot be [[short selling|sold short]].

==Theory==
The existence of a delta neutral portfolio was shown as part of the original proof of the [[Black–Scholes model]], the first comprehensive model to produce correct prices for some classes of options. See [[Black–Scholes model#Derivations|Black-Scholes: Derivation]].

From the [[Taylor expansion]] of the value of an option, we get the change in the value of an option, &lt;math&gt;C(s) \,&lt;/math&gt;, for a change in the value of the underlier &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon\,)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; C(s + \epsilon\,) = C(s) + \epsilon\,C'(s) + {1/2}\,\epsilon^2\, C''(s) + ...&lt;/math&gt;

::where &lt;math&gt; C'(s) = \Delta\,&lt;/math&gt;(delta) and &lt;math&gt;C''(s) = \Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;(gamma); see [[Greeks (finance)]].

For any small change in the underlier, we can ignore the [[Orders of approximation#Second-order|second-order term]] and use the quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta\,&lt;/math&gt; to determine how much of the underlier to buy or sell to create a hedged portfolio. However, when the change in the value of the underlier is not small, the second-order term, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be ignored: see [[Convexity (finance)]].

In practice, maintaining a delta neutral portfolio requires continuous recalculation of the position's [[Greeks (finance)|Greeks]] and rebalancing of the underlier's position. Typically, this rebalancing is performed daily or weekly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12968">In [[mathematics]], a '''Dirichlet problem''' is the problem of finding a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which solves a specified [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) in the interior of a given region that takes prescribed values on the boundary of the region.

The Dirichlet problem can be solved for many PDEs, although originally it was posed for [[Laplace's equation]].  In that case the problem can be stated as follows:

:Given a function ''f'' that has values everywhere on the boundary of a region in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, is there a unique [[continuous function]] ''u'' twice continuously differentiable in the interior and continuous on the boundary, such that ''u'' is [[harmonic function|harmonic]] in the interior and ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f'' on the boundary?

This requirement is called the [[Dirichlet boundary condition]].  The main issue is to prove the existence of a solution; uniqueness can be proved using the [[maximum principle]].

==History==
The Dirichlet problem goes back to  [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]]  who studied the problem on general domains with general boundary conditions in his ''Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism'', published in 1828. He reduced the problem into a problem of constructing what we now call Green's functions, and argued that Green's
function exists for any domain. His methods were not rigorous by today's standards, but the
ideas were highly influential in the subsequent developments.
The next steps in the study of the Dirichlet's problem were taken by [[Karl Friedrich Gauss]],  William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) and [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] after whom the problem was named and the solution to the problem (at least for the ball) using the Poisson kernel was known to Dirichlet (judging by his 1850 paper submitted to the Prussian academy). Lord Kelvin and Dirichlet suggested a solution to the problem by a variational method based on the minimization of "Dirichlet's energy". According to Hans Freudenthal (in the ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', vol 11), [[Bernhard Riemann]] was the first mathematician who solved this variational problem based on a method which he called [[Dirichlet's principle]]. The existence of a unique solution is very plausible by the 'physical argument': any charge distribution on the boundary should, by the laws of [[electrostatics]], determine an [[electrical potential]] as solution. However, [[Karl Weierstrass]] found a flaw in Riemann's argument, and a rigorous proof of existence was found only in 1900 by [[David Hilbert]], using his [[direct method in the calculus of variations]]. It turns out that the existence of a solution depends delicately on the smoothness of the boundary and the prescribed data.

==General solution==
For a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; having a sufficiently smooth boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial D&lt;/math&gt;, the general solution to the Dirichlet problem is given by

:&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int_{\partial D} \nu(s) \frac{\partial G(x,s)}{\partial n} ds&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Green's function]] for the partial differential equation, and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial G(x,s)}{\partial n} = \widehat{n} \cdot \nabla_s G (x,s) = \sum_i n_i \frac{\partial G(x,s)}{\partial s_i}&lt;/math&gt;

is the derivative of the Green's function along the inward-pointing unit normal vector &lt;math&gt;\widehat{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  The integration is performed on the boundary, with [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;\nu(s)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the unique solution to the [[Fredholm integral equation]] of the second kind,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = -\frac{\nu(x)}{2} + \int_{\partial D} \nu(s) \frac{\partial G(x,s)}{\partial n} ds.&lt;/math&gt;

The Green's function to be used in the above integral is one which vanishes on the boundary:

:&lt;math&gt;G(x,s)=0&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;s\in \partial D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in D&lt;/math&gt;. Such a Green's function is usually a sum of the free-field Green's function and a harmonic solution to the differential equation.

===Existence===
The Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions always has a solution, and that solution is unique, when the boundary is sufficiently smooth and &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. More precisely, it has a solution when

:&lt;math&gt;\partial D \in C^{1,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C^{1,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hölder condition]].

==Example: the unit disk in two dimensions==
In some simple cases the Dirichlet problem can be solved explicitly.  For example, the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the unit disk in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is given by the [[Poisson integral formula]].

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function on the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial D&lt;/math&gt; of the open unit disk &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution to the Dirichlet problem is &lt;math&gt;u(z)&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;u(z) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\psi})
\frac {1-\vert z \vert ^2}{\vert 1-ze^{-i\psi}\vert ^2} d \psi &amp; \mbox{if }z \in D \\
 f(z) &amp; \mbox{if }z \in \partial D. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The solution &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the closed unit disk &lt;math&gt;\bar{D}&lt;/math&gt; and harmonic on &lt;math&gt;D.&lt;/math&gt;

The integrand is known as the [[Poisson kernel]]; this solution follows from the Green's function in two dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;G(z,x) = -\frac{1}{2\pi} \log \vert z-x\vert + \gamma(z,x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma(z,x)&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_x \gamma(z,x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

and chosen such that &lt;math&gt;G(z,x)=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in \partial D&lt;/math&gt;.

==Methods of solution==
For bounded domains, the Dirichlet problem can be solved using the [[Perron method]], which relies on the [[maximum principle]] for [[subharmonic function]]s. This approach is described in many text books.&lt;ref&gt;See for example:
*{{harvnb|John|1982}}
*{{harvnb|Bers|John|Schechter|1979}}
*{{harvnb|Greene|Krantz|2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is not well-suited to describing smoothness of solutions when the boundary is smooth. Another classical [[Hilbert space]] approach through [[Sobolev space]]s does yield such information.&lt;ref&gt;See for example:
*{{harvnb|Bers|John|Schechter|1979}}
*{{harvnb|Chazarain|Piriou|1982}}
*{{harvnb|Taylor|2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The solution of the Dirichlet problem using [[Sobolev spaces for planar domains]] can be used to prove the smooth version of the [[Riemann mapping theorem]]. {{harvtxt|Bell|1992}} has outlined a different approach for establishing the smooth Riemann mapping theorem, based on the [[reproducing kernel]]s of Szegő and Bergman, and in turn used it to solve the Dirichlet problem. The classical methods of [[potential theory]] allow the Dirichlet problem to be solved directly in terms of [[integral operator]]s, for which the standard theory of [[compact operator|compact]] and [[Fredholm operator]]s is applicable. The same methods work equally for the [[Neumann problem]].
&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Folland|1995}}
*{{harvnb|Bers|John|Schechter|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
Dirichlet problems are typical of [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s, and [[potential theory]], and the [[Laplace equation]] in particular. Other examples include the [[biharmonic equation]] and related equations in [[elasticity theory]].

They are one of several types of classes of PDE problems defined by the information given at the boundary, including [[Neumann problem]]s and [[Cauchy problem]]s.

==Example - equation of a finite string attached to one moving wall==

Let us consider the Dirichlet problem for the [[wave equation]] which describes a string attached between walls with one end
attached permanently and with the other moving with the constant velocity i.e. the [[d'Alembert equation]]
on the triangular region of the [[Cartesian product]] of the space and the time:
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{}^2}{\partial t^2}u(x,t) - \frac{\partial{}^2}{\partial x^2} u(x,t)  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;u(0,t)= 0&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;u(\lambda t, t)=0 &lt;/math&gt;

As one can easily check by substitution that the solution fulfilling the first condition is
:: &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)= f(t-x) - f(x+t)&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally we want
:: &lt;math&gt;f(t-\lambda t) - f(\lambda t+t)=0&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting
:: &lt;math&gt;\tau=(\lambda +1) t&lt;/math&gt;

we get the condition of [[self-similarity]]

&lt;math&gt;f(\gamma \tau) = f(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\gamma= \frac{1-\lambda}{\lambda +1} &lt;/math&gt;

It is fulfilled for example by the [[composite function]]
&lt;math&gt;\sin[\log(e^{2 \pi} x)]= \sin[\log(x)]&lt;/math&gt;

with

&lt;math&gt;\lambda=e^{2\pi}=1^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;

thus in general

&lt;math&gt;f(\tau) = g[\log(\gamma \tau)]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a [[periodic function]] with a period &lt;math&gt;\log(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g[\tau+\log(\gamma)]= g(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

and we get the general solution

:: &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)=g[\log(t-x)] - g[\log(x+t)]&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Distance''' is a numerical [[measurement]] of how far apart objects are. In [[physics]] or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical [[length]] or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. "two counties over"). In most cases, "distance from A to B" is interchangeable with "distance from B to A". In [[mathematics]], a distance function or [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] is a generalization of the concept of physical distance. A metric is a function that behaves according to a specific set of rules, and is a way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be "close to" or "far away from" each other.

==Overview and definitions==

===Physical distances===
[[File:Greatcircle Jetstream routes.svg|thumb|400px|Airline routes between [[Los Angeles]] and [[Tokyo]] approximately follow a direct [[great circle]] route (top), but use the [[jet stream]] (bottom) when heading eastwards.  Note that the shortest route appears as a curve rather than a straight line because this map is a [[Mercator projection]], which does not scale all distances equally compared to the real spherical surface of the Earth.]]
[[File:Manhattan distance.svg|thumb|200px|"Manhattan distance" on a grid]]

A physical distance can mean several different things:
* The length of a specific path traveled between two points, such as the distance walked while navigating a maze
* The length of a specific path that returns to the starting point, such as a ball thrown straight up, or the Earth when it completes one [[orbit]].
[[File:Distance board in Vizag.jpg|thumb|A board showing distances near [[Visakhapatnam]]]]
* The length of the shortest possible path through space, between two points, that could be taken if there were no obstacles (usually formalized as [[Euclidean distance]])
* The length of the shortest path between two points while remaining on some surface, such as the [[great-circle distance]] along the [[Figure of the Earth|curve of the Earth]]

"Circular distance" is the distance traveled by a wheel, which can be useful when designing vehicles or mechanical gears. The circumference of the wheel is 2''&amp;pi;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;radius, and assuming the radius to be&amp;nbsp;1, then each revolution of the wheel is equivalent of the distance 2''&amp;pi;'' radians. In engineering ''&amp;omega;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''&amp;pi;&amp;fnof;'' is often used, where ''&amp;fnof;'' is the [[frequency]].

Unusual definitions of distance can be helpful to model certain physical situations, but are also used in theoretical mathematics:
* "[[Manhattan distance]]" is a rectilinear distance, named after the number of blocks north, south, east, or west a taxicab must travel on to reach its destination on the grid of streets in parts of New York City.
* "Chessboard distance", formalized as [[Chebyshev distance]], is the minimum number of moves a king must make on a [[chessboard]] to travel between two squares.

[[Distance measures (cosmology)|Distance measures in cosmology]] are complicated by the [[expansion of the universe]], and by effects described by the [[theory of relativity]] such as [[length contraction]] of moving objects.

===Theoretical distances===

The term "distance" is also used by analogy to measure non-physical entities in certain ways.

In computer science, there is the notion of the "[[edit distance]]" between two strings.  For example, the words "dog" and "dot", which vary by only one letter, are closer than "dog" and "cat", which differ by three letters.  This idea is used in [[spell checker]]s and in [[coding theory]], and is mathematically formalized in several different ways, such as:
* [[Levenshtein distance]]
* [[Hamming distance]]
* [[Lee distance]]
* [[Jaro–Winkler distance]]

In mathematics, a [[metric space]] is a set for which distances between all members of the set are defined.  In this way, many different types of "distances" can be calculated, such as for traversal of graphs, comparison of distributions and curves, and using unusual definitions of "space" (for example using a [[manifold]] or [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]]).  The notion of [[Distance (graph theory)|distance in graph theory]] has been used to describe [[social network]]s, for example with the [[Erdős number]] or the [[Bacon number]], the number of collaborative relationships away a person is from prolific mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] or actor [[Kevin Bacon]], respectively.

In psychology, human geography, and the social sciences, distance is often theorized not as an objective metric, but as a subjective experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 |title=Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography |journal=Geoforum |volume=75 |pages=249 |year=2016 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distance versus directed distance and displacement ==
[[File:Distancedisplacement.svg|thumb|Distance along a path compared with displacement]]
Both distance and displacement measure the movement of an object. Distance cannot be [[negative number|negative]], and never decreases. Distance is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, or a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]].  Whereas [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] is a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] quantity with both magnitude and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]. It can be negative, zero, or positive. Directed distance does not measure movement, it measures the separation of two points, and can be a positive, zero, or negative vector.&lt;ref name="ittcKU"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Directed Distance |url=http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jstiles/220/handouts/The%20Directed%20Distance.pdf |website=Information and Telecommunication Technology Center |publisher=University of Kansas |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110044317/http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jstiles/220/handouts/The%20Directed%20Distance.pdf |archivedate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance covered by a vehicle (for example as recorded by an [[odometer]]), person, animal, or object along a curved path from a point ''A'' to a point ''B'' should be distinguished from the straight-line distance from ''A'' to ''B''. For example, whatever the distance covered during a round trip from ''A'' to ''B'' and back to ''A'', the displacement is zero as start and end points coincide. In general the straight-line distance does not equal distance travelled, except for journeys in a straight line.

=== Directed distance ===

Directed distances can be determined along straight lines and along curved lines.

Directed distances along straight lines are vectors that give the distance and direction between a starting point and an ending point. A directed distance of a point ''C'' from point ''A'' in the direction of ''B'' on a line ''AB'' in a [[Euclidean vector space]] is the distance from ''A'' to ''C'' if ''C'' falls on the ray ''AB'', but is the negative of that distance if ''C'' falls on the ray ''BA'' (I.e., if ''C'' is not on the same side of ''A'' as ''B'' is). I.e. the directed distance from the New York City Main Library flag pole to the Statue of Liberty flag pole has: 
* a starting point: library flag pole
* an ending point: statue flag pole
* a direction: -38°
* a distance: 8.72 km

Another kind of directed distance is that between two different particles or point masses at a given time. For instance, the distance from the [[center of gravity]] of the Earth ''A'' and the center of gravity of the Moon ''B'' (which does not strictly imply motion from ''A'' to ''B'') falls into this category.

A directed distance along a curved line is not a vector and is represented by a segment of that curved line defined by endpoints ''A'' and ''B'', with some specific information indicating the sense (or direction) of an ideal or real motion from one endpoint of the segment to the other (see figure). For instance, just labelling the two endpoints as ''A'' and ''B'' can indicate the sense, if the ordered sequence (''A'', ''B'') is assumed, which implies that ''A'' is the starting point.

===Displacement===

A displacement (see above) is a special kind of directed distance defined in [[mechanics]]. A directed distance is called displacement when it is the distance along a straight line (minimum distance) from ''A'' and ''B'', and when ''A'' and ''B'' are positions occupied by the ''same particle'' at two ''different instants'' of time. This implies [[motion (physics)|motion]] of the particle. The distance traveled by a particle must always be greater than or equal to its displacement, with equality occurring only when the particle moves along a straight path.

==Mathematics==
{{see also|Metric (mathematics)}}

===Geometry===
In [[analytic geometry]], the distance between two points of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|xy-plane]] can be found using the distance formula.  The distance between (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;d=\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, given points (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in [[Cartesian coordinate system|three-space]], the distance between them is:
:&lt;math&gt;d=\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2+(\Delta z)^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
These formula are easily derived by constructing a right triangle with a leg on the [[hypotenuse]] of another (with the other leg [[orthogonal]] to the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] that contains the 1st triangle) and applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]].
In the study of complicated geometries, we call this (most common) type of distance [[Euclidean distance]], as it is derived from the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which does not hold in [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]. This distance [[formula]] can also be expanded into the [[arc length|arc-length formula]].

===Distance in Euclidean space===
In the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, the distance between two points is usually given by the [[Euclidean distance]] (2-norm distance).  Other distances, based on other [[norm (mathematics)|norms]], are sometimes used instead.

For a point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and a point (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), the '''[[Minkowski distance]]''' of order ''p'' ('''''p''-norm distance''') is defined as:
{| cellpadding="2"
| 1-norm distance || &lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=1}^n \left| x_i - y_i \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 2-norm distance || &lt;math&gt; = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \left| x_i - y_i \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| ''p''-norm distance ||&lt;math&gt; = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \left| x_i - y_i \right|^p \right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| infinity norm distance ||&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{p \to \infty} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \left| x_i - y_i \right|^p \right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; = \max \left(|x_1 - y_1|,  |x_2 - y_2|,  \ldots, |x_n - y_n| \right).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

''p'' need not be an integer, but it cannot be less than 1, because otherwise the [[triangle inequality]] does not hold.

The 2-norm distance is the [[Euclidean distance]], a generalization of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] to more than two [[coordinates]]. It is what would be obtained if the distance between two points were measured with a [[ruler]]: the "intuitive" idea of distance.

The 1-norm distance is more colourfully called the ''taxicab norm'' or ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]]'', because it is the distance a car would drive in a city laid out in square blocks (if there are no one-way streets).

The infinity norm distance is also called [[Chebyshev distance]]. In 2D, it is the minimum number of moves [[king (chess)|king]]s require to travel between two squares on a [[chessboard]].

The ''p''-norm is rarely used for values of ''p'' other than 1, 2, and infinity, but see [[super ellipse]].

In physical space the Euclidean distance is in a way the most natural one, because in this case the length of a [[rigid body]] does not change with [[rotation]].

===Variational formulation of distance===
The Euclidean distance between two points in space (&lt;math&gt;A = \vec{r}(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \vec{r}(T)&lt;/math&gt;) may be written in a [[calculus of variations|variational]] form where the distance is the minimum value of an integral:

: &lt;math&gt;
D = \int_0^T \sqrt{\left({\partial \vec{r}(t) \over \partial t}\right)^2} \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the trajectory (path) between the two points. The value of the integral (D) represents the length of this trajectory. The distance is the minimal value of this integral and is obtained when &lt;math&gt;r = r^{*}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal trajectory. In the familiar Euclidean case (the above integral) this optimal trajectory is simply a straight line. It is well known that the shortest path between two points is a straight line. Straight lines can formally be obtained by solving the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] for the above [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]. In [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] manifolds (curved spaces) where the nature of the space is represented by a [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; the integrand has to be modified to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g^{ac}\dot{r}_c g_{ab}\dot{r}^b}&lt;/math&gt;, where [[Einstein summation convention]] has been used.

===Generalization to higher-dimensional objects===
The Euclidean distance between two objects may also be generalized to the case where the objects are no longer points but are higher-dimensional [[manifolds]], such as space curves, so in addition to talking about distance between two points one can discuss concepts of distance between two strings. Since the new objects that are dealt with are extended objects (not points anymore) additional concepts such as non-extensibility, [[curvature]] constraints, and non-local interactions that enforce non-crossing become central to the notion of distance. The distance between the two manifolds is the [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar quantity]] that results from minimizing the generalized distance functional, which represents a transformation between the two manifolds:

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal {D} = \int_0^L\int_0^T \left \{ \sqrt{\left({\partial \vec{r}(s,t) \over \partial t}\right)^2} + \lambda \left[\sqrt{\left({\partial \vec{r}(s,t) \over \partial s}\right)^2} - 1\right] \right\} \, ds \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The above double integral is the generalized distance functional between two polymer conformation. &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a spatial parameter and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is pseudo-time. This means that &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}(s,t=t_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the polymer/string conformation at time &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and is parameterized along the string length by &lt;math&gt; s&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}(s=S,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the trajectory of an infinitesimal segment of the string during transformation of the entire string from conformation &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}(s,0)&lt;/math&gt; to conformation &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}(s,T)&lt;/math&gt;. The term with cofactor &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lagrange multiplier]] and its role is to ensure that the length of the polymer remains the same during the transformation. If two discrete polymers are inextensible, then the minimal-distance transformation between them no longer involves purely straight-line motion, even on a Euclidean metric. There is a potential application of such generalized distance to the problem of [[protein folding]]&lt;ref&gt;SS Plotkin, PNAS.2007; 104: 14899–14904,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AR Mohazab, SS Plotkin,"Minimal Folding Pathways for Coarse-Grained Biopolymer Fragments" Biophysical Journal, Volume 95, Issue 12, Pages 5496–5507&lt;/ref&gt;
This generalized distance is analogous to the [[Nambu–Goto action]] in [[string theory]], however there is no exact correspondence because the Euclidean distance in 3-space is inequivalent to the spacetime distance minimized for the classical relativistic string.

=== Algebraic distance ===
{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}
This is a metric often used in [[computer vision]] that can be minimized by [[least squares]] estimation. [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/FISHER/ALGDIST/alg.htm][http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/FISHER/CIRCLEFIT/fit2dcircle/node3.html]  For curves or surfaces given by the equation &lt;math&gt;x^\text{T} C x=0&lt;/math&gt; (such as a [[Conic#Homogeneous coordinates|conic in homogeneous coordinates]]), the algebraic distance from the point &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; to the curve is simply &lt;math&gt;x'^\text{T} C x'&lt;/math&gt;.
It may serve as an "initial guess" for [[geometric distance]] to refine estimations of the curve by more accurate methods, such as [[non-linear least squares]].

===General metric===
In [[mathematics]], in particular [[geometry]], a [[Metric (mathematics)|distance function]] on a given [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''M'' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] {{nowrap|''d'': ''M'' × ''M'' → '''R'''}}, where '''R''' denotes the set of [[real number]]s, that satisfies the following conditions:
*{{nowrap|''d''(''x'',''y'') ≥ 0}}, and {{nowrap|1=''d''(''x'',''y'') = 0}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.  (Distance is positive between two different points, and is zero precisely from a point to itself.)
*It is [[Symmetric relation|symmetric]]: {{nowrap|1=''d''(''x'',''y'') = ''d''(''y'',''x'')}}.  (The distance between ''x'' and ''y'' is the same in either direction.)
*It satisfies the [[triangle inequality]]: {{nowrap|''d''(''x'',''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'',''y'') + ''d''(''y'',''z'')}}.  (The distance between two points is the shortest distance along any path). Such a distance function is known as a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]].  Together with the set, it makes up a [[metric space]].

For example, the usual definition of distance between two real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' is: {{nowrap|1=''d''(''x'',''y'') = {{abs|''x'' − ''y''}}}}. This definition satisfies the three conditions above, and corresponds to the standard [[topology]] of the [[real line]]. But distance on a given set is a definitional choice. Another possible choice is to define: {{nowrap|1=''d''(''x'',''y'') = 0}} if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}, and 1 otherwise. This also defines a metric, but gives a completely different topology, the "[[discrete topology]]"; with this definition numbers cannot be arbitrarily close.

===Distances between sets and between a point and a set===
[[File:Distance between sets.svg|thumb| ''d''(''A'',&amp;nbsp;''B'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''d''(''A'',&amp;nbsp;''C'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d''(''C'',&amp;nbsp;''B'')]]
Various distance definitions are possible between objects. For example, between celestial bodies one should not confuse the surface-to-surface distance and the center-to-center distance. If the former is much less than the latter, as for a [[low earth orbit]], the first tends to be quoted (altitude), otherwise, e.g. for the Earth–Moon distance, the latter.

There are two common definitions for the distance between two non-empty [[subset]]s of a given [[metric space]]:
*One version of distance between two non-empty sets is the [[infimum]] of the distances between any two of their respective points, which is the everyday meaning of the word, i.e.
::&lt;math&gt;d(A,B)=\inf_{x\in A, y\in B} d(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;
:This is a symmetric [[premetric space|premetric]]. On a collection of sets of which some touch or overlap each other, it is not "separating", because the distance between two different but touching or overlapping sets is zero. Also it is not [[hemimetric space|hemimetric]], i.e., the [[triangle inequality]] does not hold, except in special cases. Therefore only in special cases this distance makes a collection of sets a [[metric space]].
*The [[Hausdorff distance]] is the larger of two values, one being the [[supremum]], for a point ranging over one set, of the infimum, for a second point ranging over the other set, of the distance between the points, and the other value being likewise defined but with the roles of the two sets swapped. This distance makes the set of non-empty [[compact space|compact]] subsets of a metric space itself a [[metric space]].

The [[Metric space#Distance between points and sets; Hausdorff distance and Gromov metric|distance between a point and a set]] is the infimum of the distances between the point and those in the set. This corresponds to the distance, according to the first-mentioned definition above of the distance between sets, from the set containing only this point to the other set.

In terms of this, the definition of the Hausdorff distance can be simplified: it is the larger of two values, one being the supremum, for a point ranging over one set, of the distance between the point and the set, and the other value being likewise defined but with the roles of the two sets swapped.

===Graph theory===

In [[graph theory]] the [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] between two vertices is the length of the shortest [[path (graph theory)|path]] between those vertices.

===Other mathematical "distances"===
*[[Canberra distance]] – a weighted version of Manhattan distance, used in computer science
*[[Energy distance]], the statistical distance between probability distributions
*[[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], which measures the difference between two probability distributions
*[[Mahalanobis distance]] is used in [[statistics]]

The '''FISH (FIbonacci SHrinking)''' [[stream cipher]] is a fast [[software]] based stream cipher using [[Lagged Fibonacci generator]]s, plus a concept from the [[shrinking generator]] cipher. It was published by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] in 1993. FISH is quite fast in software and has a huge [[key length]]. However, in the same paper where he proposed [[Pike (cipher)|Pike]], [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] showed that FISH can be broken with just a few thousand [[bit]]s of known [[plaintext]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15489">In [[mathematics]], the '''falling factorial''' (sometimes called the '''descending factorial''',&lt;ref name="Steffensen" /&gt; '''falling sequential product''', or '''lower factorial''') is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;(x)_n\ =\ x^{\underline{n}}\ =\ x(x{-}1)(x{-}2)\cdots(x{-}n{+}1)\ =\ \prod_{k=1}^n(x{-}k{+}1)\ =\ \prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(x{-}k).&lt;/math&gt;

The '''rising factorial''' (sometimes called the '''Pochhammer function''', '''Pochhammer polynomial''', '''ascending factorial''',&lt;ref name = "Steffensen"&gt;{{Citation | last = Steffensen | first = J. F. | authorlink = Johan Frederik Steffensen
| title = Interpolation | publisher = Dover Publications |edition = 2nd
| location = | page = 8 | url = | isbn = 0-486-45009-0}} (A reprint of the 1950 edition by Chelsea Publishing Co.)&lt;/ref&gt; '''rising sequential product''', or '''upper factorial''') is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;x^{(n)}\ =\ x^{\overline{n}}\ =\ x(x{+}1)(x{+}2)\cdots(x{+}n{-}1)\ =\ \prod_{k=1}^n(x{+}k{-}1) \ =\  \prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(x{+}k). &lt;/math&gt;

The value of each is taken to be 1 (an [[empty product]]) when ''n'' = 0. These symbols are collectively called
'''factorial powers'''.&lt;ref name="The Art of Computer Programming"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knuth |title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]] |volume=Vol. 1 |edition=3rd |page=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pochhammer symbol '''introduced by [[Leo August Pochhammer]] is the notation {{math|(''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''n''}} is a [[non-negative integer]]. Depending on the context the Pochhammer symbol may represent either the rising factorial or the falling factorial as defined above. Care needs to be taken to check which interpretation is being used in any particular article. Pochhammer himself actually used {{math|(''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with yet another meaning, namely to denote the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom xn&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Knuth"&gt;{{citation|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|title=Two notes on notation|year=1992|authorlink1=Donald Knuth|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=99|issue=5|pages=403–422|arxiv=math/9205211|doi=10.2307/2325085|jstor=2325085}}. The remark about the Pochhammer symbol is on page 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article the symbol {{math|(''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used to represent the falling factorial and the symbol {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} is used for the rising factorial.  These conventions are used in [[combinatorics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olver|1999|p=101}} &lt;/ref&gt; although Knuth's underline/overline notations &lt;math&gt;x^{\underline{n}},x^{\overline{n}}&lt;/math&gt; are increasingly popular.&lt;ref name="The Art of Computer Programming" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Hirst, Mossinghoff, ''Combinatorics and Graph Theory'', Springer (2008), Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the theory of [[special functions]] (in particular the [[hypergeometric function]]) the Pochhammer symbol {{math|(''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used to represent the rising factorial.&lt;ref&gt;so is the case in Abramowitz and Stegun's "Handbook of Mathematical Functions", P. 256&lt;/ref&gt;
A useful list of formulas for manipulating the rising factorial in this last notation is given in {{harv|Slater|1966|loc=Appendix I}}.
 
When {{math|''x''}} is a positive integer, {{math|(''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} gives the number of [[Twelvefold way#case i|{{math|''n''}}-permutations]] of an {{math|''x''}}-element set, or equivalently the number of [[injective function|injective]] functions from a set of size {{math|''n''}} to a set of size&amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}. However, for these meanings other notations like {{math|&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and ''P''(''x,n'') are commonly used. The Pochhammer symbol serves mostly for more algebraic uses, for instance when {{math|''x''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], in which case {{math|(''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} designates a particular [[polynomial]] of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''x''}}. Feller&lt;ref&gt;William Feller, ''An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications'', Vol. 1, Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; describes {{math|(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as "the number of ways to arrange ''n'' flags on ''x'' flagpoles".

==Examples==
The first few rising factorials are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;x^{(0)}=x^{\overline0}=1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^{(1)}=x^{\overline1}=x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^{(2)}=x^{\overline2}=x(x+1)=x^2+x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^{(3)}=x^{\overline3}=x(x+1)(x+2)=x^3+3x^2+2x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^{(4)}=x^{\overline4}=x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)=x^4+6x^3+11x^2+6x &lt;/math&gt;
The first few falling factorials are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;(x)_0=x^{\underline0}=1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x)_1=x^{\underline1}=x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x)_2=x^{\underline2}=x(x-1)=x^2-x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x)_3=x^{\underline3}=x(x-1)(x-2)=x^3-3x^2+2x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x)_4=x^{\underline4}=x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)=x^4-6x^3+11x^2-6x &lt;/math&gt;
The coefficients that appear in the expansions are [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]].

==Properties==
The rising and falling factorials can be used to express a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^{(n)}}{n!} = {x+n-1 \choose n} \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{(x)_n}{n!} = {x \choose n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus many identities on binomial coefficients carry over to the falling and rising factorials.

A rising factorial can be expressed as a falling factorial that starts from the other end,

:&lt;math&gt;x^{(n)} = (x + n - 1)_n ,&lt;/math&gt;

or as a falling factorial with opposite argument,

:&lt;math&gt;x^{(n)} = (-1)^n (-x)_n .&lt;/math&gt;

The rising and falling factorials are well defined in any unital [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], and therefore ''x'' can be taken to be, for example, a [[complex number]], including negative integers, or a [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients, or any [[complex-valued function]].

The rising factorial can be extended to [[real number|real]] values of {{math|''n''}} using the [[Gamma function]] provided {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''}} are real numbers that are not negative integers:

:&lt;math&gt;x^{(n)}=\frac{\Gamma(x+n)}{\Gamma(x)},&lt;/math&gt;

and so can the falling factorial:

:&lt;math&gt;(x)_n=\frac{\Gamma(x+1)}{\Gamma(x-n+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''D''}} denotes [[derivative|differentiation]] with respect to {{math|''x''}}, one has

:&lt;math&gt;D^n(x^a) = (a)_n\,\, x^{a-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Pochhammer symbol is also integral to the definition of the [[hypergeometric function]]: The hypergeometric function is defined for |''z''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 by the [[power series]]

:&lt;math&gt;\,_2F_1(a,b;c;z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {a^{(n)} b^{(n)}\over c^{(n)}} \, {z^n \over n!} &lt;/math&gt;

provided that ''c'' does not equal 0, −1, −2, ... .  Note, however, that the hypergeometric function literature uses the notation &lt;math&gt;{(a)}_{{n}}&lt;/math&gt; for rising factorials.

==Relation to umbral calculus==
The falling factorial occurs in a formula which represents [[polynomial]]s using the forward [[difference operator]] {{math|Δ}} and which is formally similar to [[Taylor's theorem]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) \ = \ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\Delta^n\! f(0)}{n!}\,(x)_n.
&lt;/math&gt; 
In this formula and in many other places, the falling factorial {{math|(''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the calculus of [[finite difference]]s plays the role of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} in differential calculus. Note for instance the similarity of
&lt;math&gt;\Delta (x)_n = n (x)_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;D x^n = n x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  

A similar result holds for the rising factorial.

The study of analogies of this type is known as [[umbral calculus]]. A  general theory covering such relations, including the falling and rising factorial functions, is given by the theory of [[binomial type|polynomial sequences of binomial type]] and [[Sheffer sequence]]s. Rising and falling factorials are Sheffer sequences of binomial type, as shown by the relations:

:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^{(n)} = \sum_{j=0}^n {n \choose j} (a)^{(n-j)}(b)^{(j)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)_n = \sum_{j=0}^n {n \choose j} (a)_{n-j}(b)_{j}&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients are the same as the ones in the expansion of a power of a binomial ([[Chu–Vandermonde identity#Chu–Vandermonde identity|Chu–Vandermonde identity]]).

Similarly, the generating function of Pochhammer polynomials then amounts to the umbral exponential,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (x)_n  ~\frac{t^n}{n!} = (1+t)^x ~, &lt;/math&gt;

as  Δ(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t'')&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t'' )&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Connection coefficients and identities ==

The falling and rising factorials are related to one another through the [[Lah numbers]] and through sums for integral powers of a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; involving the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]] in the following forms where &lt;math&gt;\binom{r}{k} = r^{\underline{k}} / k!&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the factorials and binomials|url=http://functions.wolfram.com/GammaBetaErf/Factorial/introductions/FactorialBinomials/05/|website=Wolfram Functions Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x^{\underline{n}} &amp; = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \frac{n!}{k!} \times (x)_k \\
                  &amp; = (-1)^n (-x)_n = (x-n+1)_n = \frac{1}{(x+1)^{\overline{-n}}} \\ 
(x)_n &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (n-1)^{\underline{n-k}} \times x^{\underline{k}} \\ 
      &amp; = (-1)^n (-x)^{\underline{n}} = (x+n-1)^{\underline{n}} = \frac{1}{(x-1)^{\underline{-n}}} \\
      &amp; = \binom{-x}{n} (-1)^n n! \\
      &amp; = \binom{x+n-1}{n} n! \\
x^n &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \left\{\begin{matrix} n \\ n-k \end{matrix} \right\} x^{\underline{n-k}} \\
    &amp; = \sum_{k=0}^n \left\{\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix} \right\}(-1)^{n-k} (x)_k. 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the falling factorials are a basis for the [[polynomial ring]], we can re-express the product of two of them as a linear combination of falling factorials:

:&lt;math&gt;(x)_m (x)_n = \sum_{k=0}^m {m \choose k} {n \choose k} k!\, (x)_{m+n-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients of the (''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&amp;minus;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, called '''connection coefficients''', have a combinatorial interpretation as the number of ways to identify (or glue together) {{math|''k''}} elements each from a set of size {{math|''m''}} and a set of size {{math|''n''}}.
We also have a connection formula for the ratio of two Pochhammer symbols given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x)_n}{(x)_i} = (x+i)_{n-i},\ n \geq i. &lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, we can expand generalized exponent laws and negative rising and falling powers through the following identities:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
x^{\underline{m+n}} &amp; = x^{\underline{m}} (x-m)^{\underline{n}} \\ 
(x)_{m+n} &amp; = (x)_m (x+m)_n \\ 
(x)_{-n} &amp; = \frac{1}{(x-n)_n} = \frac{1}{(x-1)^{\underline{n}}} \\ 
x^{\underline{-n}} &amp; = \frac{1}{(x+1)_n} = \frac{1}{n! \binom{x+n}{n}} = \frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2) \cdots (x+n)}. 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, [[duplication formula|duplication]] and [[multiplication formula]]s for the rising factorials provide the next relations:

:&lt;math&gt;(x)_{k+mn} = (x)_k m^{mn} \prod_{j=0}^{m-1} \left(\frac{x+j+k}{m}\right)_n,\ m \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;(ax+b)_n = x^n \prod_{k=0}^{x-1} \left(a+\frac{b+k}{x}\right)_{n/x},\ x \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;(2x)_{2n} = 2^{2n} (x)_n \left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)_n. &lt;/math&gt;

==Alternate notations==

An alternate notation for the rising factorial

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\overline{m}}=\overbrace{x(x+1)\ldots(x+m-1)}^{m \text{ factors}} \qquad \text{for integer } m\ge0,&lt;/math&gt;

and for the falling factorial

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\underline{m}}=\overbrace{x(x-1)\ldots(x-m+1)}^{m \text{ factors}} \qquad \text{for integer } m\ge0;&lt;/math&gt;

goes back to A. Capelli (1893) and L. Toscano (1939), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;According to Knuth, ''The Art of Computer Programming'', Vol. 1, 3rd ed., p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, Knuth and Patashnik&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald L. Graham]], [[Donald E. Knuth]] and [[Oren Patashnik]] in their book ''[[Concrete Mathematics]]'' (1988), Addison-Wesley, Reading MA. {{ISBN|0-201-14236-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;47,48&lt;/ref&gt;  propose to pronounce these expressions as "{{math|''x''}} to the {{math|''m''}} rising" and "{{math|''x''}} to the {{math|''m''}} falling", respectively.

Other notations for the falling factorial include {{math|''P''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')}}, {{math|&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|P&lt;sub&gt;''x'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or {{math|&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  (See [[permutation]] and [[combination]].)

An alternate notation for the rising factorial {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the less common {{math|(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. When the notation {{math|(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used for the rising factorial, the notation {{math|(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is typically used for the ordinary falling factorial to avoid confusion.&lt;ref name=Knuth /&gt;

==Generalizations==
The Pochhammer symbol has a generalized version called the [[generalized Pochhammer symbol]], used in multivariate [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. There is also a [[q-analog|''q''-analogue]], the [[q-Pochhammer symbol|''q''-Pochhammer symbol]].

A generalization of the falling factorial in which a function is evaluated on a descending arithmetic sequence of integers and the values are multiplied is:

:&lt;math&gt;[f(x)]^{k/-h}=f(x)\cdot f(x-h)\cdot f(x-2h)\cdots f(x-(k-1)h),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&amp;minus;''h''}} is the decrement and {{math|''k''}} is the number of factors. The corresponding generalization of the rising factorial is

:&lt;math&gt;[f(x)]^{k/h}=f(x)\cdot f(x+h)\cdot f(x+2h)\cdots f(x+(k-1)h).&lt;/math&gt;

This notation unifies the rising and falling factorials, which are [''x'']&lt;sup&gt;''k''/1&lt;/sup&gt; and [''x'']&lt;sup&gt;''k''/&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

For any fixed arithmetic function &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and symbolic parameters &lt;math&gt;x, t&lt;/math&gt;, related generalized factorial products of the form

:&lt;math&gt;(x)_{n,f,t} := \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \left(x+\frac{f(k)}{t^k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

may be studied from the point of view of the classes of generalized [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] defined by the following coefficients of the powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the expansions of &lt;math&gt;(x)_{n,f,t}&lt;/math&gt; and then by the next corresponding triangular recurrence relation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
\left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix} \right]_{f,t} &amp; = [x^{k-1}] (x)_{n,f,t} \\ 
     &amp; = f(n-1) t^{1-n} \left[\begin{matrix} n-1 \\ k \end{matrix} \right]_{f,t} + \left[\begin{matrix} n-1 \\ k-1 \end{matrix} \right]_{f,t} + \delta_{n,0} \delta_{k,0}. 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;

These coefficients satisfy a number of analogous properties to those for the [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] as well as recurrence relations and functional equations related to the ''f-harmonic numbers'', &lt;math&gt;F_n^{(r)}(t) := \sum_{k \leq n} t^k / f(k)^r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04708 Combinatorial Identities for Generalized Stirling Numbers Expanding f-Factorial Functions and the f-Harmonic Numbers]'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

He received in 1883 his Ph.D. (''laurea'') in mathematics from the [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]], where he became an instructor (''libero docente'') and from 1885 to 1923 taught projective geometry.&lt;ref name="DaubenRef"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dauben, Joseph W.|editor2=Scriba, Christoph|chapter=Amodeo, Federico|title=Writing the History of Mathematics: Its Historical Development|publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag|year=2002|pages=353|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA353}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught as a professor in Naples at the Istituto Tecnico "Gianbattista Della Porta" from 1890 to 1923, when he retired.&lt;ref name=DaubenRef/&gt; In 1890–1891 he visited the geometers at the [[University of Turin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marchisotto, Elena Anne|authorlink=Elena Marchisotto|author2=Smith, James|chapter=Amodeo, Federico|title=The Legacy of Mario Pieri in Geometry and Arithmetic|year=2007|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZoYihwdxDwC&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As a historian, he specialized in the history of mathematics in Naples before 1860, which he explicated in a two-volume work entitled ''Vita matematica napoletana''; volume I (1905), volume II (1924).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1102">'''Finite element exterior calculus (FEEC)''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] framework that formulates [[finite element method]]s in the calculus of [[differential form]]s. Its main application has been a comprehensive theory for finite element methods in [[computational electromagnetism]]. FEEC has been developed in the early 2000s by [[Douglas N. Arnold]], [[Richard S. Falk]] and [[Ragnar Winther]], &lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Douglas N., Richard S. Falk, and Ragnar Winther. "Finite element exterior calculus, homological techniques, and applications." Acta numerica 15 (2006): 1-155.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Douglas, Richard Falk, and Ragnar Winther. "Finite element exterior calculus: from Hodge theory to numerical stability." Bulletin of the American mathematical society 47.2 (2010): 281-354.&lt;/ref&gt;
among others.

Finite element exterior calculus is sometimes called as an example of a compatible discretization technique, and bears similarities with [[discrete exterior calculus]], although they are distinct theories.

In [[graph theory]], the '''Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem''' is a form of [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] between the [[graph coloring|colorings]] of the vertices of a given undirected graph and the [[Orientation (graph theory)|orientations]] of its edges. It states that the minimum number of colors needed to properly color any graph ''G'' equals one plus the length of a [[longest path]] in an [[orientation (graph theory)|orientation]]  of ''G'' chosen to minimize this path's length.&lt;ref name="hl09"&gt;{{citation

==Examples==
A [[bipartite graph]] may be oriented from one side of the bipartition to the other; the longest path in this orientation has only two vertices. Conversely, if a graph is oriented without any three-vertex paths, then every vertex must either be a source (with no incoming edges) or a sink (with no outgoing edges) and the partition of the vertices into sources and sinks shows that it is bipartite.

In any orientation of a [[cycle graph]] of odd length, it is not possible for the edges to alternate in orientation all around the cycle, so some two consecutive edges must form a path with three vertices. Correspondingly, the chromatic number of an odd cycle is three.

==Proof==
To prove that the chromatic number is greater than or equal to the minimum number of vertices in a longest path, suppose that a given graph has a coloring with ''k'' colors, for some number ''k''. Then it may be acyclically oriented by numbering colors and by directing each edge from its lower-numbered endpoint to the higher-numbered endpoint. With this orientation, the numbers are strictly increasing along each directed path, so each path can include at most one vertex of each color, for a total of at most ''k'' vertices per path.

To prove that the chromatic number is less than or equal to the minimum number of vertices in a longest path, suppose that a given graph has an orientation with at most ''k'' vertices per simple directed path, for some number ''k''. Then the vertices of the graph may be colored with ''k'' colors by choosing a [[maximal element|maximal]] [[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]] [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of the orientation, and then coloring each vertex by the length of the longest path in the chosen subgraph that ends at that vertex. Each edge within the subgraph is oriented from a vertex with a lower number to a vertex with a higher number, and is therefore properly colored. For each edge that is not in the subgraph, there must exist a directed path within the subgraph connecting the same two vertices in the opposite direction, for otherwise the edge could have been included in the chosen subgraph; therefore, the edge is oriented from a higher number to a lower number and is again properly colored.&lt;ref name="hl09"/&gt;

The proof of this theorem was used as a test case for a formalization of [[mathematical induction]] by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Category-theoretic interpretation==
The theorem also has a natural interpretation in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of [[directed graph]]s and [[graph homomorphism]]s. A homomorphism is a map from the vertices of one graph to the vertices of another that always maps edges to edges. Thus, a ''k''-coloring of an undirected graph ''G'' may be described by a homomorphism from ''G'' to the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. If the complete graph is given an orientation, it becomes a [[Tournament (graph theory)|tournament]], and the orientation can be lifted back across the homomorphism to give an orientation of ''G''. In particular,  the coloring given by the length of the longest incoming path corresponds in this way to a homomorphism to a transitive tournament (an acyclically oriented complete graph), and every coloring can be described by a homomorphism to a transitive tournament in this way.

Considering homomorphisms in the other direction, to ''G'' instead of from ''G'', a directed graph ''G'' is acyclic and has at most ''k'' vertices in its longest path if and only if there is no homomorphism from the [[path graph]] ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''G''.

Thus, the Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem is equivalent to the theorem that, for every directed graph ''G'', there is a homomorphism to the ''k''-vertex transitive tournament if and only if there is not a homomorphism from the (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-vertex path.&lt;ref name="no12"/&gt; In the case that ''G'' is acyclic this can also be seen as a form of [[Mirsky's theorem]] that the longest chain in a [[partially ordered set]] equals the minimum number of antichains into which the set may be partitioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6801">In [[mathematics]], '''geometric measure theory''' ('''GMT''') is the study of [[geometry|geometric]] properties of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] (typically in [[Euclidean space]]) through [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]]. It allows mathematicians to extend tools from [[differential geometry]] to a much larger class of [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s that are not necessarily [[Differentiable manifold|smooth]].

== History ==

Geometric measure theory was born out of the desire to solve the [[Joseph Plateau|Plateau]] [[Plateau's problem|problem]] which asks if for every smooth closed curve in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] of least [[area]] among all surfaces whose [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] equals the given curve. Such surfaces mimic [[soap film]]s.

The problem had remained open since it was posed in 1760 by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]. It was solved independently in the 1930s by [[Jesse Douglas]] and [[Tibor Radó]] under certain [[topology|topological]] restrictions. In 1960 [[Herbert Federer]] and [[Wendell Fleming]] used the theory of [[Current (mathematics)|currents]] with which they were able to solve the orientable Plateau's problem [[Mathematical Analysis|analytically]] without topological restrictions, thus sparking geometric measure theory. Later [[Jean Taylor]] after [[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.|Fred Almgren]] proved [[Plateau's laws]] for the kind of singularities that can occur in these more general soap films and soap bubbles clusters.

== Important notions ==

The following objects are central in geometric measure theory:

* [[Rectifiable set|Rectifiable]] sets (or [[Radon measure]]s), which are [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s with the least possible regularity required to admit approximate [[tangent space]]s.
* [[Flat convergence#Integral currents|Currents]], a generalization of the concept of [[orientability|oriented]] [[manifold]]s, possibly with [[Manifold#Manifold with boundary|boundary]].
* Flat chains, an alternative generalization of the concept of [[manifold]]s, possibly with [[Manifold#Manifold with boundary|boundary]].
* [[Caccioppoli set]]s (also known as sets of locally finite perimeter), a generalization of the concept of [[manifolds]] on which the [[Divergence theorem]] applies.

The following theorems and concepts are also central:

* The area formula, which generalizes the concept of [[Integration by substitution|change of variables]] in integration.
* The [[coarea formula]], which generalizes and adapts [[Fubini's theorem]] to geometric measure theory.
* The [[isoperimetric inequality]], which states that the smallest possible [[circumference]] for a given [[area]] is that of a round [[circle]].
* [[Flat convergence]], which generalizes the concept of manifold convergence.

== Examples ==

The [[Brunn–Minkowski inequality]] for the ''n''-dimensional volumes of [[convex body|convex bodies]] ''K'' and ''L'',

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{vol} \big( (1 - \lambda) K + \lambda L \big)^{1/n} \geq (1 - \lambda) \mathrm{vol} (K)^{1/n} + \lambda \, \mathrm{vol} (L)^{1/n},&lt;/math&gt;

can be proved on a single page and quickly yields the classical [[isoperimetric inequality]]. The Brunn–Minkowski inequality also leads to [[Anderson's theorem]] in statistics.  The proof of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality predates modern measure theory; the development of measure theory and [[Lebesgue integration]] allowed connections to be made between geometry and analysis, to the extent that in an integral form of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality known as the [[Prékopa–Leindler inequality]] the geometry seems almost entirely absent.

These [[Spin (physics)|spinless]] bosons correspond to the spontaneously broken internal symmetry generators, and are characterized by the [[quantum number]]s of these.
They transform ''nonlinearly'' (shift) under the action of these generators, and can thus be excited out of the asymmetric vacuum by these generators.  Thus, they can be thought of as the excitations of the field in the broken symmetry directions in group space—and are [[Massless particle|massless]] if the spontaneously broken symmetry is ''not also [[Explicit symmetry breaking|broken explicitly]]''.

If, instead, the symmetry is not exact, i.e. if it is ''explicitly broken as well as spontaneously broken'', then the Nambu–Goldstone bosons are not massless, though they typically remain relatively light; they are then called '''[[Chiral symmetry breaking|pseudo-Goldstone boson]]s''' or '''pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone bosons''' (abbreviated '''PNGBs''').

==Goldstone's theorem==

'''Goldstone's theorem''' examines a generic [[continuous symmetry]] which is [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]]; i.e., its currents are conserved, but the [[ground state]] is not invariant under the action of the corresponding charges. Then, necessarily, new massless (or light, if the symmetry is not exact) [[Scalar field theory|scalar]] particles appear in the spectrum of possible excitations.  There is one scalar particle—called a Nambu–Goldstone boson—for each generator of the symmetry that is broken, i.e., that does not preserve the [[ground state]]. The Nambu–Goldstone mode is a long-wavelength fluctuation of the corresponding [[order parameter]].

By virtue of their special properties in coupling to the vacuum of the respective symmetry-broken theory, vanishing momentum ("soft") Goldstone bosons involved in field-theoretic amplitudes make such amplitudes vanish ("Adler zeros").

In theories with [[gauge symmetry]], the Goldstone bosons are "eaten" by the [[gauge boson]]s. The latter become massive and their new, longitudinal polarization is provided by the Goldstone boson.

==Examples==

===Natural===

*In [[fluid]]s, the [[phonon]] is longitudinal and it is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken [[Galilean symmetry]]. In [[solid]]s, the situation is more complicated; the Goldstone bosons are the longitudinal and transverse phonons and they happen to be the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken Galilean, translational, and rotational symmetry with no simple one-to-one correspondence between the Goldstone modes and the broken symmetries.
*In [[magnet]]s, the original rotational symmetry (present in the absence of an external magnetic field) is spontaneously broken such that the magnetization points into a specific direction. The Goldstone bosons then are the ''[[magnon]]s'', i.e., spin waves in which the local magnetization direction oscillates.
*The ''[[pion]]s'' are the [[Chiral symmetry breaking|pseudo-Goldstone boson]]s that result from the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral-flavor symmetries of QCD effected by quark condensation due to the strong interaction.  These symmetries are further  explicitly broken by the masses of the quarks, so that the pions are not massless, but their mass is ''significantly smaller'' than typical hadron masses.
*The longitudinal polarization components of the [[W and Z bosons]] correspond to the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken part of the electroweak symmetry ''SU(2)''&amp;otimes;''U(1)'', which, however, are not observable. Because this symmetry is gauged, the three would-be Goldstone bosons are "eaten" by the three gauge bosons corresponding to the three broken generators; this gives these three gauge bosons a mass, and the associated necessary third polarization degree of freedom.  This is described in the [[Standard Model]] through the [[Higgs mechanism]]. An analogous phenomenon occurs in [[superconductivity]], which served as the original source of inspiration for Nambu, namely, the photon develops a dynamical mass (expressed as magnetic flux exclusion from a superconductor), cf. the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]].

===Theory===
Consider a [[complex number|complex]] [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]] {{mvar|''ϕ''}}, with the constraint that {{math|''ϕ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;ϕ'' {{=}} ''v²''}}, a constant. One way to impose a constraint of this sort is by including a [[potential]] interaction term in its [[Lagrangian density]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(\phi^*\phi - v^2)^2  ~, &lt;/math&gt;
and taking the limit as  {{math|''λ'' → ∞}}   (this is called the "Abelian nonlinear σ-model". It corresponds to the [[Mexican hat potential#A pedagogical example: the Mexican hat potential|Goldstone sombrero potential]] where the tip and the sides shoot to infinity, preserving the location of the minimum at its base).

The constraint, and the action, below, are invariant under a ''U''(1) phase transformation,  {{math|''δϕ''{{=}}i''εϕ''}}.  The field can be redefined to give a real [[scalar field]] (i.e., a spin-zero particle) {{mvar|''θ''}} without any constraint by
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = v e^{i\theta} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|''θ''}}  is the Nambu–Goldstone boson (actually {{math|''vθ''}} is), and the ''U''(1) symmetry transformation effects a shift on  {{mvar|''θ''}}, namely 
:&lt;math&gt; \delta \theta = \epsilon ~,&lt;/math&gt;    
but  does not preserve the ground state {{math|{{!}}0〉}} (i.e. the above infinitesimal transformation ''does not annihilate it''—the hallmark of invariance), as evident in the charge of the current below.

Thus, the vacuum is degenerate and noninvariant under the action of the spontaneously broken symmetry.

The corresponding [[Lagrangian density]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}=-\frac{1}{2}(\partial^\mu \phi^*)\partial_\mu \phi +m^2 \phi^* \phi = -\frac{1}{2}(-iv e^{-i\theta} \partial^\mu \theta)(iv e^{i\theta} \partial_\mu \theta) + m^2 v^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
and thus 
::&lt;math&gt; =-\frac{v^2}{2}(\partial^\mu \theta)(\partial_\mu \theta) + m^2 v^2~.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the constant term {{math|''m²v²''}} in the Lagrangian density has no physical significance, and the other term in it is simply the kinetic term for a massless scalar.

The symmetry-induced conserved ''U''(1) current is 
:&lt;math&gt;  J_\mu = -v^2 \partial_\mu \theta ~.&lt;/math&gt; 
The charge, ''Q'', resulting from this current shifts {{mvar|''θ''}} and the ground state to a new, degenerate,  ground state. Thus, a vacuum with {{math|〈''θ''〉 {{=}} 0}} will shift to a ''different vacuum'' with {{math|〈''θ''〉 {{=}} −''ε''}}.  The current connects the original vacuum with the Nambu–Goldstone boson state, {{math|〈0{{!}}''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(0){{!}}''θ''〉&amp;ne; 0}}.

In general, in a theory with several scalar fields, {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the Nambu–Goldstone mode {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[Massless particle|massless]], and parameterises the curve of possible (degenerate) vacuum states. Its hallmark under the broken symmetry transformation is '''''nonvanishing vacuum expectation''''' {{math|〈''δϕ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''〉}}, an [[order parameter]], for vanishing {{math|〈''ϕ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''〉 {{=}} 0}}, at some ground state |0〉 chosen at the minimum of the potential,  {{math|〈∂''V''/∂''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;〉 {{=}} 0}}. Symmetry dictates that all variations of the potential with respect to the fields in all symmetry directions vanish. The vacuum value of the first order variation in any direction vanishes as just seen; while the vacuum value of the second order variation must also vanish, as follows. Vanishing vacuum values of field symmetry transformation increments add no new information.

By contrast, however, ''nonvanishing vacuum expectations of transformation increments'', {{math|〈''δϕ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;〉}}, specify the relevant (Goldstone) ''null eigenvectors of the mass matrix'',
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation =  &lt;math&gt; \left\langle { \partial^2  V  \over \partial \phi _i \partial \phi _j } \right\rangle \langle \delta \phi_j \rangle =0~,  &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6

|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
and hence the corresponding zero-mass eigenvalues.

== Goldstone's argument ==
The principle behind Goldstone's argument is that the ground state is not unique. Normally, by current conservation, the charge operator for any symmetry current is time-independent,
:&lt;math&gt;{d\over dt} Q = {d\over dt} \int_x J^0(x) =0.&lt;/math&gt;

Acting with the charge operator on the vacuum either ''annihilates the vacuum'', if that is symmetric; else, if ''not'', as is the case in spontaneous symmetry breaking, it produces  a zero-frequency state out of it, through its shift transformation feature illustrated above. Actually, here, the charge itself is ill-defined, cf. the Fabri–Picasso argument below. 

But its better behaved commutators with fields, that is, the nonvanishing transformation shifts {{math|〈''δϕ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;〉}}, are, nevertheless, ''time-invariant'',  
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \langle \delta \phi_g \rangle }{dt} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
thus generating a {{math|δ(''k''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)}} in its  Fourier transform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble_mechanism#Proof_of_the_theorem  Scholarpedia proof]&lt;/ref&gt; (This ensures that, inserting a complete set of intermediate states in a nonvanishing current commutator can lead to vanishing time-evolution only when one or more of these states is massless.)

Thus, if the vacuum is not invariant under the symmetry, action of the charge operator produces a state which is different from the vacuum chosen, but which has zero frequency. This is a long-wavelength oscillation of a field which is nearly stationary:  there are physical states with zero frequency, {{math|''k''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}},  so that the theory cannot have a [[mass gap]].

This argument is further clarified by taking the limit carefully. If an approximate charge operator acting in a huge but finite region  {{mvar|A}} is applied to the vacuum,
:&lt;math&gt;{d\over dt} Q_A = {d\over dt} \int_x e^{-\frac{x^2}{2A^2}} J^0(x) = -\int_x e^{-\frac{x^2}{2A^2}} \nabla \cdot J = \int_x \nabla \left (e^{-\frac{x^2}{2A^2}} \right ) \cdot J,&lt;/math&gt;

a state with approximately vanishing time derivative is produced,
:&lt;math&gt;\left \| {d\over dt} Q_A |0\rangle \right \| \approx \frac{1}{A} \left \| Q_A|0\rangle\right  \|.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a nonvanishing mass gap  {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the frequency of any state like the above,  which is orthogonal to the vacuum, is at least  {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}},
:&lt;math&gt; \left \| \frac{d}{dt} |\theta\rangle \right \| = \| H |\theta\rangle \| \ge m_0 \||\theta\rangle \|.&lt;/math&gt;

Letting {{mvar|A}} become large leads to a contradiction. Consequently {{mvar|m}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. However this argument fails when the symmetry is gauged, because then the symmetry generator is only performing a gauge transformation. A gauge transformed state is the same exact state, so that acting with a symmetry generator does not get  one out of the vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Higgs mechanism]].&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Fabri–Picasso Theorem.''' {{mvar|Q}} does not properly exist in the Hilbert space, unless {{math|''Q''{{!}}0〉 {{=}} 0}}.

The argument&lt;ref&gt;Fabri, E and Picasso, L E  (1966), "Quantum Field Theory and Approximate Symmetries", ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''16''' (1966) 408  {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.408.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires both the vacuum and the charge {{mvar|Q}} to be translationally invariant, {{math|''P''{{!}}0〉  {{=}} 0}},  {{math|[''P,Q'']{{=}} 0}}.

Consider the correlation function of the charge with itself,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \langle 0| QQ |0\rangle &amp;= \int d^3x \langle0|j_0(x) Q|0\rangle  \\
 &amp;=\int d^3x \left \langle 0 \left |e^{iPx}  j_0(0) e^{-iPx} Q \right |0 \right \rangle \\
 &amp;=\int d^3x \left \langle 0 \left | e^{iPx}  j_0(0) e^{-iPx} Q e^{iPx} e^{-iPx} \right | 0 \right \rangle \\
 &amp;=\int d^3x \left \langle 0 \left | j_0(0)  Q \right |0 \right \rangle 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
so the  integrand in the right hand side does not depend on the position.

Thus, its value is proportional to the total space volume,  &lt;math&gt;\|Q|0\rangle \|^2 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; unless the symmetry is unbroken, {{math|''Q''{{!}}0〉 {{=}} 0}}.  Consequently, {{mvar|Q}} does not properly exist in the Hilbert space.

== Infraparticles ==
There is an arguable loophole in the theorem. If one reads the theorem carefully, it only states that there exist non-[[vacuum state]]s with arbitrarily small energies. Take for example a chiral &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt; = 1 [[super QCD]] model with a nonzero [[sfermion|squark]] [[vacuum expectation value|VEV]] which is [[conformal field theory|conformal]] in the [[Infrared|IR]]. The chiral symmetry is a [[global symmetry]] which is (partially) spontaneously broken. Some of the "Goldstone bosons" associated with this spontaneous symmetry breaking are charged under the unbroken gauge group and hence, these [[composite particle|composite]] bosons have a continuous [[mass spectrum]] with arbitrarily small masses but yet there is no Goldstone boson with exactly [[Massless particle|zero mass]]. In other words, the Goldstone bosons are [[infraparticle]]s.

== Nonrelativistic theories ==
A version of Goldstone's theorem also applies to [[nonrelativistic]] theories (and also relativistic theories with spontaneously broken spacetime symmetries, such as [[Lorentz symmetry]] or conformal symmetry, rotational, or translational invariance).

It essentially states that, for each spontaneously broken symmetry, there corresponds some [[quasiparticle]] with no [[energy gap]]&amp;mdash;the nonrelativistic version of the [[mass gap]]. (Note that the energy here is really {{math|''H''−''μN''−{{vec|''α''}}⋅{{vec|''P''}}}} and not {{math|''H''}}.) However, two ''different'' spontaneously broken generators may now give rise to the ''same'' Nambu–Goldstone boson. For example, in a [[superfluid]], both the ''[[U(1)]]'' particle number symmetry and [[Galilean symmetry]] are spontaneously broken. However, the [[phonon]] is the Goldstone boson for both.

In general, the phonon is effectively the Nambu–Goldstone boson for spontaneously broken [[Galilean transformation|Galilean]]/[[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz]] symmetry. However, in contrast to the case of internal symmetry breaking, when spacetime symmetries are broken, the order parameter ''need not'' be a scalar field, but may be a tensor field, and the corresponding independent massless modes may now be ''fewer'' than the number of spontaneously broken generators, because the 
Goldstone modes may now be linearly dependent among themselves: e.g., the Goldstone modes for some generators might be expressed as gradients of Goldstone modes for other broken generators.

== Nambu–Goldstone fermions ==

Spontaneously broken global fermionic symmetries, which occur in some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] models, lead to Nambu–Goldstone [[fermions]], or ''[[goldstinos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Volkov | first = D.V.   | year = 1973| title =  Is the neutrino a goldstone particle?| journal =  Physics Letters| volume = B46| pages = 109&amp;ndash;110 | doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(73)90490-5 | last2 =Akulov | first2 =V|bibcode = 1973PhLB...46..109V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Salam| first = A  | year = 1974| title =  On Goldstone Fermion  | journal =   Physics Letters  | volume = B49  | pages = 465&amp;ndash;467  | doi =10.1016/0370-2693(74)90637-6 |bibcode = 1974PhLB...49..465S |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These have spin ½, instead of 0, and carry all quantum numbers of the respective supersymmetry generators broken spontaneously.

Spontaneous  supersymmetry breaking smashes up ("reduces")  supermultiplet structures into the characteristic [[nonlinear realization]]s of broken supersymmetry, so that goldstinos are superpartners of ''all'' particles in the theory, of ''any spin'', and the only superpartners, at that. That is, to say, two non-goldstino particles 
are connected to only goldstinos through supersymmetry transformations, and not to each other, even if they were so connected before the breaking of supersymmetry. As a result, the masses and spin multiplicities of such particles are then arbitrary.

In [[theoretical physics]] [[Rajesh Gopakumar]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] introduced new topological invariants, which named '''Gopakumar–Vafa invariant''', that represent the number of [[BPS state]]s on [[Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi–Yau 3-fold]], in a series of papers. (see {{Harvtxt|Gopakumar|Vafa|1998a}},{{Harvtxt|Gopakumar|Vafa|1998b}} and also see {{Harvtxt|Gopakumar|Vafa|1998c}}, {{Harvtxt|Gopakumar|Vafa|1998d}}.)　They lead the following formula generating function for the [[Gromov–Witten invariant]] on Calabi–Yau 3-fold ''M''.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{g\ge0,n\ge1,\beta\in H_2(M,\mathbb{Z})} GW(g,\beta)q^{\beta}\lambda^{2g-2}=\sum_{k&gt;0,g\ge0,\beta\in H^2(M,\mathbb{Z})}BPS(g,\beta)\frac{1}{k}\left(2\sin\left(\frac{k\lambda}{2}\right)\right)^{2g-2}q^{k\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;GW(g,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; is Gromov–Witten invariant, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; the number of [[pseudoholomorphic curve]]s with [[genus]] ''g'' and &lt;math&gt;BPS(g,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; the number of the BPS states.

== As a partition function in topological quantum field theory ==
Gopakumar–Vafa invariants can be viewed as a partition function in [[topological quantum field theory]].　They are proposed to be the partition function in Gopakumar–Vafa form:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{top}=\exp\left[\sum_{\begin{smallmatrix} k&gt;0,\ g\ge0,\\ \beta\in H_2(M,\mathbb{Z})\end{smallmatrix}}BPS(g,\beta)\frac{1}{k}\left(2\sin\left(\frac{k\lambda}{2}\right)\right)^{2g-2}q^{k\beta\cdot t}\right]\ .&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17353">'''Hadamard's maximal determinant problem''', named after [[Jacques Hadamard]], asks for the largest [[determinant]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with elements equal to 1 or −1.  The analogous question for matrices with elements equal to 0 or 1 is equivalent since, as will be shown below, the maximal determinant of a {1,−1} matrix of size ''n'' is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; times the maximal determinant of a {0,1} matrix of size ''n''−1.  The problem was posed by Hadamard in the 1893 paper &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Hadamard's bound implies that {1,&amp;nbsp;−1}-matrices of size ''n'' have determinant at most ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Hadamard observed that a construction of [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

produces examples of matrices that attain the bound when ''n'' is a power of 2, and produced examples of his own of sizes 12 and 20.  He also showed that the bound is only attainable when ''n'' is equal to 1, 2, or a multiple of 4.  Additional examples were later constructed by Scarpis and Paley and subsequently by many other authors.  Such matrices are now known as [[Hadamard matrices]].  They have received intensive study.

Matrix sizes ''n'' for which ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;4) have received less attention. The earliest results are due to Barba, who tightened Hadamard's bound for ''n'' odd, and Williamson, who found the largest determinants for ''n''=3, 5, 6, and 7.  Some important results include
* tighter bounds, due to Barba, Ehlich, and Wojtas, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;4), which, however, are known not to be always attainable,
* a few infinite sequences of matrices attaining the bounds for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;4),
* a number of matrices attaining the bounds for specific ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;4),
* a number of matrices not attaining the bounds for specific ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;4), but that have been proved by exhaustive computation to have maximal determinant.

The [[design of experiments]] in [[statistics]] makes use of {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrices ''X'' (not necessarily square) for which the [[information matrix]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''X'' has maximal determinant.  (The notation ''X''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[transpose]] of ''X''.)  Such matrices are known as [[optimal design|D-optimal designs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If ''X'' is a [[square matrix]], it is known as a saturated D-optimal design.

==Hadamard matrices==
Any two rows of an ''n''×''n'' Hadamard matrix are [[orthogonal]]. For a {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrix, it means any two rows differ in exactly half of the entries, which is impossible when ''n'' is an [[odd number]].  When ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;4), two rows that are both orthogonal to a third row cannot be orthogonal to each other.  Together, these statements imply that an ''n''×''n'' Hadamard matrix can exist only if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2, or a multiple of&amp;nbsp;4.  Hadamard matrices have been well studied, but it is not known whether an ''n''×''n'' Hadamard matrix exists for every ''n'' that is a positive multiple of 4.  The smallest ''n'' for which an ''n''×''n'' Hadamard matrix is not known to exist is 668.

==Equivalence and normalization of {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrices==
Any of the following operations, when performed on a {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrix ''R'', changes the determinant of ''R'' only by a minus sign: 
* Negation of a row.
* Negation of a column.
* Interchange of two rows.
* Interchange of two columns.
Two {1,−1} matrices, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are considered '''equivalent''' if ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be converted to ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by some sequence of the above operations.  The determinants of equivalent matrices are equal, except possibly for a sign change, and it is often convenient to standardize ''R'' by means of negations and permutations of rows and columns.  A {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrix is '''normalized''' if all elements in its first row and column equal 1.  When the size of a matrix is odd, it is sometimes useful to use a different normalization in which every row and column contains an even number of elements 1 and an odd number of elements −1.  Either of these normalizations can be accomplished using the first two operations.

==Connection of the maximal determinant problems for {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} and {0,&amp;nbsp;1} matrices==
There is a one-to-one map from the set of normalized ''n''×''n'' {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrices to the set of (''n''−1)×(''n''-1) {0,&amp;nbsp;1} matrices under which the magnitude of the determinant is reduced by a factor of 2&lt;sup&gt;1−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  This map consists of the following steps.
# Subtract row 1 of the {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrix from rows 2 through ''n''.  (This does not change the determinant.)
# Extract the (''n''−1)×(''n''−1) submatrix consisting of rows 2 through ''n'' and columns 2 through ''n''.  This matrix has elements 0 and −2.  (The determinant of this submatrix is the same as that of the original matrix, as can be seen by performing a [[cofactor expansion]] on column 1 of the matrix obtained in Step 1.)
# Divide the submatrix by −2 to obtain a {0,&amp;nbsp;1} matrix.  (This multiplies the determinant by (−2)&lt;sup&gt;1−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.)
'''Example:'''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1\\1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\left[\begin{array}{c|ccc}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\hline0 &amp; -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 &amp; -2\\0 &amp; -2 &amp; 0 &amp; -2\end{array}\right]\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}-2 &amp; -2 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; -2 &amp; -2\\-2 &amp; 0 &amp; -2\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
In this example, the original matrix has determinant −16 and its image has determinant 2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−16·(−2)&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Since the determinant of a {0,&amp;nbsp;1} matrix is an integer, the determinant of an ''n''×''n'' {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrix is an integer multiple of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Upper bounds on the maximal determinant==

===Gram matrix===
Let ''R'' be an ''n'' by ''n'' {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrix. The '''Gram matrix''' of ''R'' is defined to be the matrix ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''RR''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.  From this definition it follows that ''G''
# is an integer matrix,
# is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]],
# is [[positive-definite matrix|positive-semidefinite]],
# has constant diagonal whose value equals ''n''.
Negating rows of ''R'' or applying a permutation to them results in the same negations and permutation being applied both to the rows, and to the corresponding columns, of ''G''.  We may also define the matrix ''G''′=''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''R''.  The matrix ''G'' is the usual [[Gram matrix]] of a set of vectors, derived from the set of rows of ''R'', while ''G''′ is the Gram matrix derived from the set of columns of ''R''.  A matrix ''R'' for which ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''G''′ is a [[normal matrix]].  Every known maximal-determinant matrix is equivalent to a normal matrix, but it is not known whether this is always the case.

===Hadamard's bound (for all ''n'')===
Hadamard's bound can be derived by noting that |det&amp;nbsp;''R''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(det&amp;nbsp;''G'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;(det&amp;nbsp;''nI'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a consequence of the observation that ''nI'', where ''I'' is the ''n'' by ''n'' [[identity matrix]], is the unique matrix of maximal determinant among matrices satisfying properties 1–4.  That det&amp;nbsp;''R'' must be an integer multiple of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; can be used to provide another demonstration that Hadamard's bound is not always attainable.  When ''n'' is odd, the bound ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt; is either non-integer or odd, and is therefore unattainable except when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  When ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''k'' with ''k'' odd, the highest power of 2 dividing Hadamard's bound is 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; which is less than 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; unless ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.  Therefore, Hadamard's bound is unattainable unless ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, 2, or a multiple of 4.

===Barba's bound for ''n'' odd===
When ''n'' is odd, property 1 for Gram matrices can be strengthened to
# ''G'' is an odd-integer matrix.
This allows a sharper upper bound&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to be derived: |det&amp;nbsp;''R''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(det&amp;nbsp;''G'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;(det&amp;nbsp;(''n''-1)''I''+''J'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(2''n''−1)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''−1)&lt;sup&gt;(''n''−1)/2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''J'' is the all-one matrix.  Here (''n''-1)''I''+''J'' is the maximal-determinant matrix satisfying the modified property 1 and properties 2–4.  It is unique up to multiplication of any set of rows and the corresponding set of columns by −1.  The bound is not attainable unless 2''n''−1 is a perfect square, and is therefore never attainable when ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;3 (mod 4).

===The Ehlich–Wojtas bound for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2 (mod 4)===
When ''n'' is even, the set of rows of ''R'' can be partitioned into two subsets.
* Rows of '''even type''' contain an even number of elements 1 and an even number of elements −1.
* Rows of '''odd type''' contain an odd number of elements 1 and an odd number of elements −1.
The dot product of two rows of the same type  is congruent to ''n'' (mod 4); the dot product of two rows of opposite type is congruent to ''n''+2 (mod 4).  When ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2 (mod 4), this implies that, by permuting rows of ''R'', we may assume the '''standard form''',
:&lt;math&gt;G=\begin{bmatrix}A &amp; B\\B^\mathrm{T} &amp; D\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''D'' are symmetric integer matrices whose elements are congruent to 2 (mod 4) and ''B'' is a matrix whose elements are congruent to 0 (mod 4).  In 1964, Ehlich&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; independently showed that in the maximal determinant matrix of this form, ''A'' and ''D'' are both of size ''n''/2 and equal to (''n''−2)''I''+2''J'' while ''B'' is the zero matrix.  This optimal form is unique up to multiplication of any set of rows and the corresponding set of columns by −1 and to simultaneous application of a permutation to rows and columns.  This implies the bound det&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;(2''n''−2)(''n''−2)&lt;sup&gt;(''n''−2)/2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Ehlich showed that if ''R'' attains the bound, and if the rows and columns of ''R'' are permuted so that both ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''RR''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and ''G''′&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' have the standard form and are suitably normalized, then we may write
:&lt;math&gt;R=\begin{bmatrix}W &amp; X\\Y &amp; Z\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''W'', ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are (''n''/2)×(''n''/2) matrices with constant row and column sums ''w'', ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' that satisfy ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''w'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'', and ''w''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''n''−2.  Hence the Ehlich–Wojtas bound is not attainable unless 2''n''−2 is expressible as the sum of two squares.

===Ehlich's bound for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;3 (mod 4)===
When ''n'' is odd, then by using the freedom to multiply rows by −1, one may impose the condition that each row of ''R'' contain an even number of elements 1 and an odd number of elements −1.  It can be shown that, if this normalization is assumed, then property 1 of ''G'' may be strengthened to
# ''G'' is a matrix with integer elements congruent to ''n'' (mod 4).
When ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1 (mod 4), the optimal form of Barba satisfies this stronger property, but when ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;3 (mod 4), it does not.  This means that the bound can be sharpened in the latter case.  Ehlich&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 |last = Ehlich |first = Hartmut

 |pages = 438–447
 |doi = 10.1007/BF01109911
}}.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that when ''n''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;3 (mod 4), the strengthened property 1 implies that the maximal-determinant form of ''G'' can be written as ''B''−''J'' where ''J'' is the all-one matrix and ''B'' is a [[block-diagonal matrix]] whose diagonal blocks are of the form (''n''-3)''I''+4''J''.  Moreover, he showed that in the optimal form, the number of blocks, ''s'', depends on ''n'' as shown in the table below, and that each block either has size ''r'' or size ''r+1'' where &lt;math&gt;r=\lfloor n/s\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

Except for ''n''=11 where there are two possibilities, the optimal form is unique up to multiplication of any set of rows and the corresponding set of columns by −1 and to simultaneous application of a permutation to rows and columns.  This optimal form leads to the bound
:&lt;math&gt;\det R\le(n-3)^{(n-s)/2} (n-3+4r)^{u/2} (n+1+4r)^{v/2} \left[1 - \frac{ur}{n-3+4r} - \frac{v(r+1)}{n+1+4r}\right]^{1/2},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''−''rs'' is the number of blocks of size ''r''+1 and ''u''&amp;nbsp;=''s''−''v'' is the number of blocks of size ''r''.

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; derived additional restrictions on the attainability of the bound using the [[Hasse-Minkowski theorem]] on the rational equivalence of quadratic forms, and showed that the smallest ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3 for which Ehlich's bound is conceivably attainable is 511.

==Maximal determinants up to size 21==
The maximal determinants of {1,&amp;nbsp;−1} matrices up to size ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;21 are given in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A003432|name=Hadamard maximal determinant problem: largest determinant of a (real) {0,1}-matrix of order n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Size 22 is the smallest open case.  In the table, ''D''(''n'') represents the maximal determinant divided by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Equivalently, ''D''(''n'') represents the maximal determinant of a {0,&amp;nbsp;1} matrix of size ''n''−1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3347">In mathematics, a '''Hausdorff gap''' consists roughly of two collections of sequences of integers, such that there is no sequence lying between the two collections. The first example was found by {{harvs|txt|last=Hausdorff|authorlink=Felix Hausdorff|year=1909}}. The existence of Hausdorff gaps shows that the partially ordered set of possible growth rates of sequences is not complete.

==Definition==

Let ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; be the set of all sequences of non-negative integers, and define ''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''g'' to mean lim&amp;nbsp;''g''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''f''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞.

If ''X'' is a poset and κ and λ are cardinals, then a (κ,λ)-pregap in ''X'' is a set of elements ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; for α in κ and a set of elements ''g''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; for β in λ such that
*The transfinite sequence ''f'' is strictly increasing
*The transfinite sequence ''g'' is strictly decreasing
*Every element of the sequence ''f'' is less than every element of the sequence ''g''

A pregap is called a gap if it satisfies the additional condition:

*There is no element ''h'' greater than all elements of ''f'' and less than all elements of ''g''.

A '''Hausdorff gap''' is a (ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-gap in ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; such that for every countable ordinal α and every natural number ''n'' there are only a finite number of β less than α such that for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' we have ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'').

There are some variations of these definitions, with the ordered set ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; replaced by a similar set. For example, one can redefine ''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''g'' to mean ''f''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''g''(''n'') for all but finitely many ''n''. Another variation introduced by {{harvtxt|Hausdorff|1936}} is to replace ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; by the set of all subsets of ω, with the order given by  ''A''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''B'' if ''A'' has only finitely many elements not in ''B'' but ''B'' has infinitely many elements not in ''A''.

[[Guido Grandi]] (1671–1742) reportedly provided a simplistic account of the series in 1703. He noticed that inserting parentheses into {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} produced varying results: either
:&lt;math&gt;(1-1) + (1-1) + \cdots = 0&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;1+(-1+1)+(-1+1) +\cdots = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Grandi's explanation of this phenomenon became well known for its religious overtones:

{{quote|text=By putting parentheses into the expression 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · in different ways, I can, if I want, obtain 0 or 1. But then the idea of the creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' is perfectly plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Bagni ''Appunti'' ch.4, p.54. The original quotation, in Italian: "Mettendo in modo diverso le parentesi nell’espressione 1-1+1-1+... io posso, volendo, ottenere 0 o 1. Ma allora l’idea della creazione ''ex nihilo'' è perfettamente plausibile." Bagni does not identify the primary source, writing only that the quotation is from 1703 and that it is cited in I, p.185 of Silov, G.E. (1978), ''Analisi matematica'', Mir, Mosca. 1703 is also the publication year of the ''Quadratura circula'', but Panza's analysis of the treatment of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · in that book does not mention this idea.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In fact, the series was not an idle subject for Grandi, and he didn't think it summed to either 0 or 1. Rather, like many mathematicians to follow, he thought the true value of the series was &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for a variety of reasons.

[[File:Witch (1, .5).svg|thumb|(1, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on the witch of Agnesi]]
Grandi's mathematical treatment of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} occurs in his 1703 book ''Quadratura circula et hyperbolae per infinitas hyperbolas geometrice exhibita''. Broadly interpreting Grandi's work, he derived {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} through geometric reasoning connected with his investigation of the [[witch of Agnesi]]. Eighteenth-century mathematicians immediately translated and summarized his argument in analytical terms: for a generating circle with diameter ''a'', the equation of the witch ''y'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) has the series expansion
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{a^{2n-1}}=a - \frac{x^2}{a} + \frac{x^4}{a^3} - \frac{x^6}{a^5} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:and setting ''a'' = ''x'' = 1, one has 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;According to Giovanni Ferraro (2002 p.193), citing Marco Panza's doctoral dissertation including a detailed analysis of Grandi's writing.&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[Morris Kline]], Grandi started with the [[binomial expansion]]
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:and substituted ''x'' = 1 to get {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Grandi "also argued that since the sum was both 0 and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, he had proved that the world could be created out of nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1983 p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

Grandi offered a new explanation that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in 1710, both in the second edition of the ''Quadratura circula''&lt;ref&gt;Panza (p.298) places the example on p.30 of Grandi 1710, ''Quadratura circula … editio altera''&lt;/ref&gt; and in a new work, ''De Infinitis infinitorum, et infinite parvorum ordinibus disquisitio geometrica''.&lt;ref&gt;Reiff pp.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Two brothers inherit a priceless gem from their father, whose will forbids them to sell it, so they agree that it will reside in each other's museums on alternating years. If this agreement lasts for all eternity between the brother's descendants, then the two families will each have half possession of the gem, even though it changes hands infinitely often. This argument was later criticized by Leibniz.&lt;ref name="Leibniz p.46"&gt;Leibniz (Gerhardt) pp.385-386, Markushevich p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

The parable of the gem is the first of two additions to the discussion of the corollary that Grandi added to the second edition. The second repeats the link between the series and the creation of the universe by God:
{{quote|text=Sed inquies: aggregatum ex infinitis differentiis infinitarum ipsi DV æqualium, sive continuè, sive alternè sumptarum, est demum summa ex infinitis nullitatibus, seu 0, quomodo ergo quantitatem notabilem aggreget? At repono, eam Infiniti vim agnoscendam, ut etiam quod per se nullum est multiplicando, in aliquid commutet, sicuti finitam magnitudiné dividendo, in nullam degenerare cogit: unde per infinitam Dei Creatoris potentiam omnia ex nihlo facta, omniaque in nihilum redigi posse: neque adeò absurdum esse, quantitatem aliquam, ut ita dicam, creari per infinitam vel multiplicationem, vel additionem ipsius nihili, aut quodvis quantum infinita divisione, aut subductione in nihilum redigit.&lt;ref&gt;Panza (p.298) places this passage on p.29 of Grandi 1710, ''Quadratura circula … editio altera''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Marchetti===
After Grandi published the second edition of the ''Quadratura'', his fellow countryman [[Alessandro Marchetti (mathematician)|Alessandro Marchetti]] became one of his first critics. One historian charges that Marchetti was motivated more by jealousy than any other reason.&lt;ref&gt;Montucla pp.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Marchetti found the claim that an infinite number of zeros could add up to a finite quantity absurd, and he inferred from Grandi's treatment the danger posed by theological reasoning. The two mathematicians began attacking each other in a series of open letters; their debate was ended only by Marchetti's death in 1714.

==Leibniz==
With the help and encouragement of [[Antonio Magliabechi]], Grandi sent a copy of the 1703 ''Quadratura'' to Leibniz, along with a letter expressing compliments and admiration for the master's work. Leibniz received and read this first edition in 1705, and he called it an unoriginal and less-advanced "attempt" at his calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzone and Roero pp.246-247, who cite: Grandi to Magliabechi, Pisa 17.7.1703 BU Pisa MS 99, f. 219; Magliabechi to Grandi, Florence 31.7.1703, BU Pisa MS 93, f. 110; Grandi to Leibniz, Pisa 28.6.1703, GM 4, p. 209; Leibniz to Magliabechi, Hanover 12.8.1704; Leibniz to Magliabechi, Hanover 2.7.1705, Paoli 1899, p. XC; Leibniz to Grandi, Hanover 11.7.1705, GM 4, pp.210-212; Leibniz to Hermann, Hanover 21.5.1706, GM 4, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Grandi's treatment of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · would not catch Leibniz's attention until 1711, near the end of his life, when [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] sent him a letter on Marchetti's behalf describing the problem and asking for Leibniz's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt p.141; Wolff to Leibniz, 16 April 1711, in Gerhardt pp.134-135, LXIII&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
As early as 1674, in a minor, lesser-known writing ''De Triangulo Harmonico'' on the [[harmonic triangle]], Leibniz  mentioned {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} very briefly in an example:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = \frac11-\frac{1}{1+1}. \;\mathrm{Ergo}\; \frac{1}{1+1} = 1-1+1-1+1-1 \;\mathrm{etc.}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz p.369&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably he arrived at this series by repeated substitution:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = 1 - ( 1 - \frac{1}{1+1} )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - \frac{1}{1+1} ) ) )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1} = 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - ( 1 - \frac{1}{1+1} ) ) ) ) )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;br/&gt;And so on.

The series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} also appears indirectly in a discussion with [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus|Tschirnhaus]] in 1676.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz p.817&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz had already considered the divergent alternating series {{nowrap|1=[[1 − 2 + 4 − 8 + 16 − · · ·]]}} as early as 1673. In that case he argued that by subtracting either on the left or on the right, one could produce either positive or negative infinity, and therefore both answers are wrong and the whole should be finite. Two years after that, Leibniz formulated the first convergence test in the history of mathematics, the [[alternating series test]], in which he implicitly applied the modern definition of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz pp.205-207; Knobloch pp.124-127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solutions===
[[File:Leibniz to Wolff on Grandi.jpg|thumb|Beginning of the published Leibniz-Wolff letter]]
In the 1710s, Leibniz described Grandi's series in his correspondence with several other mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;For example, his ultimate solution is repeated in a 1716 letter to [[Pierre Dangicourt]]; see Hitt p.143&lt;/ref&gt; The letter with the most lasting impact was his first reply to Wolff, which he published in the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]''. In this letter, Leibniz attacked the problem from several angles.

In general, Leibniz believed that the algorithms of calculus were a form of "blind reasoning" that ultimately had to be founded upon geometrical interpretations. Therefore, he agreed with Grandi that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} claiming that the relation was well-founded because there existed a geometric demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 2000 p.545&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Leibniz sharply criticized Grandi's example of the shared gem, claiming that the series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} has no relation to the story. He pointed out that for any finite, even number of years, the brothers have equal possession, yet the sum of the corresponding terms of the series is zero.&lt;ref name="Leibniz p.46"/&gt;

Leibniz thought that the argument from {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + ''x'')}} was valid; he took it as an example of his [[law of continuity]]. Since the relation {{nowrap|1=1 − ''x'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + · · · = 1/(1 + ''x'')}} holds for all ''x'' less than 1, it should hold for ''x'' equal to 1 as well. Still, Leibniz thought that one should be able to find the sum of the series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} directly, without needing to refer back to the expression {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + ''x'')}} from which it came. This approach may seem obvious by modern standards, but it is a significant step from the point of view of the history of summing divergent series.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Weidlich (p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, the study of series was dominated by power series, and summing a numerical series by expressing it as ''f''(1) of some function's power series was thought to be the most natural strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro and Panza p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz begins by observing that taking an even number of terms from the series, the last term is −1 and the sum is 0:
:1 − 1 = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 = 0.
Taking an odd number of terms, the last term is +1 and the sum is 1:
:1 = 1 − 1 + 1 = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 = 1.

Now, the infinite series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · has neither an even nor an odd number of terms, so it produces neither 0 nor 1; by taking the series out to infinity, it becomes something between those two options. There is no more reason why the series should take one value than the other, so the theory of "probability" and the "law of justice" dictate that one should take the arithmetic mean of 0 and 1, which is {{nowrap|1=(0 + 1) / 2 = 1/2.}}&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz (Gerhardt) pp.386-387; Hitt (p.143) translates the Latin into French.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eli Maor]] says of this solution, "Such a brazen, careless reasoning indeed seems incredible to us today…"&lt;ref&gt;Maor, pp.32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Kline portrays Leibniz as more self-conscious: "Leibniz conceded that his argument was more metaphysical than mathematical, but said that there is more metaphysical truth in mathematics than is generally recognized."&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1983 pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Further: Moore p.4--&gt;

Charles Moore muses that Leibniz would hardly have had such confidence in his metaphysical strategy if it did not give the same result (namely &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Moore p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, this was no accident: Leibniz's treatment would be partially justified when the compatibility of averaging techniques and power series was finally proven in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Smail p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
When he had first raised the question of Grandi's series to Leibniz, Wolff was inclined toward skepticism along with Marchetti. Upon reading Leibniz's reply in mid-1712,&lt;ref&gt;Wolff's first reference to the letter published in the ''Acta Eruditorum'' appears in a letter written from [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]] dated 12 June 1712; Gerhardt pp.143-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff was so pleased with the solution that he sought to extend the arithmetic mean method to more divergent series such as {{nowrap|1=1 − 2 + 4 − 8 + 16 − · · ·}}. Leibniz's intuition prevented him from straining his solution this far, and he wrote back that Wolff's idea was interesting but invalid for several reasons. For one, the terms of a summable series should decrease to zero; even {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} could be expressed as a limit of such series.&lt;ref&gt;Moore's pp.2-3; Leibniz's letter is in Gerhardt pp.147-148, dated 13 July 1712 from [[Hanover]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz described Grandi's series along with the general problem of convergence and divergence in letters to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] in 1712 and early 1713. J. Dutka suggests that this correspondence, along with Nicolaus I Bernoulli's interest in probability, motivated him to formulate the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], another situation involving a divergent series, in September 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Dutka p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in his ''Essai Philosophique sur les Probabilités'', Grandi's series was connected with Leibniz seeing "an image of the Creation in his binary arithmetic", and thus Leibniz wrote a letter to [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] [[Claudio Filippo Grimaldi]], court mathematician in [[China]], in the hope that [[Claudio Filippo Grimaldi]]'s interest in science and the mathematical "emblem of creation" might combine to convert the nation to [[Christianity]]. Laplace remarks, "I record this anecdote only to show how far the prejudices of infancy may mislead the greatest men."&lt;ref&gt;Upham and Stewart pp.479, 480, who cite Laplace pp.194, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divergence==

===Jacob Bernoulli===
[[File:Bernoulli Positiones 3 Opera.png|thumb|right|Start of ''Positiones'' part 3, as reprinted in 1744]]
[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1654–1705) dealt with a similar series in 1696 in the third part of his ''Positiones arithmeticae de seriebus infinitis''.&lt;ref name=Knopp457 /&gt; Applying [[Nicholas Mercator]]'s method for [[polynomial long division]] to the ratio {{nowrap|1=''k''/(''m'' + ''n'')}}, he noticed that one always had a remainder.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 2002 p.181&lt;/ref&gt; If {{nowrap|1=''m'' &gt; ''n''}} then this remainder decreases and "finally is less than any given quantity", and one has
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{m+n}=\frac{k}{m} - \frac{kn}{m^2} + \frac{kn^2}{m^3} - \frac{kn^3}{m^4} + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''m'' = ''n'', then this equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{2m}=\frac{k}{m} - \frac{k}{m} + \frac{k}{m} - \frac{k}{m} + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
Bernoulli called this equation a "not inelegant paradox".&lt;ref name=Knopp457&gt;Knopp p.457&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor (p.96) makes the quote "''unde paradoxum fluit non inelegans''", citing Ebenda II, 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varignon===
[[File:Varignon Précautions.png|thumb|left]]
[[Pierre Varignon]] (1654–1722) treated Grandi's series in his report ''Précautions à prendre dans l'usage des Suites ou Series infinies résultantes…''. The first of his purposes for this paper was to point out the divergence of Grandi's series and expand on Jacob Bernoulli's 1696 treatment.

(Varignon's math…)

The final version of Varignon's paper is dated February 16, 1715, and it appeared in a volume of the ''Mémories'' of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] that was itself not published until 1718. For such a relatively late treatment of Grandi's series, it is surprising that Varignon's report does not even mention Leibniz's earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;For the possible significance of the omission, see Panza p.339.&lt;/ref&gt; But most of the ''Précautions'' was written in October 1712, while Varignon was away from [[Paris]]. The [[Abbé Poignard]]'s 1704 book on [[magic squares]], ''Traité des Quarrés sublimes'', had become a popular subject around the Academy, and the second revised and expanded edition weighed in at 336 pages. To make the time to read the ''Traité'', Varignon had to escape to the countryside for nearly two months, where he wrote on the topic of Grandi's series in relative isolation. Upon returning to Paris and checking in at the Academy, Varignon soon discovered that the great Leibniz had ruled in favor of Grandi. Having been separated from his sources, Varignon still had to revise his paper by looking up and including the citation to Jacob Bernoulli. Rather than also take Leibniz's work into account, Varignon explains in a postscript to his report that the citation was the only revision he had made in Paris, and that ''if'' other research on the topic arose, his thoughts on it would have to wait for a future report.&lt;ref&gt;Panza p.339; Varignon pp.203, 225; Gerhardt p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

(Letters between Varignon and Leibniz…)

In the 1751 ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] echoes the view that Grandi's reasoning based on division had been refuted by Varignon in 1715. (Actually, d'Alembert attributes the problem to "[[Luigi Guido Grandi|Guido Ubaldus]]", an error that is still occasionally propagated today.)&lt;ref&gt;Hitt pp.147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riccati and Bougainville===
In a 1715 letter to [[Jacopo Riccati]], Leibniz mentioned the question of Grandi's series and advertised his own solution in the ''Acta Eruditorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Bagni (p.4) identifies the letter as "probably written in 1715", citing Michieli's 1943 ''Una famiglia di matematici…'', p. 579&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Riccati would criticize Grandi's argument in his 1754 ''Saggio intorno al sistema dell'universo'', saying that it causes contradictions. He argues that one could just as well write {{nowrap|1=''n'' − ''n'' + ''n'' − ''n'' + · · · = ''n''/(1 + 1),}} but that this series has "the same quantity of zeroes" as Grandi's series. These zeroes lack any evanescent character of ''n'', as Riccati points out that the equality {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 = ''n'' − ''n''}} is guaranteed by {{nowrap|1=1 + ''n'' = ''n'' + 1.}} He concludes that the fundamental mistake is in using a divergent series to begin with:
{{quote|text=In fact, it doesn't happen that if we stop this series, the following terms can be neglected in comparison with preceding terms; this property is verified only for convergent series."&lt;ref&gt;Bagni p.5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another 1754 publication also criticized Grandi's series on the basis of its collapse to 0. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] briefly treats the series in his acclaimed 1754 textbook ''Traité du calcul intégral''. He explains that a series is "true" if its sum is equal to the expression from which is expanded; otherwise it is "false". Thus Grandi's series is false because {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + 1) = 1/2}} and yet {{nowrap|1=(1 − 1) + (1 − 1) + · · · = 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bougainville vol.1, ch.22, pts.318-320, pp.309-312; Schubring p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euler==
{{further|Euler on infinite series}}

[[Leonhard Euler]] treats {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} along with other divergent series in his ''De seriebus divergentibus'', a 1746 paper that was read to the Academy in 1754 and published in 1760. He identifies the series as being first considered by Leibniz, and he reviews Leibniz's 1713 argument based on the series {{nowrap|1=1 − ''a'' + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + · · ·}}, calling it "fairly sound reasoning", and he also mentions the even/odd median argument. Euler writes that the usual objection to the use of {{nowrap|1=1/(1 + ''a'')}} is that it does not equal {{nowrap|1=1 − ''a'' + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + · · ·}} unless ''a'' is less than 1; otherwise all one can say is that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+a} = 1 - a + a^2 - a^3 + \cdots \pm a^n \mp \frac{a^{n+1}}{1+a},&lt;/math&gt;
where the last remainder term does not vanish and cannot be disregarded as ''n'' is taken to infinity. Still writing in the third person, Euler mentions a possible rebuttal to the objection: essentially, since an infinite series has no last term, there is no place for the remainder and it should be neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Euler 1760 §§3-5, pp.206-207; English translation in Barbeau and Leah pp.145-146&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing more badly divergent series like {{nowrap|1=[[1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + · · ·]]}}, where he judges his opponents to have firmer support, Euler seeks to define away the issue:

{{quote|text=Yet however substantial this particular dispute seems to be, neither side can be convicted of any error by the other side, whenever the use of such series occurs in analysis, and this ought to be a strong argument that neither side is in error, but that all disagreement is solely verbal. For if in a calculation I arrive at this series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 etc.}} and if in its place I substitute 1/2, no one will rightly impute to me an error, which however everyone would do had I put some other number in the place of this series. Whence no doubt can remain that in fact the series {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + etc.}} and the fraction 1/2 are equivalent quantities and that it is always permitted to substitute one for the other without error. Thus the whole question is seen to reduce to this, whether we call the fraction 1/2 the correct sum of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + etc.}}; and it is strongly to be feared that those who insist on denying this and who at the same time do not dare to deny the equivalence have stumbled into a battle over words.

But I think all this wrangling can be easily ended if we should carefully attend to what follows…&lt;ref&gt;Euler 1760 §10 and beginning of §11, p.211; English translation by Barbeau and Leah (p.148)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Euler also used [[finite difference]]s to attack {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}. In modern terminology, he took the [[Euler transform]] of the sequence and found that it equalled &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guinness pp.68-69&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1864, De Morgan claims that "this transformation has always appeared one of the strongest presumptions in favour of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − …}} being &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilution and new values==
Despite the confident tone of his papers, Euler expressed doubt over divergent series in his correspondence with Nicolaus I Bernoulli. Euler claimed that his attempted definition had never failed him, but Bernoulli pointed out a clear weakness: it does not specify how one should determine "the" finite expression that generates a given infinite series. Not only is this a practical difficulty, it would be theoretically fatal if a series were generated by expanding two expressions with different values. Euler's treatment of {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} rests upon his firm belief that &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the only possible value of the series; what if there were another?

In a 1745 letter to [[Christian Goldbach]], Euler claimed that he was not aware of any such counterexample, and in any case Bernoulli had not provided one. Several decades later, when [[Jean-Charles Callet]] finally asserted a counterexample, it was aimed at {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}. The background of the new idea begins with [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.14; Bromwich p.322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daniel Bernoulli===
*{{cite journal |last=Bernoulli |first=Daniel |title=De summationibus serierum quarunduam incongrue veris earumque interpretatione atque usu |journal= Novi Commentarii academiae scientiarum imperialis Petropolitanae |volume=16 |year=1771 |pages=71–90}}

Daniel Bernoulli, who accepted the probabilistic argument that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, noticed that by inserting 0s into the series in the right places, it could achieve any value between 0 and 1. In particular, the argument suggested that

===Callet and Lagrange===
In a memorandum sent to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] toward the end of the century, Callet pointed out that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} could also be obtained from the series
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1+x}{1+x+x^2}=1-x^2+x^3-x^5+x^6-x^8+\cdots;&lt;/math&gt;
substituting ''x'' = 1 now suggests a value of &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, not &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Lagrange approved Callet's submission for publication in the ''Mémoires'' of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], but it was never directly published. Instead, Lagrange (along with [[Charles Bossut]]) summarized Callet's work and responded to it in the ''Mémoires'' of 1799. He defended Euler by suggesting that Callet's series actually should be written with the 0 terms left in:
:&lt;math&gt;1+0-x^2+x^3+0-x^5+x^6+0-x^8+\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
which reduces to
:1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + · · ·
instead.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich pp.319-320, Lehmann p.176, Kline 1972 p.463; here Bromwich seems to cite Borel's ''Leçons sur les Séries Divergentes'', pp.1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Other objections: Smail p.2--&gt;

==19th century==
The 19th century is remembered as the approximate period of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s and [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]]'s largely successful ban on the use of divergent series, but Grandi's series continued to make occasional appearances. Some mathematicians did not follow Abel's lead, mostly outside France, and British mathematicians especially took "a long time" to understand the analysis coming from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[Robert Woodhouse]] proposed that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} summed to something called
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+1},&lt;/math&gt;
which could be distinguished from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] remarks on this proposal, "… R. Woodhouse … wrote with admirable honesty on the problems which he failed to understand. … Of course, there is no harm in defining new symbols such as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1+1&lt;/sub&gt;; but the idea is 'formalist' in the unflattering sense, and it does not bear on the problem of the convergence of series."&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guinness p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algebraic reasoning===

In 1830, a mathematician identified only as "M. R. S." wrote in the ''[[Annales de Gergonne]]'' on a technique to numerically find fixed points of functions of one variable. If one can transform a problem into the form of an equation ''x = A + f(x)'', where ''A'' can be chosen at will, then 
:&lt;math&gt;x = A+f(A+f(A+f(\cdots)))&lt;/math&gt;
should be a solution, and truncating this infinite expression results in a sequence of approximations. Conversely, given the series {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a'' − ''a'' + ''a'' − ''a'' + · · ·}}, the author recovers the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x = a - x,&lt;/math&gt;
to which the solution is (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''a''.

M. R. S. notes that the approximations in this case are ''a'', 0, ''a'', 0, …, but there is no need for Leibniz's "subtle reasoning". Moreover, the argument for averaging the approximations is problematic in a wider context. For equations not of the form ''x = A + f(x)'', M. R. S.'s solutions are [[continued fraction]]s, [[continued radical]]s, and other infinite expressions. In particular, the expression {{nowrap|1=''a'' / (''a'' / (''a'' / · · · )))}} should be a solution of the equation {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a''/''x''}}. Here, M. R. S. writes that based on Leibniz's reasoning, one is tempted to conclude that ''x'' is the average of the truncations ''a'', 1, ''a'', 1, …. This average is {{nowrap|1=(1 + ''a'')/2}}, but the solution to the equation is the [[square root]] of ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;M.R.S. pp.363-365&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Bolzano]] criticized M. R. S.' algebraic solution of the series. In reference to the step
:&lt;math&gt;x = a-a+a-a+\cdots = a-(a-a+a-\cdots),&lt;/math&gt;
Bolzano charged,
{{quote|text=The series within parentheses has clearly not the same set of numbers of that originally indicated with ''x'', as the first term ''a'' is missing.}}
This comment exemplifies Bolzano's intuitively appealing but deeply problematic views on infinity. In his defense, [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] himself pointed out that Bolzano worked in a time when the concept of the [[cardinality]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] was absent.&lt;ref&gt;Sbaragli p.27; the primary source for Bolzano is not given, but it appears to be Moreno and Waldegg (1991), "The conceptual evolution of actual mathematical infinity". ''Educational studies in mathematics''. 22, 211-231. The primary source for Cantor is his 1932 ''Gesammelte Abhandlngen''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Morgan and company===
As late as 1844, [[Augustus De Morgan]] commented that if a single instance where {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} did not equal &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be given, he would be willing to reject the entire theory of trigonometric series.&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1972 p.976&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=I do not argue with those who reject everything that is not within the providence of arithmetic, but only with those who abandon the use of infinitely divergent series and yet appear to employ finitely divergent series with confidence. Such appears to be the practice, both at home and abroad. They seem perfectly reconciled to {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}, but cannot admit {{nowrap|1=1 + 2 + 4 + · · · = −1}}.&lt;ref name="Hardy19"&gt;Hardy p.19&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=The whole fabric of periodic series and integrals … would fall instantly if it were shown to be possible that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} might be one quantity as a limiting form of {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − · · · }}and another as a limiting form of {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − · · ·.}}&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same volume contains papers by [[Samuel Earnshaw]] and [[J R Young]] dealing in part with {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}}. [[G. H. Hardy]] dismisses both of these as "little more than nonsense", in contrast to De Morgan's "remarkable mixture of acuteness and confusion";&lt;ref name="Hardy19" /&gt; in any case, Earnshaw got De Morgan's attention with the following remarks:

{{quote|text=…it is not very unusual to cast a mantle of mystery over this subject, by introducing zeros into the expansion of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1+1+1&lt;/sub&gt;. But such a device, however much it may serve to satisfy the eye, cannot satisfy the head…&lt;ref&gt;Earnshaw p.261, partially quoted in De Morgan 1864 p.1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

De Morgan fired back in 1864 in the same journal:
{{quote|text=I cannot approve of introducing ciphers to satisfy the eye: but to me they always ''introduced themselves.'' … those who reject casual evanescents out of a routine of operation have no right to charge those who do ''not reject'' with ''introduction.''&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan 1864 pp.1-2; emphases are his&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Frobenius and modern mathematics==
{{main|Summation of Grandi's series}}

The last scholarly article to be motivated by 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · might be identified as the first article in the modern history of divergent series.&lt;ref&gt;For example, it is presented as such in Smail pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Frobenius]] published an article titled "Ueber die Leibnitzsche Reihe" (''On Leibniz's series'') in 1880. He had found Leibniz's old letter to Wolff, citing it along with an 1836 article by [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe]], who in turn drew on ideas by Leibniz and Daniel Bernoulli.&lt;ref&gt;Raabe p.355; Frobenius p.262&lt;/ref&gt;

Frobenius' short paper, barely two pages, begins by quoting from Leibniz's treatment of 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·. He infers that Leibniz was actually stating a generalization of [[Abel's Theorem]]. The result, now known as [[Frobenius' theorem (divergent series)|Frobenius' theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Smail p.4&lt;/ref&gt; has a simple statement in modern terms: any series that is [[Cesàro summation|Cesàro summable]] is also [[Abel summation|Abel summable]] to the same sum. Historian Giovanni Ferraro emphasizes that Frobenius did not actually state the theorem in such terms, and Leibniz did not state it at all. Leibniz was defending the association of the divergent series {{nowrap|1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·}} with the value &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while Frobenius' theorem is stated in terms of convergent sequences and the [[epsilon-delta]] formulation of the [[limit of a function]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 1999 p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

Frobenius' theorem was soon followed with further generalizations by [[Otto Hölder]] and [[Thomas Joannes Stieltjes]] in 1882. Again, to a modern reader their work strongly suggests new definitions of the sum of a divergent series, but those authors did not yet make that step. [[Ernesto Cesàro]] proposed a systematic definition for the first time in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro 1999 pp.117, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, mathematicians have explored many different summability methods for divergent series. Most of these, especially the simpler ones with historical parallels, sum Grandi's series to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Others, motivated by Daniel Bernoulli's work, sum the series to another value, and a few do not sum it at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], the '''homeomorphism group''' of a [[topological space]] is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] consisting of all [[homeomorphism]]s from the space to itself with [[function composition]] as the group [[binary operation|operation]]. Homeomorphism groups are very important in the theory of topological spaces and in general are examples of [[automorphism group]]s. Homeomorphism groups are [[topological invariant]]s in the sense that the homeomorphism groups of homeomorphic topological spaces are [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic as groups]].

==Properties and Examples==
There is a natural [[group action]] of the homeomorphism group of a space on that space. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space and denote the homeomorphism group of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The action is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    G\times X &amp;\longrightarrow X\\
    (\varphi, x) &amp;\longmapsto \varphi(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a group action since for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi\in G&lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt;\varphi\cdot(\psi\cdot x)=\varphi(\psi(x))=(\varphi\circ\psi)(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the group action, and the [[identity element]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (which is the [[identity function]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) sends points to themselves. If this action is [[transitive group action|transitive]], then the space is said to be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]].

===Topology===
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
As with other sets of maps between topological spaces, the homeomorphism group can be given a topology, such as the [[compact-open topology]].
In the case of regular, locally compact spaces the group multiplication is then continuous.

If the space is compact and Hausdorff, the inversion is continuous as well and &lt;math&gt;Homeo(X)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[topological group]] as one can easily show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/173093/homeomorphisms-of-x-form-a-topological-group|title=Homeomorphisms of X form a topological group|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff, locally compact  and locally connected this holds as well.&lt;ref name="vu.nl"&gt;http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dijkstra/research/papers/2005compactopen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However there are locally compact separable metric spaces for which the inversion map is not continuous and &lt;math&gt;Homeo(X)&lt;/math&gt; therefore not a topological group.&lt;ref name="vu.nl"/&gt;

In the category of topological spaces with homeomorphisms, object groups are exactly homeomorphism groups.

==Mapping class group==
{{Main|Mapping class group}}
In [[geometric topology]] especially, one considers the [[quotient group]] obtained by quotienting out by [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]], called the [[mapping class group]]:
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm MCG}(X) = {\rm Homeo}(X) / {\rm Homeo}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;
The MCG can also be interpreted as the 0th [[homotopy group]], &lt;math&gt;{\rm MCG}(X) = \pi_0({\rm Homeo}(X))&lt;/math&gt;.
This yields the [[short exact sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;1 \rightarrow {\rm Homeo}_0(X) \rightarrow {\rm Homeo}(X) \rightarrow {\rm MCG}(X) \rightarrow 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In some applications, particularly surfaces, the homeomorphism group is studied via this short exact sequence, and by first studying the mapping class group and group of isotopically trivial homeomorphisms, and then (at times) the extension.

An interaction net system is specified by a set of agent types and a set of interaction rules. Interaction nets are an inherently distributed model of computation in the sense that computations can take place simultaneously in many parts of an interaction net, and no synchronisation is needed. The latter is guaranteed by the strong confluence property of reduction in this model of computation. Thus interaction nets provide a natural language for massive parallelism. Interaction nets are at the heart of many implementations of the [[lambda calculus]], such as efficient closed reduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Mackie|title=An Interaction Net Implementation of Closed Reduction|pages=43–59|date=2008|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24452-0_3|journal=Implementation and Application of Functional Languages: 20th International Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and optimal, in Lévy's sense, Lambdascope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Vincent|last1=van Oostrom|first2=Kees-Jan|last2=van de Looij|first3=Marijn |last3=Zwitserlood|title=Lambdascope: Another optimal implementation of the lambda-calculus|date=2010|url=http://www.phil.uu.nl/~oostrom/publication/pdf/lambdascope.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Interactions nets are graph-like structures consisting of ''agents'' and ''edges''.

An agent of type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and with ''arity'' &lt;math&gt;\text{ar}(\alpha) = n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; has one ''principal port'' and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ''auxiliary ports''. Any port can be connected to at most one edge. Ports that are not connected to any edge are called ''free ports''. Free ports together form the ''interface'' of an interaction net. All agent types belong to a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; called ''signature''.

An interaction net that consists solely of edges is called a ''wiring'' and usually denoted as &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. A ''tree'' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with its ''root'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is inductively defined either as an edge &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, or as an agent &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with its free principal port &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and its auxiliary ports &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; connected to the roots of other trees &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Graphically, the primitive structures of interaction nets can be represented as follows:

[[File:Primitives of Interaction Nets.png|Primitives of Interaction Nets]]

When two agents are connected to each other with their principal ports, they form an ''active pair''. For
active pairs one can introduce ''interaction rules'' which describe how the active pair rewrites to another interaction
net. An interaction net with no active pairs is said to be in ''normal form''. A signature &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\text{ar}: \Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; defined on it) along with a set of interaction rules defined for agents &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; together constitute an ''interaction system''.

== Interaction calculus ==

Textual representation of interaction nets is called the ''interaction calculus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernández|first1=Maribel|last2=Mackie|first2=Ian|title=A calculus for interaction nets|journal=Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming|date=1999|pages=170–187|doi=10.1007/10704567|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen as a programming language.

Inductively defined trees correspond to ''terms'' &lt;math&gt;t ::= \alpha(t_1, \dots, t_n)\ |\ x&lt;/math&gt; in the interaction calculus, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''name''.

Any interaction net &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be redrawn using the previously defined wiring and tree primitives as follows:

[[File:Interaction Net as Configuration.png|Interaction Net as Configuration]]

which in the interaction calculus corresponds to a ''configuration''

&lt;math&gt;c \equiv \langle t_1, \dots, t_m \ |\ v_1 = w_1, \dots, v_n = w_n \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary terms. The ordered sequence &lt;math&gt;t_1,...,t_m&lt;/math&gt; in the left-hand side is called an ''interface'', while the right-hand side contains an unordered multiset of ''equations'' &lt;math&gt;v_i = w_i&lt;/math&gt;. Wiring &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; translates to names, and each name has to occur exactly twice in a configuration.

Just like in the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-calculus, the interaction calculus has the notions of ''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-conversion'' and ''substitution'' naturally defined on configurations. Specifically, both occurrences of any name can be replaced with a
new name if the latter does not occur in a given configuration. Configurations are considered equivalent up to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-conversion. In turn, substitution &lt;math&gt;t[x := u]&lt;/math&gt; is the result of replacing the name &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with another term &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one occurrence in the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

Any interaction rule can be graphically represented as follows:
 
[[File:Interaction Rule.png|Interaction Rule]]

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and the interaction net &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; on the right-hand side is redrawn using the wiring and tree primitives in order to translate into the interaction calculus as &lt;math&gt;\alpha[v_1,\dots, v_m] \bowtie \beta[w_1,\dots, w_n]&lt;/math&gt; using Lafont's notation.

The interaction calculus defines reduction on configurations in more details than seen from graph
rewriting defined on interaction nets. Namely, if &lt;math&gt;\alpha[v_1,\dots, v_m] \bowtie \beta[w_1,\dots,w_n]&lt;/math&gt;, the following reduction:

&lt;math&gt;\langle \vec t\ |\ \alpha(t_1,\dots,t_m) = \beta(u_1,\dots,u_n), \Delta\rangle \rightarrow \langle \vec t\ |\ t_1 = v_1,\dots, t_m = v_m, u_1 = w_1,\dots, u_n = w_n, \Delta\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is called ''interaction''. When one of equations has the form of &lt;math&gt;x = u&lt;/math&gt;, ''indirection'' can be applied resulting
in substitution of the other occurrence of the name &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in some term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\langle \dots t \dots \ |\ x = u, \Delta\rangle \rightarrow \langle \dots t[x := u] \dots \ |\ \Delta\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
or
&lt;math&gt;\langle \vec t\ |\ x = u, t = w, \Delta\rangle \rightarrow \langle \vec t\ |\ t[x := u] = w, \Delta \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

An equation &lt;math&gt;x = t&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''deadlock'' if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has occurrence in term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Generally only deadlock-free interaction nets are considered. Together, interaction and indirection define the reduction relation on configurations. The fact that configuration &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; reduces to its ''normal form'' &lt;math&gt;c'&lt;/math&gt; with no equations left is denoted as &lt;math&gt;c \downarrow c'&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

Interaction nets benefit from the following properties:

* '''locality''' (only active pairs can be rewritten);
* '''linearity''' (each interaction rule can be applied in constant time);
* '''strong confluence''' also known as one-step diamond property (if &lt;math&gt;c \rightarrow c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c \rightarrow c_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_1 \rightarrow c'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2 \rightarrow c'&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c'&lt;/math&gt;).

These properties together allow massive parallelism.

== Interaction combinators ==

One of the simplest interaction systems that can simulate any other interaction system is that of ''interaction combinators''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Yves|last=Lafont|title=Interaction Combinators|journal=Information and Computation|volume=137|issue=1|pages=69–101|date=1997|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|doi=10.1006/inco.1997.2643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its signature is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{\epsilon, \delta, \gamma\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\text{ar}(\epsilon) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{ar}(\delta) = \text{ar}(\gamma) = 2&lt;/math&gt;. Interaction rules for these agents are:

* &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \bowtie \alpha[\epsilon,\dots, \epsilon]&lt;/math&gt; called ''erasing'';
* &lt;math&gt;\delta[\alpha(x_1,\dots, x_n), \alpha(y_1,\dots, y_n)] \bowtie \alpha[\delta(x_1, y_1),\dots, \delta(x_n, y_n)]&lt;/math&gt; called ''duplication'';
* &lt;math&gt;\delta[x, y] \bowtie \delta[x, y]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma[x, y] \bowtie \gamma[y, x]&lt;/math&gt; called ''annihilation''.

Graphically, the erasing and duplication rules can be represented as follows:

[[File:Examples of Interaction Nets.png|Examples of Interaction Nets]]

with an example of a non-terminating interaction net that reduces to itself. Its infinite reduction sequence starting from the corresponding configuration in the interaction calculus is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\langle \varnothing\ |\ \delta(\epsilon, x) = \gamma(x, \epsilon)\rangle \rightarrow \\
&amp;\langle \varnothing\ |\ \epsilon = \gamma(x_1, x_2),\ x = \gamma(y_1, y_2),\ x = \delta(x_1, y_1),\ \epsilon = \delta(x_2, y_2)\rangle \rightarrow^* \\
&amp;\langle \varnothing\ |\ x_1 = \epsilon,\ x_2 = \epsilon,\ x = \gamma(y_1, y_2),\ x = \delta(x_1, y_1),\ x_2 = \epsilon,\ y_2 = \epsilon\rangle \rightarrow^* \\
&amp;\langle \varnothing\ |\ \delta(\epsilon, x) = \gamma(x, \epsilon)\rangle \rightarrow \dots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Non-deterministic extension ==

Interaction nets are essentially deterministic and cannot model non-deterministic computations directly. In order to express non-deterministic choice, interaction nets need to be extended. In fact, it is sufficient to introduce just one agent &lt;math&gt;\text{amb}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernández|first1=Maribel|last2=Khalil|first2=Lionel|title=Interaction Nets with McCarthy's Amb: Properties and Applications|journal=Nordic Journal of Computing|date=2003|volume=10|issue=2|pages=134–162|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220369522_Interaction_Nets_with_McCarthy%27s_amb}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two principal ports and the following interaction rules:

[[File:Non-deterministic Agent.png|Non-deterministic Agent]]

This distinguished agent represents ambiguous choice and can be used to simulate any other agent with arbitrary number of principal ports. For instance, it allows to define a &lt;math&gt;\text{ParallelOr}&lt;/math&gt; boolean operation that returns true if any of its arguments is true, independently of the computation taking place in the other arguments.

The '''International Society of Dynamic Games (ISDG)''' is an international [[non-profit]], [[professional body|professional organization]] for the advancement of the theory of [[dynamic game]]s.

==History==
The ISDG was founded on August 9, 1990 in [[Helsinki, Finland]], at the site of the 4th International Symposium on Dynamic games and Applications in the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. ISDG is governed by an executive board chaired by a president. The first president of the society was professor [[Tamer Başar]]. In past years the presidents of ISDG were
* [[Tamer Başar]] 1990-1994
* Alain Haurie 1994-1998
* Pierre Bernhard 1998-2002
* Georges Zaccour 2002-2006
* Geert Jan Olsder 2006-2008
* [[Leon Petrosjan|Leon Petrosyan]] 2008-2012
* Michèle Breton 2012-2016
* Vladimir Mazalov 2016-

==The objectives of ISDG==
* to promote and foster the development and applications of the theory of dynamic games. 
* to disseminate scientific information through all conveniently adopted support services. ISDG achieves these goals by organizing or co-organizing [http://www.isdg-site.org/default.aspx?page=isdg_meet symposia, conferences and workshops] and publishing distinguished high-standard journals
* to establish links with the international scientific community and in particular with other societies dealing with game theory, optimization, decision analysis and dynamical systems.

==The Isaacs Award==
The executive board of the International Society of Dynamic Games decided in 2003 to establish a prize to recognize the "outstanding contribution to the theory and applications of dynamic games" of two scholars at each of its symposium, starting in 2004. The prize was named after [[Rufus Isaacs (game theorist)|Rufus Isaacs]], the acknowledged founding father of [[differential games]]. The recipients of this prize are:

'''Karl Georg Christian von Staudt''' (24 January 1798 – 1 June 1867) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] who used [[synthetic geometry]] to provide a foundation for arithmetic.

==Life and influence==
Karl was born in the Free Imperial City of Rothenburg, which is now called [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] in Germany. From 1814 he studied in Gymnasium in Ausbach.  He attended the [[University of Göttingen]] from 1818 to 1822 where he studied with [[Gauss]] who was director of the observatory. Staudt provided an [[ephemeris]] for the orbits of [[Mars]] and the [[asteroid]] [[2 Pallas|Pallas]]. When in 1821 [[Comet]] Nicollet-Pons was observed, he provided the elements of its [[orbit]]. These accomplishments in [[astronomy]] earned him his doctorate from [[University of Erlangen]] in 1822.

Staudt's professional career began as a secondary school instructor in [[Würzburg]] until 1827 and then [[Nuremberg]] until 1835. He married Jeanette Dreschler in 1832. They had a son Eduard and daughter Mathilda, but Jeanette died in 1848.

The book ''Geometrie der Lage'' (1847) was a landmark in [[projective geometry]]. As Burau (1976) wrote:
:Staudt was the first to adopt a fully rigorous approach. Without exception his predecessors still spoke of distances, perpendiculars, angles and other entities that play no role in projective geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burau (1976) "Karl Georg Christian von Staudt", [[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]], auspices of [[American Council of Learned Societies]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, this book (page 43) uses the [[complete quadrangle]] to "construct the fourth harmonic associated with three points on a straight line", the [[projective harmonic conjugate]].

Indeed, in 1889 [[Mario Pieri]] translated von Staudt, before writing his ''I Principii della Geometrie di Posizione Composti in un Systema Logico-deduttivo'' (1898). In 1900 [[Charlotte Scott]] of [[Bryn Mawr College]] paraphased much of von Staudt's work in English for ''The Mathematical Gazette''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlotte Scott]] (1900) "On von Staudt's ''Geometrie der Lage''", ''The Mathematical Gazette'' 1(19):307–14, 1(20):323–31, 1(22):363–70&lt;/ref&gt;
When [[Wilhelm Blaschke]] published his [[textbook]] ''Projective Geometry'' in 1948, a portrait of the young Karl was placed opposite the ''Vorwort''.

Staudt went beyond real projective geometry and into [[complex projective space]] in his three volumes of ''Beiträge zur Geometrie der Lage'' published from 1856 to 1860.

In 1922 [[H. F. Baker]] wrote of von Staudt's work:
:It was von Staudt to whom the elimination of the ideas of distance and congruence was a conscious aim, if, also, the recognition of the importance of this might have been much delayed save for the work of Cayley and Klein upon the projective theory of distance. Generalised, and combined with the subsequent Dissertation of Riemann, v. Staudt's volumes must be held to be the foundation of what, on its geometrical side, the Theory of Relativity, in Physics, may yet become.&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Baker (1922) ''Principles of Geometry'', volume 1, page176, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Staudt is also remembered for his view of [[conic section]]s and the relation of [[pole and polar]]:
:Von Staudt made the important discovery that the relation which a conic establishes between poles and polars is really more fundamental than the conic itself, and can be set up independently. This "polarity" can then be used to ''define'' the conic, in a manner that is perfectly symmetrical and immediately self-dual: a conic is simply the locus of points which lie on their polars, or the envelope of lines which pass through their poles. Von Staudt’s treatment of [[quadric]]s is analogous, in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;H.S.M. Coxeter (1942) Non-Euclidean Geometry, pp 48,9, [[University of Toronto Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebra of throws==
In 1857, in the second ''Beiträge'', von Staudt contributed a route to number through geometry called the '''algebra of throws''' ({{lang-de|Wurftheorie}}). It is based on [[projective range]] and the relation of [[projective harmonic conjugate]]s. Through operations of addition of points and multiplication of points, one obtains an "algebra of points", as in chapter 6 of Veblen &amp; Young's textbook on projective geometry. The usual presentation relies on [[cross ratio]] (''CA,BD'') of four collinear points. For instance, Coolidge wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Coolidge]] (1940) ''A History of Geometrical Methods'', pages 100, 101, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:How do we add two distances together? We give them the same starting point, find the point midway between their terminal points, that is to say, the harmonic conjugate of infinity with regard to their terminal points, and then find the harmonic conjugate of the initial point with regard to this mid-point and infinity. Generalizing this, if we wish to add throws (''CA,BD'') and (''CA,BD' ''), we find ''M'' the harmonic conjugate of ''C'' with regard to ''D'' and ''D' '', and then ''S'' the harmonic conjugate of ''A'' with regard to ''C'' and ''M'' :
::&lt;math&gt;(CA,BD) + (CA,BD') = (CA,BS) .\ &lt;/math&gt;
:In the same way we may find a definition of the product of two throws. As the product of two numbers bears the same ratio to one of them as the other bears to unity, the ratio of two numbers is the cross ratio which they as a pair bear to infinity and zero, so Von Staudt, in the previous notation, defines the product of two throws by
::&lt;math&gt;(CA,BD) \cdot (CA,DD') = (CA,BD').&lt;/math&gt;
:These definitions involve a long series of steps to show that the algebra so defined obeys the usual commutative, associative, and distributive laws, and that there are no divisors of zero.

A summary statement is given by Veblen &amp; Young&lt;ref&gt;Veblen &amp; Young page 141&lt;/ref&gt; as Theorem 10: "The set of points on a line, with &lt;math&gt;P_\infin&lt;/math&gt; removed, forms a [[field (mathematics)|field]] with respect to the operations previously defined". As Freudenthal notes&lt;ref name=HF74/&gt;{{rp|199}}
:...up to Hilbert, there is no other example for such a direct derivation of the algebraic laws from geometric axioms as found in von Staudt's ''Beiträge''.

Another affirmation of von Staudt's work with the harmonic conjugates comes in the form of a theorem:
:The only one-to-one correspondence between the real points on a line which preserves the harmonic relation between four points is a non-singular projectivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1953) ''Lectures on Analytic and Projective Geometry'', p 22, "theorem of von Staudt"&lt;/ref&gt;

The algebra of throws was described as "projective arithmetic" in ''The Four Pillars of Geometry'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stillwell]], [[Sheldon Axler]], [[Ken A. Ribet]] (2005) ''The Four Pillars of Geometry'', page 128, Springer: [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] {{ISBN|978-0-387-29052-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a section called "Projective arithmetic", he says
:The real difficulty is that the construction of ''a'' + ''b'' , for example, is different from the construction of ''b'' + ''a'', so it is a "coincidence" if ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''. Similarly it is a "coincidence" if ''ab'' = ''ba'', of any other law of algebra holds. Fortunately, we can show that the required coincidences actually occur, because they are implied by certain geometric coincidences, namely the Pappus and Desargues theorems.

If one interprets von Staudt’s work as a [[construction of the real numbers]], then it is incomplete. One of the required properties is that a bounded sequence has a [[cluster point]]. As [[Hans Freudenthal]] observed:

:To be able to consider  von Staudt's approach as a rigorous foundation of projective geometry, one need only add explicitly the topological axioms which are tacitly used by von Staudt. ... how can one formulate the [[topology]] of projective space without the support of a metric? Von Staudt was still far from raising this question, which a quarter of a century later  would become urgent. ... [[Felix Klein]] noticed the gap in von Staudt's approach; he was aware of the need to formulate the topology of projective space independently of Euclidean space.... the Italians were the first to find truly satisfactory solutions for the problem of a purely projective foundation of projective geometry, which von Staudt had tried to solve.&lt;ref name=HF74&gt;[[Hans Freudenthal]] (1974) "The Impact of Von Staudt's Foundations of Geometry", in ''For Dirk Struik'', R.S. Cohen editor, [[D. Reidel]]. Also found in ''Geometry – von Staudt’s Point of View'', Peter Plaumann &amp; Karl Strambach editors, Proceedings of NATO Advanced Study Institute, Bad Windsheim, July/August 1980, D. Reidel, {{ISBN|90-277-1283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Italian mathematicians was [[Giovanni Vailati]] who studied the [[circular order]] property of the real projective line. The science of this order requires a [[relation (mathematics)|quaternary relation]] called the [[separation relation]]. Using this relation, the concepts of monotone sequence and limit can be addressed, in a cyclic "line". Assuming that every monotone sequence has a limit,&lt;ref&gt;[[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1949) ''The Real Projective Plane'', Chapter 10: Continuity, [[McGraw Hill]]&lt;/ref&gt; the line becomes a [[complete space]]. These developments were inspired by von Staudt’s deductions of [[field axioms]] as an initiative in the derivation of properties of ℝ from axioms in projective geometry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">'''Khinchin's theorem on the factorization of distributions''' says that every [[probability distribution]] ''P'' admits (in the convolution semi-group of probability distributions) a factorization

:&lt;math&gt;P = P_1 \otimes P_2 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a probability distribution without any [[indecomposable distribution|indecomposable]] factor and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a distribution that is either degenerate or is representable as the convolution of a finite or countable set of indecomposable distributions. The factorization is not unique, in general.

The theorem was proved by [[A. Ya. Khinchin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the arithmetic of distribution laws|last=Kinchin|first=A. Ya.|publisher=Byull. Moskov. Gos. Univ.

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, '''LCF notation''' or '''LCF code''' is a notation devised by [[Joshua Lederberg]], and extended by [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M.

A single graph may have multiple different representations in LCF notation.

==Description==
In a Hamiltonian graph, the vertices can be [[circular layout|arranged in a cycle]], which accounts for two edges per vertex.  The third edge from each vertex can then be described by how many positions clockwise (positive) or counter-clockwise (negative) it leads. The basic form of the LCF notation is just the sequence of these numbers of positions, starting from an arbitrarily chosen vertex and written in square brackets.
The numbers between the brackets are interpreted [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''N'', where ''N'' is the number of vertices. Entries congruent modulo ''N'' to 0, 1, or ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 do not appear in this sequence of numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Klavdija Kutnar and Dragan Marušič, [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606585v1 "Hamiltonicity of vertex-transitive graphs of order 4''p'',"] ''European Journal of Combinatorics'', Volume 29,  Issue 2 (February 2008), pp. 423-438, section 2.&lt;/ref&gt; because they would correspond either to a [[loop (graph theory)|loop]] or [[multigraph|multiple adjacency]], neither of which are permitted in simple graphs.

Often the pattern repeats, and the number of repetitions can be indicated by a superscript in the notation.  For example, the [[Nauru graph]],&lt;ref name="DE1"/&gt; shown on the right, has four repetitions of the same six offsets, and can be represented by the LCF notation [5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;9,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;7,&amp;nbsp;9,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;5]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. A single graph may have multiple different LCF notations, depending on the choices of Hamiltonian cycle and starting vertex.

==Applications==
LCF notation is useful in publishing concise descriptions of Hamiltonian cubic graphs, such as the examples below.  In addition, some software packages for manipulating graphs include utilities for creating a graph from its LCF notation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/AddOns/view.aspx?path=GraphTheory/SpecialGraphs/LCFGraph Maple], [http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/generated/networkx.LCF_graph.html NetworkX], [http://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-Generators.html#igraph_lcf igraph], and [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html#sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.LCFGraph sage].&lt;/ref&gt;

If a graph is represented by LCF notation, it is straightforward to test whether the graph is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]]: this is true if and only if all of the offsets in the LCF notation are odd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Extended LCF notation ==
A more complex extended version of LCF notation was provided by Coxeter, Frucht, and Powers in later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=H. S. M. |last1=Coxeter |first2=Robert |last2=Frucht |first3=David L. |last3=Powers |title=Zero-symmetric graphs: trivalent graphical regular representations of groups |year=1981 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-194580-4|mr=0658666 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they introduced an "anti-palindromic" notation: if the second half of the numbers between the square brackets was the reverse of the first half, but with all the signs changed, then it was replaced by a semicolon and a dash. The Nauru graph satisfies this condition with [5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;9,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;7,&amp;nbsp;9,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;5]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and so can be written [5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;9,&amp;nbsp;7;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; in the extended notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coxeter|Frucht|Powers|1981}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">[[File:ATCGATCGA$ Suffix Tree.png|thumb|A suffix tree of the letters ATCGATCGA$]]In [[computer science]], the '''longest repeated substring problem''' is the problem of finding the longest [[substring]] of a [[string (computer science)|string]] that occurs at least twice. 

This problem can be solved in linear time and space &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n)&lt;/math&gt; by building a [[suffix tree]] for the string (with a special end-of-string symbol like '$' appended), and finding the deepest internal node in the tree.  Depth is measured by the number of characters traversed from the root.  The string spelled by the edges from the root to such a node is a longest repeated substring. The problem of finding the longest substring with at least &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; occurrences can be solved by first preprocessing the tree to count the number of leaf descendants for each internal node, and then finding the deepest node with at least &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; leaf descendants that have no children. To avoid overlapping repeats, you can check that the list of suffix lengths has no consecutive elements with less than prefix-length difference.

In the figure with the string "ATCGATCGA$", the longest substring that repeats at least twice is "ATCGA".

For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer.]]
[[File:Cut Napkin ring problem Animation created with openscad.gif|thumb|Animation of a cut napkin ring with constant height]]

In [[geometry]], the '''napkin-ring problem''' involves finding the volume of a "band" of specified height around a [[sphere]], i.e. the part that remains after a hole in the shape of a circular cylinder is drilled through the center of the sphere. It is a counterintuitive fact that this volume does not depend on the original sphere's [[radius]] but only on the resulting band's height.

The problem is so called because after removing a cylinder from the sphere, the remaining band resembles the shape of a [[napkin ring]].

== Statement ==
Suppose that the axis of a [[right circular cylinder]] passes through the center of a sphere of radius&amp;nbsp;''R'' and that ''h'' represents the height (defined as the distance in a direction [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the axis) of the part of the cylinder that is inside the sphere. The "band" is the part of the sphere that is outside the cylinder. The volume of the band depends on ''h'' but not on&amp;nbsp;''R'':

: &lt;math&gt; V=\frac{\pi h^3}{6}. &lt;/math&gt;

As the radius ''R'' of the sphere shrinks, the diameter of the cylinder must also shrink in order that ''h'' can remain the same.  The band gets thicker, and this would increase its volume.  But it also gets shorter in circumference, and this would decrease its volume.  The two effects exactly cancel each other out.  In the extreme case of the smallest possible sphere, the cylinder vanishes (its radius becomes zero) and the height&amp;nbsp;''h'' equals the diameter of the sphere.  In this case the volume of the band is the [[volume of a sphere|volume of the whole sphere]], which matches the formula given above.

An early study of this problem was written by 17th-century [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese mathematician]] [[Seki Kōwa]]. According to {{harvtxt|Smith|Mikami|1914}}, Seki called this solid an arc-ring, or in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''kokan'' or ''kokwan''.

== Proof ==
Suppose the radius of the sphere is &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and the length of the cylinder (or the tunnel) is &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the radius of the cylinder is

[[Image:ring cross-sections.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Finding the measurements of the ring that is the horizontal cross-section.]]

: &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{R^2 - \left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^2},\qquad\qquad(1) &lt;/math&gt;

and the radius of the horizontal cross-section of the sphere at height&amp;nbsp;''y'' above the "equator" is

: &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{R^2 - y^2}.\qquad\qquad(2) &lt;/math&gt;

The [[cross-section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the band with the plane at height&amp;nbsp;''y'' is the region inside the larger circle of radius given by&amp;nbsp;(2) and outside the smaller circle of radius given by&amp;nbsp;(1). The cross-section's area is therefore the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {}\quad \pi(\text{larger radius})^2 - \pi(\text{smaller radius})^2 \\
&amp; = \pi\left(\sqrt{R^2 - y^2}\right)^2 - \pi\left(\sqrt{R^2 - \left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^2\,{}}\,\right)^2 = \pi\left(\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^2 - y^2\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The radius ''R'' does not appear in the last quantity.  Therefore, the area of the horizontal cross-section at height&amp;nbsp;''y'' does not depend on&amp;nbsp;''R'', as long as ''y'' &amp;le; {{sfrac|''h''|2}} &amp;le; ''R''.  The volume of the band is

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{-h/2}^{h/2} (\text{area of cross-section at height }y) \, dy, &lt;/math&gt;

and that does not depend on&amp;nbsp;''R''.

This is an application of [[Cavalieri's principle]]: volumes with equal-sized corresponding cross-sections are equal.  Indeed, the area of the cross-section is the same as that of the corresponding cross-section of a sphere of radius ''h''/2, which has volume

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\pi\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{\pi h^3}{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Neyman construction''' is a [[frequentist]] method to construct an interval at a [[confidence level]] &lt;math&gt; C, \,&lt;/math&gt; such that if we repeat the experiment many times the interval will contain the true value of some parameter a fraction &lt;math&gt; C\,&lt;/math&gt; of the time. It is named after [[Jerzy Neyman]].

==Coverage probability==
The probability that the interval contains the true value is called the [[coverage probability]].

==Implementation==
A Neyman construction can be carried out by performing [[pseudo-experiment]]s, i.e. constructing data sets corresponding to a given value of the parameter. The pseudo-experiments are fitted with conventional methods, and the space of fitted parameter values constitutes the band which the confidence interval can be selected from.

As a generalized approach for [[nonuniform sampling]], the NUDFT allows one to obtain frequency domain information of a finite length signal at any frequency. One of the reasons to adopt the NUDFT is that many signals have their energy distributed nonuniformly in the frequency domain. Therefore, a nonuniform sampling scheme could be more convenient and useful in many [[digital signal processing]] applications. For example, the NUDFT provides a variable spectral resolution controlled by the user.

==Definition==
The ''nonuniform discrete Fourier transform'' transforms a sequence of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; complex numbers &lt;math&gt;x_0, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; into another sequence of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;X_0, \ldots, X_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; defined by
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-2\pi i p_n \omega_k}, \quad 0 \leq k \leq N-1,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;p_0, \ldots, p_{N-1} \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; are sample points and &lt;math&gt;\omega_0, \ldots, \omega_{N-1} \in [0,N]&lt;/math&gt; are frequencies. Note that if &lt;math&gt;p_n = n/N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_k = k&lt;/math&gt;, then equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) reduces to the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. There are three types of NUDFTs.&lt;ref name="Greengard2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greengard|first1=Leslie|last2=Lee|first2=June-Yub|title=Accelerating the Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform|journal=SIAM Review|date=January 2004|volume=46|issue=3|pages=443–454|doi=10.1137/S003614450343200X|bibcode=2004SIAMR..46..443G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The nonuniform discrete Fourier transform of type I (NUDFT-I) uses uniform sample points &lt;math&gt;p_k = k/N&lt;/math&gt; but nonuniform (i.e. non-integer) frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;. This corresponds to evaluating a [[generalized Fourier series]] at equispaced points.
* The nonuniform discrete Fourier transform of type II (NUDFT-II) uses uniform (i.e. integer) frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_n = k&lt;/math&gt; but nonuniform sample points &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;. This corresponds to evaluating a Fourier series at nonequispaced points.
* The nonuniform discrete Fourier transform of type III (NUDFT-III) uses both nonuniform sample points &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; and nonuniform frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;. This corresponds to evaluating a [[generalized Fourier series]] at nonequispaced points.

Inverse NUDFTs are defined by substituting &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;+i&lt;/math&gt; in equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).

==Multidimensional NUDFT==
The multidimensional NUDFT converts a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional array of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;x_{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt; into another &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional array of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;X_{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;X_{\mathbf{k}} = \sum_{\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{N}-1} x_{\mathbf{n}} e^{-2\pi i \mathbf{p}_{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathbf{k}}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_{\mathbf{k}} \in [0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; are sample points, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}_{\mathbf{n}} \in [0,N_1] \times [0,N_2] \times \cdots \times [0,N_d]&lt;/math&gt; are frequencies, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} = (n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = (k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_d)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vectors of indices from 0 to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}-1 = (N_1-1,N_2-1,\ldots,N_d-1)&lt;/math&gt;. The multidimensional NUDFTs of types I, II, and III are defined analogously to the 1D case.&lt;ref name="Greengard2004"/&gt;

==Relationship to Z-transform==
The NUDFT can be expressed as a [[Z-transform]].&lt;ref name="Marvasti2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marvasti|first1=Farokh|title=Nonuniform Sampling: Theory and Practice|date=2001|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4615-1229-5|pages=325–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NUDFT of a sequence &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;X(z_k)=X(z)|_{z=z_k}=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]z_k^{-n},\quad k=0, 1, ..., N-1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;X(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the Z-transform of &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{z_i\}_{i=0, 1, ..., N-1}&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrarily distinct points in the z-plane. Note that the NUDFT reduces to the DFT when the sampling points are located on the unit circle at equally spaced angles.

Expressing the above as a matrix, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
 X(z_0)\\
 X(z_1)\\
 \vdots\\
 X(z_{N-1})
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\mathbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}
 x[0]\\
 x[1]\\
 \vdots\\
 x[N-1]
\end{bmatrix},\text{ and}\quad
\mathbf{D}=\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; z_0^{-1} &amp; z_0^{-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; z_0^{-(N-1)}\\
 1 &amp; z_1^{-1} &amp; z_1^{-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; z_1^{-(N-1)}\\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
 1 &amp; z_{N-1}^{-1} &amp; z_{N-1}^{-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; z_{N-1}^{-(N-1)}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Direct inversion of the NUDFT===
As we can see, the NUDFT is characterized by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; and hence the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;{z_k}&lt;/math&gt; points. If we further factorize &lt;math&gt;det(\mathbf{D})&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular provided the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;{z_k}&lt;/math&gt; points are distinct. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, we can get a unique inverse NUDFT as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{D^{-1}}\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}\text{ and }\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt;, we can use [[Gaussian elimination]] to solve for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;. However, the complexity of this method is &lt;math&gt;O(N^3)&lt;/math&gt;. To solve this problem more efficiently, we first determine &lt;math&gt;X(z)&lt;/math&gt; directly by polynomial interpolation:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat X [k]=X(z_k),\quad k=0, 1, ..., N-1&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the above interpolating polynomial.

Expressing &lt;math&gt;X(z)&lt;/math&gt; as the Lagrange polynomial of order &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;X(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\frac{L_k(z)}{L_k(z_k)}\hat X [k],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\{L_i(z)\}_{i=0, 1, ..., N-1}&lt;/math&gt; are the fundamental polynomials:

:&lt;math&gt;L_k(z)=\prod_{i\ne k}(1-z_iz^{-1}),\quad k=0, 1, ..., N-1&lt;/math&gt;.

Expressing &lt;math&gt;X(z)&lt;/math&gt; by the Newton interpolation method, we get
:&lt;math&gt;X(z)=c_0 + c_1(1-z_0z^{-1}) + c_2(1-z_0z^{-1})(1-z_1z^{-1}) + \cdots + c_{N-1}\prod_{k=0}^{N-2}(1-z_kz^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_j&lt;/math&gt; is the divided difference of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th order of &lt;math&gt;\hat X [0], \hat X [1], ..., \hat X [j]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;z_0, z_1, ..., z_j&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;c_0 = \hat X [0],&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_1 = \frac{\hat X [1]-c_0}{1-z_0z_1^{-1}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_2 = \frac{\hat X [2]-c_0-c_1(1-z_0z^{-1})}{(1-z_0z_2^{-1})(1-z_1z_2^{-1})},&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;

The disadvantage of the Lagrange representation is that any additional point included will increase the order of the interpolating polynomial, leading to the need to recompute all the fundamental polynomials. However, any additional point included in the Newton representation only requires the addition of one more term.

We can use a lower triangular system to solve &lt;math&gt;\{c_j\}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
 \hat X [0]\\
 \hat X [1]\\
 \vdots\\
 \hat X [N-1]
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\mathbf{c}=\begin{bmatrix}
 c_0\\
 c_1\\
 \vdots\\
 c_{N-1}
\end{bmatrix},\text{ and}\quad
\mathbf{L}=\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
 1 &amp; (1-z_0z_1^{-1}) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
 1 &amp; (1-z_0z_2^{-1}) &amp; (1-z_0z_2^{-1})(1-z_1z_2^{-1}) &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
 1 &amp; (1-z_0z_{N-1}^{-1}) &amp; (1-z_0z_{N-1}^{-1})(1-z_1z_{N-1}^{-1}) &amp; \cdots &amp; \prod_{k=0}^{N-2}(1-z_kz_{N-1}^{-1})
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

By the above equation, &lt;math&gt;\{c_j\}&lt;/math&gt; can be computed within &lt;math&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt; operations. In this way Newton interpolation is more efficient than Lagrange Interpolation unless the latter is modified by
:&lt;math&gt;L_{k+1}(z) = \frac{(1-z_{k+1}z^{-1})}{(1-z_kz^{-1})}L_k(z),\quad k=0, 1, ..., N-1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Nonuniform fast Fourier transform==
While a naive application of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) results in an &lt;math&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt; algorithm for computing the NUDFT, &lt;math&gt;O(N \log N)&lt;/math&gt; algorithms based on the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) do exist. Such algorithms are referred to as NUFFTs or NFFTs and have been developed based on oversampling and interpolation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutt|first1=A.|last2=Rokhlin|first2=V.|title=Fast Fourier Transforms for Nonequispaced Data|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|date=November 1993|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1368–1393|doi=10.1137/0914081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potts|first1=Daniel|last2=Steidl|first2=Gabriele|title=Fast Summation at Nonequispaced Knots by NFFT|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|date=January 2003|volume=24|issue=6|pages=2013–2037|doi=10.1137/S1064827502400984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=John P|title=A fast algorithm for Chebyshev, Fourier, and sinc interpolation onto an irregular grid|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|date=December 1992|volume=103|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1016/0021-9991(92)90399-J|bibcode=1992JCoPh.103..243B}}&lt;/ref&gt; min-max interpolation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fessler|first1=J.A.|last2=Sutton|first2=B.P.|title=Nonuniform fast fourier transforms using min-max interpolation|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date=February 2003|volume=51|issue=2|pages=560–574|doi=10.1109/TSP.2002.807005|bibcode=2003ITSP...51..560F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low-rank approximation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruiz-Antolín|first1=Diego|last2=Townsend|first2=Alex|title=A Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform Based on Low Rank Approximation|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|date=20 February 2018|volume=40|issue=1|pages=A529–A547|doi=10.1137/17M1134822|arxiv=1701.04492}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, NUFFTs leverage the FFT by converting the nonuniform problem into a uniform problem (or a sequence of uniform problems) to which the FFT can be applied.&lt;ref name="Greengard2004"/&gt; Software libraries for performing NUFFTs are available in 1D, 2D, and 3D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NUFFT page|url=https://cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html|website=cims.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFFT|url=http://www.nfft.org/|website=www.nfft.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MikaelSlevinsky/FastTransforms.jl|url=https://github.com/MikaelSlevinsky/FastTransforms.jl|website=GitHub|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=chebfun/chebfun|url=https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun|website=GitHub|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre-Louis Lions''' ({{IPA-fr|ljɔ̃ːs|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czl1a084HGQ CORE Fields Medal Talk: Pierre-Louis Lions on Mean Field Games]&lt;!--at 0:13--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; born 11 August 1956) is a [[French people|French]] mathematician.

==Biography==
His parents were [[Jacques-Louis Lions]], a mathematician and at that time professor at the [[University of Nancy]], who became President of the [[International Mathematical Union]], and Andrée Olivier, his wife. He graduated from the [[École Normale Supérieure|École normale supérieure]]  in 1977 (same year as [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]], another Fields Medalist). Refusing to take the ''agrégation'' in Mathematics, he chose to carry out research in applied mathematics and received his doctorate from the [[University of Pierre and Marie Curie]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |format=PDF|url=http://www2.cnrs.fr/sites/communique/fichier/medailles_fields_francaises_corrige.pdf |title=La Médaille Fields : 11 lauréats sur 44 sont issus de laboratoires français., Alain Connes, |work=www2.cnrs.fr  | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lions received the [[Fields Medal]], for his work on theory of [[nonlinear partial differential equation]]s, in 1994 while working at the [[Université Paris-Dauphine|University of Paris-Dauphine]]. He was the first to give a complete solution to the [[Boltzmann equation]] with proof. Other awards Lions received include the IBM Prize in 1987 and the Philip Morris Prize in 1991. He was an invited professor at the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Louis Lions, « Analyse, modèles et simulations », ''Université de tous les savoirs'', '''4''', 86-92, Éditions Odile Jacob, Paris, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a doctor honoris causa of [[Heriot-Watt University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ae-info.org/ae/User/Lions_Pierre-Louis|title=Academy of Europe: Lions Pierre-Louis|last=Hoffmann|first=Ilire Hasani, Robert|website=www.ae-info.org|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Edinburgh]]), [[Narvik University College]] (2014), and of the [[City University of Hong Kong|City University of Hong-Kong]] and is listed as an [[ISI highly cited researcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the position of Professor of ''[[Partial differential equations]] and their applications'' at the [[Collège de France]] in Paris as well as a position at [[École Polytechnique]].

In the paper "Viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations" (1983), written with [[Michael G. Crandall]], he introduced the notion of [[viscosity solutions]]. This has had an effect on the theory of partial differential equations.

'''Proof of stake''' ('''PoS''') is a type of algorithm by which a [[cryptocurrency]] [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]] network aims to achieve [[Consensus (computer science)|distributed consensus]]. In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (''i.e.,'' the stake). In contrast, the algorithm of [[Proof-of-work system|proof-of-work]]-based cryptocurrencies such as [[bitcoin]] uses [[Bitcoin network#Mining|mining]]; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

==Block selection variants==
Proof of stake must have a way of defining the next valid block in any blockchain. Selection by account balance would result in (undesirable) centralization, as the single richest member would have a permanent advantage. Instead, several different methods of selection have been devised.

===Randomized block selection===
[[Nxt]] and BlackCoin use randomization to predict the following generator by using a formula that looks for the lowest hash value in combination with the size of the stake.&lt;ref name=nxt-whitepaper-blocks /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name=nxt-math-of-forging /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name="BlackCoin PoS v2 White Paper" /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}} Since the stakes are public, each node can predict—with reasonable accuracy—which account will next win the right to forge a block.

===Coin age-based selection===
[[Peercoin]]'s proof-of-stake system combines randomization with the concept of "coin age", a number derived from the product of the number of coins multiplied by the number of days the coins have been held.

Coins that have been unspent for at least 30 days begin competing for the next block. Older and larger sets of coins have a greater probability of signing the next block. However, once a stake of coins has been used to sign a block, it must start over with zero "coin age" and thus wait at least 30 more days before signing another block. Also, the probability of finding the next block reaches a maximum after 90 days in order to prevent very old or very large collections of stakes from dominating the [[Bitcoin#Blockchain|blockchain]].&lt;ref name="Peercoin White Paper" /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buterin|first=Vitalik|authorlink=Vitalik Buterin|title=What Proof of Stake Is And Why It Matters|url=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/what-proof-of-stake-is-and-why-it-matters-1377531463/|publisher=Bitcoin Magazine|accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradbury|first=Danny|title=Third largest cryptocurrency peercoin moves into spotlight with Vault of Satoshi deal|url=http://www.coindesk.com/peercoin-vault-of-satoshi-deal/|publisher=CoinDesk|accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}

This process secures the network and gradually produces new coins over time without consuming significant computational power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Jeffrey|title=The Rise of Bitcoins, Altcoins—Future of Digital Currency|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/400362-the-rise-of-bitcoins-altcoins-future-of-digital-currency/|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=The Epoch Times|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}

=== Delegated Proof-of-Stake ===
Various projects such as EOS, Bitcoin-sCrypt, Steem, Ark and Bitshares are using delegated proof-of-stake, or DPoS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hackernoon.com/explain-delegated-proof-of-stake-like-im-5-888b2a74897d|title=Explain Delegated Proof of Stake Like I’m 5 – Hacker Noon|date=2017-09-28|work=Hacker Noon|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}} The system uses a limited number of nodes to propose and validate blocks to the blockchain. This is meant to keep transaction processing fast, rather than using several hundred or several thousand nodes. EOS uses a limited number of block validators, 21, whose reputation may or may not drop, allowing back-up validators to replace former nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blockgeeks.com/guides/eos-blockchain/|title=What is EOS Blockchain: Beginners Guide - Blockgeeks|work=Blockgeeks|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}

=== Randomized Proof-of-Stake ===
Orbs uses a similar process, dubbed randomized proof-of-stake (or RPoS) but selects an entire committee rather than a single block leader. Each node is selected randomly using a verifiable random beacon to propose the current block of transactions. Then, the block is verified through that committee containing a pre-set number of nodes from within the total network of nodes available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://orbs.com/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos-vs-dpos-vs-rpos/|title=What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)? What is Randomized Proof-of-Stake (RPoS)? - Orbs|work=Orbs|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}

==Advantages==

Incentives differ between the two systems of block generation. Under proof of work, miners may potentially own none of the currency they are mining and thus seek only to maximize their own profits. It is unclear whether this disparity lowers or raises security risks.&lt;ref name=pow-pos-debate&gt;{{cite web|title=Proof of Work, Proof of Stake and the Consensus Debate|url=http://cointelegraph.com/news/113157/proof-of-work-proof-of-stake-and-the-consensus-debate|website=cointelegraph.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}} Under proof of stake, however, those "guarding" the coins always own the coins, although several cryptocurrencies do allow or enforce the lending of staking power to other nodes.

==Criticism==
Some authors&lt;ref name="apoelstra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Distributed Consensus from Proof of Stake is Impossible|url=https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf|author=Andrew Poelstra}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name=buterin-on-stake /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}} argue that proof of stake is not an ideal option for a distributed consensus protocol. One issue that can arise is the "nothing-at-stake" problem, wherein block generators have nothing to lose by voting for multiple blockchain histories, thereby preventing consensus from being achieved. Because unlike in proof-of-work systems, there is little cost to working on several chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard Problems of Cryptocurrencies|url=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have attempted to solve these problems:
*[[Peercoin]] is the first cryptocurrency that applied the concept of PoS.  In its early stages, it used centrally broadcast checkpoints [[Digital signature|signed]] under the developer's [[private key]]. No blockchain reorganization was allowed deeper than the last known checkpoints.

In [[statistics]], the '''Rao–Blackwell theorem''', sometimes referred to as the '''Rao–Blackwell–Kolmogorov theorem''', is a result which characterizes the transformation of an arbitrarily crude [[estimator]] into an estimator that is optimal by the [[mean squared error|mean-squared-error]] criterion or any of a variety of similar criteria.

The Rao–Blackwell theorem states that if ''g''(''X'') is any kind of [[estimator]] of a parameter θ, then the [[conditional expectation]] of ''g''(''X'') given ''T''(''X''), where ''T'' is a [[sufficient statistic]], is typically a better estimator of θ, and is never worse. Sometimes one can very easily construct a very crude estimator ''g''(''X''), and then evaluate that conditional expected value to get an estimator that is in various senses optimal.

The theorem is named after [[Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao]] and [[David Blackwell]].  The process of transforming an estimator using the Rao–Blackwell theorem is sometimes called '''Rao–Blackwellization'''. The transformed [[estimator]] is called the '''Rao–Blackwell estimator'''.&lt;ref name=LS1/&gt;&lt;ref name=LS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=LS3/&gt;

==Definitions==
*An [[estimator]] δ(''X'') is an ''observable'' random variable (i.e. a [[statistic]]) used for estimating some ''unobservable'' quantity. For example, one may be unable to observe the average height of ''all'' male students at the University of X, but one may observe the heights of a random sample of 40 of them.  The average height of those 40—the "sample average"—may be used as an estimator of the unobservable "population average".
*A [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficient statistic]] ''T''(''X'') is a statistic calculated from data ''X'' to estimate some parameter θ for which no other statistic which can be calculated from data X provides any additional information about θ. It is defined as an ''observable'' [[random variable]] such that the [[conditional probability]] distribution of all observable data ''X'' given ''T''(''X'') does not depend on the ''unobservable'' parameter θ, such as the mean or standard deviation of the whole population from which the data ''X'' was taken. In the most frequently cited examples, the "unobservable" quantities are parameters that parametrize a known family of [[probability distribution]]s according to which the data are distributed.
::In other words, a [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficient statistic]] ''T(X)'' for a parameter θ is a [[statistic]] such that the [[conditional probability|conditional distribution]] of the data ''X'', given ''T''(''X''), does not depend on the parameter θ.

*A '''Rao–Blackwell estimator''' δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') of an unobservable quantity θ is the [[Conditional expectation|conditional expected value]] E(δ(''X'') | ''T''(''X'')) of some estimator δ(''X'') given a sufficient statistic ''T''(''X'').  Call δ(''X'') the '''"original estimator"''' and δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') the '''"improved estimator"'''.  It is important that the improved estimator be ''observable'', i.e. that it not depend on θ.  Generally, the conditional expected value of one function of these data given another function of these data ''does'' depend on θ, but the very definition of sufficiency given above entails that this one does not.
*The ''[[mean squared error]]'' of an estimator is the expected value of the square of its deviation from the unobservable quantity being estimated.

==The theorem==

===Mean-squared-error version===
One case of Rao–Blackwell theorem states:

:The mean squared error of the Rao–Blackwell estimator does not exceed that of the original estimator.

In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}((\delta_1(X)-\theta)^2)\leq 
       \operatorname{E}((\delta(X)-\theta)^2).&lt;/math&gt;

The essential tools of the proof besides the definition above are the [[law of total expectation]] and the fact that for any random variable ''Y'', E(''Y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cannot be less than [E(''Y'')]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  That inequality is a case of [[Jensen's inequality]], although it may also be shown to follow instantly from the frequently mentioned fact that

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq \operatorname{Var}(Y) = \operatorname{E}((Y-\operatorname{E}(Y))^2) = 
               \operatorname{E}(Y^2)-(\operatorname{E}(Y))^2.&lt;/math&gt;

More precisely, the mean square error of the Rao-Blackwell estimator has the following decomposition&lt;ref name=LiaoBerg2018&gt;{{cite journal|title= Sharpening Jensen's Inequality | authors = J. G. Liao &amp; A. Berg | date = 22 June 2018 | journal = The American Statistician | doi = 10.1080/00031305.2017.1419145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[(\delta_1(X)-\theta)^2]=\operatorname{E}[(\delta(X)-\theta)^2]-\operatorname{E}[\operatorname{Var}(\delta(X)\mid T(X))]&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\operatorname{Var}(\delta(X)\mid T(X))]\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, the Rao-Blackwell theorem immediately follows.

===Convex loss generalization===
The more general version of the Rao–Blackwell theorem speaks of the "expected loss" or [[risk function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(L(\delta_1(X)))\leq \operatorname{E}(L(\delta(X)))&lt;/math&gt;

where the "loss function" ''L'' may be any [[convex function]].  If the loss function is twice-differentiable, as in the case for mean-squared-error, then we have the sharper inequality&lt;ref name=LiaoBerg2018/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(L(\delta(X)))-\operatorname{E}(L(\delta_1(X)))\ge \frac{1}{2}\operatorname{E}_T\left[\inf_x L''(x)\operatorname{Var}(\delta(X)\mid T)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
The improved estimator is [[bias of an estimator|unbiased]] if and only if the original estimator is unbiased, as may be seen at once by using the [[law of total expectation]].  The theorem holds regardless of whether biased or unbiased estimators are used.

The theorem seems very weak: it says only that the Rao–Blackwell estimator is no worse than the original estimator.  In practice, however, the improvement is often enormous.

==Example==
Phone calls arrive at a switchboard according to a [[Poisson process]] at an average rate of λ per minute.  This rate is not observable, but the numbers ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of phone calls that arrived during ''n'' successive one-minute periods are observed.  It is desired to estimate the probability ''e''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;λ&lt;/sup&gt; that the next one-minute period passes with no phone calls.

An ''extremely'' crude estimator of the desired probability is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_0=\left\{\begin{matrix}1 &amp; \text{if}\ X_1=0, \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise,}\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., it estimates this probability to be 1 if no phone calls arrived in the first minute and zero otherwise.  Despite the apparent limitations of this estimator, the result given by its Rao–Blackwellization is a very good estimator.

The sum

:&lt;math&gt; S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = X_1+\cdots+X_n&lt;/math&gt;

can be readily shown to be a sufficient statistic for λ, i.e., the ''conditional'' distribution of the data ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, depends on λ only through this sum.  Therefore, we find the Rao–Blackwell estimator

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_1=\operatorname{E}(\delta_0\mid S_n=s_n).&lt;/math&gt;

After doing some algebra we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta_1 &amp;= \operatorname{E} \left (\mathbf{1}_{\{X_1=0\}} \Bigg| \sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = s_n \right ) \\
&amp;= P \left (X_{1}=0 \Bigg| \sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = s_n \right ) \\
&amp;= P \left (X_{1}=0, \sum_{i=2}^n X_{i} = s_n \right ) \times P \left (\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = s_n \right )^{-1} \\
&amp;= e^{-\lambda}\frac{\left((n-1)\lambda\right)^{s_n}e^{-(n-1)\lambda}}{s_n!} \times \left (\frac{(n\lambda)^{s_n}e^{-n\lambda}}{s_n!} \right )^{-1} \\
&amp;= \frac{\left((n-1)\lambda\right)^{s_n}e^{-n\lambda}}{s_n!} \times \frac{s_n!}{(n\lambda)^{s_n}e^{-n\lambda}} \\
&amp;= \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{s_n}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the average number of calls arriving during the first ''n'' minutes is ''n''λ, one might not be surprised if this estimator has a fairly high probability (if ''n'' is big) of being close to

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1-{1 \over n}\right)^{n\lambda}\approx e^{-\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

So δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is clearly a very much improved estimator of that last quantity.  In fact, since ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[completeness (statistics)|complete]] and δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is unbiased, δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the unique minimum variance unbiased estimator by the [[Lehmann–Scheffé theorem]].

==Idempotence==
Rao–Blackwellization is an [[idempotent]] operation.  Using it to improve the already improved estimator does not obtain a further improvement, but merely returns as its output the same improved estimator.

==Completeness and Lehmann&amp;ndash;Scheffé minimum variance==
If the conditioning statistic is both complete and sufficient, and the starting estimator is unbiased, then the Rao&amp;ndash;Blackwell estimator is the unique "[[minimum-variance unbiased estimator|best unbiased estimator]]": see [[Lehmann–Scheffé theorem]].

An example of an improvable Rao–Blackwell improvement, when using a minimal sufficient statistic that is '''not complete''', was provided by Galili and Meilijson in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An Example of an Improvable Rao–Blackwell Improvement, Inefficient Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and Unbiased Generalized Bayes Estimator | authors = Tal Galili &amp; Isaac Meilijson | date = 31 Mar 2016 | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683?journalCode=utas20 | pages = 108–113 | doi=10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683| pmc = 4960505 | pmid=27499547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X_1, \ldots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; be a random sample from a scale-uniform distribution &lt;math&gt;X \sim U \left( (1-k) \theta, (1+k) \theta  \right),&lt;/math&gt; with unknown mean &lt;math&gt;E[X]=\theta&lt;/math&gt; and known design parameter &lt;math&gt;k \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. In the search for "best" possible unbiased estimators for &lt;math&gt;\theta,&lt;/math&gt; it is natural to consider &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; as an initial (crude) unbiased estimator for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and then try to improve it. Since &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; is not a function of &lt;math&gt;T = \left( X_{(1)}, X_{(n)}  \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the minimal sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;X_{(1)} = \min( X_i )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{(n)} = \max( X_i )&lt;/math&gt;), it may be improved using the Rao–Blackwell theorem as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{RB}=E_{\theta} \left [X_1|X_{(1)}, X_{(n)} \right ]=\frac{X_{(1)}+X_{(n)}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, the following unbiased estimator can be shown to have lower variance:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{LV} = \frac{1}{2 \left (k^2 \frac{n-1}{n+1}+1\right )} \left[ (1-k){{X}_{(1)}}+(1+k){{X}_{(n)}} \right].&lt;/math&gt;

And in fact, it could be even further improved when using the following estimator:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{BAYES} =\frac{n+1}{n} \left[ 1-\frac{\frac{\left( \frac{{{X}_{(1)}}}{1-k} \right)}{\left( \frac{{{X}_{(n)}}}{1+k} \right)}-1}{{{\left[ \frac{\left( \frac{{{X}_{(1)}}}{1-k} \right)}{\left( \frac{{{X}_{(n)}}}{1+k} \right)} \right]}^{n+1}}-1} \right] \frac{X_{(n)}}{1+k}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Calculus |Differential}}

In [[differential calculus]], '''related rates''' problems involve finding a rate at which a quantity changes by [[Equation|relating]] that quantity to other quantities whose rates of change are known.  The rate of change is usually with respect to [[time]].  Because science and engineering often relate quantities to each other, the methods of related rates have broad applications in these fields.  Differentiation with respect to time or one of the other variables requires application of the [[chain rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Related Rates|url=http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus_online/section06.02.html|publisher=Whitman College|accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; since most problems involve several variables.

Fundamentally, if a function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is defined such that &lt;math&gt;F=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be taken with respect to another variable. (The Variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is frequently used as many Related Rates problems apply to finding changes with respect to time.) We assume &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;x=g(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F=f(g(t))&lt;/math&gt;, so 

&lt;math&gt;F'=f'(g(t)) \cdot g'(t)&lt;/math&gt; 

Written in Leibniz notation, this is:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dt} = \frac{df}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of this is: if it is known how &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; changes with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, then we can determine how &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; changes with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa. We can extend this application of the chain rule with the sum, difference, product and quotient rules of calculus, etc.

e.g. 

If &lt;math&gt;F(x)= G(y)+ H(z)&lt;/math&gt; 

then  &lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dx}\cdot \frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dG}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt}+\frac{dH}{dz} \cdot \frac{dz}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Procedure ==

The most common way to approach related rates problems is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreider|first=Donald|title=Related Rates|url=http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~klbooksite/2.17/217.html|publisher=Dartmouth|accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Identify the known [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], including rates of change and the rate of change that is to be found. (Drawing a picture or representation of the problem can help to keep everything in order)
#Construct an [[equation]] relating the quantities whose rates of change are known to the quantity whose rate of change is to be found.
#[[Derivative|Differentiate]] both sides of the equation with respect to time (or other rate of change).  Often, the  [[chain rule]] is employed at this step.
#Substitute the known rates of change and the known quantities into the equation.
#Solve for the wanted rate of change.

Errors in this procedure are often caused by plugging in the known values for the variables ''before'' (rather than after) finding the derivative with respect to time. Doing so will yield an incorrect result, since if those values are substituted for the variables before differentiation, those variables will become constants; and when the equation is differentiated, zeroes appear in places of all variables for which the values were plugged in.

==Examples==

===Leaning ladder example===
A 10-meter ladder is leaning against the wall of a building, and the base of the ladder is sliding away from the building at a rate of 3 meters per second. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 6 meters from the wall?

The distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, ''x'', and the height of the ladder on the wall, ''y'', represent the sides of a [[right triangle]] with the ladder as the hypotenuse, ''h''. The objective is to find ''dy''/''dt'', the rate of change of ''y'' with respect to time, ''t'', when ''h'', ''x'' and ''dx''/''dt'', the rate of change of ''x'', are known.

Step 1:
:&lt;math&gt;x=6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h=10&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dt}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=?&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Step 2:
From the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=h^2\,&lt;/math&gt;,
describes the relationship between ''x'', ''y'' and ''h'', for a right triangle. Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time, ''t'', yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}(x^2+y^2)=\frac{d}{dt}(h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Step 3:
When solved for the wanted rate of change, ''dy''/''dt'', gives us
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}(x^2)+\frac{d}{dt}(y^2)=\frac{d}{dt}(h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(2x)\frac{dx}{dt}+(2y)\frac{dy}{dt}=(2h)\frac{dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x\frac{dx}{dt}+y\frac{dy}{dt}=h\frac{dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{h\frac{dh}{dt}-x\frac{dx}{dt}}{y}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Step 4 &amp; 5:
Using the variables from step 1 gives us:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{h\frac{dh}{dt}-x\frac{dx}{dt}}{y}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{10\times0-6\times3}{y}=-\frac{18}{y}.&lt;/math&gt;
Solving for y using the Pythagorean Theorem gives:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=h^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;6^2+y^2=10^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y=8&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Plugging in 8 for the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{18}{y}=-\frac{18}{8}=-\frac{9}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

It is generally assumed that negative values represent the downward direction. In doing such, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of {{frac|9|4}} meters per second.

==Physics Examples==

Because one physical quantity often depends on another, which, in turn depends on others, such as time, related rate methods have broad applications in Physics.  This section presents an example of related rates [[kinematics]]  and [[electromagnetic induction]].

===Physics Example I: Relative Kinematics of Two Vehicles===
[[File:Physics intersection.png|400px | right | thumb | One vehicle is headed North and currently located at (0,3); the other vehicle is headed West and currently located at (4,0). The chain rule can be used to find whether they are getting closer or further apart.]]

For example, one can consider the kinematics problem where one vehicle is heading West toward an intersection at 80 miles per hour while another is heading North away from the intersection at 60 miles per hour.  One can ask whether the vehicles are getting closer or further apart and at what rate at the moment when the North bound vehicle is 3 miles North of the intersection and the West bound vehicle is 4 miles East of the intersection.

'''Big idea:''' use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles.

'''Plan:'''
#Choose coordinate system
#Identify variables
#Draw picture
#Big idea: use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles
#Express c in terms of x and y via Pythagorean theorem
#Express dc/dt using chain rule in terms of dx/dt and dy/dt
#Substitute in x, y, dx/dt, dy/dt
#Simplify.

'''Choose coordinate system:'''
Let the y-axis point North and the x-axis point East.

'''Identify variables:'''
Define y(t) to be the distance of the vehicle heading North from the origin and x(t) to be the distance of the vehicle heading West from the origin.

'''Express c in terms of x and y via Pythagorean theorem:'''

&lt;math&gt;
c = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Express dc/dt using chain rule in terms of dx/dt and dy/dt:'''

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dc}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; || width="250pt" |  Apply derivative operator to entire function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\frac{d}{dt}(x^2 + y^2)&lt;/math&gt; || Square root is outside function; Sum of squares is inside function
|-
| &lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\left[\frac{d}{dt}(x^2) + \frac{d}{dt}(y^2) \right]&lt;/math&gt; || Distribute differentiation operator

| &lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\left[ 2x\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt}\right] &lt;/math&gt;  || Apply chain rule to x(t) and y(t)}
|-
| &lt;math&gt;= \frac{x\frac{dx}{dt} + y\frac{dy}{dt}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} &lt;/math&gt;  || Simplify.
|-
|}

'''Substitute in x = 4&amp;nbsp;mi, y = 3&amp;nbsp;mi, dx/dt = -80&amp;nbsp;mi/hr, dy/dt = 60&amp;nbsp;mi/hr and Simplify'''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dc}{dt} &amp; = \frac{4 mi \cdot (-80 mi/hr) + 3 mi \cdot (60) mi/hr}{\sqrt{(4 mi)^2 + (3 mi)^2}}\\
&amp; = \frac{-320 mi^2/hr + 180 mi^2/hr}{5 mi}\\
&amp;= \frac{-140 mi^2/hr}{5 mi}\\
&amp; = -28 mi/hr\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the two vehicles are getting closer together at a rate of 28&amp;nbsp;mi/hr.

===Physics Example II: Electromagnetic induction of conducting loop spinning in magnetic field===
The magnetic flux through a loop of area A whose normal is at an angle θ to a magnetic field of strength B is

&lt;math&gt; \Phi_B = B A \cos(\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

[[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction states that the induced [[electromotive force]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative rate of change of magnetic flux &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B&lt;/math&gt; through a conducting loop.

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = -{{d\Phi_B} \over dt},&lt;/math&gt;

If the loop area A and magnetic field B are held constant, but the loop is rotated so that the angle θ is a known function of time, the rate of change of θ can be related to the rate of change of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B&lt;/math&gt; (and therefore the electromotive force) by taking the time derivative of the flux relation

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} =  B A \sin{\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

If for example, the loop is rotating at a constant angular velocity ω, so that θ=ωt, then

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}= \omega B A \sin{\omega t} &lt;/math&gt;

In [[physics]], '''relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM)''' is any [[Poincaré group|Poincaré covariant]] formulation of [[quantum mechanics]] (QM). This theory is applicable to [[massive particle]]s propagating at all [[velocity|velocities]] up to those comparable to the [[speed of light]]&amp;nbsp;''c'', and can accommodate [[massless particle]]s. The theory has application in [[high energy physics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D.H.

''Relativistic quantum mechanics'' (RQM) is quantum mechanics applied with [[special relativity]], but not [[general relativity]]. Although the earlier formulations, like the [[Schrödinger picture]] and [[Heisenberg picture]] were originally formulated in a non-relativistic background, these pictures of quantum mechanics also apply with special relativity.

The relativistic formulation is more successful than the original quantum mechanics in some contexts, in particular: the prediction of [[antimatter]], [[electron spin]], [[spin magnetic moment]]s of [[elementary particle|elementary]] [[spin-1/2|spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}]] [[fermion]]s, [[fine structure]], and quantum dynamics of [[charged particle]]s in [[electromagnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name="Martin, Shaw, pp 5–6"&gt;{{cite book| author=B. R.

By contrast, in quantum mechanics, terms have to be introduced artificially into the [[Hamiltonian operator]] to achieve agreement with experimental observations.

Nevertheless, RQM is only an approximation to a fully self-consistent relativistic theory of known particle interactions because it does not describe cases where the number of (elementary) particles changes; for example in [[matter creation]] and [[annihilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = A. Messiah| year = 1981| title = Quantum Mechanics|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|volume=2|page=875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR93vUk8d_8C&amp;pg=PA876&amp;dq=lorentz+group+in+relativistic+quantum+mechanics#v=onepage&amp;q=lorentz%20group%20in%20relativistic%20quantum%20mechanics&amp;f=false| isbn =0-7204-0045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By yet another theoretical advance, a more accurate theory that allows for these occurrences and other predictions is ''relativistic [[quantum field theory]]'' in which particles are interpreted as ''field quanta'' (see article for details).

In this article, the equations are written in familiar 3d [[vector calculus]] notation and use hats for [[operator (physics)|operators]] (not necessarily in the literature), and where space and time components can be collected, [[tensor index notation]] is shown also (frequently used in the literature), in addition the [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used. [[SI units]] are used here; [[Gaussian units]] and [[natural units]] are common alternatives. All equations are in the position representation; for the momentum representation the equations have to be [[Fourier transform]]ed – see [[position and momentum space]].

==Combining special relativity and quantum mechanics==
One approach is to modify the [[Schrödinger picture]] to be consistent with special relativity.&lt;ref name="Martin, Shaw, p 3"/&gt;

A [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|postulate of quantum mechanics]] is that the [[time evolution]] of any quantum system is given by the [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi =\hat{H}\psi&lt;/math&gt;

using a suitable [[Hamiltonian operator]] {{math|''Ĥ''}} corresponding to the system. The solution is a [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[wavefunction]] {{math|''ψ''('''r''', ''t'')}}, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[three-dimensional space|3d]] [[position vector]] {{math|'''r'''}} of the particle at time {{math|''t''}}, describing the behavior of the system.

Every particle has a non-negative [[spin quantum number]] {{math|''s''}}. The number {{math|2''s''}} is an integer, odd for [[fermion]]s and even for [[boson]]s. Each {{math|''s''}} has {{math|2''s'' + 1}} ''z''-projection quantum numbers; {{math|''σ''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''s'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, ... , &amp;minus;''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, &amp;minus;''s''}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Other common notations include {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} etc., but this would clutter expressions with unnecessary subscripts. The subscripts {{math|''σ''}} labeling spin values are not to be confused for [[tensor index notation|tensor indices]] nor the [[Pauli matrices]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an additional discrete variable the wavefunction requires; {{math|''ψ''('''r''',&amp;nbsp;''t'',&amp;nbsp;''σ'')}}.

Historically, in the early 1920s [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]], [[Ralph Kronig|Kronig]], [[George Uhlenbeck|Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit|Goudsmit]] were the first to propose the concept of spin. The inclusion of spin in the wavefunction incorporates the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (1925) and the more general [[spin-statistics theorem]] (1939) due to [[Markus Fierz|Fierz]], rederived by Pauli a year later. This is the explanation for a diverse range of [[subatomic particle]] behavior and phenomena: from the [[electronic configuration]]s of atoms, nuclei (and therefore all [[Chemical element|element]]s on the [[periodic table]] and their [[chemistry]]), to the quark configurations and [[colour charge]] (hence the properties of [[baryon]]s and [[meson]]s).

A fundamental prediction of special relativity is the relativistic [[energy–momentum relation]]; for a particle of [[rest mass]] {{math|''m''}}, and in a particular [[frame of reference]] with [[energy]] {{math|''E''}} and 3-[[momentum]] {{math|'''p'''}} with [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude]] in terms of the [[dot product]] {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|'''p'''&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;'''p'''}}}}, it is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dynamics and Relativity|author1=J.R. Forshaw |author2=A.G. Smith |series=Manchester Physics Series|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|pages=258–259|isbn=978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = c^2\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p} + (mc^2)^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are used together with the [[energy operator|energy]] and [[momentum operator|momentum]] [[operator (physics)#Operators in quantum mechanics|operator]]s, which are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{E}=i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\,,\quad \hat{\mathbf{p}} = -i\hbar\nabla\,,&lt;/math&gt;

to construct a [[relativistic wave equation]] (RWE): a [[partial differential equation]] consistent with the energy–momentum relation, and is solved for {{math|''ψ''}} to predict the quantum dynamics of the particle. For space and time to be placed on equal footing, as in relativity, the orders of space and time [[partial derivative]]s should be equal, and ideally as low as possible, so that no initial values of the derivatives need to be specified. This is important for probability interpretations, exemplified below. The lowest possible order of any differential equation is the first (zeroth order derivatives would not form a differential equation).

The [[Heisenberg picture]] is another formulation of QM, in which case the wavefunction {{math|''ψ''}} is ''time-independent'', and the operators {{math|''A''(''t'')}} contain the time dependence, governed by the equation of motion:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}A = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[A,\hat{H}]+\frac{\partial}{\partial t}A\,,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is also true in RQM, provided the Heisenberg operators are modified to be consistent with SR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = W. Greiner| page=70|year = 2000 |edition=3rd|title = Relativistic Quantum Mechanics.

Historically, around 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] show that wave mechanics and [[matrix mechanics]] are equivalent, later furthered by Dirac using [[Transformation theory (quantum mechanics)|transformation theory]].

A more modern approach to RWEs, first introduced during the time RWEs were developing for particles of any spin, is to apply [[representations of the Lorentz group]].

===Space and time===
In [[classical mechanics]] and non-relativistic QM, time is an absolute quantity all observers and particles can always agree on, "ticking away" in the background independent of space. Thus in non-relativistic QM one has for a [[many particle system]] {{math|''ψ''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t'', ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...)}}.

In [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[Coordinate system|spatial coordinates]] and [[coordinate time]] are ''not'' absolute; any two observers moving relative to each other can measure different locations and times of [[Event (relativity)|event]]s. The position and time coordinates combine naturally into a [[four vector#Four-position|four-dimensional spacetime position]] {{math|'''X''' {{=}} (''ct'', '''r''')}} corresponding to events, and the energy and 3-momentum combine naturally into the [[four momentum]] {{math|'''P''' {{=}} (''E''/''c'', '''p''')}} of a dynamic particle, as measured in ''some'' [[frame of reference|reference frame]], change according to a [[Lorentz transformation]] as one measures in a different frame boosted and/or rotated relative the original frame in consideration. The derivative operators, and hence the energy and 3-momentum operators, are also non-invariant and change under Lorentz transformations.

Under a proper [[orthochronous]] [[Lorentz transformation]] {{math|('''r''', ''t'') → Λ('''r''', ''t'')}} in [[Minkowski space]], all one-particle quantum states {{math|''ψ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} locally transform under some [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representation]] {{math|''D''}} of the [[Lorentz group]]:&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys.

where {{math|''D''(Λ)}} is a finite-dimensional representation, in other words a {{math|(2''s'' + 1)×(2''s'' + 1)}} [[square matrix]] . Again, {{math|''ψ''}} is thought of as a [[column vector]] containing components with the {{math|(2''s'' + 1)}} allowed values of {{math|''σ''}}. The [[quantum number]]s {{math|''s''}} and {{math|''σ''}} as well as other labels, continuous or discrete, representing other quantum numbers are suppressed. One value of {{math|''σ''}} may occur more than once depending on the representation.

===Non-relativistic and relativistic Hamiltonians===
{{main|Hamiltonian operator}}

The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical Hamiltonian]] for a particle in a [[potential (physics)|potential]] is the [[kinetic energy]] {{math|'''p'''·'''p'''/2''m''}} plus the [[potential energy]] {{math|''V''('''r''', ''t'')}}, with the corresponding quantum operator in the [[Schrödinger picture]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}}{2m} + V(\mathbf{r},t) &lt;/math&gt;

and substituting this into the above Schrödinger equation gives a non-relativistic QM equation for the wavefunction: the procedure is a straightforward substitution of a simple expression. By contrast this is not as easy in RQM; the energy–momentum equation is quadratic in energy ''and'' momentum leading to difficulties. Naively setting:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = \hat{E} = \sqrt{c^2 \hat{\mathbf{p}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}} + (mc^2)^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi = \sqrt{c^2 \hat{\mathbf{p}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{p}} + (mc^2)^2} \, \psi&lt;/math&gt;

is not helpful for several reasons. The square root of the operators cannot be used as it stands; it would have to be expanded in a [[power series]] before the momentum operator, raised to a power in each term, could act on {{math|''ψ''}}. As a result of the power series, the space and time [[derivative (mathematics)|derivative]]s are ''completely asymmetric'': infinite-order in space derivatives but only first order in the time derivative, which is inelegant and unwieldy. Again, there is the problem of the non-invariance of the energy operator, equated to the square root which is also not invariant. Another problem, less obvious and more severe, is that it can be shown to be [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal]] and can even ''violate [[Causality (physics)|causality]]'': if the particle is initially localized at a point {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} so that {{math|''ψ''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t'' {{=}} 0)}} is finite and zero elsewhere, then at any later time the equation predicts delocalization {{math|''ψ''('''r''', ''t'') ≠ 0}} everywhere, even for {{math|{{!}}'''r'''{{!}} &gt; ''ct''}} which means the particle could arrive at a point before a pulse of light could. This would have to be remedied by the additional constraint {{math|''ψ''({{math|{{!}}'''r'''{{!}} &gt; ''ct''}}, ''t'') {{=}} 0}}.&lt;ref name="Parker 1994"&gt;{{cite book|pages=1193–1194| author=C.B. Parker| title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics| publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd| year=1994| isbn=0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the problem of incorporating spin in the Hamiltonian, which isn't a prediction of the non-relativistic Schrödinger theory. Particles with spin have a corresponding spin magnetic moment quantized in units of {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the [[Bohr magneton]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles|edition=2nd|page=274|author1=R.

where {{math|''g''}} is the (spin) [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] for the particle, and {{math|'''S'''}} the [[spin operator]], so they interact with [[electromagnetic field]]s.

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_B = - \mathbf{B} \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_S &lt;/math&gt;

has to be added to the above non-relativistic Hamiltonian. On the contrary; a relativistic Hamiltonian introduces spin ''automatically'' as a requirement of enforcing the relativistic energy-momentum relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics|author=E.

Relativistic Hamiltonians are analogous to those of non-relativistic QM in the following respect; there are terms including [[rest mass]] and interaction terms with externally applied fields, similar to the classical potential energy term, as well as momentum terms like the classical kinetic energy term. A key difference is that relativistic Hamiltonians contain spin operators in the form of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], in which the [[matrix multiplication]] runs over the spin index {{math|''σ''}}, so in general a relativistic Hamiltonian:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = \hat{H}(\mathbf{r}, t, \hat{\mathbf{p}}, \hat{\mathbf{S}})&lt;/math&gt;

is a function of space, time, and the momentum and spin operators.

===The Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations for free particles===
Substituting the energy and momentum operators directly into the energy–momentum relation may at first sight seem appealing, to obtain the [[Klein–Gordon equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=A. Wachter|page=5|title=Relativistic quantum mechanics

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{E}^2 \psi = c^2\hat{\mathbf{p}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}\psi + (mc^2)^2\psi \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and was discovered by many people because of the straightforward way of obtaining it, notably by Schrödinger in 1925 before he found the non-relativistic equation named after him, and by Klein and Gordon in 1927, who included electromagnetic interactions in the equation.  This ''is'' [[Lorentz covariance|relativistically invariant]], yet this equation alone isn't a sufficient foundation for RQM for a few reasons; one is that negative-energy states are solutions,&lt;ref name="Martin, Shaw, p 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics|author=E. Abers|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2004|page=415|isbn=978-0-13-146100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; another is the density (given below), and this equation as it stands is only applicable to spinless particles. This equation can be factored into the form:&lt;ref name="Penrose 2005, p 620–621"&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage Books|pages=620–621| year=2005 | isbn=978-0-09-944068-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physics of Atoms and Molecules|author=Bransden, BH|author2=Joachain, CJ |year=1983|publisher=Prentice Hall|edition=1st|page=634|isbn=0-582-44401-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\hat{E} - c\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}} - \beta mc^2 \right)\left(\hat{E} + c\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}} + \beta mc^2 \right)\psi=0 \,,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''α''' {{=}} (''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''β''}} are not simply numbers or vectors, but 4 × 4 [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] that are required to [[anticommute]] for {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \beta = - \beta \alpha_i, \quad \alpha_i\alpha_j = - \alpha_j\alpha_i  \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and square to the [[identity matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_i^2 = \beta^2 = I \,, &lt;/math&gt;

so that terms with mixed second-order derivatives cancel while the second-order derivatives purely in space and time remain. The first factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\hat{E} - c\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}} - \beta mc^2 \right)\psi=0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \hat{H} = c\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}} + \beta mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Dirac equation]]. The other factor is also the Dirac equation, but for a particle of [[negative mass]].&lt;ref name="Penrose 2005, p 620–621"/&gt; Each factor is relativistically invariant. The reasoning can be done the other way round: propose the Hamiltonian in the above form, as Dirac did in 1928, then pre-multiply the equation by the other factor of operators {{math|''E'' + ''c'''''α''' · '''p''' + ''βmc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and comparison with the KG equation determines the constraints on {{math|'''α'''}} and {{math|''β''}}. The positive mass equation can continue to be used without loss of continuity. The matrices multiplying {{math|''ψ''}} suggest it isn't a scalar wavefunction as permitted in the KG equation, but must instead be a four-component entity. The Dirac equation still predicts negative energy solutions,&lt;ref name="Martin, Shaw, pp 5–6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.T. Grandy|title=Relativistic quantum mechanics of leptons and fields|volume=|page=54|publisher=Springer|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPCFI4yFMbcC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=magnetic+moments+in+relativistic+quantum+mechanics&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=magnetic%20moments%20in%20relativistic%20quantum%20mechanics&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7923-1049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Dirac postulated that negative energy states are always occupied, because according to the [[Pauli principle]], [[electronic transition]]s from positive to negative energy levels in [[atom]]s would be forbidden. See [[Dirac sea]] for details.

===Densities and currents===
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the square-modulus of the [[wavefunction]] {{math|''ψ''}} gives the [[probability density function]] {{math|''ρ'' {{=}} {{!}}''ψ''{{!}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], circa 1927. In RQM, while {{math|''ψ''('''r''', ''t'')}} is a wavefunction, the probability interpretation is not the same as in non-relativistic QM. Some RWEs do not predict a probability density {{math|''ρ''}} or [[probability current]] {{math|'''j'''}} (really meaning ''probability current density'') because they are ''not'' [[positive definite function]]s of space and time. The [[Dirac equation]] does:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics|author=E. Abers|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2004|page=423|isbn=978-0-13-146100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\psi^\dagger \psi, \quad \mathbf{j} = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 \boldsymbol{\gamma} \psi \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad J^\mu = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 \gamma^\mu \psi &lt;/math&gt;

where the dagger denotes the [[Hermitian adjoint]] (authors usually write {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}} {{=}} ''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''γ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the [[Dirac adjoint]]) and {{math|''J&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the [[Probability current#Definition (relativistic 4-current)|probability four-current]], while the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] does not:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Field Theory|series=Demystified|author=D. McMahon|publisher=McGraw Hill|page=114|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-154382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{i\hbar}{2mc^2}\left(\psi^{*}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} - \psi \frac{\partial \psi^*}{\partial t}\right)\, ,\quad \mathbf{j} = -\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left(\psi^* \nabla \psi - \psi \nabla \psi^*\right)  \quad \rightleftharpoons  \quad J^\mu = \frac{i\hbar}{2m}(\psi^*\partial^\mu\psi - \psi\partial^\mu\psi^*) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∂&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[four gradient]]. Since the initial values of both {{math|''ψ''}} and {{math|∂''ψ''/∂''t''}} may be freely chosen, the density can be negative.

Instead, what appears look at first sight a "probability density" and "probability current" has to be reinterpreted as [[charge density]] and [[current density]] when multiplied by [[electric charge]]. Then, the wavefunction {{math|''ψ''}} is not a wavefunction at all, but reinterpreted as a ''field''.&lt;ref name="Parker 1994"/&gt; The density and current of electric charge always satisfy a [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{J} = 0 \quad \rightleftharpoons  \quad \partial_\mu J^\mu = 0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

as charge is a [[conserved quantity]]. Probability density and current also satisfy a continuity equation because probability is conserved, however this is only possible in the absence of interactions.

==Spin and electromagnetically interacting particles==
Including interactions in RWEs is generally difficult. [[Minimal coupling]] is a simple way to include the electromagnetic interaction. For one charged particle of [[electric charge]] {{math|''q''}} in an electromagnetic field, given by the [[magnetic vector potential]] {{math|'''A'''('''r''', ''t'')}} defined by the magnetic field {{math|'''B''' {{=}} &amp;nabla; &amp;times; '''A'''}}, and [[electric scalar potential]] {{math|''ϕ''('''r''', ''t'')}}, this is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physics of Atoms and Molecules|author=Bransden, BH|author2=Joachain, CJ |year=1983|publisher=Prentice Hall|edition=1st|pages=632–635|isbn=0-582-44401-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{E} \rightarrow \hat{E} - q\phi \,, \quad \hat{\mathbf{p}}\rightarrow \hat{\mathbf{p}} - q \mathbf{A} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \hat{P}_\mu \rightarrow \hat{P}_\mu -q A_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[four-momentum]] that has a corresponding [[4-momentum operator]], and {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} the [[four-potential]]. In the following, the non-relativistic limit refers to the limiting cases:

:&lt;math&gt;E - e\phi \approx mc^2\,,\quad \mathbf{p} \approx m \mathbf{v}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the total energy of the particle is approximately the rest energy for small electric potentials, and the momentum is approximately the classical momentum.

===Spin 0===
In RQM, the KG equation admits the minimal coupling prescription;

:&lt;math&gt;{(\hat{E} - q\phi)}^2 \psi = c^2{(\hat{\mathbf{p}} - q \mathbf{A})}^2\psi + (mc^2)^2\psi \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \left[{(\hat{P}_\mu - q A_\mu)}{(\hat{P}^\mu - q A^\mu)} - {(mc)}^2 \right] \psi = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the charge is zero, the equation reduces trivially to the free KG equation so nonzero charge is assumed below. This is a scalar equation that is invariant under the ''irreducible'' one-dimensional scalar [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|{{math|(0,0)}}]] representation of the Lorentz group. This means that all of its solutions will belong to a direct sum of {{math|(0,0)}} representations. Solutions that do not belong to the irreducible {{math|(0,0)}} representation will have two or more ''independent'' components. Such solutions cannot in general describe particles with nonzero spin since spin components are not independent. Other constraint will have to be imposed for that, e.g. the Dirac equation for spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}, see below. Thus if a system satisfies the KG equation ''only'', it can only be interpreted as a system with zero spin.

The electromagnetic field is treated classically according to [[Maxwell's equations]] and the particle is described by a wavefunction, the solution to the KG equation. The equation is, as it stands, not always very useful, because massive spinless particles, such as the ''π''-mesons, experience the much stronger strong interaction in addition to the electromagnetic interaction. It does, however, correctly describe charged spinless bosons in the absence of other interactions.

The KG equation is applicable to spinless charged [[boson]]s in an external electromagnetic potential.&lt;ref name="Martin, Shaw, p 3"/&gt; As such, the equation cannot be applied to the description of atoms, since the electron is a spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} particle. In the non-relativistic limit the equation reduces to the Schrödinger equation for a spinless charged particle in an electromagnetic field:&lt;ref name="Schuam p 181"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}- q\phi\right) \psi = \frac{1}{2m}{(\hat{\mathbf{p}} - q \mathbf{A})}^2 \psi \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \hat{H} = \frac{1}{2m}{(\hat{\mathbf{p}} - q \mathbf{A})}^2 + q\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

===Spin {{sfrac|1|2}}===
{{main|spin-1/2}}

Non relativistically, spin was ''[[phenomenological model|phenomenologically]]'' introduced in the [[Pauli equation]] by [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] in 1927 for particles in an [[electromagnetic field]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - q \phi  \right) \psi = \left[ \frac{1}{2m}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot(\mathbf{p} - q \mathbf{A}))}^2 \right] \psi \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \hat{H} = \frac{1}{2m}{(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot(\mathbf{p} - q \mathbf{A}))}^2 + q \phi &lt;/math&gt;

by means of the 2&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;2 [[Pauli matrices]], and {{math|''&amp;psi;''}} is not just a scalar wavefunction as in the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, but a two-component [[spinor field]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi=\begin{pmatrix}\psi_{\uparrow} \\ \psi_{\downarrow} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripts ↑ and ↓ refer to the "spin up" ({{math|''σ'' {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) and "spin down" ({{math|''σ'' {{=}} &amp;minus;{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) states.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This spinor notation is not necessarily standard; the literature usually writes &lt;math&gt;\psi=\begin{pmatrix} u^1 \\ u^2 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\psi=\begin{pmatrix} \chi \\ \eta \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; etc., but in the context of spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}, this informal identification is commonly made.&lt;/ref&gt;

In RQM, the Dirac equation can also incorporate minimal coupling, rewritten from above;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} -q\phi \right)\psi = \gamma^0 \left[ c\boldsymbol{\gamma}\cdot{(\hat{\mathbf{p}} - q\mathbf{A})} - mc^2 \right] \psi \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \left[\gamma^\mu (\hat{P}_\mu - q A_\mu) - mc^2 \right]\psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and was the first equation to accurately ''predict'' spin, a consequence of the 4 &amp;times; 4 [[gamma matrices]] {{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''β'', '''γ''' {{=}} (''γ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''β'''''α''' {{=}} (''βα''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''βα''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''βα''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. There is a 4 × 4 [[identity matrix]] pre-multiplying the energy operator (including the potential energy term), conventionally not written for simplicity and clarity (i.e. treated like the number 1). Here {{math|''&amp;psi;''}} is a four-component spinor field, which is conventionally split into two two-component spinors in the form:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Again this notation is not necessarily standard, the more advanced literature usually writes

:&lt;math&gt;\psi=\begin{pmatrix}u \\ v \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u^1 \\ u^2 \\ v^1 \\ v^2 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; etc.,

but here we show informally the correspondence of energy, helicity, and spin states.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi=\begin{pmatrix}\psi_{+} \\ \psi_{-} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\psi_{+\uparrow} \\ \psi_{+\downarrow} \\ \psi_{-\uparrow}  \\ \psi_{-\downarrow} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The 2-spinor {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponds to a particle with 4-momentum {{math|(''E'', '''p''')}} and charge {{math|''q''}} and two spin states ({{math|''σ'' {{=}} ±{{sfrac|1|2}}}}, as before). The other 2-spinor {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponds to a similar particle with the same mass and spin states, but ''negative'' 4-momentum {{math|−(''E'', '''p''')}} and ''negative'' charge {{math|−''q''}}, that is, negative energy states, [[T-symmetry|time-reversed]] momentum, and [[C-symmetry|negated charge]]. This was the first interpretation and prediction of a particle and ''corresponding [[antiparticle]]''. See [[Dirac spinor]] and [[bispinor]] for further description of these spinors. In the non-relativistic limit the Dirac equation reduces to the Pauli equation (see [[Dirac equation#Comparison with the Pauli theory|Dirac equation]] for how). When applied a one-electron atom or ion, setting {{math|'''A''' {{=}} '''0'''}} and {{math|''ϕ''}} to the appropriate electrostatic potential, additional relativistic terms include the [[spin-orbit interaction]], electron [[gyromagnetic ratio]], and [[Darwin term]]. In ordinary QM these terms have to be put in by hand and treated using [[perturbation theory]]. The positive energies do account accurately for the fine structure.

Within RQM, for massless particles the Dirac equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\hat{E}}{c} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{p}} \right) \psi_{+} = 0 \,,\quad \left(\frac{\hat{E}}{c} - \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{p}} \right) \psi_{-} = 0 \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \sigma^\mu \hat{P}_\mu \psi_{+} = 0\,,\quad \sigma_\mu \hat{P}^\mu \psi_{-} = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the first of which is the [[Weyl equation]], a considerable simplification applicable for massless [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="C.B. 1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.B. Parker|year=1994|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw Hill|page=1194|isbn=0-07-051400-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This time there is a 2 × 2 [[identity matrix]] pre-multiplying the energy operator conventionally not written. In RQM it is useful to take this as the zeroth Pauli matrix {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} which couples to the energy operator (time derivative), just as the other three matrices couple to the momentum operator (spatial derivatives).

The Pauli and gamma matrices were introduced here, in theoretical physics, rather than [[pure mathematics]] itself. They have applications to [[quaternion]]s and to the [[SO(2)]] and [[SO(3)]] [[Lie group]]s, because they satisfy the important [[commutator]] [&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;] and [[Commutator#Anticommutator|anticommutator]] [&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;]&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; relations respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\sigma_a, \sigma_b \right] = 2i \varepsilon_{abc} \sigma_c \,, \quad \left[\sigma_a, \sigma_b \right]_{+} = 2\delta_{ab}\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[three-dimensional]] [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. The gamma matrices form [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Clifford algebra]], and have a connection to the components of the flat spacetime [[Minkowski metric]] {{math|''η&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} in the anticommutation relation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\gamma^\alpha,\gamma^\beta\right]_{+} = \gamma^\alpha\gamma^\beta + \gamma^\beta\gamma^\alpha = 2\eta^{\alpha\beta}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

(This can be extended to [[curved space]]time by introducing [[Cartan formalism (physics)|vierbein]]s, but is not the subject of special relativity).

In 1929, the [[Breit equation]] was found to describe two or more electromagnetically interacting massive spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} fermions to first-order relativistic corrections; one of the first attempts to describe such a relativistic quantum [[many-particle system]]. This is, however, still only an approximation, and the Hamiltonian includes numerous long and complicated sums.

===Helicity and chirality===
{{main|Helicity (particle physics)|Chirality (physics)}}
{{see also|spin polarization}}

The [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity operator]] is defined by;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h} = \hat{\mathbf{S}}\cdot \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}}{|\mathbf{p}|} = \hat{\mathbf{S}} \cdot \frac{c\hat{\mathbf{p}}}{\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' is the momentum operator, '''S''' the spin operator for a particle of spin ''s'', ''E'' is the total energy of the particle, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; its rest mass. Helicity indicates the orientations of the spin and translational momentum vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supersymmetry|author=P. Labelle|series=Demystified|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-163641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helicity is frame-dependent because of the 3-momentum in the definition, and is quantized due to spin quantization, which has discrete positive values for parallel alignment, and negative values for antiparallel alignment.

A automatic occurrence in the Dirac equation (and the Weyl equation) is the projection of the spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} operator on the 3-momentum (times ''c''), {{math|'''σ''' · ''c'' '''p'''}}, which is the helicity (for the spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} case) times &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

For massless particles the helicity simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}  = \hat{\mathbf{S}} \cdot \frac{c\hat{\mathbf{p}}}{E} &lt;/math&gt;

===Higher spins===
The Dirac equation can only describe particles of spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}. Beyond the Dirac equation, RWEs have been applied to [[free particle]]s of various spins. In 1936, Dirac extended his equation to all fermions, three years later [[Markus Fierz|Fierz]] and Pauli rederived the same equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = S. Esposito | year = 2011 | title = Searching for an equation: Dirac, Majorana and the others | arxiv = 1110.6878 | doi=10.1016/j.aop.2012.02.016 | volume=327 | journal=Annals of Physics | pages=1617–1644| bibcode=2012AnPhy.327.1617E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]] were found in 1948 using Lorentz group theory, applicable for all free particles with any spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bargmann, V.|author2=Wigner, E.

The wavefunctions are multicomponent [[spinor field]]s, which can be represented as [[column vector]]s of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of space and time:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{\sigma=s}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{\sigma=s - 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \vdots \\ \psi_{\sigma=-s + 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{\sigma=-s}(\mathbf{r},t) \end{bmatrix}\quad\rightleftharpoons\quad {\psi(\mathbf{r},t)}^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix} {\psi_{\sigma=s}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; {\psi_{\sigma=s - 1}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; \cdots &amp; {\psi_{\sigma=-s + 1}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; {\psi_{\sigma=-s}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the expression on the right is the [[Hermitian conjugate]]. For a ''massive'' particle of spin {{math|''s''}}, there are {{math|2''s'' + 1}} components for the particle, and another {{math|2''s'' + 1}} for the corresponding [[antiparticle]] (there are {{math|2''s'' + 1}} possible {{math|''σ''}} values in each case), altogether forming a {{math|2(2''s'' + 1)}}-component spinor field:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{+,\,\sigma=s}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{+,\,\sigma=s - 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \vdots \\ \psi_{+,\,\sigma=-s + 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{+,\,\sigma=-s}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{-,\,\sigma=s}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{-,\,\sigma=s - 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \vdots \\ \psi_{-,\,\sigma=-s + 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{-,\,\sigma=-s}(\mathbf{r},t) \end{bmatrix}\quad\rightleftharpoons\quad {\psi(\mathbf{r},t)}^\dagger\begin{bmatrix} {\psi_{+,\,\sigma=s}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; {\psi_{+,\,\sigma=s - 1}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; \cdots &amp; {\psi_{-,\,\sigma=-s}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

with the + subscript indicating the particle and − subscript for the antiparticle. However, for ''massless'' particles of spin ''s'', there are only ever two-component spinor fields; one is for the particle in one helicity state corresponding to +''s'' and the other for the antiparticle in the opposite helicity state corresponding to &amp;minus;''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{+}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{-}(\mathbf{r},t) \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

According to the relativistic energy-momentum relation, all massless particles travel at the speed of light, so particles traveling at the speed of light are also described by two-component spinors. Historically, [[Élie Cartan]] found the most general form of [[spinor]]s in 1913, prior to the spinors revealed in the RWEs following the year 1927.

For equations describing higher-spin particles, the inclusion of interactions is nowhere near as simple minimal coupling, they lead to incorrect predictions and self-inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. Jaroszewicz |author2=P.S Kurzepa |year=1992|title=Geometry of spacetime propagation of spinning particles|journal=Annals of Physics|doi=10.1016/0003-4916(92)90176-M|bibcode = 1992AnPhy.216..226J|volume=216|pages=226–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; For spin greater than {{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}, the RWE is not fixed by the particle's mass, spin, and electric charge; the electromagnetic moments ([[electric dipole moment]]s and [[magnetic dipole moment]]s) allowed by the [[spin quantum number]] are arbitrary. (Theoretically, [[magnetic charge]] would contribute also). For example, the spin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} case only allows a magnetic dipole, but for spin&amp;nbsp;1 particles magnetic quadrupoles and electric dipoles are also possible.&lt;ref name="C.B. 1994"/&gt; For more on this topic, see [[multipole expansion]] and (for example) Cédric Lorcé (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv

==Velocity operator==
The Schrödinger/Pauli velocity operator can be defined for a massive particle using the classical definition {{math|'''p''' {{=}} ''m'' '''v'''}}, and substituting quantum operators in the usual way:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Strange|title=Relativistic Quantum Mechanics: With Applications in Condensed Matter and Atomic Physics|page=206|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdVrBM2w0OwC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=velocity+operator+in+relativistic+quantum+mechanics#v=onepage&amp;q=velocity%20operator%20in%20relativistic%20quantum%20mechanics&amp;f=false|isbn=0-521-56583-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{1}{m}\hat{\mathbf{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

which has eigenvalues that take ''any'' value. In RQM, the Dirac theory, it is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{i}{\hbar}\left[\hat{H},\hat{\mathbf{r}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

which must have eigenvalues between ±''c''. See [[Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation]] for more theoretical background.

==Relativistic quantum Lagrangians==
The Hamiltonian operators in the Schrödinger picture are one approach to forming the differential equations for {{math|''ψ''}}. An equivalent alternative is to determine a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] (really meaning ''[[Lagrangian density]]''), then generate the differential equation by the [[Classical field theory#Relativistic field theory|field-theoretic Euler–Lagrange equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial ( \partial_\mu \psi )} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \psi} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

For some RWEs, a Lagrangian can be found by inspection. For example, the Dirac Lagrangian is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supersymmetry|author=P. Labelle|series=Demystified|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=14|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-163641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{\psi}(\gamma^\mu P_\mu - mc)\psi&lt;/math&gt;

and Klein–Gordon Lagrangian is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \eta^{\mu \nu} \partial_{\mu}\psi^{*} \partial_{\nu}\psi - m c^2 \psi^{*} \psi\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is not possible for all RWEs; and is one reason the Lorentz group theoretic approach is important and appealing: fundamental invariance and symmetries in space and time can be used to derive RWEs using appropriate group representations. The Lagrangian approach with field interpretation of {{math|''ψ''}} is the subject of QFT rather than RQM: Feynman's [[path integral formulation]] uses invariant Lagrangians rather than Hamiltonian operators, since the latter can become extremely complicated, see (for example) S. Weinberg (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Steven Weinberg|S. Weinberg]] | year = 1995 | title = The Quantum Theory of Fields|volume=1 |publisher= Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-55001-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relativistic quantum angular momentum==
In non-relativistic QM, the [[angular momentum operator]] is formed from the classical [[pseudovector]] definition {{math|'''L''' {{=}} '''r''' × '''p'''}}. In RQM, the position and momentum operators are inserted directly where they appear in the orbital [[relativistic angular momentum]] tensor defined from the four-dimensional position and momentum of the particle, equivalently a [[bivector]] in the [[exterior algebra]] formalism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage Books|pages=437, 566–569| year=2005 | isbn=978-0-09-944068-0}}  '''Note:''' Some authors, including Penrose, use ''Latin'' letters in this definition, even though it is conventional to use Greek indices for vectors and tensors in spacetime.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M^{\alpha\beta} = X^\alpha P^\beta - X^\beta P^\alpha = 2 X^{[\alpha} P^{\beta]} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{X}\wedge\mathbf{P}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which are six components altogether: three are the non-relativistic 3-orbital angular momenta; {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the other three {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;01&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;02&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''M''&lt;sup&gt;03&lt;/sup&gt;}} are boosts of the [[centre of mass]] of the rotating object. An additional relativistic-quantum term has to be added for particles with spin. For a particle of rest mass {{math|''m''}}, the ''total'' angular momentum tensor is:

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\alpha\beta} = 2X^{[\alpha} P^{\beta]} + \frac{1}{m^2}\varepsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} W_\gamma p_\delta \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{X}\wedge\mathbf{P} + \frac{1}{m^2}\star(\mathbf{W}\wedge\mathbf{P})&lt;/math&gt;

where the star denotes the [[Hodge dual]], and

:&lt;math&gt;W_\alpha =\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta}M^{\beta \gamma}p^\delta \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{W} = \star(\mathbf{M}\wedge\mathbf{P})&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Field Theory|author=L.H. Ryder|publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=2nd|isbn=0-521-47814-6|year=1996|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnuW_kVJ500C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=pauli-lubanski+pseudovector#v=onepage&amp;q=pauli-lubanski%20pseudovector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more on relativistic spin, see (for example) S.M.

===Thomas precession and spin-orbit interactions===
In 1926 the [[Thomas precession]] is discovered: relativistic corrections to the spin of elementary particles with application in the [[spin–orbit interaction]] of atoms and rotation of macroscopic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Charles W. Misner|C.W. Misner]], [[Kip S. Thorne|K.S. Thorne]], [[John A. Wheeler|J.A. Wheeler]]|title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]|page=1146|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=I. Ciufolini |author2=R.R.A. Matzner |title=General relativity and John Archibald Wheeler|
page=329|publisher=Springer|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0pSfo8vrtsC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;lpg=PA329&amp;dq=thomas+precession+relativistic+quantum+mechanics#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20precession%20relativistic%20quantum%20mechanics&amp;f=false|isbn=90-481-3735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 Wigner derived the Thomas precession.

In [[classical electromagnetism and special relativity#The E and B fields|classical electromagnetism and special relativity]], an electron moving with a velocity {{math|'''v'''}} through an electric field {{math|'''E'''}} but not a magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}}, will in its own frame of reference experience a [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz-transformed]] magnetic field {{math|'''B&amp;prime;'''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}' = \frac{\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{v}}{c^2\sqrt{1- \left(v/c\right)^2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the non-relativistic limit {{math|''v'' &lt;&lt; ''c''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}' = \frac{\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{v}}{c^2} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so the non-relativistic spin interaction Hamiltonian becomes:&lt;ref name="Kroemer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=H. Kroemer|year=2003|title=The Thomas precession factor in spin–orbit interaction |doi=10.1119/1.1615526|url=http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/faculty/Kroemer/pubs/13_04Thomas.pdf|arxiv = physics/0310016 |bibcode = 2004AmJPh..72...51K|volume=72|journal=American Journal of Physics|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = - \mathbf{B}'\cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_S = -\left(\mathbf{B} + \frac{\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{v}}{c^2} \right) \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_S \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the first term is already the non-relativistic magnetic moment interaction, and the second term the relativistic correction of order {{math|(''v/c'')²}}, but this disagrees with experimental atomic spectra by a factor of {{frac|1|2}}. It was pointed out by L.&amp;nbsp;Thomas that there is a second relativistic effect: An electric field component perpendicular to the electron velocity causes an additional acceleration of the electron perpendicular to its instantaneous velocity, so the electron moves in a curved path. The electron moves in a [[rotating frame of reference]], and this additional precession of the electron is called the ''Thomas precession''. It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jackson, J. D.| authorlink=John David Jackson (physicist)|page=548|year=1999|title=Classical Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-30932-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the net result of this effect is that the spin–orbit interaction is reduced by half, as if the magnetic field experienced by the electron has only one-half the value, and the relativistic correction in the Hamiltonian is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = - \mathbf{B}'\cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_S = -\left(\mathbf{B} + \frac{\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{v}}{2c^2} \right) \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_S \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of RQM, the factor of {{frac|1|2}} is predicted by the Dirac equation.&lt;ref name="Kroemer"/&gt;

==History==
The events which led to and established RQM, and the continuation beyond into [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), are summarized below [see, for example, R. Resnick and R. Eisberg (1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles|edition=2nd|pages=57, 114–116, 125–126, 272|author1=R. Resnick |author2=R. Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1985|isbn=978-0-471-87373-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Atkins|P.W Atkins]] (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quanta: A handbook of concepts|author=[[Peter Atkins|P.W. Atkins]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=168–169, 176, 263, 228|year=1974|isbn=0-19-855493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]. More than half a century of experimental and theoretical research from the 1890s through to the 1950s in the new and mysterious quantum theory as it was up and coming revealed that a number of phenomena cannot be explained by QM alone. SR, found at the turn of the 20th century, was found to be a ''necessary'' component, leading to unification: RQM. Theoretical predictions and experiments mainly focused on the newly found [[atomic physics]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[particle physics]]; by considering [[spectroscopy]], [[diffraction]] and [[scattering]] of particles, and the electrons and nuclei within atoms and molecules. Numerous results are attributed to the effects of spin.

===Relativistic description of particles in quantum phenomena===
[[Einstein]] in 1905 explained of the [[photoelectric effect]]; a particle description of light as [[photons]]. In 1916, [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] explains [[fine structure]]; the splitting of the [[spectral line]]s of [[atoms]] due to first order relativistic corrections. The [[Compton effect]] of 1923 provided more evidence that special relativity does apply; in this case to a particle description of photon–electron scattering. [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie]] extends [[wave–particle duality]] to [[matter]]: the [[de Broglie relations]], which are consistent with special relativity and quantum mechanics. By 1927, [[Clinton Davisson|Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer|Germer]] and separately [[George Paget Thomson|G. Thomson]] successfully diffract electrons, providing experimental evidence of wave-particle duality.

===Experiments===
*1897 [[J. J. Thomson]] discovers the [[electron]] and measures its [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. Discovery of the [[Zeeman effect]]: the splitting a [[spectral line]] into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field.
*1908 [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] measures the charge on the electron and finds experimental evidence of its quantization, in the [[oil drop experiment]].
*1911 [[Alpha particle]] scattering in the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]], led by [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]], showed that atoms possess an internal structure: the [[atomic nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.S. Krane|year=1988|title=Introductory Nuclear Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=396–405|isbn=978-0-471-80553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1913 The [[Stark effect]] is discovered: splitting of spectral lines due to a static [[electric field]] (compare with the Zeeman effect). 
*1922 [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]]: experimental evidence of spin and its quantization.
*1924 [[Edmund Clifton Stoner|Stoner]] studies splitting of [[energy level]]s in [[magnetic field]]s.
*1932 Experimental discovery of the [[neutron]] by [[James Chadwick|Chadwick]], and [[positron]]s by [[Carl David Anderson|Anderson]], confirming the theoretical prediction of positrons.
*1958 Discovery of the [[Mössbauer effect]]: resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption of [[gamma radiation]] by atomic nuclei bound in a solid, useful for accurate measurements of [[gravitational redshift]] and [[time dilation]], and in the analysis of nuclear electromagnetic moments in [[hyperfine interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.S. Krane|year=1988|title=Introductory Nuclear Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=361–370|isbn=978-0-471-80553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum non-locality and relativistic locality===
In 1935; Einstein, [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?|author1=A. Einstein |author2=B. Podolsky |author3=N. Rosen |year=1935|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=47|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |pages=777–780}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning [[quantum entanglement]] of particles, questioning [[quantum nonlocality]] and the apparent violation of causality upheld in SR: particles can appear to interact instantaneously at arbitrary distances. This was a misconception since information is not and cannot be transferred in the entangled states; rather the information transmission is in the process of measurement by two observers (one observer has to send a signal to the other, which cannot exceed ''c''). QM does ''not'' violate SR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics|author=E.

The [[electromagnetic field tensor|EM field tensor]] and [[Electromagnetic four-potential|EM 4-potential]] formulations are both applicable in SR, but in QM the potentials enter the Hamiltonian (see above) and influence the motion of charged particles even in regions where the fields are zero. In 1964, [[Bell's theorem]] was published in a paper on the EPR paradox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===The Lamb shift===
{{main|Lamb shift}}

In 1947 the Lamb shift was discovered: a small difference in the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; levels of hydrogen, due to the interaction between the electron and vacuum. [[Willis Lamb|Lamb]] and [[Robert Retherford|Retherford]] experimentally measure stimulated radio-frequency transitions the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogen levels by [[microwave]] radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom by a Microwave Method|first=Willis E.|last=Lamb|author2=Retherford, Robert C. |authorlink=Willis Lamb|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=72|issue=3|pages=241–243|year=1947|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.72.241|bibcode = 1947PhRv...72..241L }}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation of the Lamb shift is presented by [[Hans Bethe|Bethe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8456">In [[graph theory]], '''Turán's theorem''' is a result on the number of edges in a [[complete graph|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt;]]-[[Glossary_of_graph_theory#Subgraphs|free]] [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].

An {{mvar|n}}-[[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] graph that does not contain any {{math|(''r'' + 1)}}-vertex [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] may be formed by partitioning the set of vertices into {{mvar|r}} parts of equal or nearly equal size, and connecting two vertices by an edge whenever they belong to two different parts. We call the resulting graph the [[Turán graph]] {{math|''T''(''n'', ''r'')}}. Turán's theorem states that the Turán graph has the largest number of edges among all {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}}-free {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs.

[[Turán graph]]s were first described and studied by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]] [[Pál Turán]] in 1941, though a special case of the theorem was stated earlier by Mantel in 1907.

==Formal statement==
:'''Turán's Theorem.''' Let {{mvar|G}} be any graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices, such that {{mvar|G}} is ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt; -free. Then the number of edges in {{mvar|G}} is at most
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{r-1}{r}\cdot\frac{n^2}{2} = \left( 1-\frac{1}{r} \right) \cdot\frac{n^2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

An equivalent formulation is the following:

:'''Turán's Theorem (Second Formulation).''' Among the {{mvar|n}}-vertex simple graphs with no {{math|(''r'' + 1)}}-cliques, {{math|''T''(''n'', ''r'')}} has the maximum number of edges.

==Proof==

Let {{mvar|G}} be an {{mvar|n}}-vertex simple graph with no {{math|(''r'' + 1)}}-clique and with the maximum number of edges.

:'''Overview:''' The proof consists of two claims about {{mvar|G}}, which we outline, before proving. The first claim is that {{mvar|G}} must be a complete r-partite graph (although it is stated more technically below). In other words, we can partition the vertex set into {{mvar|r}} subsets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2,\ldots,S_r&lt;/math&gt; such that if two vertices are in different sets, &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt;, then they have an edge between them, but if they are in the same set, then they have no edge between them.  The second claim is that the sizes of these sets &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; differ from each other by at most 1.  For example, if we want the graph on 23 vertices with the most edges that does not contain a triangle, then we partition the vertices into sets &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;|S_1|=12&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|S_2|=11&lt;/math&gt;. We add all the edges between the two sets, so the graph will have 11*12 = 132 edges. This matches with the theorem, which says that {{mvar|G}} will have at most &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{23^2}{2} = \frac{23^2}4 = 132.25&lt;/math&gt; edges.

:'''Claim 1:''' Graph {{mvar|G}} does not contain any three vertices {{mvar|u, v, w}} such that {{mvar|G}} contains edge {{mvar|uv}}, but contains neither edge {{mvar|uw}} nor {{mvar|vw}}. (This claim is equivalent to the relation x~y iff x not connected to y being an equivalence relation. ~ is always reflexive and symmetric, but only in special cases is it transitive. ~ is not transitive precisely when we have {{mvar|u, v, w}} with {{mvar|u ~ w}} and {{mvar|w ~ v}} without {{mvar|u ~ v}}.)

Assume the claim is false. Construct a new {{mvar|n}}-vertex simple graph {{mvar|G′}} that contains no {{math|(''r'' + 1)}}-clique but has more edges than {{mvar|G}}, as follows:

Case 1: &lt;math&gt;d(w) &lt; d(u)\text{ or }d(w) &lt; d(v).&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that &lt;math&gt;d(w) &lt; d(u)&lt;/math&gt;. Delete vertex {{mvar|w}} and create a copy of vertex {{mvar|u}} (with all of the same neighbors as {{mvar|u}}); call it {{mvar|u′}}. Any clique in the new graph contains at most one vertex among &lt;math&gt;\{u,u'\}&lt;/math&gt;. So this new graph does not contain any {{math|(''r'' + 1)}}-clique.  However, it contains more edges: 

:&lt;math&gt;|E(G')| = |E(G)| - d(w) + d(u) &gt; |E(G)|.&lt;/math&gt;

Case 2: &lt;math&gt;d(w)\geq d(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(w)\geq d(v)&lt;/math&gt;

Delete vertices {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} and create two new copies of vertex {{mvar|w}}. Again, the new graph does not contain any {{math|(''r'' + 1)}}-clique.  However it contains more edges: 

:&lt;math&gt;|E(G')| = |E(G)|-(d(u) + d(v) - 1) + 2d(w) \geq |E(G)| + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This proves Claim 1.

The claim proves that one can partition the vertices of {{mvar|G}} into [[equivalence classes]] based on their non-neighbors; i.e. two vertices are in the same equivalence class if they are nonadjacent. This implies that {{mvar|G}} is a [[complete multipartite graph]] (where the parts are the equivalence classes).

:'''Claim 2:'''  The number of edges in a complete {{mvar|k}}-partite graph is maximized when the size of the parts differs by at most one.

If {{mvar|G}} is a complete {{mvar|k}}-partite graph with parts ''A'' and ''B'' and &lt;math&gt;|A| &gt; |B|+1&lt;/math&gt;, then we can increase the number of edges in {{mvar|G}} by moving a vertex from part ''A'' to part {{mvar|B}}. By moving a vertex from part ''A'' to part ''B'',  the graph loses &lt;math&gt;|B|&lt;/math&gt; edges, but gains &lt;math&gt;|A|-1&lt;/math&gt; edges. Thus, it gains at least &lt;math&gt;|A|-1-|B|\geq 1&lt;/math&gt; edge. This proves Claim 2.

This proof shows that the Turan graph has the maximum number of edges. Additionally, the proof shows that the Turan graph is the ''only'' graph that has the maximum number of edges.

==Mantel's theorem==
As a special case of Turán's theorem, for ''r'' = 2, one obtains:

:'''Mantel's Theorem.''' The maximum number of edges in an {{mvar|n}}-vertex [[triangle-free graph]] is &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor.&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Mantel|1907}}

In other words, one must delete nearly half of the edges in {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} to obtain a triangle-free graph.

A strengthened form of Mantel's theorem states that any hamiltonian graph with at least ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4 edges must either be the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''/2,''n''/2&lt;/sub&gt; or it must be [[pancyclic graph|pancyclic]]: not only does it contain a triangle, it must also contain cycles of all other possible lengths up to the number of vertices in the graph {{harv|Bondy|1971}}.

Another strengthening of Mantel's theorem states that the edges of every {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph may be covered by at most &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; [[clique (graph theory)|cliques]] which are either edges or triangles. As a corollary, the [[Intersection number (graph theory)|intersection number]] is at most &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Erdős|Goodman|Pósa|1966}}.

Let ''F'' be a family of distinct analytic functions on a given [[Domain of a function|domain]] with the property that, for each ''x'' in the domain, the functions in ''F'' map ''x'' to a [[countable set]] of values. In his doctoral dissertation, Wetzel asked whether this assumption implies that ''F'' is necessarily itself countable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[mathematical physics]], the''' Wu–Sprung potential''', named after Hua Wu and Donald Sprung, is a [[Potential|potential function]] in one dimension inside a [[Hamiltonian mechanics#Mathematical formalism|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt; H=p^2 + f(x) &lt;/math&gt; with the potential defined by solving a non-linear [[integral equation]] defined by the [[Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization conditions]] involving the spectral staircase, the energies &lt;math&gt; E_n &lt;/math&gt; and the potential &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt; \oint p \, dq =2 \pi n(E)= 4\int_0^a dx \sqrt{E_n - f(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

here a is a classical [[Stationary point|turning point]] so &lt;math&gt; E=f(a)=f(-a) &lt;/math&gt;, the quantum energies of the model are the roots of the [[Riemann Xi function]] &lt;math&gt; \xi( \frac{1}{2}+ i \sqrt{E_n})=0 &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; f(x)=f(-x) &lt;/math&gt;. In general, although Wu and Sprung considered only the smooth part, the potential is defined implicitly by &lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(x)= \sqrt \pi \frac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}N(x) &lt;/math&gt;; with ''N''(''x'') being the [[eigenvalue]] staircase &lt;math&gt; N(x)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty H(x-E_{n}) &lt;/math&gt; and ''H''(''x'') is the Heaviside [[step function]].

For the case of the [[Riemann hypothesis|Riemann zeros]] Wu and Sprung and others have shown that the potential can be written implicitly in terms of the [[Gamma function]] and zeroth-order [[Bessel function]].

: &lt;math&gt; f^{-1} (x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{4x+1} } +\frac{1}{4\pi } \int\nolimits_{-\sqrt{x} }^{\sqrt{x}}\frac{dr}{\sqrt{x-r^2} } \left( \frac{\Gamma '}{\Gamma } \left( \frac{1}{4} +\frac{ir}{2} \right) -\ln \pi \right)  -\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda (n)}{2\sqrt{n} } J_0 \left( \sqrt{x} \ln n\right)  &lt;/math&gt;

and that the density of states of this Hamiltonian is just the Delsarte's formula for the [[Riemann zeta function]] and defined semiclassically as &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt \pi} \frac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}f^{-1}(x)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\delta (x-E_{n}) &lt;/math&gt;

\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty }\delta \left( x-\gamma _{n} \right) + \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty }\delta \left( x+\gamma _{n} \right)  =\frac{1}{2\pi } \frac{\zeta }{\zeta } \left( \frac{1}{2} +ix\right) +\frac{1}{2\pi } \frac{\zeta '}{\zeta } \left( \frac{1}{2} -ix\right) -\frac{\ln \pi }{2\pi }  \\[10pt]

here they have taken the derivative of the Euler product on the critical line &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}+is &lt;/math&gt;; also they use the Dirichlet generating function &lt;math&gt; \frac{\zeta ' (s)}{\zeta(s)}= -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Lambda (n) e^{-slnn} &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \Lambda (n) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mangoldt function]].

The main idea by Wu and Sprung and others is to interpret the density of states as the distributional [[Delsarte's formula]] and then use the WKB method to evaluate the imaginary part of the zeros by using [[quantum mechanics]].

Wu and Sprung also showed that the zeta-regularized functional determinant is the Riemann Xi-function &lt;math&gt; \frac{ \xi(s)}{\xi(0)}= \frac{\det(H-s(1-s)+\frac{1}{4})}{\det(H+\frac{1}{4})} &lt;/math&gt;

The main idea inside this problem is to recover the potential from spectral data as in some [[inverse spectral problems]] in this case the spectral data is the Eigenvalue staircase, which is a quantum property of the system, the inverse of the potential then, satisfies an [[Abel integral equation]] (fractional calculus) which can be immediately solved to obtain the potential.

== Asymptotics==

For big ''x'' if we take only the smooth part of the eigenvalue staircase &lt;math&gt; N(E)\sim \frac{\sqrt{E} }{2\pi } \log \left( \frac{\sqrt{E} }{2\pi e} \right) &lt;/math&gt;, then the potential as &lt;math&gt; |x| \to \infty &lt;/math&gt; is positive and it is given by the asymptotic expression &lt;math&gt; f(-x)=f(x)\sim 4\pi^2 e^2 \left( \frac{2\epsilon \sqrt{\pi } x+B}{A(\epsilon )} \right) ^{\frac{2}{\epsilon } }  &lt;/math&gt; with  &lt;math&gt; A(\epsilon )=\frac{\Gamma \left( \frac{3+\epsilon }{2} \right) }{\Gamma \left( 1+\frac{\epsilon }{2} \right) }  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B= A(0) &lt;/math&gt; in the limit &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This potential is approximately a [[Morse Potential]] with &lt;math&gt; 16\pi^{2} e^{8|x|} &lt;/math&gt;

The asymptotic of the energies depend on the quantum number ''n'' as &lt;math&gt; E_n = \frac{4\pi^2 n^2}{W^2(ne^{-1})} &lt;/math&gt; here ''W'' is the [[Lambert function]]
